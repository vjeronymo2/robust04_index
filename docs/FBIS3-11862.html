			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" Commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] Elections will be held in Washington tomorrow, 27  March, to choose a new OAS secretary general to replace Brazil's  Joao Baena Soares, undoubtedly one of the most outstanding  secretaries general of the OAS, an organization which has lost  much of its prestige.    The candidates are current Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria,  who will conclude his presidential term by the middle of the  year, and Bernd Niehaus, foreign minister of the outgoing Costa  Rican Government.    Over the past few decades, the OAS has stood on the  sidelines  of the main Latin American and Caribbean problems. It has been  used as an instrument of the successive U.S. Administrations  against Cuba, and after a brief period when it seemed to have  regained the path of respect for self-determination and for the  legitimate governments of each nation, it yielded again to U.S.  pressure and aligned itself with the one-sided idea of presuming  the traditional representative democracy to be the sole legal  system.    However, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares in public  remarks has reaffirmed that Cuba should not be absent from this  organization.    The elections that will be held tomorrow have prompted the  emergence of contradictions within the organization. Costa Rica,  which has maintained a policy too tied to Washington in the  recent past, has had some disputes with the United States over  the issue of expropriations and over the seizure of a U.S.  fishing boat within Costa Rican jurisdictional waters. Now it is  directly accusing Washington of pressuring countries which have  promised to support Niehaus.    Niehaus himself had said that it is a battle of a group of  small countries against the large and strong countries. He  recalled -- quoting his words -- that if we are to say that the  OAS's task is to defend democracy, how can it be that its  secretary general is elected in an antidemocratic manner,  disregarding the free will of the majority, using the mechanism  of pressure?    U.S. pressure was precisely what led the OAS to a total loss  of credibility. Absent from the main conflicts on the continent,  because of U.S. pressure, it is no surprise to anyone that the  OAS today is engulfed in this type of difficulty when it is  choosing a new secretary general, giving heed to denunciations  made by Niehaus, who had also supported the U.S. policy of  exclusion and alignment.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Broker Barred: The Securities and Exchange Commission has barred a Cincinnati  stockbroker from the securities business but said he could be reinstated if he  gets a clean bill of health from a psychiatrist. The broker, P. David  Herrlinger, caused an uproar on Wall Street in 1987 when he called Dow Jones  News Service and announced a bogus $6.8-billion offer to buy Minneapolis-based  Dayton Hudson Corp., one of the nation's biggest retailers. Speculators  responding to the Dow Jones report of the purported $70-a-share bid sent the  price of Dayton Hudson stock soaring by as much as $9 a share in heavy trading.  The price later tumbled after Herrlinger's attorney reported the offer was a  hoax.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH COUNCIL OKS RESIDENTIAL PROJECT ON FORMER WETLANDS SITE  </P> <P> The Seal Beach City Council, in a rare special session Saturday, approved a  long-debated 355-home development project on the old Hellman Ranch site, a  former wetlands area.  </P> <P> The special session was called, in part, so that a decision could be made in  time for the California Coastal Commission staff to review it at a meeting  later this week.  </P> <P> The Mola Development Co., which agreed during negotiations on the project to  restore and enlarge the surrounding wetlands, build an 11-acre public park and  give the city $1 million, wants to have its plans ready for approval by the  state commission at its Nov. 13 meeting.  </P> <P> The housing project, which is north of Pacific Coast Highway and just west of  Seal Beach Boulevard, has created controversy since it was first proposed more  than three years ago. But only a handful of people showed up to witness the  final 3-0 council vote. And only one resident, whose home is near the project,  complained.  </P> <P> Carl Sanfilippo, who has sought refinements of the plan at many previous  council meetings, asked the council members what their rush was. He urged them  to wait until a regular meeting of the council next week.  </P> <P> Mayor Victor S. Grgas explained that the Coastal Commission was meeting in the  Southland in November, in Playa del Rey, and that would give Seal Beach  residents who oppose the development a chance to attend the hearing. The  commission staff, meeting this week, reviews matters before they go before the  full commission.  </P> <P> But also, the five members of the council have had a difficult time with a  quorum recently because of vacation plans and business obligations.  </P> <P> "This was one of the rare times when we could get three of us together to vote  on this," Councilwoman Joyce Risner said.  </P> <P> Risner and Councilman Joe Hunt approved the project. Council members Frank  Laszlo, the only opponent of the development, and Edna Wilson could not attend  the meeting. Laszlo is opposed because the new development would be a gated  community, and many public officeholders have complained that the city has so  many gated areas that it is difficult to reach the voters.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach-based development company originally had proposed a 770-unit  project for the 149-acre site. But that plan, which included more than 600  condominium units, was strongly opposed by residents and was voted down by the  Coastal Commission last year.  </P> <P> "We have not rushed this; we've been at this for 3 1/2 years. We've taken our  sweet time to get to this point," the mayor told the small audience. "We've  negotiated a deal we think is fair to the developer and to the city."  </P> <P> Councilman Hunt offered another reason for voting as soon as possible: the city  stands to make about $50,000 for its redevelopment agency from property taxes  raised from the new single-family homes.  </P> <P> "The faster we get going, the sooner that money is going to start rolling in,"  Hunt said.  </P> <P> The city council negotiated more than 100 points with the developer. Some  include:  </P> <P> * The city no longer will have to lease the Gum Grove Park, the linear  wilderness area that is adjacent to the development. The developers will give  it to the city. Also, the 11-acre park to be built by the developer will be  outside the gated area, open to the public.  </P> <P> * Those seeking municipal office will have a right to enter the gated  community. However, in a compromise, the developers retained the right to keep  them out if a majority of the homeowners don't want them.  </P> <P> * Mola will build a road connecting the development to Seal Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> * Mola promises to restore 26 acres of degraded wetlands on the property and  expand them to 36 acres. Mola also promised to return tidal flow to the  wetlands and replant native flora.  </P> <P> * The development is contingent on an agreement between the executors of the  Hellman Ranch and city officials that the city buy five acres for city use.  </P> <P> "I can tell you today that consummation of the five-acre deal is imminent,"  Grgas said.  </P> <P> Grgas also remarked to the few opponents at the meeting that the Coastal  Commission may order further restrictions on Mola that might appease some of  the residents in the area.  </P> <P> Risner said after the meeting that she was still less than happy with the plan.  </P> <P> "But politics is the art of compromise," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy and Finance Minister Edmond </F> Alphandery by Marie-Laure Cittanova, Francoise Crouigneau, and  Jean de Belot; place and date not given]    [Text] While the government has just successfully carried  out the biggest privatization ever in France with Elf [oil  company], Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery welcomes the  success of selling shares to the public. Especially because the  privatizations make it possible, he thinks, to mobilize the  means of combating unemployment, which demonstrates the  coherence between the government's financial policy and social  policy. In this interview to LES ECHOS, he states that the  privatizations are not inconsistent with the incentives to  consumption recently decided by the government: There is, the  economy minister explains, a reserve of liquid savings  accumulated in the short-term SICAV [open-end investment  companies], which can either be invested in the long term,  especially in shares in privatized companies, or be directed  toward consumption.    At all events, the minister thinks that there is no reason  at  present to change his diagnosis of growth for 1994, in view of a  series of reports showing that the climate is changing.  Finally, he explained his thinking on the two plans which the  economy ministry is due to implement in the spring: the reform  of the Deposit and Consignment Bank, the unity of which he  wishes to maintain, and the creation of pension funds.    [LES ECHOS] The government has recently reported favorable  economic indicators. They still seem firm. Do you still think  that growth will reach, or even exceed, 1.4 percent this year?    [Alphandery] We have no reason to change our diagnosis for  1994. In addition, 1.4 percent or even 1.5 percent growth is  not a high figure. I understand that, in the present climate,  in which we are experiencing high unemployment, the signs of  recovery give rise to a degree of skepticism. The same thing  has been seen in the United States: The transition involves ups  and downs.    However, since the beginning of the year, we have seen a  series of reports which all go in the same direction. The  climate is changing. In the enterprises, the prospects are  improving, and this is clear in the sector of intermediate  goods. Salaried work fell less in the second quarter, the drop  was limited to 0.5 percent. With regard to household demand,  consumption is still irregular, which justifies the measures  taken to help the automobile industry. With regard to housing,  demand is finally recovering.    [LES ECHOS] However, is there not a risk of seeing Germany,  our main client, emerging more slowly from the recession than  expected?    [Alphandery] Three things can be observed abroad.    In the United States, the small increase in the minimum  lending rate was decided for internal purposes and only  demonstrates one thing: The economy is working well and the  only risk is that of overheating. In Japan, the new plan for  recovery through lowering taxes is fairly important and should  produce results. The recovery in Britain is being confirmed.  In all, the international environment will be more buoyant in  1994. The development in Germany is less predictable, although  many signs suggest that the climate is improving. However, our  scenario is cautious because we predict growth of only 0.5  percent for western Germany this year.    [LES ECHOS] But is it not just exports which will lead  French  growth in 1994?    [Alphandery] The foreign order books are doing better and  better. There is no doubt that, in our 1994 forecasts, exports  are at the heart of the recovery. But the second buoyant  element is investment by enterprises. Investments fell so much  in 1993 that their stabilization at the present level in 1994  will contribute to speeding up growth.    [LES ECHOS] Will the fall in investment over the past three  years not mean that French industry will be lagging behind?    [Alphandery] This is a possibility which cannot be ruled  out.  We have lost a good deal of ground. This reflects the  unsuitability of the economic policies pursued since the early  eighties. If the level of unemployment in France is so high, it  is because, structurally, our level of investment and our level  of savings are too low. Our production sector is not strong  enough given the growing burdens it bears.    [LES ECHOS] Is there not a contradiction between the  inadequate savings which you deplore and the measures to revive  consumption which the government has just taken?    [Alphandery] We need long-term savings to fund the  investment  necessary for a lasting economic development, as we need the  situation to be supported by consumption. These two  requirements are not inconsistent. Thus, the government, by  various measures, is seeking the reduction of the treasury SICAV  (around 600 billion francs [Fr] held by households). These  savings, which only partly deserve that name, can be transformed  very largely into long-term savings (PEA [shareholding savings  plan], life insurance, property...) and into greater  consumption. I am already observing appreciable results because  the withdrawals of investments at the end of the year were large  and effectively benefited shares and bonds, and helped support  the consumption of households.    [LES ECHOS] How do you think short-term rates will develop  in  the coming months?    [Alphandery] For 10 months we have observed an overall  reduction in the interest rate curve which was particularly  large with regard to short-term rates. With regard to the  future, I think that they could be below the long-term rates in  1994.    [LES ECHOS] Assuming there is no exchange constraint, would  it not be possible to speed up the reduction in short-term  interest rates?    [Alphandery] If you look at what is happening in the  European  countries which are reputed to have freed themselves from any  exchange constraints, you note that the long-term interest rates  in those countries are higher than in France. On the other  hand, a degree of stability in the currency seems more capable  of guaranteeing a low level of interest rates, as the  Netherlands shows, for instance. Hence the importance of  pursuing a stable franc policy.    [LES ECHOS] Now that we are experiencing a period of calm  for European currencies, would it not be possible to imagine a  concerted cut in interest rates which all the European countries  need?    [Alphandery] In this connection, I would like to stress that  economic and financial cooperation exists. France and Germany,  by jointly presenting coherent convergence programs, made it  possible to draw up medium-term policies. With regard to  interest rates, I note that the European countries have  experienced a marked reduction in the level of these rates for a  year, both in short and medium-term rates. With regard to the  future, I think that the return to a normal scale of interest  rates will also take place in the rest of Europe.    It is partly thanks to this fall in interest rates that the  economic climate in France is changing. This fall has, in  particular, boosted the Stock Exchange and is making the  successful completion of privatization easier.    [LES ECHOS] In this connection, are you satisfied with the  privatization of Elf?    [Alphandery] It is a great popular success. Some 3.1 million  French people subscribed to it. The total which they requested  (Fr38 billion) is considerable: It is the biggest demand ever  recorded from individuals during a privatization in France. The  privatizations are now well rooted in country. They have  received a plebiscite from the French people. With this  operation alone, we will have colleced Fr76 billion in less than  six months: Fr43 billion in 1993 and Fr33 billion with the Elf  privatization alone. This year, we should collect at least the  Fr55 billion expected.    [LES ECHOS] How was this revenue allocated in 1993?    [Alphandery] The distribution was set out by the finance  bill  last spring: Fr18.7 billion were allocated to employment  measures. Fr8 billion to support for economic activity (BTP  [Public Buildings and Works sector], urban policy) and Fr16  billion to capital donations for public enterprises. It is  clear that there is consistency between the government financial  policy and social policy. The privatizations make it possible  to mobilize resources for combating unemployment, for social  progress, and for employment. In 1994, we are following the same  policy.    [LES ECHOS] Raymond Barre criticized you for not following  an  orthodox policy because the money from privatizations should  serve to clear the state's debts.    [Alphandery] That would be my dearest wish, because Raymond  Barre is right. But necessity dictates: We inherited the worst  recession since the war. To extricate ourselves from it, we had  to make good the public and social deficits: We therefore took  resources where they are to be found. We do not have any choice.    At all events, I note that the privatizations are a  remarkable success in terms of popular shareholding and also  with employees of the privatized enterprises. In addition, we  have drawn up a privatization technique which is proven: The  Privatization Commission gained a reputation for unswerving  independence and responsibility in the first operations. I  would like to pay tribute to it.    [LES ECHOS] In view of the prime minister's growing promises  in recent weeks, are you not afraid of a loss of budget control  which would make it impossible for France to meet the Maastricht  criteria?    [Alphandery] Let us not make any mistake about scale. The  emergency aid granted to the fishermen amounts to Fr300 million,  spending to improve safety in schools amounts to Fr500 million  per year over five years. Of course, these are large sums for  those who will benefit from them, but, compared with the total  budget deficit, this is insignificant.    Moreover, there is nothing abnormal about this, because  every  year unexpected spending has to be included in the budget. The  essential thing is to counterbalance this unexpected spending by  savings. In 1993, when the government took office, it launched  a large sum of new spending while reducing the budget deficit.  These two things are not incompatible. The policy which we are  following does not take us away from the Maastricht criteria,  but brings us closer to it. I would remind you that we have  already reduced the budget deficit by Fr20 billion and the  Social Security deficit by Fr70 billion. This is a considerable  initial effort.    This ability to hold the general course of our policy while  adapting was again welcomed last week by two big British  weeklies known for their critical judgment.    [LES ECHOS] What are your plans for the Deposit and  Consignment Bank?    [Alphandery] I would first like to explain that there is no  question of causing an unpheaval in the existing Deposit Bank.  Thus, the reform will safeguard the establishment's unity. It  will maintain the existing group, and will not lead to a breakup  or dismantling of it. It will maintain the status of the staff  and the staffing levels.    The aim of the reform is to modernize the Bank and to submit  its competitive activities to rules equivalent to those of its  competitors. For instance, the 1816 statute makes provision for  the Bank's director general to be indefinitely fixed in his  post, which the governor of the Bank of France is not. Another  example: The Bank is not subject to the same controls as other  public enterprises and must clarify its relations with the  state. One way of doing this is giving some banking and  financial activities to subsidiaries. A clarification of the  Bank's missions and functioning is therefore necessary.    [LES ECHOS] When will the plan be ready?    [Alphandery] At the end of March. It should be adopted by  the government to be examined by Parliament in the spring  session.    [LES ECHOS] Do you not think that the approach of the  presidential election will hamper any intention of reform?    [Alphandery] No, of course not, other issues, of varying  importance, are being prepared. I would like to mention in  particular the issue of pension funds. In this sphere, I think  that the technical dimension is less difficult to handle than  the psychological and political dimensions. Thinking is  changing. However, some people still have reservations.  Consultation has started to detect the concerns of the  interested parties and make it possible to define a pension fund  system by capitalization which the French people want, as the  success of life insurance has demonstrated.</p>

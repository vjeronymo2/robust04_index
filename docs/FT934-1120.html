			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Television The LWT defence document contains the kind of good knockabout stuff that keeps shareholders amused and merchant bankers in lucrative employment. The use of highly selective charts accentuates LWT's fine record while diminishing Granada's achievements. It nevertheless lands some telling blows about the underlying prospects for some of Granada's businesses. One of LWT's more substantive arguments is that the UK is about to experience the same media explosion which has already shattered the US scene. In the fast-developing - if ill-defined - world of multi-media, companies which can create intellectual property and boast a library of existing 'software' will become increasingly valuable. This is highlighted by the current bid for Paramount, where QVC and Viacom are both prepared to pay about 40 times historic earnings to secure a rare film production company with an international distribution network. The S&amp;P broadcast media index has strongly outperformed this year as a result of such excitement. Parallels can be drawn with the UK. The proliferation of media channels will surely increase the value of television programmes; LWT is one of the more imaginative producers. But LWT is no Paramount. Nor is it the case that the UK market has neglected the value of media stocks: they are already the most highly rated of UK consumer companies. Despite the diversions of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, Granada's bid still seems likely to shake down to a question of price. At 30 times LWT's earnings, Granada's offer is not demonstrably cheap.</p>

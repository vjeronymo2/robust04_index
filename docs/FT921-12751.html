			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Consultant offers hope for pits A CONFIDENTIAL report for the Department of Energy suggests that 30 pits could produce coal at competitive prices. The the study, by John T. Boyd, a US mining consultancy, has been passed to British Coal. Details of the study appear in the latest issue of Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter. Boyd's conclusions mirror those of a study by the British Association of Colliery Management, which has predicted that 30 mines could produce 49m tonnes a year at competitive prices. British Coal would still have to shut nearly half its pits, and the present rate of closures and redundancies is likely to continue, according to Mr Gerard McCloskey, consulting editor of Coal UK. The newsletter says Hatfield, Bentley and Markham Main in the Yorkshire area will be the next three closures among 55 working pits employing about 55,000 miners. Boyd differs from NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, which has reported to the government that fewer than 10 pits are viable.</p>

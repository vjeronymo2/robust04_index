			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Exporters slam DTI on new law The Institute of Export yesterday protested to the government about 'ineffective' consultation with industry and corporate lawyers about the new laws on commercial agents, which come into force on January 1. Complaints about poor consultation have been mounting throughout the autumn as exporters realised the new laws were going to raise costs and that some companies were unlikely to have enough time to adjust. The final straw that led the institute to write to Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, appears to have been a new section in the final form of the regulations. This was unexpectedly published last week with no time for amendment, less than three weeks before the regulations become law. It changed the way agents should be compensated when sacked. In all drafts, Britain appeared to be opting for damages rather than the fixed-indemnity formulae favoured by most other European Union countries. Since damages are negotiable, most lawyers acting for exporters believed this would generally offer the cheapest option if companies and agents fell out. But, according to Mr Michael Thornton, a solicitor who is co-author of a standard textbook explaining the laws, the new regulations say both methods shall be used, allowing agents to claim a fixed indemnity worth one year's commission averaged over five years, plus damages. He added that he and other specialist lawyers had not been consulted. 'Somebody is going to have to say you can have one or the other, or does this now mean you can only have damages if the sum exceeds the indemnity?' Some lawyers believe the new laws - which implement a 1986 EC directive - may actually be wrong, as the directive appears to stipulate an 'either/or' approach to compensation. Mr Thornton, a partner specialising in export law at the Manchester office of Laytons, added: 'It's a bit rich for this to appear in the final version when it didn't appear in any of the drafts. It has just been slapped in by somebody in the Department of Industry and now appears as the law.' Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, said: 'The government banged out a few drafts to a few people and said they had consulted. They had not.' Inquirers were refused a list of consultees by the DTI, making it difficult to liaise and co-ordinate responses in the common interests of industry and commerce, he added. Mr Thornton added: 'Someone in the DTI must love lawyers. Many companies will need possibly expensive legal assistance just to check if the laws apply to them.'</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Insurer to speed training reforms Sun Alliance is to speed up plans to merge the training of its life insurance direct sales force and that of 'tied agents' - financial advisers who sell its products - after recommendations from regulators. The insurer, one of the UK's largest, received a report from Lautro, the life industry watchdog, this month and told its agents just over a week ago that the training merger would be brought forward. Mr Mike Austen, managing director of Sun Alliance's life and pensions operation, emphasised that Lautro's report had not found any area where the competence of any sales agent was in doubt and had not identified any issues relating to investor protection. The changes being made are similar to those being carried out in other life companies. After visits from Lautro, both Norwich Union and Nationwide building society took the more drastic course of suspending their financial services sales forces temporarily for retraining. Both later decided to reduce sharply the number of authorised agents. The size of Sun Alliance's life and pensions sales force, including tied agents, has dropped by almost a third from 1,700 in June 1993.</p>

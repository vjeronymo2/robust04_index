			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A joint news conference by Anatoliy Zlenko  and Andre Ouellet, the Ukrainian and Canadian foreign ministers,  took place at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 1 April.    Andre Ouellett announced a package of Canadian aid to  Ukraine  valuing $15 million to support the dismantlement of nuclear  weapons and ensure nuclear safety. This package is a part of  Canadian aid to Ukraine. "Canada is taking on a commitment to  cooperate with Ukraine in strengthening international stability  and security. This package will help Ukraine, guided by the  experience of Canadian experts, to dispose of nuclear weapons,"  Andre Ouellett reported.    The head of the Foreign Ministry noted that Canada would  assist in integrating Ukraine into the European Community, would  help to take the appropriate measures for its accession to the  GATT, would support Ukraine in cooperation with the IMF, and  would also demand that the issue of support for Ukraine by the  international community be examined at a sitting of the "Great  Seven." As regards Canada's mediation, Andre Ouellett noted  that "there is no necessity for this, because Ukraine will be  able to defend itself."    Anatoliy Zlenko expressed gratitude to Canada's foreign  minister for supporting Ukraine in the international arena and  noted that Canadian-Ukrainian relations have great potential  possibilities, especially in the field of military-political and  trade and economic cooperation. "It is important to us to have  partnership relations with Canada, the prestige of which is very  influential in the world," he stressed.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): Ethics and the investor INVESTING WITH YOUR CONSCIENCE: HOW TO ACHIEVE HIGH RETURNS USING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING by John C Harrington John Wiley &amp; Sons, Dollars 24.95, 276 pages THE IDEA of ethical investing is not new; only the ethics have changed. As the 1960s generation reaches its wealthier middle age, it seems likely that the issue of 'making money morally' will grow in importance. Harrington's book deals with the market's development in the US, where ethical investment has had its biggest impact. Conditions in America have certainly been conducive; there is both financial sophistication among the pollution and a plethora of single issue pressure groups. After briefly mentioning the free market view that companies should make profits for their shareholders and let others worry about ethics, Harrington's book makes the assumption that readers will share the view that ethical investing is 'a good thing'. The book is thus very much a 'how to' rather than a 'why should I' manual, and since it largely restricts itself to the US market, is likely to be of little use to the international reader. But it does illustrate how the agenda of ethical investing is constantly on the change. South Africa was the big issue of the 1980s; the environment has become the subject of the 1990s. But green investing is not an easy matter; some companies making big profits from waste disposal are themselves accused of being polluters. The great problem is that few people's ethics are exactly the same and in some areas - where the religious right clashes with the liberal left - one man's morality is another man's wickedness. Constructing ethical funds that meet the needs of everyone is probably beyond the wit of any fund manager. Ethical investment may be a growing field, but it will also be highly fragmented.</p>

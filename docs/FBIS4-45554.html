			<p>`Positive'   <F P=102>   PY2506034594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0303 GMT 25 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> PY2506034594 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Lima 24 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori today termed positive U.S. President Bill Clinton's  proposal to Congress that U.S. support to Peru for the detection  of drug trafficking from the air be reestablished.    Fujimori said, however, that "with or without support" Peru  is carrying out a firm and constant struggle against drug  trafficking.    He recalled that the contribution made by the U.S. AWACS and  Orion airplanes with modern equipment for detecting airplanes  had been very effective when they were cooperating with the  Peruvian Air Force, until May when the U.S. Government decided  to withdraw that support.    In a news conference Fujimori said that with that help "our  airplanes were able to persecute and shoot down" the airplanes  of Colombian drug traffickers entering the Peruvian jungle  region to pick up the basic cocaine paste gathered by drug  traffickers.    Fujimori added that the U.S. radar installed in the jungle  region, which was also deactivated, was not effective as it is  obsolete equipment used during World War II.    He said that the reestablishment of the aid for detecting  the  airplanes of drug traffickers would be a positive step.    He reiterated that the struggle against drug trafficking is  an international problem, which is the responsibility of drug  producing and consuming countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean Luckenson on news conference held by the </F> Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, formerly  Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti,  FRAPH, on 21 June -- passages within italics in Creole]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Luckenson] They have  gone from threats to action. FRAPH, which stood for the  Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, has  become the Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People and  has called for a general strike for 24 June. FRAPH leader  Emmanuel Constant, in tiger-striped pants, a black t-shirt, with  a gun around his waist, asked the head of the provisional  government, Attorney Emile Jonassaint, who is not recognized by  the international community, to close the doors of his  ministries to protest the actions of first U.S. citizen, Mr.  Clinton; the 16 December president, Dr. Aristide; new U.S.  charge d'affaires in the Haitian crisis, Mr. William Gray; and  the deaths of the 143,000 children who have already died. These  deaths are part of the negative results of the unfair, criminal  international embargo imposed on the Haitian people.    This statement was made by Emmanuel Constant during a news  conference on 21 June at about 1500. [passage omitted]    A few days after Clinton's executive order, Louis Jodel  Chambelain, founder of the party, said it is a serious time and  the leaders of all political parties, all sectors of national  life must break their silence. The Front, which shares the  opinion of President Jonassaint, who said that only elections  can solve the country's problems, is wondering if the elections  will be held. Meanwhile, the national coordinator of the party,  Louis Jodel Chambelain, who was wearing a grey suit, appeared in  public for the first time since his last statement, asking the  international community to ensure his safety. [passage omitted]    Chambelain congratulates the foreigners who continue  living in Haiti despite the country's hard times and tells them  there is no problem; they are safe. Chambelain also took the  opportunity to severely criticize certain ministers who are part  of the 11 May government, which most parliamentarians have  accused of abusing authority. He took the opportunity to  denounce the administrative mess prevailing in public offices,  which a small group continues to enjoy even though they never  work.    For his part, Constant said [quote] the Fatherland is  in danger and a state of emergency has been ordered by the 11  May president. As previously announced, we have gone into action  today, not to create a parallel body, but to (?work under the  supervision) of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH]. For the time  being, we are first aid workers whose mission is to protect the  national territory. We are working 24 hours a day. Unquote.    [Begin Constant recording] We have decided to become the  Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, as we have been  saying since 17 August. This does not mean we want to create a  parallel body, on the contrary, we want to put ourselves in the  service of the FADH, or at least with the colors and the  institutions in charge of preserving the sovereignty of the  territory.    First, we have become first aid workers. First, we have  become first aid workers [repeats] because of the state of  emergency. Second, we are always ready, 24 hours a day, to  protect the Haitian territory and to protect the people who wish  to leave on boats, who will even set out for Guantanamo; to  prepare our traditional arms, not firearms, but traditional  arms, which will be used throughout the country in case of  invasion because it is (?easy) to land in Haiti by dropping  bombs....[end recording]    [Luckenson] Journalists reminded Constant that the  government issued a communique saying that only the FADH are  authorized to carry weapons on national territory. Constant  replied that in case of an intervention, the Haitian Army will  be obliged to accept all citizens who come to help it defend the  national territory as Haitians. The FRAPH secretary general  called on journalists to seize the opportunity to get images and  pictures of the FRAPH members because this would be their last  news conference. After this, there would be no one in the  offices because they were going to withdraw to strategic areas  to make traditional weapons such as pikes, magic potions,  hammocks, and other materials to be used in case of foreign  intervention.    Constant pointed out that foreigners must respect  President Jonassaint's latest communique concerning strategic  areas. He believes that as noted in the communique, the  Jonassaint government will not agree to planes being used for  propaganda.</p>

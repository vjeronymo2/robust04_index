			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Brazil fails to achieve IMF aims THE BRAZILIAN government admitted yesterday it had failed to meet at least one of the five targets for the first quarter of its programme with the International Monetary Fund, and so would not request the second tranche of IMF funding due this month, reports Christina Lamb in Sao Paulo. Rather than ask for a waiver of the IMF conditions, so as to enable it to receive the Dollars 250m payment, Brazil has asked the fund for a rephasing of their agreement signed in January. The country's progress is now to be reassessed in August. Brazil's economic team believes targets will have been met by then.</p>

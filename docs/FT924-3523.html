			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Crimea order will upset Ukraine THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies yesterday questioned the status of Sevastopol, home port of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, Reuter reports from Moscow. The move is certain to raise hackles in Ukraine. The Congress, under strong pressure from the conservative opposition, ordered the smaller standing parliament to consider the status of the port. On the Crimean peninsula, it has a mostly Russian population but was ceded formally to Ukraine, within the Soviet Union, in 1954. Ukrainian independence last December made the break real. President Boris Yeltsin has accepted Ukrainian sovereignty over the Crimea but Russian conservatives have urged that Sevastopol should have special status rather than belonging solely to Ukraine. They cited a 1948 decree giving the city an autonomous administrative centre. Relations between Russia and Ukraine, the two most powerful ex-Soviet states, have been soured by a row over sharing the 380-ship Black Sea fleet since the communist superpower collapsed. In August Mr Yeltsin and Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk signed an accord on a share-out, which considerably calmed emotions. Russian nationalists have challenged Ukraine's right to Sevastopol and the whole peninsula, saying Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had no legal authority to hand them to Kiev in 1954. Russia's standing parliament this year raised the Crimea issue, triggering an increase in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. In Kiev, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said the decision to turn the issue over to the standing parliament could only hurt relations between the two republics. The ministry said the decision violated international principles on territorial integrity and the inviolability of established borders.</p>

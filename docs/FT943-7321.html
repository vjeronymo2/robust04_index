			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Investment rises in manufacturing Manufacturing investment rose in the past quarter for the first time in two years, official figures showed yesterday, fuelling hopes that the improvement in the industrial sector might be feeding through to a growth in investment. The rise occurred although official data released on Monday showed that overall investment in the economy fell in the second quarter of the year, compared with the first quarter. The seasonally adjusted provisional estimate of manufacturers' capital spending in the three months to June was 4 per cent higher than in the three months to March, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Some analysts suggested that the growth might indicate a turning point in the manufacturing sector. In the past five years manufacturing investment has fallen about 30 per cent, after falling steadily from the peak it reached in 1989. But with the past quarter's improvement in manufacturing investment still lagging a long way behind the overall growth in manufacturing output, yesterday's figures suggested that the investment picture remained patchy. Manufacturing investment in the second quarter of this year was 2 per cent higher compared with the same period last year, the CSO said. Measured on an annual basis, however, the level of capital spending in the year to June was 3 per cent lower than in the year to June last year. The data showed distinct differences in the type of investment on a sectoral basis. Spending on plant and machinery, which accounts for the bulk of manufacturing investment, rose 3.4 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. However, spending on plant and machinery was 1 per cent lower in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, and on an annual basis spending fell 5 per cent in the year to June, compared with the previous year. Spending on vehicles rose 8 per cent in the year to June compared with the previous year, while spending on buildings rose 4 per cent. On a sectoral basis, the figures showed that the solid and nuclear fuels and oil refinery sector fell sharply over the year, with spending in the second quarter of this year 31 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. Spending in the chemicals, metals and non-metallic minerals sector also fell over the year, in spite of a small rise in the past quarter. Spending in this sector was 5.6 per cent lower in the second quarter of the year, compared with the same period a year ago. Spending in the machinery, electrical and transport sector was 1.7 per cent higher in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period a year ago. Separate data released by the CSO yesterday showed that manufacturers reduced their stocks by Pounds 57m in the past quarter, after a sharp rise in stocks in the first quarter of the year. The level of work in progress among manufacturers rose Pounds 115m in the second quarter, after rising Pounds 182m in the first quarter of this year. Retailers' stocks rose in the second quarter of the year, after falling back in the first three months. Wholesalers' stocks rose for the second successive quarter.</p>

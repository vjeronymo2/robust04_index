			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: Regulator likely to be Bank of England THE BANK of England is likely to become the main regulator of HSBC Holdings if Hongkong Bank's acquisition of Midland Bank is successful. However, most of the operations will remain outside the scope of the Bank of England's direct regulatory supervision - an arrangement believed to be unique for a UK-based banking group. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, said yesterday that the Bank would supervise the holding company, while its subsidiary banks will remain regulated by the monetary authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are headquartered. A formal application has been made to the Bank of England. Informal discussions have continued with the Bank since Hongkong Bank first showed an interest in Midland, and the Bank is believed to have agreed in principle to take responsibility. The Bank of England's role as lead regulator springs from the fact that the group will be run from London, rather than simply that it is legally incorporated in the UK. Mr Purves said the regulator wanted 'to know where the mind and management (of the bank) is.' For HSBC Holdings that place will be London where, eventually, the bank's chairman and chief executive will reside. The Bank's responsibility for the group holding company, though, will not give it direct responsibility for most of its operations. While Midland will continue to be overseen by the Bank of England, Hongkong Bank will remain under the supervision of Mr David Carse, Hong Kong's banking commissioner. This arrangement differs markedly from that of Standard Chartered, the UK-based overseas bank which offers the closest parallel. The main operating arm of Standard Chartered is located in the UK, with other operations around the world run as branches or subsidiaries owned by the UK bank. This gives the Bank of England a direct interest in the supervision of operations overseas. Mr Carse, who is technically on secondment in Hong Kong, having previously worked in the Bank of England's supervision department, said the decision to have the Bank as the key regulator was in line with international supervisory principles. The Bank of England has in the past been responsible for Hongkong Bank's branch operations in the UK. It will for the first time become responsible for the group's capital position and the fitness and properness of its directors.</p>

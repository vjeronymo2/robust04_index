			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Gas chief warns against break-up MR ROBERT Evans, the chairman of British Gas, has warned the prime minister that Britain needs large, viable companies if it is to compete overseas. A joint venture between British Gas and India's Gas Authority is expected to be agreed this week as part of Mr John Major's tour of India. The contract, to set up and operate a distribution network in Bombay, is worth Pounds 100m. Further projects in India could follow. Mr Evans, who accompanied Mr Major to India, said such projects depended on financial strength and large-scale research and development. British Gas is awaiting a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on its possible break-up and Mr Evans said: 'If we were small and fractured like the electrical industry I think that we would find it very difficult. You do require large, viable entities.' He had a private talk with Mr Major during the flight to India and said afterwards that the prime minister agreed 'that we need strong British companies'. Downing Street indicated that Mr Major had yet to consider the possible implications of the MMC investigation into the dominant market position of British Gas. Mr Evans said the government's reaction would be 'to some extent political decisions'. The spliting of British Gas into a transport and storage arm and a trading arm has been proposed by Ofgas, the industry's regulator. The gas distribution network was a natural monopoly but a break-up could jeopardise further price cuts in addition to those British Gas had made since privatisation. He added: 'If we are to continue that kind of progress we have really got to have access to the cheapest possible gas. We are in a global marketplace and we need global players.' British Gas had regarded overseas expansion as a priority because it had 'virtually saturated' the UK market. But Mr Evans acknowledged there was resistance in many countries to foreign investors buying into utilities. The company estimates that spending on gas-related activities in India could be worth up to Pounds 2bn in the next 10 years.</p>

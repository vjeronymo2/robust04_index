			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Reform of the pension funds THE MAXWELL scandals have left millions of members of occupational pension schemes wondering just how safe their pensions are, and many thousands facing actual poverty. It was a theme which dominated the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds last week. Battles may lie ahead. A survey by the 100 Group of finance directors suggested that companies will fight for the right to continue to claw back at least part of scheme surpluses for their benefit. Some would say that it is time to draw up a radical agenda. Already the role of occupational schemes has shrunk: NAPF member schemes cover no more than 7m employees, against the more than 4m who have started personal pension plans within the past few years. Now that scheme membership is voluntary many pensions managers are disappointed in their ability to attract the support of new recruits. Perhaps the fraudulent disappearance of money will prove a very rare phenomenon (though the Maxwell case is unique only in its size) but millions of scheme members regularly - if undramatically - lose out through poor transfer values and the reluctance to protect benefits against inflation. Indeed, the current phenomena of scheme surpluses and widespread company contribution holidays can be said to relate very largely to the failure to maintain benefits in real terms. Many employees might be better off with a system of low-cost company-sponsored personal pension plans which could be freely transferred from one employment to another. Deep pool But the well-entrenched network of occupational schemes should not be dismantled lightly. With some Pounds 300bn of assets they represent an enormous and stable pool of long-term savings, the envy of some countries which are overdependent on save-as-you-go pensions systems threatened by adverse demographic trends. Nevertheless, it is right that the state should intervene to draw up some tighter rules. Occupational pension schemes are not simply exercises in corporate charity and paternalism, they are aspects of employee benefit strategy which exploit generous tax reliefs. In exchange, the government is entitled to be confident that, at the very least, it will not be faced with huge compensation demands. More generally, it needs to be confident that schemes are run fairly. A first priority is to provide for the safe custody of funds. Some kind of insurance or compensation scheme must also be developed in case things still go wrong. These may prove costly measures, but they cannot now be avoided. Trustees' powers Second, pension fund trustees must be given broader powers and responsibilities to ensure fair treatment of beneficiaries. At present, they can do little more than apply often inequitable rules laid down by the employers. Already the government has been forced to legislate to ensure fairer transfer terms and protection against inflation, but more is required. Third, there is the controversial matter of the ownership of so-called surpluses. These have arisen basically because during the 1980s dividends rose faster than employee earnings, but this is no longer true. During the 1970s, many schemes actually went into substantial deficit, and companies argue that if they are expected to top schemes up in hard times they must also be permitted to benefit at least indirectly from surpluses when they occur, otherwise schemes will be allowed to become chronically underfunded. However, it might be possible to approach this problem by laying down minimum funding standards, which will in any case be required if scheme benefits are to be insured. By moving carefully in these directions it ought to be possible to preserve the bulk of the occupational pensions sector while improving the security of members. The balance of advantage must to some degree shift from final salary schemes towards money purchase arrangements which impose an extra investment risk upon the scheme members but avoid the problems of surpluses and inequitable distribution of benefits. They are, indeed, only one step removed from personal plans. Recent events have made fundamental reform inevitable as well as desirable.</p>

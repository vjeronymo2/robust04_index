			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca proves its critics wrong Mr John Mayo, Zeneca's finance director, was beaming even more than usual yesterday. Partly it was because he had the opportunity to boast how last year he had timed two Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) Yankee bonds at 6.4 per cent and 7 per cent within weeks of the bottom of the market. His cheeriness was also because he believed his much-criticised plan to bundle Imperial Chemical Industries' agrochemicals and speciality business with the drugs division had been justified by the group's latest figures. Much of the 17 per cent rise in operating profits was due to the previously unfashionable agrochemicals and seeds division. Profits rose 45 per cent from Pounds 85m to Pounds 123m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 893m (Pounds 825m). 'Our agrochemicals business is having a highly successful year. In 1993 nearly all that could go wrong did go wrong. The reverse is true in 1994,' said Mr David Barnes, chief executive. Mr Alan Pink, chief executive of agrochemicals and seeds, said: 'We've benefited from a combination of cost-cutting and a rising sales line.' Sales were up 11 per cent from Pounds 726m to Pounds 807m. The business had been assisted by new product launches which had helped win market share, particularly in the US. The North American market was also up, driven by wet weather and an 8 per cent increase in area planted. North American sales were up 23 per cent at Pounds 288m (Pounds 234m). Latin America sales increased 23 per cent to Pounds 75m, as the region began to benefit from the GATT Uruguay round. Asia-Pacific sales were up 14 per cent to Pounds 111m. In Europe, the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms in 1992 had worked their way out, said Mr Pink. Sales were virtually static at Pounds 294m. Sales at the seeds business, troubled by difficulties in eastern Europe, were down 13 per cent at Pounds 86m (Pounds 99m). In contrast to agrochemicals, the drugs division was more mundane. Mr Barnes said the pharmaceuticals industry was in a period of unprecedented change, but against that demanding background the business had growing sales and trading profit. Operating profits from the ongoing drugs business were up 7 per cent from Pounds 299m to Pounds 320m, boosted by a strong performance in Europe. Group sales were up 6 per cent from Pounds 924m to Pounds 976m. Underlying growth was 7 per cent, but prices fell 1 percentage point. Sales of Zestril, Zeneca's top-selling product, increased 14 per cent from Pounds 208m to Pounds 238m. However, the drug's sales growth in the US was disappointing at only 5 per cent. Although prescription volumes were 15 per cent, and the heart drug continues to gain market share, it suffered price competition from Merck's Vasotec. Tenormin, formerly Zeneca's biggest drug whose US patents have expired, continued to suffer a deterioration in sales, down 9 per cent from Pounds 242m to Pounds 221m. Sales of Nolvadex, the cancer treatment were static at Pounds 174m (Pounds 175m). Newer products, such as Diprivan, the anaesthetic, and Zoladex, another cancer treatment, continued to grow, up 25 per cent at Pounds 119m and 31 per cent at Pounds 92m respectively. The specialities division, renowned for its low margins, reported a 'steady recovery' with trading profits up 11 per cent from Pounds 35m to Pounds 39m on virtually static sales at Pounds 521m (Pounds 519m). However, Mr Mayo said the coatings business achieved good results. Sales by the Stahl coatings operations were up 1 per cent at Pounds 86m, while the resins operations rose 10 per cent to Pounds 86m. Textile colour sales were static at Pounds 115m; industrial colours rose 13 per cent to Pounds 54m; other organic chemicals were up 2 per cent at Pounds 101m. Sales of biological products, such as the meat substitute Quorn, were up 17 per cent at Pounds 14m, partly thanks to a national advertising campaign in the UK.</p>

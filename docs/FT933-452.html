			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Intellectual outsider steps up to the crease - GMB leader John Edmonds MR JOHN EDMONDS, who may today deliver a powerful blow to Mr John Smith's leadership of the Labour party, is the most able and complex of Britain's union bosses. The only one who, like his hero Ernest Bevin, would not be out of his depth serving in a Labour cabinet. But any chance that he might get that opportunity has withered over the past few months irrespective of what happens in today's vote on the one-member-one-vote proposal - backed by Mr Smith and opposed by Mr Edmonds. Many among the Labour leadership, particularly the 'modernisers', have been appalled by what they see as betrayal by a union leader usually associated with moderate, progressive, causes. The hostile views of his erstwhile political allies in both the party and the unions hurts Mr Edmonds. He also accepts that his stand will, at least in the short term, harm both Mr Smith and himself. But Mr Edmonds, 48, is used to being an outsider. The son of a Transport and General Workers Union shop steward who won a scholarship to fee-paying Christ's Hospital - where as a young batsman he was once bowled out by future England fast bowler John Snow - has never found a niche in the union movement. He is resented for his brains and his arrogance, and his laboured humour does little to compensate. After studying history at Oxford he climbed the greasy pole in the GMB general union. He is now poised to lead his union into a merger with the TGWU and has a good chance of emerging as the leader of the joint union. Some of his critics allege that Mr Edmonds' refusal to accept a small reduction in union influence in the selection of parliamentary candidates is bound up with that leadership ambition. Despite his support for a loosening of the party-union links in the late 1980s, he now defends the link because, it is alleged by his detractors, that will increase his popularity with leftwing activists in the TGWU. He rejects that and argues for the rights of levy-paying unionists who are not, and do not want to be, full party members, but want some local political influence in return for their money. His aides also claim that while Mr Edmonds has great authority in his official-dominated union, the regional barons have ensured that he does not waver on the issue of one-member-one-vote. But some critics stress his record for inconsistency. Others stress his vanity. 'John has a big political ego and without an important role in the Labour party the TV cameras would not be at his front door', said one Labour MP. It was certainly Mr Edmonds' premature TV endorsement of Mr John Smith for the leadership that gave an anti-union twist to the subsequent debate about reforming the links. Vain or not, Mr Edmonds is certainly not a man who underestimates his ability to change the course of history. Asked recently by New Statesman magazine which day he would visit if he could travel back in time, he replied: 'The day in August 1917 when, with anti-Bolshevik feeling growing in Russia, Kerensky decided not to move against Lenin.' Mr Edmonds was not able to prevent 75 years of division in the world labour movement but, his critics accuse, he is inflicting incalculable damage to today's Labour party by reminding the voters how much power is still wielded by union barons.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [A.I. report: "Cadres Are Paramount. Will The Military </F> District Prosecutor Also Be Kicked Out?"]    [Text] A tough, under-the-rug struggle seems to be  proceeding in the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's  Office, where Aleksey Ilyushenko is still the acting prosecutor.  Yet one can only judge of this indirectly. Thus, recently  three deputy general prosecutors at once lost their posts,  whereupon Ilyushenko got around to department chiefs. In the  very near future the entire leadership of the Moscow Military  District Prosecutor's Office could also be replaced. District  prosecutor Mikhail Kislitsyn, who lately closed the Terekhov  case over the 3-4 October events following an amnesty, has  obviously annoyed Ilyushenko. Even so, the acting prosecutor  has not as yet countermanded Kislitsyn's decision (which he has  every right to do) and it is not ruled out that he will soon  invoke his other powers: to appoint and dismiss personnel.  Rumor has it that an order to remove Kislitsyn is pending.    Kislitsyn was appointed to his post only a few months ago.  It is known that recently he was offered the position of deputy  chief military prosecutor, which he refused for unknown reasons.  At that time, the vacancy unexpectedly went to Stanislav  Gaveto, who has been serving in Moscow all these years. It is  not clear what has brought about his rise. This is a question  for Valentin Panichev, who heads the Military Prosecutor's  Office. Up till now Gaveto has held secondary positions. It is  not ruled out, however, that the appointment has been made on  Ilyushenko's initiative and is aimed at getting rid of Panichev  himself, one of the few deputies who have survived the purge in  the General Prosecutor's Office.</p>

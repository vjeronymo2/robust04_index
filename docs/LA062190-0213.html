			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: HARRY JAMES SOUND COMES BACK TO LIFE AT  DEL MAR FAIR  </P> <P> Trumpeter Harry James died in 1983, but his band lives on, providing a dream  job for trumpeter Art Depew.  </P> <P> Depew, who played with James for five years during the 1950s, returned 2 1/2  years ago to lead the Harry James Orchestra, a 17-piece swing ensemble which  hits the Del Mar Fair's Grandstand Stage this afternoon at 2.  </P> <P> During his career, James was occasionally criticized for playing music he knew  would succeed commercially, at the expense of innovation. But Depew has  respected his idol's work since the late 1930s.  </P> <P> "I first heard him with Benny Goodman, when I was 12 or 13," Depew recalled,  "but I saw him live for the first time at the Hollywood Palladium in 1943. He  had a great deal of technique, an awful lot of power and strength, nice tone  and vibrato. He was very creative and very advanced.  </P> <P> "Harry was a commercial trumpet player, but he played great jazz too -- his  solo on 'Sing, Sing, Sing' with Benny Goodman became the song's definitive  melody. His jazz was so lucid and clear. His solos went from jazz solos to  becoming the melodies audiences expected to hear."  </P> <P> As leader, Depew now plays these solos, and he sings an occasional number. The  material consists mostly of such James' band standards as "Sleepy Lagoon," "The  Mole," "I've Heard That Song Before," "Cherry," "Two O'Clock Jump," "Blues for  Sale," "Don't Be That Way" and "You Made Me Love You," James' "most successful  ballad," according to Depew.  </P> <P> Depew, who considers swing-era big band music "a lot more stimulating than  Bruce Springsteen," said the style is catching on all over again back East,  where people in their 20s and 30s are packing dance halls.  </P> <P> Depew, 65, has worked with band leaders including Tommy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, Tex  Beneke and Charlie Barnet, but considers his career to be one long training  session for his ultimate job.  </P> <P> "I'm absolutely in love with what I'm doing. I have to maintain my abilities,  so I practice three or four hours a day to play those solos the way I've  trained my entire life to play them."  </P> <P> It's not surprising that many of James' original recordings bear some  relationship to recordings by the Count Basie Orchestra; James often borrowed  Basie band members for his sessions.  </P> <P> For comparison's sake, you can hear the newest version of Basie's group, under  the direction of saxophonist Frank Foster, tonight at 7:30 and 9:30 at the  Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach.  </P> <P> Basie died in 1984, but his band continues to earn rave notices for the quality  of the ensemble work and soloists. Compared with the intricate musical themes  played by other big bands, the characteristic Basie sound emphasizes bluesy  swing and rhythmic subtlety as much as harmonic complexity.  </P> <P> If you missed Marimba Mike's multimedia performance downtown at Ruse  Performance Gallery earlier this year, you've got another chance. Mike, a.k.a.  Bryan Jackson, will repeat the exotic original piece "People of the Lake," an  "ethnomusicological journey through time and space," this Friday night at 8 at  Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. He also plans to include compositions  by Chick Corea, Charles Mingus and others.  </P> <P> A master of many percussion instruments, Mike also plays a variety of unusual  African wind instruments and whistles. On "People of the Lake," he uses tape  and electronics to enhance the sound, while images of primitive art and foreign  landscapes are projected.  </P> <P> Tickets are $7.50; reservations are recommended (298-4011).  </P> <P> RIFFS: Singer Jimmy Witherspoon opened five nights at Elario's last night with  his hot band: Roy Alexander on Hammond B-3 organ, Terry Evans on guitar and  Maurice Simons Jr., on drums. . . .  </P> <P> Hiroshima played two sold-out shows at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay last  weekend, and promoter Kenny Weissberg would like to bring the band back in  October. Harry Connick Jr., Chet Atkins (with Garrison Keillor), Spyro Gyra,  Michael Franks and David Benoit are jazz acts that appear headed for a sellout  this summer at Humphrey's. . . .  </P> <P> Sunday night's "Le Jazz Club" program on KSDS-FM (88.3) features Meredith  D'Ambrosio singing music by George Gershwin, Cole Porter and other popular  American composers. . . .  </P> <P> The Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown hosts a rare appearance by a  quartet featuring flutist Holly Hofmann, pianist Randy Porter, bassist Bob  Magnusson and drummer Tim McMahon this Friday and Saturday nights. . . .  </P> <P> Hot Vazquez plays Friday night and Daniel Jackson's Real Jazz Band Saturday  night at Croce's downtown. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Wofford holds down the solo piano seat tonight through Saturday at the  Beach House restaurant in Pacific Beach. . . .  </P> <P> Keyboard man Rob Mullins, who has played with Diane Schuur, Spike Robinson,  Phillip Bailey (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire) and the Rippingtons, works this  Sunday's brunch cruises aboard The Entertainer, leaving from 1066 N. Harbor  Drive downtown at 10 and 12:30. . . .  </P> <P> Fattburger is the star of next Wednesday's "Jazz Trax Nite" at the Catamaran  Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach. . . .  </P> <P> Ragtime and honky-tonk piano man Fred Finn continues in "The Mickey Finn Show,"  running through tunes from the Gay '90s, Roaring '20s, Dixieland, blues and  jazz Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8 and Sundays at 2 p.m. at the Hahn  Cosmopolitan Theatre, 444 4th Ave., downtown. . . .  </P> <P> Trombonist and singer Aubrey Fay and his band kick off summer at the B St. Cafe  &amp; Bar downtown tonight through Saturday night. . . .  </P> <P> Guitarist Laurindo Almeida is featured on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" program  Saturday night at 11 and again Monday night at 11:30.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Kalon continues its progress with 15% rise KALON, the paints group which in August failed to acquire Manders (Holdings), its rival paints, inks and property company, has continued its progress with a 15 per cent pre-tax profits rise in the year to December 31. Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules profits worked through at Pounds 10.6m, against Pounds 9.22m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.62m, of which Pounds 1.56m was the cost of its abortive bid for Manders and Pounds 1.06m the loss on the disposal of the chemicals division. Turnover was Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 98.5m), of which Pounds 3.57m (Pounds 4.48m) related to discontinued operations. Operating profits from continuing activities rose 38 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 9.51m) but were knocked back by losses of Pounds 560,000 (Pounds 330,000) from discontinued businesses. Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said Kalon had learnt a lot from the Manders bid, adding that, without its failing, its other acquisitions could not all have happened. In December 1992 it bought the J Mangers' DIY business for Pounds 2.4m, in January the Chelec builders' merchants supply business for Pounds 250,000, and in February Novodec, the French private label paint maker, for Pounds 22m. Within the decorative division, the retail side of the private label paints business lifted sales 7 per cent in a market which only grew 3 per cent. Kalon's market share is now estimated at 28 per cent. On the trade side, overall market sales fell 6 per cent, though sales of Kalon's Leyland brand rose 14 per cent, in large part on the back of its 68 Leyland trade centres, up five over the year. Earnings per share slipped to 5.17p (5.28p). A recommended final dividend of 2.2p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3.2p (2.2p). COMMENT It is difficult to find fault with Kalon, and though many concede that it gains much of its drive and clear, coherent strategy from Mr Hennessy, the feeling is that the businesses are sound and well-managed throughout. Growth potential abounds. Its efficient factories still have at least 30 per cent spare capacity and the loss of Manders may be a blessing in disguise. If Kalon is happy not to threaten the multinationals' grip on the overall paints market, there are plenty of other opportunities in sundries and in own-label paints on the Continent and France in particular. Forecast pre-tax profits for 1993 are about Pounds 19m, with earnings between 9.3p and 9.6p, giving a multiple of about 15. Reasonable value.</p>

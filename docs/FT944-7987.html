			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Opec At one level, the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over whether to roll over Opec's production ceiling for a year or only six months is purely tactical. After all, both countries have a shared objective: higher crude prices. The Saudis believe a year-long freeze would be more effective. In this case, the market would know there was little chance of the ceiling's being raised in mid-1995 to meet expected increases in world demand. Arguably, it would therefore be unwilling to run down stocks next spring. Yesterday traders responded to the Saudi plan at the cartel's meeting in Bali by pushing up crude prices. Kuwait's view that a six-month freeze would carry greater market credibility is hard to understand, unless it is seen as a ploy to achieve a higher quota. The sooner the overall ceiling is reviewed, the better the chance of increasing its own share. By contrast, the Saudis want to keep the higher quota they received after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and so have an interest in freezing the regime. With two of Opec's largest members struggling for market share, the cartel looks ill-prepared to cut production in 1995 should that be needed. At the moment, with world demand growing, restraint is unnecessary. But that outlook could be challenged from several angles: the mild start to winter in Europe and North America may continue; non-Opec suppliers may increase production next year substantially; and UN sanctions on Iraq may be lifted. The manoeuvring in Bali suggests the cartel will find it hard to accommodate such shocks.</p>

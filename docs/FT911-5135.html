			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Schneider 'closer to Square D' SCHNEIDER, the French electrical equipment group, yesterday claimed further progress in its unsolicited Dollars 1.8bn bid for control of Square D, the US maker of electrical distribution equipment. The French bidder said 78.1 per cent of Square D's shares had been tendered to its initial Dollars 78-a-share cash offer, 10 per cent more than the number achieved by the first deadline, at the end of March. Schneider has decided to extend the offer until May 3. 'An imposing majority of Square D shareholders has once again responded favourably to our offer . . . Better still, we have registered a very clear progression in the number of shares being offered to us,' said Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman. Square D is based in Illinois but registered in Delaware to take advantage of Delaware state laws requiring a bidder to control 85 per cent of the capital before claiming victory. 'In refusing to cancel the obstacles to this transaction and to meet us to discuss our offer, the board of Square D is neglecting the will of its shareholders,' said Mr Pineau-Valencienne. The French group launched its bid in February, when it became clear that discussions with Square D on an agreed merger were coming to nothing. Schneider has now asked shareholders to give it their proxy votes for Square D's annual general meeting on May 25, at which it will try to oust the US company's board and replace it with its candidates. 'In giving us their mandate, Square D's shareholders will give us the means to bring about an operation which serves their interests just as much as the long term industrial interests of Square D,' said Mr Pineau-Valencienne.</p>

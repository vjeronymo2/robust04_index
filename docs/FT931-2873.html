			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Bonds: AfDB issue reflects demand for long-dated paper NEW issues were concentrated in the Eurodollar sector yesterday, with other areas of the international bond market quiet ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting today. The triple A-rated African Development Bank (AfDB) launched its widely-expected Dollars 500m Eurobond issue, though the choice of a 30-year maturity surprised the market. The joint lead-manager, Goldman Sachs, said the issue was the AfDB's largest and longest public deal to date. The bonds were priced at 98.56 to yield 48 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 48 to 50 basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly, reflecting good investor demand for long-dated paper. Goldman Sachs reported widespread demand for the bonds, from south-east Asia to Europe. Mr Kofi Bucknor, the AfDB's treasurer, said that the longer-dated maturity suited the bank's funding requirements, since it was essentially a long-term lender. The 30-year life of the bonds reduced the bank's exposure to interest rate volatility and enabled the bank to lock into historically low interest rates, he said. Mr Bucknor added that the AfDB planned a Y40bn 'samurai' issue in the domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers by mid-April. A strong performance in the Tokyo stock market recently, and positive sentiment towards the Japanese railway sector in particular, prompted investors to snap up Keisei Electric Railway's Dollars 200m worth of four-year warrant bonds. The bonds were priced at par, but immediately jumped to 105 1/4 bid when they were freed to trade. An official at the lead-manager, Nomura, said that the rise in the price of the bonds reflected a lack of supply of this sort of instrument which is geared to the Japanese equity market. The Nikkei average closed at the year's high of 18,173.37 yesterday, up 205.07 on the day. BAT Capital Corp, the US financing arm of BAT Industries, raised Dollars 400m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds which were priced at 99.57 to yield 75 basis points over the comparable US Treasury. Lead-manager CSFB said that the spread tightened to 73 basis points shortly after the bonds were freed to trade. Mr Richard Desmond, BAT's group treasurer, said that yesterday's transaction was part of the company's strategy of issuing longer-term debt and retiring commercial paper. Mr Desmond added that the proceeds would be kept in dollars and that there was no interest-rate swap associated with the bonds. Elsewhere, HSBC Holdings raised Pounds 200m worth of subordinated Eurobonds due 2018, which the lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said was the largest long-dated subordinated issue to date in the Eurosterling sector. HSBC Holdings, which announced its 1992 results earlier this week, went ahead with its issue yesterday, encouraged by strong investor demand for high-yielding, long-dated paper and the UK government bond market's recovery from its initial nervous reaction to Tuesday's Budget. The bonds, which are callable in 2013, were priced at 98.692 to yield 150 basis points above the 9 per cent UK gilt due 2012. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly.</p>

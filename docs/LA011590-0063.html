			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTH CAROLINA;  </P> <P> FEMALE SOLDIER FILES INVASION COMPLAINT  </P> <P> A female Army intelligence analyst who is an expert on Panama filed a complaint  over being excluded from taking part in the U.S. invasion there, but she said  that her problem stems from "confused" policy rather than sexism.  </P> <P> "I think that it was not deliberate," Sgt. Rhonda Maskus, who is a member of  the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, N.C., said in an interview on CBS-TV's  "Face the Nation." She has filed the complaint with the Army's Office of  Inspector General. Maskus, a Spanish linguist, said she played a key role in  the contingency planning for Panama. About 600 of the 24,500 U.S. military  personnel who took part in the invasion were women.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD CITY MANAGER VOTED LUCRATIVE NEW PACT  </P> <P> The Inglewood City Council has granted veteran City Manager Paul Eckles a  3-year contract extension giving him a significant salary increase and an  improved severance pay package should his duties be diminished by council  ordinance or City Charter amendment.  </P> <P> Councilman Daniel Tabor cast the only opposing vote at Tuesday's council  meeting, saying the council should have negotiated with Eckles after he  submitted the contract proposal. If the contract were invoked today, it would  provide him with more than six months of severance pay and compensation for  unused sick leave.  </P> <P> The contract provisions and Tabor's dissent reflect political uncertainty at  Inglewood City Hall. An election for three council seats is scheduled this  year, and voting for a fourth is possible depending on the outcome of a court  fight. Also, Tabor recently called for the creation of council committees to  help manage the city and increase the power of a predominantly black council  over a largely white city administration.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, Tabor praised Eckles and insisted that there was no racial  factor in his vote against the contract.  </P> <P> A 2-hour executive session preceded the vote to extend the contract, which  makes Eckles one of the best-paid city administrators in the nation with an  estimated $122,400 in salary and benefits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Politically Astute  </P> <P> All four council members praised Eckles, 48, a politically astute administrator  credited with keeping the city's economy and services strong during years of  rapid racial and ethnic change. Voting for the new agreement were Mayor Edward  Vincent, Councilman Anthony Scardenzan and Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas. (The  fifth council seat is vacant because of the death of Councilwoman Ann Wilk last  month.)  </P> <P> Eckles said: "The average tenure of a city manager is four years. I have been  city manager 15 years. I think I'm a known quantity to the council and to the  community. I don't think there should be any surprises."  </P> <P> Council members said Eckles had earned an extension and improvement of his  contract, which was in its third and final year.  </P> <P> "I hope we can have you here for 15 more years," Vincent told Eckles, who came  to the city as an assistant city manager in 1973 and became manager in 1975.  "You have shown a true love for this city."  </P> <P> Eckles said he has "a real good feeling" about the coming years. He said his  top priorities are adding 20 police officers through a new police assessment  tax approved by voters in November, maintaining the city's sound financial  status and completing a program to recycle residential land blighted by airport  noise for commercial and industrial use.  </P> <P> Eckles earns a base salary of $106,432, officials said, with 15% in deferred  compensation bringing salary and benefits to an estimated $122,400. The city  also pays for his car. In 1984 the city lent Eckles $275,000 to buy a house,  and in 1985 council members changed the interest rate from 11% to a floating  rate tied to what the city earns on the money it invests in the California  Local Agency Investment Fund. Eckles' current loan rate is 7.9%, officials  said.  </P> <P> The new 3-year contract took effect Tuesday. It gives Eckles a 4.5% annual  cost-of-living increase effective each July. The other major change in the  contract is the improvement in the severance terms, which previously were fixed  at six months' pay. The new severance agreement grants Eckles a week's pay for  every six months he has worked for the city since he was hired in December,  1973.  </P> <P> The severance clause would take effect if the city violates the contract.  Eckles also may declare himself "terminated" and take the severance pay if he  feels that his duties are "materially diminished by charter amendment or  ordinance," the contract states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uncertain Future  </P> <P> Elections will be held in April for the council seats of Tabor, Scardenzan and  Wilk. Another election is possible if an appellate court upholds the 1987  annulment of Thomas' election. The possibility of four new council members  contributes to uncertainty about the future of Eckles and other administrators.  </P> <P> But Eckles said that although the severance provision is new, it is not  unusual. "I'm not really concerned with that aspect of the future," he said.  "We'll work with whoever is on the council."  </P> <P> Tabor said he has full confidence in Eckles. But he said Wednesday that the  council should have negotiated before giving Eckles a contract that "locks in a  3-year deal" regardless of the city's fiscal situation and does not establish  specific criteria for judging performance.  </P> <P> "The issue is not Paul Eckles," Tabor said. "The issue is that the council had  a chance to negotiate and make a counteroffer, and it didn't."  </P> <P> Other council members said at Tuesday's meeting that they had discussed the  contract and Eckles' performance sufficiently and were prepared to act on it.  </P> <P> Eckles said he does not object to a more formal evaluation, such as Tabor  requested.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protective Language  </P> <P> Tabor also criticized the contract language that protects Eckles from attempts  to reduce his power.  </P> <P> "Specifically, it provides that neither charter change or ordinance should  affect his job," Tabor said in a written statement. "In other words, neither  the vote of the people nor a vote of the City Council can change or alter his  situation. It . . . potentially makes it financially irresponsible to increase  the role and responsibility of the City Council, including the mayor."  </P> <P> Tabor, a self-described advocate of increasing community input into city  government, recently accused the council of acting as a rubber stamp for  administrators. He wants the city to consider increasing the power and pay of  council members by having them chair committees that oversee broad areas of  government operations such as economic development and public safety. The  committees would work directly with department heads.  </P> <P> Tabor said Wednesday that the contract raises an obstacle to such committees  and to other initiatives such as a charter amendment, defeated by voters in  1987, that would have given Inglewood a full-time mayor.  </P> <P> "Let's say the people vote to have committees," Tabor said. "Then he can  consider himself terminated and collect all those termination benefits."  </P> <P> Eckles said he is protecting himself because "no city manager wants to lock  himself into the position of being a highly paid figurehead."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smooth on Surface  </P> <P> Eckles, his two top deputies and the city attorney are white executives of a  city that is 55% black and 30% Latino and has a predominantly black City  Council. Despite the city's contentious politics, race relations are smooth on  the surface, and racial issues are almost never raised in public.  </P> <P> In saying Wednesday that race is not a factor in his opposition to Eckles'  contract, Tabor said: "If I was putting together a management team to run the  city, Paul Eckles would be a part of that team."  </P> <P> But Tabor did say that his predominantly black constituents feel that the  council has been a rubber stamp for city administrators and should do more to  assert itself.  </P> <P> Eckles said committees such as those suggested by Tabor are rarely used in  cities with 5-member councils. They are more common in cities with larger  councils, he said. But Eckles said "nothing stands in the way" of increasing  participation by council members, adding: "I'm amenable to however the council  would like to operate."  </P></p>

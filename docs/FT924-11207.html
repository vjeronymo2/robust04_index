			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Observer: Code barred Now might not be a good time to start reading Tolstoy, since there is only one day to go before the world ends. 'Jesus will come in the feast of trumpet' on October 28 1992 according to an advert in USA Today International, paid for by the COC Mission from South Korea. The Mission cites several biblical quotations as authority, notably the reference to the 'strengthening of the EC as economic giant' apparently to be found in Daniel chapter 2, verses 40-43. Turning to the King James' version, one finds no reference to Jacques Delors. Instead, the passage begins 'And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.' The verse is about as clear as an EC directive. Never mind nit-picking. You will want to know how to prepare for the end of the world. 'Make sure the grace of blood of the cross' says the Mission (grammar will presumably go out of fashion after Armageddon) and 'give up your fleshly life'. But most important, the Mission commands 'Do not receive the mark 666, bar code on the forehead or right hand]' Sounds tricky, but most of us might just about manage it.</p>

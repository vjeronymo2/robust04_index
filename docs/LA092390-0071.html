			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL FORECAST;  </P> <P> NEW HAMPSHIRE'S UNKNOWN JUDGE: HOW TO GAUGE A MAN OF FEW WORDS?;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT: JUSTICE SOUTER WILL BE A PRAGMATIST IN CONSERVATIVE CLOTHING.  </P> <P> If the nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme Court is confirmed by the  Senate, as seems likely, the New Hampshire judge would join the court sometime  after Oct. 1, when it begins its new term. What sort of justice will he be? The  Times posed that question to seven people representing a variety of backgrounds  and interest groups:  </P> <P> Tanya Melich,executive director, Republican Pro-Choice Political Action  Committee:  </P> <P> He will be a very pragmatic jurist. I could see him lining up with (Chief  Justice William H.) Rehnquist and (Justice Antonin) Scalia on some issues, and  with (Justice Thurgood) Marshall on others.  </P> <P> I think he is a man with great respect for fundamental rights, so a lot hinges  on what he thinks a fundamental right is. But he has not given those of us who  are pro-choice any more indication as to what he'll do than he has given to the  anti-choice people. He has tried to separate his personal positions from the  law, but the bottom line is that you can't separate them entirely. . . .  </P> <P> My impression is that Souter is very much a conservative in the old tradition  -- he is a libertarian. . . . But I am certainly much more comfortable with  this man than with (rejected nominee Robert) Bork.  </P> <P> Karima Wicks,research director, Capital Punishment Project, NAACP Legal Defense  Fund:  </P> <P> If he wasn't able to see that there is discrimination in his own state, then we  aren't sure that he would be sensitive to larger civil-rights questions. New  Hampshire isn't Howard Beach, and the minority population is small, but there  are problems there.  </P> <P> We really need more information about his views with regard to women and people  of color. His record on civil rights is an unfinished book.  </P> <P> We would also like to know more about his stand on the constitutionality of the  death penalty. Civil-rights leaders and human-rights activists need to pay  attention to what Souter says about the death penalty, because a lot of  politicians use the death penalty as a way of getting tough on crime without  looking at the social and economic causes of crime, like poverty.  </P> <P> Robert Morvillo,former chief of the Criminal Division, office of the U.S.  Attorney for the Southern District of New York, now in private practice as a  criminal defense attorney:  </P> <P> I think . . . you will continue to have a court that is moderately  pro-prosecution, and will not be expanding defendants' rights or personal  liberties significantly. That wing of the court will continue to attempt to cut  back on those rights, but I believe Souter will play a swing role.  </P> <P> I don't see him as a solid vote for the right wing of the court, but he is more  conservative than liberal. I think he will pay more attention to precedent, and  to analyzing issues in a pure legal fashion than with regard to ideological  biases. He doesn't have an agenda.  </P> <P> Thomas B. Stoddard,executive director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education  Fund, the nation's largest gay-rights organization:  </P> <P> It is easiest to evaluate David Souter by considering what he will not be. He  will not be an ideologue. His views tend toward the pragmatic rather than the  theoretical.  </P> <P> He will not be a loner. However eccentric his personal habits may be, his  professional instincts are largely conventional, even conformist.  </P> <P> He will not be a leader on the court. While obviously very bright, he possesses  neither the intellectual acumen of a Felix Frankfurter nor the political  dexterity -- for even the Supreme Court of the United States runs on political  steam -- of a Brennan.  </P> <P> And, of course, he will not be a liberal. Although he did say some things on  the final day of his congressional testimony that surprised conservatives, his  career to  </P> <P> date evidences a distinctly conservative frame of mind, especially in the realm  of criminal justice. What, then, will he be? David Souter will be a bland, but  thoughtful associate justice inclined to follow the lead of the court's  conservative majority. Like Sandra Day O'Connor, he will strike out on his own  on occasion, but these forays will be rare in number and limited in scope.  </P> <P> Paul Bschorr, attorney and chairman of the litigation section, American Bar  Assn. (which recently gave Souter its "most qualified" rating):  </P> <P> I think there are going to be some surprises on both sides. I think he's going  to be much more in the middle. I think one of the really interesting questions  is if he's going to be a leader on the court, in the way, say, (Justice William  J.) Brennan (Jr.) was. (Souter) is on the quiet side, and that may indicate  that it is unlikely he will be a leader. But there are people who know him  personally that say he is a very engaging human being, on a personal,  one-to-one basis. And that is how he'll be dealing with the rest of the  justices on the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Phyllis N. Segal,president, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund:  </P> <P> He will be a consistently regressive justice on virtually every issue of  importance to women.  </P> <P> I predict Justice Souter will cast a decisive vote to unravel Roe vs. Wade's  formulation of reproductive choice as a fundamental right protected by the  Constitution.  </P> <P> He will side with the employer whose "protective" regulations cost women their  jobs. He will approve relief to victims of discrimination only in the most  blatant cases and only with the narrowest remedies. And he will side with the  state, upholding prosecution of pregnant women for substance dependency.  </P> <P> His opinions in all contexts will look to so-called "traditional American  values," rather than to contemporary values, for their foundation -- "mom and  apple pie" rather than equality for women.  </P> <P> The only open question is precisely where on the right-wing ideological  spectrum Justice Souter will land.  </P> <P> Michael H. Cardozo IV,attorney, law professor and descendant of Justice  Benjamin Cardozo:  </P> <P> The fact that (both Benjamin Cardozo and Judge Souter) were unmarried -- that's  what people are talking about. Justice Cardozo lived with his sister Ellen  until right before he went to the Supreme Court, at age 61 or 62. He was very  conscious of the needs and interests of women. It is quite possible that  Souter's closeness to his mother is like Cardozo's closeness to his sisters.  Some might say Cardozo hadn't much experience because he had no children of his  own, but he had a lot of contact with relatives' children. He wasn't removed  from life just because he didn't have a wife and children. You can't really say  that people who haven't married and have no children therefore have no  experience with life.  </P> <P> There are differences, of course. Souter is a somewhat athletic person -- I  believe he climbs mountains and things. The most exercise Justice Cardozo ever  got was to walk from his office across the street for lunch.  </P></p>

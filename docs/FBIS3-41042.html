			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Vasylyuk: "Moscow Statement Is a Compromise" </F> -- first paragraph is KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction published in  boldface]    [Text] Last weeks' equivocal events in the life of  Ukraine's foreign policy have elicited many doubts,  controversies, and hopes. It is hard to comprehend all the  subtleties of politics and understand the official position of  Kiev regarding these events without comments by a government  official or diplomat. This fact prompted a meeting between  Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and journalists. The  conversation went beyond the protocol, and therefore, responding  to numerous questions, Mr. Tarasyuk briefed us about:  <H3>  ...The Meeting Between the Ukrainian and Kazakhstani  Presidents </H3>   Unfortunately, due to the intensity of the latest events,  the  first official visit to Ukraine by Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev went almost unnoticed. This was a very  important event, since the visit become the first step toward  rapprochement of both presidents' positions on cooperation  between Ukraine and Kazakhstan in the framework of the CIS and  beyond this structure. It is not a secret that Leonid Kravchuk  and Nursultan Nazarbayev had differing viewpoints on an economic  union among former USSR republics and the CIS in general. After  the visit, the emphasis will apparently be placed on bilateral  relations.    It is hard not to appreciate future cooperation between  Ukraine, one of the key countries in Central-Eastern Europe, and  Kazakhstan, a leading state in Central Eurasia.    Borys Tarasyuk emphasized that this visit initiated a new  stage in Ukrainian-Kazakhstani relations. The presidents signed  a new interstate agreement. A declaration signed by the two  presidents became a milestone for bilateral relations between  our countries. The declaration emphasizes, in particular, the  necessity of establishing a universal interregional security  system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok," which would include all  countries without exception, as well as preventing the  establishment of new blocs on the territory of new independent  states which have ended up in a "security vacuum."    The presidents reached an agreement as to concrete fields of  cooperation such as, for example, space exploration. Although  Ukraine's contribution to the development of space exploration  amounted to 40 percent of the total share during the USSR era,  the country does not have capabilities of using such a great  potential. Kazakhstan possesses testing ranges and launching  facilities.  <H3>  ...The Tripartite Statement [as published] by the Ukrainian,  U.S., and Russian Presidents Signed in Moscow on 14 January </H3>   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine is convinced that  the signing of the statement conforms to the vital interests of  Ukraine. Regarding the compensation for nuclear weapons, the  statement envisions such compensation for Kazakhstan, Belarus,  and Ukraine in exchange for highly enriched uranium from nuclear  warheads.    The statement is not an international agreement and it must  be ratified by the legislatures of the three countries.  Although it is important to know what is the attitude of the  Ukrainian legislature toward the statement, this document acts  as a response to the reservations expressed by the Ukrainian  legislature toward the signing of the agreement on nuclear  weapons. The Moscow statement was signed by the presidents of  three states, and this fact put it beyond the framework of a  political statement, said Mr. Tarasyuk. It provides for concrete  actions. Each one of the three states made certain concessions.  This is a compromise among the three presidents. Ukraine  obtained a response to the question concerning security  guarantees, material and technical assistance in disarmament,  and compensation. The participants in the negotiations reached  an accord that, in case Ukraine signs documents on nuclear  weapons, a multilateral document will be signed -- Great Britain  also is willing to sign such a document.    What is the deadline for dismantling nuclear weapons  deployed  in Ukraine? This is a technical condition of nuclear warheads.  The predetermined shelf life of many nuclear warheads will  expire as early as this year, and next year this process will  have an avalanche effect.  <H5>  ...The Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet </H5>   Asked by journalists whether the complex economic situation  will lead to a partition of Ukraine into separate territories,  particularly with regard to the Crimea, Borys Tarasyuk replied  that the international community, including Russia, recognized  Ukraine as an independent state with defined borders in 1991.  The UN Security Council recognized as groundless the 9 July  statement issued by the Russian legislature on the status of  Sevastopol. The tripartite statement signed by the Ukrainian,  U.S., and Russian presidents says that the United States and  Russia respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and existing  borders.    Speaking about the prospects for the withdrawal of the  Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet from Ukraine, the Ukrainian  Deputy Foreign Minister stated that the Black Sea Fleet, de  jure, remains under the authority of the Ukrainian and Russian  presidents. The political atmosphere between our countries has  improved, following the Moscow summit. There are certain  grounds to expect that the Black Sea Fleet issue will be  resolved already this year.    Certain political leaders of the Crimea, noted Mr. Tarasyuk,  were looking for Russia's support. Nevertheless, we do not have  any evidence to claim that Russia's Government rendered any help  to political forces in the Crimea.    The issue of leasing by Russia certain onshore facilities  located on Ukrainian territory still remains on the agenda.  However, this does not concern the city of Sevastopol but only  several facilities.  <H3>  ...The Nonbloc Status Proclaimed by Ukraine and Perspectives  for Cooperation With NATO </H3>   Ukraine announced its nonbloc status in the 1990 declaration  on state sovereignty. Since then, the geopolitical situation  has changed. Although the Warsaw Pact does not exist, there  still is NATO, and new military-political alliances have  appeared on Asian territories. Given these circumstances,  Ukraine could end up between two military blocs. Today, we  remain in the so-called "security vacuum." Cooperation with  NATO, CSCE, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, does not  contradict our main goals.    The authors of the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace"  believe that such cooperation does not mean membership in NATO  but rather bilateral cooperation. Security guarantees,  essential for every country, should include our own armed  forces, cooperation with neighboring states, and participation  in international security systems or military-political  organizations.    Providing these explanations, Borys Tarasyuk recalled  consultations with government experts from all East and Central  European countries conducted at a meeting devoted to  establishing a security system, which was held in Pushcha-Ozerna  in the vicinity of Kiev. The experts met to find ways of  implementing Leonid Kravchuk's initiative for establishing a  stability zone in Central-Eastern Europe and the U.S. initiative  "Partnership for Peace." The main goal of the consultations was  the rapprochement of positions, searching for compromises and  common approaches to security issues. There will be another  round of such consultations, which are eventually aimed at  signing a multilateral agreement on the security system in  Central and Eastern Europe. In the best case, noted Borys  Tarasyuk, such an agreement should be signed already this year.</p>

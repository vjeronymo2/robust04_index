			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. LEADS JAPAN ON GENETIC DRUGS  </P> <P> The United States is leading Japan in the worldwide race to bring new  genetically engineered drugs into the marketplace, the Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers Assn. said today.  </P> <P> But America could lose its edge if the government refuses to hire more  reviewers at the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Patent Office, or if  Congress fails to vote a pay raise for government scientists, the association  added.  </P> <P> "Five years ago there were predictions that Japan would overtake us in  biotechnology by the end of the decade. That has not happened," PMA President  Gerald Mossinghoff said.  </P> <P> But "we cannot get medicines to doctors and patients as quickly as good science  permits -- let alone remain competitive with industries in other countries --  unless we deal with the widening gap between pay in government and the private  sector for critical review positions, both in FDA and the Patent Office," he  said.  </P></p>

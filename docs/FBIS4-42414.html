			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veselin Stoykov: "Understanding, Cooperation </F> Needs Language of Truth"]    [Text] Thessaloniki, May 25 (BTA) -- Understanding and  cooperation in the Balkans need the language of truth... We  oppose the export of internal problems of separate countries,  Greek Minister of Macedonia and Thrace Dr. Konstandinos  Triaridhis told Bulgarian journalists in Thessaloniki on May 24.  He stressed the need for the promotion of Bulgarian-Greek  economic cooperation, including the establishment of new  transport links. The meeting coincided with the visit by  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov in Athens.    Dr. Triaridhis said the ministry in his charge implemented  the policy of the Greek Government. He elaborated on Greek  views on development in the Balkans. According to him, all  countries in the regions, including Greece, have their share of  problems. Greece is a member of the European Union whereas  other Balkan states, including Bulgaria, would like to join in,  and integrate into European structures. Greece would like to  help those countries, from which it would benefit itself.  Hopefully, these Balkan states will have made progress in some  ten years, including Albania and Skopje, said the Greek  minister. Greece is trying to help cope with difficulties, he  said.    He said Greece is glad about meetings such as that with  Minister Daskalov. But it also would like to see livelier  contacts among non-governmental bodies, among journalists,  business and ordinary people. He cited recent meetings in Varna  and Khaskovo. According to Triaridhis, the strengthening of  economic cooperation in the Balkans and especially between  Bulgaria and Greece can benefit integration between the Middle  East and Central Europe.    Dr. Triaridhis elaborated on the Greek stand on Skopje. He  said that if Skopje leaders show willingness for dialogue in the  Balkans, Greece was ready to lift the embargo today, not  tomorrow, but Greece could not tolerate manifestations of  fanaticism in Skopje. According to him, these manifestations can  create problems for Blagoevgrad and Sofia, and involve Greece  and Albania, too. Greece opposed a time bomb that might explode  in some five years. The Skopje problem is a problem for the  Balkans, said Triaridhis. According to him, it is a paradox that  Bulgaria, which is in the same situation as Greece, supports the  name of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia].    The Greek minister stressed that the war in Bosnia should  end  as soon as possible. Involvement by Turkey, Albania and others  would only aggravate it. He also commented on the long-lasting  embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) which has severely hit Greece and Bulgaria.  According to him, it is very bad that Balkan countries let  foreigners manage the situation is the Balkans.    The Greek minister focused on major guidelines for the  development of Macedonia and Thrace, that concern not only  Greece but can have a positive impact in other Balkan countries,  especially Bulgaria and Albania. According to him, this is of  interest to the Bulgarian Government. Dr Triaridhis said there  were no minorities in Macedonia and Thrace but religious  communities that have all the rights and obligations of Greek  citizens.</p>

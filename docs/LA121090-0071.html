			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RICHMOND;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS CHIEF OUSTED BY BOARD  </P> <P> The Richmond school board has ousted Supt. Walter Marks amid concern that he  was jeopardizing the district's chances of getting a second emergency bailout  loan from the state.  </P> <P> The district could run out of money by next February, one state legislator  said. The district, which faces an estimated $25-million shortfall for next  year, received a $9-million loan from the state earlier this year and is forced  to ask for an additional $25 million. "The consensus of opinion was that if we  were going to have a good shot of seeing this loan, Marks would have to go,"  said Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond), who called the district "the  worst example of a public agency not being run well."  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: China leaps towards top 10 traders / A look at the pressures accompanying rapid export growth CHINA this year is expected to enter the 'top 10' of the world's trading nations, leapfrogging Taiwan and South Korea in the process. But China's extraordinary export growth is also bringing increased pressures for liberalisation and improved access to its markets. Sensitive to these pressures, emanating mainly from the US, whose trade deficit with China in 1992 reached Dollars 18bn, Chinese officials have promised to quicken the pace of reform. One of China's main aims is to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as soon as practicable, perhaps this year. The Chinese see early Gatt membership as one way of dealing with bilateral pressures from its main trading partners - the US, Japan and Germany - all of which are restive about their yawning trade gaps with China. China's powerful Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade will be monitoring trade signals from the new Clinton administration, expected to be less tolerant of the imbalance than its predecessor. Congress has also signalled a growing restiveness on the China trade issue. An early indication of the state of China-US trade relations is likely to come in the next few weeks when officials of the office of the Special Trade Representative - the first high-level Clinton team to come to Beijing - sit down to discuss Gatt-related issues. The US officials are certain to press their Chinese counterparts to speed liberalisation in line with the US-China market agreement reached last October. Under this, Beijing agreed over the next few years to remove about 75 per cent of its non-tariff barriers on a global Most Favoured Nation (MFN) basis. US trade representatives are also reporting that China is making a special effort to discuss new projects. After the lull that followed the 1989 Tiananmen episode, American businessmen have been returning to China with 'zest', according to a US official. But the larger deals in the petrochemical, power and transport sectors will take time to bring to fruition. In the meantime, the Chinese continue rapidly to expand and improve the range and the quality of their exports. Progress made by China in the past decade is impressive. A decade ago, China ranked 20th as a world trader. Then exports of Dollars 18bn represented 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and less than 1 per cent of world trade. Projected exports this year of Dollars 100bn would represent 20 per cent of China's GDP and more than 2.5 per cent of world trade. The growing sophistication of Chinese products is also reflected in the shift towards exports of manufactured items from 50 per cent in 1980 to 80 per cent last year. While China's success owes much to cheap labour costs - textiles and footwear accounted for one third of 1992's Dollars 85bn in exports - exports of machinery, electronic products and transport equipment are the fastest growing areas. High foreign investment in capital intensive areas spawned an increase of about 86 per cent in exports of machinery and transport equipment in the first nine months of 1992, compared with 1991. Trade in these items accounted for 16 per cent of exports last year, compared with just 6 per cent in 1988. The contribution to China's booming trade in 1992 of Special Economic Zones and coastal cities opened to foreign investment was also notable. Industrial output in these areas increased by 72 per cent in the first half of 1992 compared with 1991, and the bulk of this was directed towards exports. In their difficult discussions with representatives of their main trading partners, Chinese officials are certain to point out that in spite of China's export boom, the country is also coping with a surge in imports. Imports are expected to grow by 19 per cent this year to Dollars 96bn, compared with projected growth in exports of 16 per cent to around Dollars 98.5bn. Western trade officials say the Chinese are becoming more concerned about their shrinking trade surplus, down to Dollars 4.4bn last year, and its impact on the country's reserves. Curbing import growth is certain to be linked to problems associated with an overheating economy, which registered 12 per cent growth last year, and a risk of inflation. However, curbs on imports would run counter to Chinese undertakings to further liberalise its trade regime in preparation for its re-entry to Gatt.</p>

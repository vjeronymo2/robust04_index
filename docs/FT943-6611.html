			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A fistful of fresh memories - Cooker / Parsley, sage, rosemary and basil, Philippa Davenport looks at the best ways to buy herbs Herbs now play a greater part in our diet than ever before. Yet, can anyone name a fishmonger who still has the (once-common) courtesy of slipping a bunch of parsley and a lemon into your shopping basket along with your purchase? In neighbourhoods with Greek, Italian, Indian or Iranian populations, there are greengrocers who sell - at modest prices - huge handfuls of the herbs essential to their native cuisines. If you are lucky, the herbs may even come with their roots attached to help prolong their freshness. That is the way I used to buy basil in markets in Italy, a country where you might still receive this king of herbs as a gift if you are a regular customer or a pretty young woman, or if you have bought enough tomatoes on the vine or other produce from the stall-holder to earn his approval. In Britain, if you have neither a friendly greengrocer to turn to, nor a garden in which to grow herbs, the chances are that you buy fresh herbs from a supermarket. Certainly, you are grateful for the variety available all year round. But it irks to be asked to pay about 50p for 20g or less (maximum two-thirds of an ounce) of something that grows as fast and furiously as a weed. There is something faintly mean-spirited about the small quantities in which these crushproof-packed cut herbs are sold. I suppose the smallness of the packs is, at least partly, because of the speed with which cut herbs wilt even when crushproof packed. Coriander, in particular, has a nasty habit of beginning to blacken and rot within a day or two of purchase, especially if damp when packed. To overcome this, some chain stores now offer fresh herbs loose in crush-proof packs or complete with their own gardens (in other words, rooted in punnets or pots, just like mustard and cress) for shoppers who do not plan to use them immediately. Herbs that are growing stay fresh longer - and they will continue to grow. The proviso is that you take only a little snip here and there every now and then. Frail plantlets such as these are massacred easily. Cut them back hard in a sudden, greedy urge to make bowls of pesto and they are liable to curl up their toes and die. Long gone are the days when sage, parsley and bay were all that the average English cook would contemplate using. Now, the more exotic the herb, the better it sells. Basil was hot favourite until recently but rocket and coriander have overtaken it, their popularity about to reach kiwifruit proportions. Lemon grass from Thailand seems easier to find than British lemon-sour sorrel. And I have yet to see lemon thyme (so much more aromatic than common thyme) or lemon-scented geranium leaves on sale. Other noticeable absentees from the market-place are lovage, with its lemon, celery and curry notes; and fennel, the feathery fronds of which make it the most pleasing of aniseed-fragrant herbs. My hopes were raised by a preview list from Daregal*, a French company which is launching its herbs in the UK. Oregano, chervil, sorrel, lovage and lemon thyme were all mentioned. Alas, it turned out that the first two varieties were available only to caterers while the others were not coming to Britain at all. At some branches of Waitrose, Safeway and Sainsbury, however, home cooks should find coriander, basil, flat-leaf parsley and half a dozen other Daregal herbs. They are frozen, not fresh, but well done for all that: chopped roughly, filmed with oil and fast-frozen for a free-flowing end product. Retailing at about 89p for a 50g pack, they are priced competitively against fresh produce. Nothing can match the zip of good fresh herbs straight from the garden and the fact that these frozen herbs are chopped does perforce limits their uses. But they strike me as a far better back-up for fresh herbs than dried ones at times when the fresh variety is not to hand. But the shake-and-use packaging needs a rethink: it is too flimsy to open and close neatly on successive occasions without spilling some of the contents. These herbs can be - indeed, should be - used straight from the freezer as they defrost almost instantly on contact with food, whether hot or cold. Do not leave the packet hanging around in the kitchen while you cook - if defrosted and re-frozen, the contents will become mush. For the same reason, you need a cool bag and freezer sachets to protect frozen herbs when bringing them home from shopping. FRESH CORIANDER CHUTNEY (serves four-six) Here is a recipe that makes lavish use of this popular herb: a sharp, refreshing relish to serve in small dabs (like mustard with sausages) or to use as a dip for samosas. Although best when made freshly, this chutney will keep covered in the fridge for one or two days. It comes from the new, revised edition of Madhur Jaffrey's Illustrated Indian Cookery, to be published by BBC Books at the end of September. Ingredients: 3oz fresh green coriander (the top leafy parts only) coarsely chopped;  1/2 -1 fresh, hot green chilli, coarsely chopped; 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/2 teaspoon toasted and ground cumin seeds; freshly ground black pepper. Method: Combine all the ingredients in the container of an electric blender. Blend, stopping the machine several times to push the ingredients down with a spatula, until you have a paste. Transfer to a small glass or other non-metallic bowl. * Daregal is imported by Frigifrance, tel: 44590 23737; fax: 44590 23757.</p>

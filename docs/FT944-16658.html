			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BOC/ Hewlett deal BOC, the chemicals company, and Hewlett Packard, the US electronics group, will today announce the establishment of a network of alliances around the world to sell anaesthetics and the associated monitoring equipment. The arrangement involves no cash changing hands but is likely to lead to some job cuts as the two companies 'streamline' their sales and service organisations. BOC said that neither it nor HP would forecast the sales revenue that would flow through the new sales organisations but that they it expected to increase their 'access to the Dollars 1bn a year global anaesthesia equipment market'. Ohmeda, BOC's healthcare business, based in New Jersey, had 1993 revenue of Dollars 880m. HP's medical products group, in Massachusetts, had sales last year of Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

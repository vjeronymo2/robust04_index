			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- A group of Japanese  agricultural experts will visit Washington State from Sunday to  assess the U.S. quarantine system for prevention of fire blight  on apples, Farm Ministry officials said Tuesday [12 April].    The dispatch of the team by the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries stems from a Japan-U.S. row on the  lifting of an import ban on U.S. apples by Japan.    The United States has agreed to Japan's demands for biannual  on- site inspections for disease by Japanese experts.    Subject to the inspections, the import ban on U.S. apples is  expected to be lifted around October at the earliest, the  officials said.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Party heads 'aware of financing' Two former Christian Democrat prime ministers of Italy knew about the party's large-scale illicit financing, a Milan court heard yesterday. Mr Severino Citaristi, party treasurer from 1986 until March this year, made the accusations against Mr Ciriaco De Mita and Mr Arnaldo Forlani. It is the first time in a court that a Christian Democrat party leader - a post at times also occupied by both men - has been said to have had direct knowledge of illicit financing. Mr Citaristi has received 64 separate notices of investigation from 12 different sets of magistrates for corruption and illicit financing. He has not denied the charges but refused to accept political responsibility. Yesterday he gave evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a consultant close to the Socialist party who is alleged to have handled part of the L150bn (Pounds 60m) bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to arrange the reorganisation of the petrochemicals industry - the so-called Enimont affair. Mr Citaristi said his party needed up to L65bn in a normal year and L90bn in an election year, of which half came illicitly. He said De Mita, then party leader, told him to contact Mr Raul Gardini, then head of Ferruzzi-Montedison, to obtain a contribution. Mr Gardini handed over L2bn. Between 1988 and 1992 a further L7bn was paid.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. To fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in providing narrowband PCS; we propose to reserve up to four MTA frequency blocks_19, 21, 22 and 24_, and both BTA frequency blocks_25 and 26_for bidding exclusively by entities with annual gross revenues of less than $125 million and total assets of less than $500 million (``entrepreneurs' blocks''). We believe that excluding large companies from bidding in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks, and limiting the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these blocks, would significantly enhance opportunities for smaller entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure that narrowband PCS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide variety of applicants,'' as required by Section 309(j)(3)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. We recognize, however, that reserving blocks for bidding only by relatively small companies may not, by itself, be sufficient to ensure that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the opportunity to obtain narrowband PCS licenses. Businesses owned by members of minority groups and women face discrimination that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we propose a number of related steps to assist small businesses and businesses owned by woman and/or minorities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a narrowband PCS license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. First, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we propose to make bidding credits available to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' blocks. More specifically, we propose to provide small businesses with a 10 percent bidding credit. Businesses owned by minorities and women would receive a 15 percent bidding credit to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  The credits would be cumulative, so that a business owned by minorities or women that also qualified as a small business would receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Second, we propose to allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs' block to pay for their licenses in installments and to ``enhance'' those installment payments for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women by varying the moratorium on principal and the interest rate. Third, we propose to continue to extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in the provision of narrowband PCS. Fourth, we propose to reduce the upfront payment for all eligible bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks from $0.02 per MHz per pop to $0.015 per MHz per pop. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although this bidding credit would be less than the bidding credit available for selected nationwide and regional licenses (25 percent and 40 percent respectively), the 15 percent bidding credit would be available within the entrepreneurs' block rather than in a block where all companies could participate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Finally, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses as regional licenses organized in the same configuration set forth in Section 24.102 of the rules. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes such as designating these BTA licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing combinatorial bidding for the designated regions. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid for entrepreneurs' block licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The following chart highlights the major provisions proposed for businesses bidding in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This table is not comprehensive and therefore it does not present all the provisions established for designated entities, especially those available outside the entrepreneurs' blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

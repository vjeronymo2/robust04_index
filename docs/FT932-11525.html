			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Claim on wages attacked: Government accused of exaggerating savings to German businesses BRITISH government advertisements in the German press aimed at enticing businesses to move to Britain exaggerate the savings in labour costs, says a study published today by the independent research group Incomes Data Services. A recent advertisement in Handelsblatt, the German business daily, said that in Britain 'wages and social charges are significantly lower . . . the labour costs index for Britain is 100 compared to 178 for Germany'. The advertisement invited companies to 'find out more about how your firm can profit from making Great Britain your place of business' by contacting the British consulate in Dusseldorf. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has in recent months been promoting Britain's attractions to foreign investors. In particular he applauded a controversial plan by Hoover to move vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in France to Cambuslang near Glasgow. The plan enraged the French authorities and is being re-examined by Hoover as part of a cost-cutting programme. IDS said the British government's claim in the German advertisement might 'fuel concern in other European countries about social dumping - the idea that businesses will move to low-cost countries and thereby depress wages and conditions of employment throughout the Community'. IDS's study of official figures on comparative European manufacturing labour costs indicates that German costs were likely to be about 33 per cent higher than in Britain, rather than 78 per cent. There were wide variations depending on the sector and size of company. Britain had low costs in aerospace while labour costs were closer to those of other European countries for vehicle production in companies of more than 1,000 employees, IDS said. The figures also showed that Britain's main cost advantages in the EC came from relatively low national insurance and pension contributions. In 1988, however, when the last full EC comparative survey was carried out, nearly half of British occupational pension schemes were taking a total or partial contribution holiday. Taking this into account could add 4 per cent to 5 per cent to the underlying non-wage costs in Britain, IDS said. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, told the French employers federation in Paris that the 'real danger facing Europe is not one in which jobs move within the Community, but one in which they are increasingly moving out of the Community altogether'. She warned against the introduction of 'extra layers of social protection'. IDS Focus 67, Social Dumping. IDS, 193 St John St, London EC1V 4LS. By subscription.</p>

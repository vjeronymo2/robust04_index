The topic  of the telephone conference was their readiness for elections of  regional authorities and local government bodies.    Ryabov pointed out that the sum was not sufficient, and that  additional sums will be allocated after a federal budget for  1994 is adopted. On the whole, he continued, the Central  Electoral Commission is not financing now elections in the  republics. However, a draft document is expected to be signed by  the president on the additional financing of the electoral  campaign in some republics at their request. This refers  primarily to Ingushetia.    Ryabov urged the authorities in the subjects of the  federation to pay special attention to ensuring the legality of  the electoral campaign. The first experience of holding  elections in some regions was "not quite positive", as he put  it. It depends on the local authorities, in the first place, to  make the elections free and democratic. He said that the  elections had not taken place in some subjects of the federation  because of a low activity of electors. In some areas only 25 per  cent of them came to the polling stations.    The right to take part in elections in accordance with party  lists has not been put into effect in any of the regions. This,  in the opinion of Ryabov, "is not promoting the consolidation of  a multi-party system." He said that representatives of the  Central Electoral Commission had visited a number of subjects of  the federation in order to help organise the electoral campaign,  and were going to visit more. According to Ryabov, some  deviations from the legislation were observed, including those  connected with the wrong division into constituencies.    He believes it is necessary to enhance the role of the  executive authorities in organising the electoral campaign.  They should explain that the new representative authorities,  formed in accordance with the new Constitution, would be able to  resolve many problems of everyday life of the population. In  his opinion, "the level of activity of the population at the  elections corresponds directly to the level of prestige of the  authorities."    Speaking about electons to the local government bodies,  Ryabov said that numerous proposals were coming to the Central  Electoral Commission on postponing the elections till autumn.  The commission believes that it would be reasonable. However,  it would hardly be worthwhile to postpone elections in the  areas, where there are only several days left before the  elections and where both the authorities and the population are  getting prepared for them in a normal way.</p>

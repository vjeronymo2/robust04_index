			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Police are looking for vandals who damaged the windows of at least 26 vehicles  parked on streets in Ocean Beach and Loma Portal.  </P> <P> "It just looks like someone hanging out the window and shooting cars as they go  by," police detective Jim Yeatts said.  </P> <P> The vandals apparently used a pellet gun, a BB gun or a slingshot, police  spokesman Bill Robinson said. The windows were cracked but not smashed through.  </P> <P> Police said they believed the shootings occurred sometime between 10 p.m.  Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Seven of the cars were parked along Palermo Drive in Ocean Beach; the others  were parked throughout Ocean Beach and Loma Portal, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "There are probably twice those (number of) cars that didn't report the  vandalism," he said.  </P> <P> Police ask that anyone with information call the department at 236-6093.  </P></p>

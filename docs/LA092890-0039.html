			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC &amp; DANCE  </P> <P> KGB Loses Nights at the Opera: The KGB may lose its prime seats at Moscow's  Bolshoi Theater, a new blow to the prestige of the security agency now under  attack as a relic of the authoritarian past. The theater's management has  demanded closing of a "special zone" set aside for top Soviet officials and  controlled by the KGB, the youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said Thursday. The  Bolshoi's director told the newspaper removing the government boxes -- the  former czar's loge in the center and two to one side -- would make way for 60  additional seats.

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IDEA OF PRIVATIZING U.S. AIRPORTS IS TAKING OFF;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: A GROUP OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY LEADERS MEET NEAR LAX TO  DISCUSS THIS METHOD OF RAISING REVENUE.  </P> <P> Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young suggested a few years ago that the city  consider selling its busy international airport to Japanese companies eager to  invest in the Southern metropolis. Many of his constituents thought that he was  joking, and nothing has come of the idea.  </P> <P> But airport privatization was no joking matter Friday among a group of airport  and other public officials, airline executives, lawyers and investment bankers  who met to discuss the growing interest around the country in turning airport  operations over to private businesses.  </P> <P> The idea of some form of privatization is gaining credence in part because of  the gridlock at the nation's airports and the slow pace of publicly financed  efforts to increase capacity, according to participants in the seminar  sponsored by the Santa Monica-based Reason Foundation. Proponents, who argue  that private business would make airports more efficient, are also increasingly  getting a hearing from local governments frustrated by their inability to  recover the huge investments they have put into airports.  </P> <P> Privatization would provide funds to build new and different kinds of airports  and might make it easier for new airlines to get landing slots, thus increasing  competition for passengers, proponents said.  </P> <P> The seminar was held within clear sight and sound of Los Angeles International  Airport, where officials quietly started studying privatization about eight  years ago. In considering privatization, officials are trying to "correct what  we see as an inequity in the way the national air transportation system is  operated and managed," said LAX director Clifton Moore.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has a tremendous investment in the airport, he said. "Nevertheless,  the city has never received 5 cents' return on the work and investments it has  made," he said, explaining that the city is prohibited from taking any airport  revenue into its general treasury.  </P> <P> The city could sell or lease all or part of the airport, he said. One advantage  would be that at least part of the airport premises would become part of the  city's tax base.  </P> <P> The United Kingdom cashed in on investments in its airports in 1987 when it  raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares in British Airport Authorities. The  company, which operates London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports as  well as four in Scotland, now has a $4-billion market capitalization, Roger  Kitley, international director of BAA, said at the seminar.  </P> <P> "We have no doubt that BAA's experience has been a positive one," Kitley said.  The company has been consistently profitable, making $350 million in 1989, he  added.  </P> <P> The company's income per employee has increased 10% since privatization, he  said, and it is expanding its operations, including entering into a joint  venture with British Rail to build a high-speed rail link from central London  to Heathrow.  </P> <P> Although increases in the fees the company charges airlines are limited by  regulation, Kitley said, its income from commercial activities at the airports,  such as duty-free shops, has increased rapidly.  </P> <P> Proponents of privatization in the United States, including Reason Foundation  President Robert W. Poole Jr., said privately owned airports could be operated  and regulated as investor-owned utilities are today.  </P> <P> He said privatization is a broad term not limited to the sale of facilities.  The most common form of privatization is the granting of a long-term operating  lease to a private company. Burbank airport is owned by Burbank, Glendale and  Pasadena but has been operated under contract since 1978 by Lockheed Air  Terminal.  </P> <P> Ironically, Lockheed Air Terminal, a division of Lockheed Corp., was formed 60  years ago to build the airport in Burbank, said President ViggoButler. The  company pioneered privatization of airports, he said, and, "I'm here to bring  it back."  </P></p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Brussels turns its thoughts to the deprived: Alan Pike looks at 'symbolic' moves by the EC in an area traditionally looked after by member states MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has embarked on a bid to double the level of expenditure on the EC's main programme for supporting poor and deprived citizens. Official estimates compiled before the recession put the number of people in poverty in the EC - defined as those with access to less than half their national average income - at 50m. Unofficial estimates suggest the current figure could be as high as 70m. So even if member states agree to spend Ecu110m (Dollars 132m) on a new five-year anti-poverty programme, it will still be only a drop in the ocean. The move, however, signals a cautious but determined raising of the stakes in an attempt to involve the EC in the social stability of Europe's marginalised citizens. At the turn of the year, the Commission produced 'Towards a Europe of Solidarity', a document proposing ways of 'intensifying the fight against social exclusion and fostering integration.' This acknowledged that the Community could not assume member states' responsibilities for attacking social exclusion - the EC's favoured umbrella term for combined effects of material and social deprivation. But it envisaged an EC role in transferring know-how and developing concerted initiatives at European level. The Commission's agenda, even in such carefully stated terms, still raised the UK government's suspicions. A Department of Social Security memorandum commenting on the report says that it 'could be taken to imply that there should be an EC strategy to deal with social exclusion.' The British government, says the memorandum, 'believes strongly on subsidiarity grounds that the appropriate level of response to social exclusion is that of the member state.' While the Commission document did not explicitly breach the subsidiary principle 'any practical proposals which flow from it will require close examination.' The practical proposals began flowing at a conference in Copenhagen this month when Mr Delors, in addition to saying he would seek a doubling of funds for local-level anti-poverty programmes supported by the EC, came up with ideas for solemn declarations against poverty and a 'passport' setting out the rights and services to which Europe's disadvantaged citizens should be entitled. While the ideas are largely symbolic, they will add to critics' worries  - and supporters' hopes - that Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, are indeed trying to build an EC strategy on social exclusion. Although the EC has supported small-scale anti-poverty initiatives for more than 10 years, its main ventures into social policy have from the earliest days been directed at people in employment. Mr Flynn will, in this tradition, publish a green paper proposing new human resources and training initiatives shortly. But he acknowledges the concerns of anti-poverty campaigners that, if the focus of EC social funding is always on those in employment or facing redundancy, the needs of the long-term unemployed poor will become ever more distant from community thinking. If finding an acceptable basis for even advancing discussion of poverty issues at EC level is difficult, the problems themselves are daunting. There was widespread concern among academics, voluntary workers and representatives from the EC's regions at the Copenhagen conference that, even with faster economic growth, insufficient jobs will be created to rescue the excluded through increased employment opportunities alone - the OECD predicts that there will be 23m unemployed in its European member states by the end of next year, compared with 8.5m in the US and 1.7m in Japan.</p>

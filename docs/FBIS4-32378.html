			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The right-left coalition after the autumn parliamentary  elections is realistic and inevitable, KDH [Christian Democratic  Movement] Chairman Jan Carnogursky tells SME.    "The current governing coalition is able to achieve  pragmatic  approach to problems and their solutions," he says, adding that  if the mutual concessions inside coalition are compared, the  interest of the government parties in preserving the coalition  prevails.    "Sometimes abstract principles must be subordinated to  practical needs if they are considered more important. We bear  responsibility for the Slovak voters that the democratic Slovak  Government will hold the autumn parliamentary elections," he  stresses. In this connection he points to the effort of  questioning the elections by means of destabilizing the current  government to which the debates on the "lustration" (or  screening law which lays down that members of the StB, the  communist secret police, cannot hold senior public offices) law  are directed.    He rejects the speculation that by refusing the principle of  coalition and offering only places at its list of candidates to  other groups the KDH would not want to head the anti-Meciar  opposition. "The KDH was and is the backbone of opposition to  Meciar," he stresses. "We just want to keep our own identity for  the sake of the reformist forces in the next parliament," he  adds.    "It is obvious that the Democratic Left Party (SDL), as the  legal successor to the Slovak Communist Party, has other ideas  about the reforms in society than, let us say, the KDH,"  Carnogursky says. However, the SDL can be, with some  modifications, considered a reform party in Slovakia, he adds.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Maksymovych  arrived in Hanoi on Thursday for an official visit to Vietnam at  the invitation of Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.  Radio Voice of Vietnam reviews relations between Vietnam and  Ukraine over the past years.    The visit to Vietnam by the Ukrainian foreign minister is of  great significance to both countries as this is the first visit  to Vietnam of a foreign minister from Ukraine, a republic of the  former Soviet Union. It is a start in relations between the two  countries.    Following a foreign policy to be friends with all nations in  the world, Vietnam has established diplomatic relations with all  the member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States  after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Diplomatic  relations with Ukraine was established in January 1992. Today,  the bilateral relations between Vietnam and Ukraine has  developed in many fields. The number of agreements to be signed  by the two countries with a view to exploiting each other's  potential will help the economic development of each country.  They include the agreement on economic relations; trade,  military, technical, and aviation cooperation; a protocol on  foreigners; and an agreement on the travelling of citizens in  each country.    Vietnam and Ukraine have also signed other documents such as  the agreement on the encouragement and protection of investment;  the agreement on the avoidance of double taxation; a consular  agreement; and an agreement on cooperation in culture, science,  and education.    Both nations are now promoting the trading ties. In 1992,  the two-way trade turnover was only $15 million. In 1993, the  turnover was also lightly increased. Vietnam mainly imported  dairy products, steel, and construction materials, while Ukraine  imported agriculture products and consumers goods. Ukraine is  assisting Vietnam in building the Yali Hydroelectric Power Plant  and another project with a total capital of $18 million.    This visit by the Ukrainian foreign minister is a good  opportunity for the two countries to join efforts and find  measures to further strengthen the cooperative economic  relations. The visit is also a chance for the two countries to  exchange experiences in economic development of each country.  The Vietnamese people as well as the Ukrainian people hope that  this visit to Vietnam by Minister Anatoliy Maksymovych will make  contribution to the development of relations between the two  countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The presidential press service forwarded to Estonian  Radio a statement by President Lennart Meri in response to the  joint statement from the Riigikogu speaker and the prime  minister. According to the joint statement issued by Riigikogu  Speaker Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart Laar, the president's  welcoming speech [on 17 May] to the diplomatic corps accredited  to Estonia did not reflect the official position of the Republic  of Estonia.    President Lennart Meri notes with regret in his response  that  the prime minister's attempt to embroil the Riigikogu speaker in  political games may turn the current government crisis into a  constitutional crisis. The president states the text of the  welcoming speech was drafted by Toivo Klaar, head of the Foreign  Ministry's foreign policy department, at his request and with  the knowledge of the foreign minister. According to the  president, this fact could not have been unknown to Prime  Minister Laar, and if it was, it is a sign of impermissible  shortcomings within the state apparatus. The president  considers particularly dangerous for the Estonian national  security policy the fact that five days before the conference of  the foreign ministers of the countries on the Baltic Sea, the  prime minister has begun to resolve the government crisis with  foreign policy arguments, involving top state officials and  incomplete information.    In his statement the president says a government crisis is a  customary manifestation of parliamentary democracy. The  president considers it impermissible to set party political  interests above the national interest of the Republic of Estonia.</p>

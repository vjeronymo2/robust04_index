			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil issues extend recovery AN OIL sector that has doggedly underperformed the market in the past month built convincingly on Tuesday's better performance as Wall Street continued to move to record levels. Sizeable US buying overnight filtered through into London at the outset of trading yesterday, driving share prices sharply higher as marketmakers, already keenly aware of a growing stock shortage in London, began to chase stock prices higher in an attempt to cut their trading positions. This only exacerbated a situation which became increasingly difficult in the afternoon session when one of the US investment banks was seen aggressively bidding for stock in the oil majors. Talk of events in Nigeria possibly driving crude oil prices higher were ignored by London oil sector specialists, who said the upsurge in share prices was down to three reasons: a stock shortage; the strength of the dollar; and Wall Street's latest move to record levels. There was no real boost to share prices from crude prices, which were barely changed on the day. British Petroleum surged ahead in the wake of the aggressive US buying, closing 12 higher at 317 1/2 p with turnover expanding to 9.9m shares. Shell Transport climbed 11 to 671 1/2 p on 4.1m traded.</p>

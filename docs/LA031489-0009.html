			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PAPANDREOU SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE  </P> <P> The Greek Socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou survived a  no-confidence motion by the opposition New Democracy party aimed at toppling  the Socialists because of a series of scandals. The Socialists secured an  absolute majority of 155 votes in the 300-seat Parliament. Three prominent  Socialist members, including former Justice Minister George Manghakis and  former Education Minister Antonis Tritsis, abstained. They were the latest  Socialists to break ranks with the government over a series of financial and  personal scandals involving alleged embezzlement and payoffs that has embroiled  Papandreou, 70.  </P></p>

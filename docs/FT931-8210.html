			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / US Secretary of State Christopher sightsees in Egypt Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, leaves the Sphinx and Pyramids after a sightseeing tour in Egypt yesterday. After meeting Mr Christopher, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he had accepted an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton in Washington in early April, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Opening his Middle East tour, Mr Christopher said he and the Egyptian president had 'agreed to intensify efforts' to persuade all sides to reconvene peace talks, which have stalled since Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians. But Mr Mubarak appeared to deny Palestinian suggestions that Egypt was championing a new timetable for the return by June of the 396 Palestinian deportees still stranded in south Lebanon. Israel has said it will take back 101 immediately and the rest in a year - a plan the deportees reject. Mr Mubarak said Egypt still called for Israel's implementation of United Nations resolution 799 demanding the immediate return of all the deportees. 'We have no new agenda,' he said. 'We are working to implement this resolution fully - it will take some time.' Mr Christopher flew on to Amman for talks with King Hussein, the Jordanian ruler.</p>

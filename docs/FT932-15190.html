			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Sharp fall in Euro car sales NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 9.4 per cent last month as demand dropped steeply for the third month in succession. In the first quarter, new car sales declined by 17.3 per cent to around 3.06m. Sales in March declined to 1.18m from 1.3m in the equivalent month a year earlier, according to industry estimates. Demand in March was lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with higher sales registered only in the UK and Greece. The rate of decline moderated in March, following steep falls of 23 and 17 per cent in January and February, but leading carmakers are being forced to lower further their already pessimistic sales forecasts for the full year. General Motors, the US maker, said yesterday it now expected new car sales in west Europe to fall by 11 per cent to only 11.95m this year from 13.45m in 1992 compared with a 1993 forecast of 12.3m. In Germany, the single biggest market in west Europe, sales fell by 14.9 per cent in March to an estimated 363,000. Sales plunged by 21.7 per cent in the first quarter. Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement short-time work and are cutting workforces in the face of shrinking profits or mounting losses. The rate of decline has accelerated in Italy, where new car registrations fell by 20.8 per cent in March to 190,000. New car sales in France in March were 9 per cent lower than a year ago, while demand in Spain dropped steeply by 22.7 per cent. The only significant relief is being shown in the UK, where sales in March were 12.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in the first quarter rose by 11.6 per cent. After plunging by a third during more than three years of recession, sales in the UK have been higher than a year ago in each of the last six months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS January-March 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume     Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units)   Change(%) Jan-Mar 93  Jan-Mar 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET                3,064,000     -17.3     100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.            515,000     -17.9      16.8        17.0 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors                382,000     -18.2      12.5        12.6 (Opel/Vauxhall, US**** &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall               367,000     -18.1      12.0        12.1  -Saab**                       10,000     -24.5       0.3         0.4 Fiat (incl.

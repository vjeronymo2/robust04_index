			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Omnicom to acquire Paris agency OMNICOM, the US marketing services group and the fourth largest advertising company in terms of worldwide billings, is expanding its European advertising interests by taking control of TBWA, the French advertising agency, through a share swap announced yesterday. TBWA, which was founded in Paris in the early 1970s, is one of the few remaining independent European advertising networks. The company, which claims annual billings of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 196m) has offices across the continent and a small agency in the US, which has achieved a high profile for its work for Absolut vodka. However the international advertising industry is now so competitive that life has become increasingly difficult for independents. The industry has been hit both by the recession and by the long term trend for companies to move away from conventional media advertising towards other forms of promotion. Omnicom, which was formed in the late 1980s by the merger of the DDB Needham and BBDO advertising agencies, has been one of the beneficiaries of the industry's consolidation. The TBWA acquisition, which is expected to be finalised in mid-May, is the latest in a series of deals in which Omnicom has bought up smaller businesses. These included the UK's Boase Massimi Pollitt agency, which Omnicom acquired in the late 1980s after the British agency fell victim to a hostile bid from a French group. Annual billings for the two existing Omnicom networks are substantially larger than those of TBWA, each standing at around Dollars 6bn. Omnicom has long been interested in TBWA, and industry speculation about a deal has been rife. Talks between the two companies are understood to have been under way for over a year, and analysts have already suggested that by purchasing TBWA, Omnicom will obtain a strong competitive edge in the industry. The advantage to running different agency networks under one group umbrella is that this allows an advertising company to take on new business which might otherwise conflict with existing client accounts.</p>

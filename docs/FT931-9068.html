			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Report calls for accounting harmonisation THE ACCOUNTS of companies in continental Europe are becoming less conservative and more likely to flatter profits, according to a research report from NatWest Securities, the research and brokerage arm of National Westminster Bank, UK clearer. Based on an analysis of large European companies in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, the research house calls for faster progress towards harmonisation of accounting practices and tighter rules. It warns that until standards are more uniform, investors need to be wary of differing accounting practices. 'Profits are certainly widely understated where the tax authorities are more of a threat than equity markets,' it says. 'The blanket assumption that continental European accounts are conservative is becoming dangerous.' Among the practices NatWest highlights are: Revaluation upwards of assets on the balance sheet, including Total, Olivetti and Philips. Depreciation, which is accelerated in Germany and Switzerland to shelter profits from the tax authorities. Capitalisation of intangible assets on the balance sheet, such as interest costs by Sevillana, development costs by Euro Disney and the inclusion of trademarks by Pinault-Printemps. Goodwill written down to a substantially degree, such as at Alcatel, which allows it to be released from reserves into the profit and loss account in the future. Provisions and reserves, which can help smooth and adjust profits. The report criticises the poor disclosure of German banks, and highlights high restructuring provisions at Philips. Long-term contracts which can be treated in different ways which makes comparisons difficult. Joint ventures and associates, which can be treated in different ways and can delay the revaluation of profits. Off balance sheet finance such as leasing controlled 'non-subsidiaries', used by companies such as Euro Disney. Foreign currency translation, which is applied in divergent ways. Extraordinary items, which are also defined in different ways in the different countries. Ms Marina Tzamouranis, who co-ordinated the research, said the racier approaches to financial reporting were being driven by increased cross-border transactions and the growing importance of equity markets.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italian banks agree takeover Banca Popolare di Verona, a big north Italian regional bank, has reached agreement to take a controlling interest in Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero, a similar-sized rival, for about L1,040bn (Dollars 600m). The accord, reached late on Thursday, ends Italy's first hostile bank takeover bid and comes at a time of unprecedented ferment among regional banks. Last week, Deutsche Bank agreed to buy Banca Popolare di Lecco, a 100-branch regional bank located just north of Milan, at an estimated total cost of L840bn. Separately, the Parma savings bank, which has expanded through a series of local mergers, is in talks to buy Credito Commerciale, another Milan-based regional institution. The San Geminiano deal, in which the bank called in Schroders of the UK as its adviser, was a cliffhanger until the last minute, with two other potential suitors waiting in the wings. However, San Geminiano's board eventually decided to accept a greatly improved offer from the Veronese after a tough contest. Banca Popolare di Verona will now buy an estimated 60-65 per cent of Banco San Geminiano, rather than the 47 per cent originally planned. The increase stems from a commitment to buy all the stock tendered by shareholders owning less than 1,000 shares, rather than a partial purchase. That commitment, and an earlier decision to raise the offer price to L200,000 a share from L180,000, effectively clinched the deal, along with guarantees on boardroom representation for San Geminiano.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREE ADVICE TO A TOBACCO KING: WISE UP  </P> <P> To Guy Smith IV  </P> <P> Vice President, Corporate Affairs  </P> <P> Philip Morris Companies Inc.  </P> <P> Dear Guy:  </P> <P> So sorry I missed your speech at the Media Institute in Washington last week. I  loved reading it, anyway. I especially liked the part when you called reporters  the "patsies" of "quack moralists" with "bogus science." Who better to give it  to the press than a fella from Philip Morris, corporate sponsor of the Bill of  Rights itself?  </P> <P> From what I read, your main complaint is that we here in the Fourth Estate are  more skeptical of industry than of advocacy groups. You take us to task for  believing naively in the people you call "the anti-tobacco industry's top  executives."  </P> <P> Well, talk about naive. I didn't even know there was an anti-tobacco  "industry." I thought these people were public-health advocates. What do they  manufacture? "No Smoking" signs?  </P> <P> Anyway, I appreciate the warning about being too "cozy" with health researchers  (I mean "quack moralists") and the need to stay skeptical. You never know what  these health nuts are pushing. A clean lung could be a dangerous thing.  </P> <P> But frankly, Guy, until your speech, I thought the media were the patsies of  the tobacco industry, not to mention its $3-billion advertising budget.  </P> <P> What's amazed me even more about the media is how the tobacco industry has  secured a permanent post as "the other side" of the argument. You know the  drill: Over here, we have the entire weight of the medical world. Over there,  we have the Tobacco Institute. Shazam, a balanced issue.  </P> <P> But what do I know? I never even realized the tobacco industry was such a  passionate defender of science. The part where you attack the upcoming  Environmental Protection Agency study on passive smoking was a real hummer. You  seem righteously worried that the scientific arguments over passive-smoking  research might be tainted by politics. Well, hush my Jesse Helms.  </P> <P> EPA, one of those "special interest . . . bureaucracies pushing a party line"  is expected to attribute 3,000 cancer deaths a year to passive smoking. In  fact, Guy, the risks from tobacco pollution may be worse than the EPA study  suggests and, in any case, greater than those of all the carcinogenic outdoor  air pollutants on the EPA's list. Say, if the Philip Morris job goes sour, want  to defend asbestos? Polyvinyl chlorides?  </P> <P> Ever since you fellas stopped featuring doctors in ads, the posture of the  pushers has been that there is a "controversy" over cigarette smoking. The  best-documented health risk is put in the same category as eating sugar or  drinking caffeine.  </P> <P> Your pals keep telling us that nobody has proved cigarettes cause cancer. Four  decades and tens of thousands of studies on this subject have produced no hard  science. So light up, they say.  </P> <P> Well, in the spirit of a purely scientific debate, will you field a couple of  questions from a "skeptical, careful journalist"? What evidence would the  tobacco companies accept as proof of the dangers of smoking? And what would you  all do then?  </P> <P> "What I am saying" you admonished us, "is that in covering science and  industry, no more laziness, no more coziness and no more patsies." That's what  I'm saying, too, Guy.  </P> <P> Love,  </P> <P> Patsy.  </P></p>

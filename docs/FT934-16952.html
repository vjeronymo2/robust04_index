			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Tories look at rules on leadership THE POWERFUL 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers is to consider Baroness Thatcher's suggestions for changing the rules governing Tory leadership contests as a matter of priority. Dame Jill Knight, the vice-chairman of the 1922 executive, said last night she was sure the committee would look at the issues raised by Lady Thatcher 'as soon as possible'. But she indicated there was probably not enough time to head off a possible leadership challenge to Mr John Major, the prime minister, this autumn by rewriting the rules in line with Lady Thatcher's proposal. 'I would imagine it would be too late to alter the rules for this year,' Dame Jill, the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said. Lady Thatcher told The Sunday Times yesterday that existing rules for determining when a leader could be challenged should be discontinued during periods when the Conservatives were in government. The former prime minister said: 'I do not think the prime ministership of a nation should be determined by some leadership rules that were fashioned for being in opposition. 'I think the existence of them can actually destabilise the government of the day - the party really must think again. 'I think they must think about this very carefully and ponder very deeply on whether an election for the leader of the party should apply during a time when that leader is also prime minister.' Under current rules - modified in 1991 as a result of Lady Thatcher's own removal as leader - a leadership contest could be triggered if 34 Conservative MPs wrote to Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922, within 14 days of the start of a new parliamentary session to say such a step was warranted. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, yesterday welcomed Lady Thatcher's proposals, saying he was 'very much in favour of the sort of changes she is suggesting'. But the response of members of the 1922 executive was mixed. Dame Jill said Lady Thatcher had a 'strong point' in asserting that a sitting prime minister was different from a leader of the opposition. But Sir Marcus said he was wary of the proposals. Another senior member of the executive said the proposed change would not help Mr Major since it would be seen as a sign of weakness. The 1991 rule change had 'tipped the balance rather against stalking horse candidates anyway,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's  main opposition leader and presumed winner of a presidential  election last year, was put under house arrest before dawn  Saturday [11 June], a close aide told AFP.    About 20 riot police armed with assault rifles were deployed  outside his home in Ikeja, a residential neighborhood to the  north of the capital, and were blocking anyone from entering or  leaving the premises.    Another 60 policemen and an armoured vehicle were stationed  at the entrance to the road leading to the Moslem billionaire's  residence, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene. The  aide said he was put under arrest at 4:00 a.m.    About 100 Abiola supporters had gathered not far from the  police cordon, the correspondent said, but there was no sign of  unrest.    Police warned Abiola Friday that he would be arrested and  charged with treason of he went ahead with a plan to set up a  "government of national unity" on Sunday, anniversary of the  June 12, 1993 presidential vote.    Last year's presidential poll was declared free and fair by  international observers but annulled by then junta leader  General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities.    Babangida was succeeded by General Sunni Abacha, who seized  power last November. Abacha meanwhile is to make a national  address on radio early Sunday, his office said in Abuja.    Earlier Saturday a statement by the National Democratic  Coalition, which heads the opposition, said Abiola has decided  to put off forming a parallel government for "a few days."    The statement said his decision was in response to an urgent  plea from the Anglican Archbishop of Nigeria and other  opposition leaders hoping to reach a last-minute compromise with  the military regime.</p>

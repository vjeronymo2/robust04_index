			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Malawi slips at last from iron grip of Banda: Michael Holman and Nick Young on the end of an era Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who ruled Malawi from independence from Britain in 1964 until this week was the last of Africa's colonial autocrats. Popularly known as the Ngwazi (Saviour) he led the former Nyasaland to independence, consolidated his grip on power by turning the independent state of Malawi into a one-party fiefdom run with a combination of Victorian principles and an iron fist. He once said: 'I do things; let others explain why.' But few have been able to. He ruled according to his own whims and fancies, managing in the early years of independence to achieve remarkable economic growth for a deeply impoverished colonial backwater. His legacy is one of human rights abuses, belated economic reforms undermined by a reluctance to distinguish between legitimate personal resources and state assets, and illusions of grandeur demonstrated by a string of palaces and presidential retreats around the country, and a personality cult as destructive as it was colourful. With fly whisk in hand, and dressed in sombre suit, homburg and dark glasses, he cut an incongruous figure as he joined the ever present M'bumba, the redoubtable women who danced in attendance at public gatherings. He was the product of an extraordinary childhood: the traditional missionary education was followed by 40 years abroad as a student in the US and medical doctor in the UK. Regarded by many as a ruthless tyrant, Dr Banda was a shrewd, hard-working and calculating politician. Using traditional culture, he set up a well-oiled party machinery backed by a powerful security service that controlled almost all aspects of Malawian life. He personally controlled large parts of the economy 'in the interests of the nation' including the giant Press Holdings said to account for more than a third of GDP, until he reluctantly allowed economic reforms pressed on Malawi by the World Bank to take state resources out of his hands. A member of the Chewa tribe of central Malawi, Kamuzu Banda was born near Kasungu in 1906 - although the date has always been the subject of controversy. It may have been 1898. He took the name of Hastings after the missionary who baptised him; studied at the Livingstonia mission school near Lake Malawi and then set out to walk over 1,000 miles to South Africa. On the way he found a job as a hospital orderly in Rhodesia. He studied medicine, history and politics in the US and further did studies at Edinburgh and Glasgow. He set up his first practice in Liverpool in 1941 and moved to London in 1946 where he joined the Labour Party and became the representative of the Nyasaland African Congress, lobbying from his surgery against the British government's imposition of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1957 he moved to the Gold Coast (now Ghana). When unrest flared in Nyasaland a year later he was invited back home by local leaders. On July 5 1964 Malawi was born and Dr Banda, its first premier, said: 'One leader, one party, one government and no nonsense about it.' In 1970 he declared himself President for Life. Ministers suspected of plotting against him were imprisoned or forced into exile. A few died in suspicious circumstances. In 1983 three ministers, including Dick Matenje, a potential successor, were killed in a car crash. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have been summarily detained over the years for breaking rank with a ruling party - of which all Malawians had to be be members - that demanded Unity, Loyalty, Obedience and Discipline. Yet despite this, his key role in the independence movement, which he never allowed people to forget, ensured a near-divine reverence. 'Whoever takes over,' said one observer, 'will be a mere mortal.' Material contributed by Mike Hall, former FT correspondent, Lilongwe</p>

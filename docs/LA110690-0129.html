			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3RD-QUARTER OFFICE VACANCY RATE FALLS TO ITS LOWEST POINT SINCE 1988;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: A REPORT SAYS RECENT CONSTRUCTION WAS RELATIVELY LIGHT AND THAT  THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BEING BUILT IS THE LEAST OF ANY MAJOR SOUTHLAND MARKET.  </P> <P> The average office vacancy rate in the San Fernando, Conejo and Santa Clarita  valleys in the third quarter fell 0.4 percentage points to 13.6%, its lowest  point since the end of 1988, the real estate firm Grubb &amp; Ellis Co.  reported.  </P> <P> The company said 2.95 million square feet of office space was vacant out of a  total available of 21.7 million square feet.  </P> <P> The decline reflected strong "net absorption," or an increase in occupied  office space, in the central part of the San Fernando Valley, which includes  Encino, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys, Grubb &amp; Ellis said. The openings of the  91,000-square-foot Industrial Bank Building in Van Nuys and the  45,000-square-foot Home Plaza Building in Sherman Oaks contributed to the gain.  </P> <P> The office vacancy rate provides a clue to whether there is a glut of office  space available in the region, whether it's priced at levels attractive to  business, and whether new construction of offices is keeping pace with  companies' expansion plans.  </P> <P> In the latest quarter, completed new construction was relatively light at  197,000 square feet, and much of that space was pre-leased before the buildings  opened, Grubb &amp; Ellis said. There is an additional 1.3 million square feet  currently being built, which is the lowest of any major market in Southern  California, the company said.  </P> <P> The market "performed at a consistent level of absorption" in the third  quarter, Howe S. Foster, senior vice president in Grubb &amp; Ellis' Sherman  Oaks office, said in a statement. "It has now held steady in the 13% to 15%  range over the last year."  </P> <P> The rate has generally stayed below 15% for the last three years after soaring  to 21% in late 1986, when a rash of new office complexes were built. The rate  then dropped as low as 12% in late 1988 before climbing back to the 13% to 15%  range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Region's Office Vacancy Rate  </P> <P> Source: Grubb &amp; Ellis Co.  </P></p>

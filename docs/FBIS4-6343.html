			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto says it is  unlikely that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, after only eight months in power, will affect  the strong relations between the two countries.    Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters on Saturday  that the President viewed Hosokawa's resignation as relating  solely to the domestic affairs of Japan and that it should not  have any repercussions on bilateral ties with Indonesia.    Suharto, according to Murdiono, expressed his wish that  Japan  would soon overcome its domestic political problems and elect a  new prime minister.    "The leadership change in Japan is not going to affect the  politics and government of that country," Murdiono said, echoing  the President.    Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas, also voicing  confidence that Indonesian-Japanese ties will remain unaffected,  stressed on Saturday that it is only the prime minister who has  resigned, and that the government will remain.    Japan is Indonesia's main trading partner and also its  largest source of foreign aid.    The two countries in recent years have tried to expand their  bilateral ties to include other aspects, most notably culture.</p>

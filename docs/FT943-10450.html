			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trencherwood margins ahead Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 859,000 for the six months to April 30 on turnover of Pounds 9.74m. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds 4.78m, although there were exceptional credits last time of Pounds 3.45m. 'This heralds the return of the company to real profitability,' said Mr John Norgate, chairman of this USM-quoted company. Sales from residential activities totalled Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 4.8m), including Pounds 2.8m related to land trading activities. The group sold 95 units during the period, an increase of some 36 per cent, at an average price of Pounds 72,500 (Pounds 67,000). The policy of working through sites acquired during the recession and subsequent reinvestment in new sites at lower prices helped gross margins improve from 15.8 per cent to 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis. At the period end the land bank stood at 6,558 plots, 2,305 of which have planning consent or are zoned for development. Earnings per share emerged at 1.03p (3.74p) basic or 0.55p (2.11p) fully diluted.</p>

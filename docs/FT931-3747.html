			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead UNITED Biscuits' full-year results on Thursday will be scarred heavily by the profits collapse at Keebler, its US subsidiary, and a consequent restructuring charge. With Keebler's margins still under pressure, analysts forecast group pre-tax profits of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m last time. The McVitie's division is thought to have benefited from a stronger year-end, as well as from contributions from European acquisitions. A small improvement is forecast for the Ross Young's frozen foods business, though KP Foods' results fell back slightly. Annual profits from English China Clays, due on Monday, will reflect the problems of the paper industry, its major customer. Paper-makers have been trying to share their pain with suppliers, while ECC is also suffering competition from the US. Analysts are looking for a fall in profits from 1991's Pounds 115.4m pre-tax to Pounds 85m-95m. However, under the new FRS 3 accounting standards, the numbers should look better, with a rise to around Pounds 100m from Pounds 79.3m. The end of the UK-quoted banks' reporting round comes on Monday with results from HSBC Holdings. HSBC, which acquired Midland bank last summer, is expected to announced pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.8bn for 1992. Guinness, on Thursday, is expected to report a 17 per cent decline in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m. An exceptional charge of Pounds 125m for the re-organisation of the group's whisky operations and Spanish brewing business accounts for most of the shortfall on 1991's Pounds 956m. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper-maker, is likely to report on Thursday a drop in pre-tax profits of around one-third to Pounds 160m. It is suffering from the slowdown in the continental economies and excess capacity. Laporte, the UK chemicals group, reports its full-year results on Monday. During the takeover of Evode earlier this year, the company predicted that its pre-tax profits would fall from Pounds 97.2m to Pounds 86m. Analysts expect the full-year dividend to rise from 18.9p a share to between 19.3p and 19.7p. Analysts will be more interested in the group's forecasts for the remainder of the year: more than a third of Laporte's sales are in north America. Rentokil, the pest control, plant hire and environmental services group, is expected to report on Thursday another big jump in pre-tax profits for 1992. Analysts are expecting about Pounds 115m-Pounds 122m (Pounds 94.6m) and a full-year dividend of 2p-2.5p (1.7p) is forecast. George Wimpey, the house-builder, is heading for a full-year loss om Tuesday of around Pounds 70m before exceptional charges of Pounds 20m. Some recovery is expected this year.</p>

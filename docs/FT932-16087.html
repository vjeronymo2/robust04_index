			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Corning's income falls 9% CORNING, the US manufacturer of high technology and glass products, yesterday reported a 9 per cent drop in comparable first-quarter net income, which it blamed mainly on a weak results from businesses in which it has equity interests. The main culprits were Vitro Corning, its joint-venture houseware products company with Mexico's Vitro, and Dow Corning, which last year was embroiled in controversy over its breast implant products. Corning said the weak results from these businesses were due to 'soft economies in Mexico, Europe and Japan'. Corning's net income totalled Dollars 47.2m, or 25 cents a share, excluding accounting changes and special events, down 9 per cent when last year's figures are adjusted on the same basis. Sales were up from Dollars 741m to Dollars 817m. Mr James Houghton, chairman, said: 'Excluding special events, earnings from consolidated operations increased 8 per cent. However, this gain was not enough to offset the major decline in operations of equity companies.' He added that while the group was not pleased with its overall performance, it did not believe the results were indicative of the full year. 'The March operating results of consolidated companies were below our expectations primarily as a result of a series of manufacturing, distribution and service delivery disruptions caused by unusually severe weather in the US,' he said. He remained optimistic that the full-year performance would reflect the com-pany's record of consistent growth.</p>

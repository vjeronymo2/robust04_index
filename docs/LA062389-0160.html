			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUYER SHOT, K MART PARTIALLY LIABLE  </P> <P> A court found K mart partially responsible for injuries suffered by a customer  who shot himself in the toe while examining a rifle he wanted to buy for his  6-year-old son as a first-grade graduation gift.  </P> <P> Palm Beach Circuit Judge Edward Garrison ruled that K mart was negligent in the  June, 1987, accident because a clerk handed Richard Rubin, 29, the gun without  checking to see that it was loaded. The judge awarded Rubin $10,419 on  Thursday. He had sued for $200,000.  </P> <P> The jury originally awarded Rubin $16,000, but Garrison found he was 35%  negligent, reducing the corporation's liability to 65%.  </P></p>

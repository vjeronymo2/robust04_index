			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / BAe revives hope of forging defence link with GEC: Speculation grows that John Cahill will resign as chairman of British Aerospace British Aerospace has revived the idea of a strategic link withthe General Electric Company aimed at creating a powerful single UK defence contracting group. The news came as speculation within the company mounted that Mr John Cahill is to step down as chairman three years earlier than expected. Mr Cahill's expected departure, which has no connection with the company's defence ambitions, would follow BAe's Pounds 800m sale this week of Rover to BMWof Germany which will refocus the company on its main aerospace and defence activities. Following the Rover deal a large part of the restructuring ofBAe has been completed, providing Mr Cahill with the opportunity to step down. His likely departure also follows unsuccessful attempts to link the company's regional jet aircraft business with Taiwan Aerospace, with which he was closely associated. Mr Cahill, who succeeded Sir Graham Day as chairman in April 1992, may be replaced by a non-executive chairman appointed from outside the BAe board. Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said the future of the company's core defence activities ultimately lay in a relationship with the UK's other leading defence contractor. 'It is not if, it is a question of when,' MrEvans said, although he stressed that no talks were taking place at present. Any eventual merger of the two companies' defence activities would create the world's second largest defence contractor after Martin Marietta of the US. MrEvans added that the UK could no longer afford two competing contractors in theshrinking world defence market. He confirmed the companies held talks last summer on the possibility of forming a single UK defence contracting company,but the discussions had to be halted after a report appeared in The Sunday Times. Mr Evans said a link with GEC was inevitable. Close links would help secure the future of the UK's strong position in the world defence export market. But Mr Evans said the company's priority was to stop the haemorrhaging of cash from its civil aircraft business. Yesterday, BAe announced it was writing off Pounds 250m for its loss-making turbo-propeller commuter aircraft division. Mr Evans indicated that BAe would shed other peripheral activities, including property assets held by its Arlington Securities subsidiary. The BMW deal and the announcement about the turbo-prop business were welcomed by the City. BAe's shares yesterday gained 22p to close at 575p, up 30 per cent on the week. Mr Evans ruled out that the company would seek fresh funds through a rights issue. The group is now looking for joint venture partners for both its regional jet and turbo-prop operations. Although talks with Taiwan Aerospace were in limbo, Mr Evans said BAe's regional jet business had 'hugely improved' after restructuring.

			<p>SUMMARY                                  Stressing their pique at NATO's failure to consult with Moscow in  advance of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, government officials, and legislators  from  across the political spectrum have condemned the raids as  ill-advised and likely to escalate the bloodshed in Bosnia.  Media commentary echoed these sentiments and warned that the NATO  actions could adversely affect Russian internal politics and  U.S.-Russian relations.                             END SUMMARY      Yeltsin was strongly critical of NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb  positions around Gorazde and accused NATO and the United States,  in particular, of failing to consult in advance with Russia.  Yeltsin said in an 11 April press interview that "I have insisted  and I insist now" that "questions such as bombing strikes against  Serbian positions must not be decided" without prior U.S.-Russian  consultations.  He told reporters that during a telephone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton early that morning  he had made the same point about consultations "again and again."  Insisting that any such action should be taken only "in  accordance with UN decisions," Yeltsin complained that the  telephone call had not clarified whether the UN Secretary General  had given the "go-ahead" for the strikes and declared that  Russia, "without a doubt," wanted the Security Council to discuss  the issue (Ostankino TV, 11 April, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 April).      Stressing Russia's preference for continued negotiations, Yeltsin  told reporters in Madrid on 12 April that a settlement in Bosnia  must come through political negotiations and not through force"  which could lead to "everlasting war" and that the blame for such  an outcome would "rest with those who took the decision" on the  strikes.  At the same time he noted that the shooting in Gorazde  had stopped and expressed the hope that the bombing "will not,  after all, lead to greater confrontation and greater bloodshed."  Continuing to display annoyance at what he termed "discrimination  against Russia," however, Yeltsin emphasized that consultations  would be held with the UN Secretary General and President Clinton  "so that this does not happen again" (Moscow TV, ITAR-TASS, 12  April).   Other Government Reaction      Other Government officials displayed similar irritation at the  lack of consultation and expressed fears that the air strikes  would jeopardize the peace negotiations and lead to a wider  conflict.  notably some officials criticized the Serbs as well as  the Bosnian Muslims:      -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called the air strikes "a big  mistake and a great risk."  He told reporters that Russia was  "worried" that the air strike decision "was made in a hurry"  without considering "possible consequences," noting that this was  why consultations were needed.  Warning like Yeltsin that the air  strikes could result in an "escalation of the conflict instead of  its suppression," he said he had "expressed his profound concern"  to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the world  could be "engulfed in an exchange of blows" and had urged the  West "to display the utmost restraint."  Pointing to diplomatic  efforts with the Serbs made by special envoy Vitaliy Churkin,  Kozyrev called the air strikes "especially annoying" because by 2  April he claimed there were "already signs of a political  settlement" (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).      -- Churkin criticized the UN and NATO for failing to consult with  Russia about their actions.  Warning that UN and NATO  "interference" in the conflict was leading to a "greater  confrontation," he said that he was trying to work with the  Bosnia Serbs "to bring together the fragments of a Bosnian peace  settlement."  Churkin accused the Muslims of being the first to  "initiate combat activities in Gorazde" despite the fact that it  was a UN "safety zone," but also faulted the Bosnian Serbs for  misleading him as to their intentions (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).      -- Ministry press spokesman Grigoriy Karasin stressed that Russia  "will never reconcile itself to the role of a so-called junior  partner, who is informed after the event about such decisions."  He said Russia was "opposed to the practice of being consulted  only to obtain a yes" (Moscow radio, 12 April).      -- Interfax (11 April) cited an unnamed "high-ranking diplomat"  as saying that Moscow's reaction to the bombardment of Serb  positions "will be tough" if it discovered that the strikes could  have been "avoided."  He complained that Russia was not a "banana  republic" and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council  would not accept being informed about decisions to use force in  Yugoslavia as a "fait accompli."  He also claimed that the  Muslims had "provoked" the Serbs' military actions in Gorazde and  that attacks on the Serbs would only "make them unwilling to  negotiate."      An 11 April Russian Foreign Ministry statement complained that  Moscow had been informed of the air strikes only "after the  event" and said Russia continued to await "full information"  about what has happened from the UN leadership.  The statement  called for the implementation of "urgent measures" around Gorazde  including the deployment of UN forces, the withdrawal of Serbs  from their present positions, and the demilitarization of the  area, including the disarmament of Muslim forces (ITAR-TASS, 11  April).   Legislature Condemns the Attack      Predictably, the Russian legislature, many of whose members have  for months been attacking the government for cooperating with the  West on Bosnia and for giving insufficient support to the Serbs,  opposed the NATO air strikes.  Leaders from across the political  spectrum voiced disapproval:      -- Yeltsin supporter and Federation Council chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko called the strikes "unjustified at this point" and  criticized the United States for openly showing support for one  side while "punishing" the other side (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).      -- Duma Speaker and Agrarian Party member Ivan Rybkin issued a  statement on behalf of the Duma demanding "an immediate end" to  NATO's "unilateral, unsanctioned use of force," complaining that  NATO has "easily ignored not only Russia's view," but also the  "achieved agreements," and that its action "threatens to ruin"  prospects for a peaceful political settlement (ITAR-TASS, 12  April).      -- Sergey Shakhray, cochairman of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord (PRES) charged that conducting the air strikes without  consulting Russia was a "slap in the face" to Yeltsin and would  have an adverse effect within Russia, creating, indirectly, a  "telling strike against Russian reforms" and benefitting "the  national patriots" (Moscow radio, 12 April; Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  13 April).      -- Former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a  member of the moderately reformist Yavlinskiy bloc and chairman  of the Duma's international affairs committee expressed  "disappointment" at the "very unfortunate, badly timed" strikes  which had occurred just when Russian diplomatic efforts were  bringing results.  He faulted the lack of "preliminary  consultations" with Russia and called for convening the UN  Security Council to determine if the attacks were in line with UN  resolutions.  While admitting that some Serb commanders "may have  been at fault," he warned that the air strikes will "unavoidably  complicate" the situation (ITAR-TASS, 12 April).      -- The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), whose leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy had called for the bombing of NATO bases in Italy in  retaliation, denounced the air strikes, warning of the  possibility of unleashing world war in the Balkans and stating  that the "Russian people support their Serb brothers" (ITAR-TASS,  Interfax, 11 April).   Media Reaction      The Russian media across the political spectrum expressed regret  at the air strikes, with most commentary expressing anger that  Moscow was not consulted in advance, (See box) and some warning  that NATO's actions were becoming a factor in Russia's domestic  political struggle:      -- The pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya tried to present a  balanced view, expressing strong doubts about Serbian actions,  but also warning that NATO's response would have unfavorable  consequences for Russia.  A front-page 12 April report filed from  Belgrade maintained that the NATO attack "was to be expected."  Saying that Russia had "repeatedly warned" the Bosnian Serbs, who  had been "attacking" Gorazde for "the past two weeks," of the  "danger of the situation," the article charged that the Serbs had  assured Russia that there would be no "exacerbation of the  situation," but "immediately broke their word."  Another article  the same day trenchantly observed that Belgrade only began  extolling "Slav unity" after sanctions against Serbia were  introduced and claimed that Serb diplomacy was mainly directed at  pitting Russia against the West.  A 13 April Maksim Yusin article  titled "NATO Resolve and Serb Stubbornness Put Russian Diplomacy  in Difficult Position," stressed that events are "taking a most  undesirable turn for Moscow."  Claiming that Russia had been  "winning-one diplomatic victory after another" when the stress  was on negotiations, Yusin claimed that the Kremlin's ability to  influence the situation was "very limited" once NATO-Serb  hostilities began.  Yusin warned that Russia's relations with the  West "would be put to a new-test" if NATO carried out more  military operations, but he nonetheless concluded that Yeltsin  "attaches too much importance" to ties to the United States and  Western Europe to "put them at risk over the Serbs'  inflexibility."      -- A 13 April article in the independent reformist newspaper  Nezavisimaya Gazeta condemned what it saw as the West's one-sided  approach favoring the Bosnian Muslims and complained that the  West is "apparently little concerned about the internal political  complications" from such actions both for the Bosnian Serbs and  in Russia.      -- A 13 April article in the mass-circulation newspaper  Komsomolskaya Pravda titled "NATO'S Order:  Kill the Serbs,"  faulted the U.S foreign policy for its "insolence" in  demonstrating "unthinking support" and "clear favoritism" toward  the Muslims, claiming that the U.S. "inability to compromise" had  placed it "on a par" with the Bosnian Serbs.  The article  suggested that the air strikes were a reaction to Russia's  "surprisingly flexible and fresh" diplomatic approaches, which  had caught Washington "unawares" and charged that Washington, by  "constantly" declaring "Russia must not abandon us," has "placed  Russia in a difficult position."      -- The pro-communist newspaper Pravda predictably adopted a  shrill tone in a report titled "25 Minutes of War.  World War  III?"  In a transparent effort to invoke Slav solidarity, the  article quoted a Bosnian Serbian Orthodox priest, who, as a U.S.  F-16 "Phantom" flew overhead, said "it is NATO, not God who is  above us today" and "behaving as if it is above God."  He asked  why foreign aircraft were "roaring over Slav land," and charged  that the UN is becoming "NATO's hostage." After complaining that  the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact left no one to stop the  bombing, the article asked if the "Balkan fuse" "lit by the flame  of the Kremlin 'perestroyka'" would once again explode?   Outlook      Yeltsin and other government officials are clearly angered by  NATO's lack of consultation prior to launching airstrikes against  Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, in part because the use of  military force threatens to jeopardize Russia's role as a  mediator with the Serbs in negotiations, but more importantly  because this appears to indicate a continued refusal on the part  of the United States to treat Russia as an equal partner.  Apparently convinced that US  officials knew in advance of the  Gorazde strike, the Russians regard the lack of prior  consultation as a severe slight.  Moreover, NATO's actions give  ammunition to domestic critics of Yeltsin's policies of  cooperation with the West.   BOX   Television Reaction      Russia's two major state-run television networks, Ostankino and  Russian Television (RTV), have carried commentaries condemning  the airstrikes and protesting that the strikes have changed the  character of the NATO alliance from defensive to aggressive.      Commentator G. Shakhov* said on a 12 April RTV "Vesti" broadcast  that Russia should refuse to participate in NATO's Partnership  for Peace program because NATO, having carried out the  airstrikes, sided openly with one side in the Bosnian conflict  and "ignored Russia's role as a great power," and had thus shown  itself to be an unsuitable partner.  He charged that U.S.  President Bill Clinton "admitted" at a White House press  conference that he had not informed Russian President Boris  Yeltsin of the airstrikes that were then "in preparation," which,  according to Shakhov, created the impression that "the United  States has decided to independently determine the fate of the  peoples of Bosnia."  The United States failed to consult,  according to Shakhov, even though it was precisely Russia's  diplomatic intervention that helped to ameliorate the situation  during the recent crisis in Sarajevo.  Shakhov contended that  "certain circles" in Washington had been irritated by Moscow's  intervention in Sarajevo and had decided to act henceforth  "without any consultations with Russia."      *This commentary is the third in a series of recent commentaries  by Shakhov taking aim at the United States for its foreign policy  actions in areas traditionally considered to be within Russia's  sphere of influence.  For a discussion of the other two, see the  Trends of 6 April 1994, pages 23-25.      Ostankino's Vladimir Grigoryev began his 12 April "Novosti"  commentary by citing an editorial from the French newspaper, Le  Monde, which he said, charged that the airstrikes entailed a  "radical change" in NATO's doctrine and strategy, transforming  the alliance from a restraining "shield" to a "punishing sword."  Grigoryev then said that the Washington Post had called NATO's  claims that the bombings were authorized by UN resolutions merely  a "pretext" for the "widespread and massive use of military air  power."  Grigoryev condemned the airstrikes, asserting that they  took place just as "signs of a possible political normalization"  of the situation around Gorazde had appeared and that they had  taken place "in violation" of previous agreements.  He concluded  by asserting that a UN statement that henceforth airstrikes could  take place without preliminary consultation with UN officials  means "a further escalation" of the conflict.

Azeri President Geydar Aliyev and  Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov made this known when they met  with Aleksandre Chikvaidze, Georgian Foreign Minister, who had a  stopover in Baku on his way to Iran.    Internal conflicts, the Azeri leaders think, are likely to  make the CIS an unviable organizations.    Informed sources in the Azeri leader's headquarters told  Interfax that economic cooperation between Georgia and  Azerbaijan and the situation of Azeris in Georgia as well as  cooperation between the two countries in the CIS framework had  been discussed. An agreement was reached on opening a Georgian  embassy in Baku and an Azeri embassy in Tbilisi.</p>

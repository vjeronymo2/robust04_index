			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / ILO conference targets welfare THE annual conference of the International Labour Organisation opened in Geneva yesterday against a gloomy backdrop of rising unemployment, poverty and discrimination. On the agenda of the three-week conference are reports documenting a record 113 alleged violations of trade union rights and freedoms, as well as growing job discrimination based on race, nationality and religion. The main theme of the conference this year is the need to improve social welfare systems in both rich and poor countries. The 2,000 or so delegates will also discuss new international rules for preventing big industrial accidents and protecting part-time workers. The report on breaches of the ILO's freedom of association convention, which upholds trade union rights, singles out El Salvador for severe violence against trade unionists, including murder, kidnapping, disappearance, physical assaults and death threats. The ILO also calls on the Salvadorean government to release jailed trade unionists. The Ivory Coast is criticised for interference with trade union activities, including arrests and dismissals of trade union members. Britain has come under fire for the ninth time since 1979. The latest complaint relates to trade unionists dismissed or unable to find a job because they were on a recruitment blacklist compiled by the Economic League, an employer-funded organisation. The 163-nation ILO, whose aims include the eradication of poverty and unemployment, is organised on a tripartite basis, with governments, employers and trade unions all represented. The conference costs the ILO about Dollars 6m, against a total annual budget of around Dollars 280m. Governments pay the travel and hotel costs of their employer and trade union representatives.</p>

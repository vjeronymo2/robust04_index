			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Beijing] </F>   [Text] Choe Han-chun, councilor of the North Korean Embassy  in Beijing, stated on 16 May that there is no reason North Korea  should receive U.S. sanctions, even if North Korea has begun  changing its nuclear fuel rods without the presence of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The North Korean  councilor said in a news conference held in Beijing that IAEA  inspectors could have arrived in time to witness the replacement  work as they had enough advance notice.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (14): Facing up to 'kerb appeal' / Profile of Farmington Stone Traditional rural industries, including quarrying, have suffered a sharp decline in recent years, but one Gloucestershire company has bucked the trend dramatically. Farmington Stone, in the heart of the Cotswolds east of Cheltenham, has seen demand for its products surge. It has exported paving stones to Beirut and fireplaces to Hong Kong and Dallas, as well as supplying housebuilders and the construction industry in the UK with its honey-coloured local stone. The quarry, part of a 1,000-acre estate, was acquired in 1902 by the grandfather of the present owner, Capt John Barrow, and run for years as a profitable but minor sideline. 'It ticked along perfectly happily, with half a dozen men, waiting for people to walk through the door and place an order,' says Capt Barrow. Then, in 1987 it was decided to give more attention to stone production, when European Community regulations made farming less profitable. The timing was ideal, because there was growing demand for stone of all kinds as the boom in domestic and prestige public building gathered pace. Over Pounds 500,000 was invested in new workshops, offices, quarrying and processing equipment in order to increase output, improve quality and widen the product range. There are now six mobile mini production lines in the middle of the quarry. The recent recession brought its problems, particularly in the construction industry, where contracts dried up and there were payment difficulties especially from the bigger contractors. New markets had to be developed, and two were specifically targeted: housebuilding and decorative products, such as paving stones, flooring, fireplaces and garden statues. Although housebuilding went through a notoriously difficult patch, demand has soared in recent months, partly because of a general improvement in the market and partly because of a change in perceptions towards natural stone. Mr Martin Robins, managing director of Farmington Stone, argues that builders, architects and housebuyers have had to be educated into accepting that stone, traditionally regarded as expensive, need add very little to the cost of a house. 'We estimate it adds around 1 per cent but greatly increases what is called the kerb appeal of a house,' he says. The market for stone facing has 'really taken off' in the last few months, helped by the increased influence of the green lobby and the emphasis on the use of natural products. There has also been a big growth in sales of flagstones and fireplace surrounds through retailers and a sales force of 30, and these decorative products now account for around 50 per cent of turnover. The limestone quarry, in use since Roman times, has sufficient reserves of good stone to last a further 50 years at the present rate of extraction of an acre every five years. But there is one big problem. 'We could take on 20 more workers and run shifts round the clock for seven days to fulfil orders, but we can't get the people,' says Mr Robins. The difficulty is location. Farmington is miles from anywhere, is not served by public transport, and pays local wages for labouring work. Nevertheless, it is ironic that in a county that faces growing employment difficulties as rural and defence industries run down, the job offers have no takers.</p>

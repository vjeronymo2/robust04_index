			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 1 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following a short  overnight lull, fighting in the triangle between Cajnice, Foca  and Gorazde continued unabated around 0500 today, even though an  attempted Muslim breakthrough launched from Gorazde on Tuesday  and Wednesday ended in complete failure, the command of the Serb  forces announced. The command said that the fiercest fighting  was in the region of Gradina hill. These are the fiercest  Serb-Muslim clashes in this area since the beginning of the war,  with both sides using all types of weapons. The surrounding  mountains have been ringing with deafening explosions and  incessant shooting.    Two Serb fighters were killed in almost hand-to-hand  fighting  yesterday. According to Serb Command estimates, about 100  members of the Muslim units have been put out of action.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Where the bus stops When the Conservative government was re-elected on April 9 it was put about, with no resistance from Downing Street, that bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. We were, it was said, about to enter a period of everlasting prosperity and near-zero inflation. A wave of confidence, previously held back by fears of a Labour victory, would wash over the economy. The British presidency of the European Community would crown the year. A mere 85 days later, it all seems to be going wrong. Mr John Major is struggling to save his European strategy. The economy has failed to resurge. The recession is beginning to look endless. In such moments of gloom, politicians' thoughts turn to the ancient question  -who would become prime minister if the incumbent met with an accident, political or otherwise? The charming English way of putting it is, 'who is the bus candidate?' - who gets the job if the prime minister is run over by a bus? For the moment, I suspect, it is Mr Kenneth Clarke. Do not mistake me. Mr Major is performing well, perhaps never better than under fire in the Commons this week. It is exceedingly unlikely that he will be brought down by either the recession, or Maastricht, in spite of Lady Thatcher's onslaught yesterday afternoon. Yet his twin strategies of dovishness on the EC and hawkishness on inflation could fail. What then? His two immediate lieutenants, the foreign secretary and the chancellor, are direct accomplices, so rule them out as bus candidates. We are back to Mr Clarke. He has the look of a man who was slightly bewildered when he found on April 10 that he was home secretary. He was still busy shaking up the health service when, late in the summer of 1990, the then Mrs Thatcher moved him to education. He recovered from that. Then education needed turning upside-down. He knew how to do that, too. The Home Office is more complicated. In continental Europe, it would be a ministry of the interior; in the US, the Justice Department. In Britain, neither model is acceptable. US federal law is an alien concept. The overriding powers of an interior ministry are regarded as un-English. Mr Clarke's office is a rag-bag, taking on what other domestic departments decline. It handles petitions to the Queen, grants licences for scientific experiments on animals, and supervises cremations, burials and exhumations. Mr Clarke is putting the electoral boundaries bill (the bill to create between 15 and 20 more Conservative seats) through the Commons now and will doubtless one day be saddled with a Sunday trading free-for-all bill. He has a good track record for handling troublesome measures of this kind. Some of the organisational mess has already been tidied up. Responsibility for the press and broadcasting has gone to Mr David Mellor's new ministry for having a nice day. Mrs Gillian Shephard's employment department now looks after the Equal Opportunities Commission. The administration of magistrates' courts has been transferred to the lord chancellor. What the public expects of Mr Clarke, however, is safe streets, punished criminals and no immigrants. As to the latter, he believes strongly that tight controls on immigration are an essential prerequisite for good race relations. I think laws to keep blacks out encourage racialism, but, alas, this view does not prevail. The English capacity for pretending that immigration laws are non-racial is infinite. Mr Clarke, whose view of the law is that it should be genuinely colour-blind, will extend the remit of the asylum bill that was withdrawn when the election was called. He agrees that racialist attitudes among immigration officers must be curbed, but asserts that would-be illegal migrants try on so many dodges that it is little wonder that officials are jaded. Whatever he does is likely to cause a row. Crime is even more tricky. Since 1980, the Tories have spent Pounds 1bn on new jails. The new criminal justice act is designed to keep non-violent offenders out of them. Yet prisons will still be overflowing in the year 2000. Mr Clarke sees an inconsistency in a Tory government cutting the prison population for reasons of economy. He has to live with this. But he may try to economise by privatising more prisons. He will appoint a quasi-independent chief executive to manage the public part of the service, whose administration is due to move to its own premises. The police will be reorganised into larger units and may be diverted from non-core tasks, such as supervising football matches and writing traffic tickets. Police authorities will be reformed, he knows not yet how. All this should endear Mr Clarke to the rightwingers who are beginning to set their sights on Mr Major. They should beware. The home secretary is loyal to the prime minister. He is also a convinced European, favouring the EC, European Union, Emu, single currency and all. That should stop their bus.</p>

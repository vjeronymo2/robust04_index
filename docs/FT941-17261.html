			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Churchill receives further Pounds 5m cash injection Churchill Insurance yesterday announced that its parent company, Winterthur of Switzerland, had injected Pounds 5m in additional capital, paving the way for a further expansion this year in telephone sales of motor insurance. The new capital injection follows one of Pounds 6m last October and brings the company's total paid-up capital to Pounds 60m. The group insures about 500,000 motorists and began marketing home insurance policies last year. It currently insures about 35,000 householders and next month expects to announce pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.5m for 1993. In a separate development, Churchill this week assumed management control of Winterthur Tell, a new Winterthur subsidiary in Denmark. Like Churchill, Winterthur Tell will sell motor insurance by telephone directly to the public.</p>

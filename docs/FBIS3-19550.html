			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis </F> at a gathering organized by the Cyprus Studies Center at the  Hellenic Culture Center in Nicosia--live; the speech is entitled  "International and Regional Security Issues, Opportunities, and  Dangers for Hellenism"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Despite its instability and  problems, the new world order being formulated offers huge  opportunities for Hellenism if we can see far into the future.  If we are united, have plans, vision and determination, and if  we proceed, this can be a golden era for Hellenism, which has  every capability to become an important regional economic force  in the Balkans, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. In this  era, Hellenism has the capability to play its historic role,  because it is situated at the crossroads of the North, South,  East, and West. We have the capability to shape the world's  cultural trends and once more influence political developments  with the particular nature, originality, and expertise of Greek  civilization and its principles. Hellenism today has the  capability to proceed with united and planned collective  security in the region and to secure its own defense. Hellenism  today is alone capable of securing its own defense and  independence. [passage omitted]    The new world order has not yet shaped the form of  collective  security. We live in a transitional period, which will be long.  It is very possible that our entire life will be spent in that  transitional period. The new, balanced world system that will  be born could come in time. We must accept that we live in an  unstable and transitional period that is full of problems but  also full of opportunities. It is very important to understand  the dimensions of the world system being formulated so that we  do not make the same mistakes we made in the past. We must  understand the new dimensions so that we might make the right  choices with planning and vision. [passage omitted]    There are three basic issues that should constitute the  basis  of Hellenism's national strategy. Seeing things beyond today's  difficulties, I think the three axis are the following: First,  Hellenism's clear and firm European orientation. Second, a  strong economic policy by Greece and Cyprus for economic  cooperation in the Balkans, Black Sea countries, eastern  Mediterranean, and Africa. Third, and in parallel with the first  two, is the formulation of a defense policy that will cover  Hellenism's unified area.    The Cold War put Hellenism somewhere on the sidelines of  European developments. This should change. Greece is today a  firm member of the European Union, inside which it must fight  for Greek issues. Greece's basic goal is and should be the  immediate accession of Cyprus to the European Union. The  Europeans should realize that Europe's border does not stop at  Greece. Europe's border, its responsibility for collective  security, ends at the independent Republic of Cyprus. Europe  owes this to Hellenism because the Greek tradition forms its  cultural and political base. But Europe also needs Greece and  Cyprus' Hellenic element to compete with the other groups in the  regions where Hellenism can be first, that is, the Balkans and  Middle East. The fight may be hard. Greece was often isolated  in the European Union while fighting the struggle for Cyprus.  But we fight and we will win the struggle together, and in 1995  the issue of Cyprus' accession to the united Europe will at last  come up so that Hellenism will not be mutilated and divided. It  will be as it should be--one part of the European civilization  and idea.    The second issue we should follow is that of the great  economic opportunities offered to Greece's region and to Greek  business in small countries. There is another paradox: Whereas  competition exists within big economic groups, new technology  justifies the smaller countries operating within these groups.  It benefits the versatile countries, the countries with  business talents and those that can move quickly, to look into  the future and take on the risks. We are reliving the economic  opportunities that Hellenism had in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It is Hellenism's golden opportunity to develop economic  initiatives and cooperation throughout the Balkans and also in  Eastern Europe, the Black Sea, the east Mediterranean, and North  Africa. The move has already begun. Greek investment projects  in Bulgaria are second only to Germany's. Significant openings  have been made in Romania and further north, in Moldova. In  addition, when the civil war in Yugoslavia ends, Greece will  play a significant, dominant role in economic cooperation in the  area. Closer to Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, following  the moves between Israel and the Arab countries, Cypriot  Hellenism is in a good position to utilize the new possibilities  for cooperation that are available in the Middle East. [passage  omitted]    Now I come to the third issue, defense. Nothing would be  better for Hellenism than if we lived in a peaceful region, with  no problem of security, and if we had general disarmament,  because our civilization, our values, are based on the concepts  of democracy, peace, and cooperation among free peoples. It is  in this spirit that the president of the Republic of Cyprus was  right, very right, to propose, in connection with the island's  security, a general disarmament and the withdrawal of Turkish  troops so that the people themselves may use other methods to  solve their problems and live well. But this dream of peaceful  coexistence remains a dream; the reality is different, a  nightmare. Both Greece and Cyprus--two independent states but  both Hellenic--make the correct appraisal that they face the  common threat of Turkish expansionism. And, while we are  building the future with optimism and economic cooperation with  other peoples and the European Union, we have a duty to  ourselves, a duty to our history, to protect Hellenism, to  defend ourselves jointly. [passage omitted]    When two states judge that they face a common threat, the  least they must do--and woe betide them if they do not--is to  coordinate their defense plans so that their defense cooperation  can confront the threat more effectively. Speaking in the  Chamber of Deputies, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  said that any further advance of Turkey in Cyprus would be a  casus belli for Greece. As long as there is a threat, it  follows that our defense plans must be coordinated. The unified  defense area is an answer to this need. But I would like to  stress: Greece also has an increased responsibility toward  Cyprus. According to the Zurich Agreement, Greece is a guarantor  power for Cyprus and can do nothing but, as a guarantor power,  guarantee the independence of the independent state of Cyprus,  which is part of Hellenism. [applause]    The defense doctrine is a clearly defensive concept. I  repeat: Had there been no threat, had there been no illegal  occupation of part of Cyprus by Turkish troops, who, despite the  many UN resolutions have not withdrawn from Cyprus, had there  been no forceful demographic change caused by the [Turkish]  settlers, then the issue might have been different. But the  threat exists and the defense doctrine, the unified defense  area, is an attempt to restore the balance so that the feeling  of security may be consolidated within Cypriot Hellenism in that  Cyprus is not an open range, that all the Greeks [applause] are  together with the Cypriots. In times of danger we are all  Cypriots. [applause]    Serious work has already been done in the unified defense  area, which was announced by Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou and Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis last  November. The Cypriot defense minister's visit to Athens  followed and we held discussions on a specific basis. Serious  preparatory work has been carried out by leading members of the  Greek and Cypriot military General Staffs and we are discussing  the conclusions drawn by the military so that this week, I can  say, will be a historic one for promoting Greek- Cypriot defense  cooperation. Many decisions have been made and others will be  made but they cannot all be announced. Defense has this  peculiarity: You do things first and the people see them later.  You talk less and do more. This is what we are doing this  week. [applause]    The press has also reported various scenarios. We are  imaginative people and we like mythology, which is, after all, a  Greek product, but when we discuss national issues we should  spare the rumormongering and mythology. Doubtless, the  declaration of the unified defense doctrine disturbed many  quarters. There are many who want Hellenism to be weak, who  want to see Cyprus unable to negotiate its rights. Our answer  to them is that our defense doctrine is defensive. We recall  [Greek historian] Thucydides' words: The strong imposes on the  weak what his strength allows and the weak retreats as much as  his weakness forces him to retreat. I do not believe the  negotiations for a Cyprus solution can be conducted under the  current unequal terms of defense. The restoration of the  balance we seek does not go against programs for negotiations  and a Cyprus solution. On the contrary, it is a prerequisite  for a correct and peaceful Cyprus solution. This is so because  only when Cyprus has negotiating power, only when Cyprus has a  trustworthy defense, with its inclusion in the unified defense  area of Hellenism, only then can it go to the negotiating table  with its claims, which have been unanimously passed in UN  resolutions but have not been realized. We know we are in the  right but we also know another thing: To find our right we must  be united and strong. This means a unified defense area.  [applause]    So the efforts are in parallel, not in discord. Efforts must  be made to negotiate a viable Cyprus solution. I do not mean  tactical moves that fail to touch upon the problem's  substance--the illegal occupation by Turkish troops of the  independent Cyprus. [applause] A viable Cyprus solution should  start with and solve the question of the security and  independence of a UN member state-- Cyprus. To strengthen and  turn the negotiations in this direction, which is the only way  to solve the issue, we create our defense prerequisites. This  is primarily to discourage adventuring by some quarters, who,  sensing a defense weakness, might attempt, and why not, to  repeat something that was done in the past, in 1974. The  message must be passed to the other countries that the issue of  solving the Cyprus problem will be resolved on a basis in which  Cyprus has a trustworthy defense. This is the framework and  concept of the unified defense area. The first steps have been  taken; we will proceed quickly to consolidate this doctrine.    Hellenism has only one heart. We strike with one heart.  Greece and Cyprus have the same heart. There is no defense and  security of Cyprus separate from the defense and security of  Greece and there is no defense and security for Greece when  Cyprus is in danger. We are together in this struggle for  national survival, national vindication. We are together on a  difficult, uphill path. But, as I said earlier, I look far,  perhaps too far, to the horizon, where the future looks bright  if we can overcome our national weaknesses. Our national  strategy must be coordinated, planned, and united. We are faced  with many domestic problems, which can divide us. We may  quarrel. We are a people who like dialogue and dispute. We  have many domestic issues that can divide the parties. But on  national issues there must be unanimity, a national strategy for  all Hellenism. This message is beginning to reach other  countries. I felt really proud when foreign diplomats started  to ask me about the unified defense area and what it means.  They believed me, because they know that we are determined to  go ahead. For the first time I saw that they are beginning to  take us seriously. This way we will solve our issue.    I am not a daydreamer. I am one of many Greeks who believe  in their tradition and who believe we have a bright future.  Seeing this bright future beyond the difficulties, I see  nothing in which Hellenism is inferior. We can realize this  vision. To those who mistrust, those who doubt, I say: Why not  this vision? Greece has achieved it often. We will achieve it  this time too. We will win. [applause]</p>

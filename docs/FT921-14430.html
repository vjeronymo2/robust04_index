			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas Yesterday's initial 4 per cent jump in British Gas shares on its capitulation to the Office of Fair Trading showed how little faith the market had in the gasman's willingness to bow to the inevitable. The fact that the gain then all but evaporated was a more realistic measure of the difficulties Gas faces. Having claimed that its ability to meet shareholder expectations on dividends would be hampered unless its regulator also climbed down, Gas can do little more than put on a brave face while it is broken into pieces. The shares will increasingly suffer a two-way pull, with their yield attraction diminishing as their break-up value is clarified. The message will doubtless not be lost on investors in BT. As Sir Bryan Carsberg prepares to leave Oftel, his counterpart at Ofgas has shown what a determined regulator can achieve. A new incumbent at Oftel might choose to take up the challenge: a new government might conceivably require it.</p>

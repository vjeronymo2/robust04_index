			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Italian parties jockey for poll positions Italy's political parties are entering a decisive week to select candidates and refine their alliances before parliament winds up for the general election on March 27. The need to allocate parliamentary seats will concentrate minds among party leaders, who have so far focused on broad alliances and not yet grappled with the details of the election campaign. The jockeying for position among parties comes against the background of growing controversy over the role of the judges leading investigations of political corruption. Politicians from the Northern League, which is expected to perform well in the polls, have accused magistrates of political bias, or 'stop-watch justice', in deliberately timing recent arrests to cause embarrassment to some parties. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate-turned-politician who this month launched his Forza Italia political movement, took pains on Saturday not to attack the Milan magistrates who, on Friday, had ordered the arrest of his brother Paolo for alleged corruption. Speaking at Ancona, however, on the first step of a national tour to popularise Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi questioned the need for his brother's formal arrest in that the latter had already indicated his readiness to testify. The message was amplified by commentators on Mr Berlusconi's three Fininvest television channels, who implied at the weekend that the arrest may have been politically motivated by left-wing magistrates seeking to embarrass Forza Italia and its leader. The right of the judiciary to investigate corruption, in spite of increasing political sensitivity ahead of the election, was underlined by Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister. However, he also warned judges to be 'scrupulous' and avoid the impression of political interference. Support for the judiciary was echoed by Mr Giovanni Galloni, the deputy head of the magistrates' self-regulating council. He said: 'It is up to every politician and party to see that candidates under investigation should await the conclusion of their cases before seeking re-election.' The issue of re-election has focused on Mr Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democratic former prime minister, who has been urged to stand again by constituents in his political power base in the Avellino district, near Naples. In a separate development, indicating rising tension before the polls, Mr Bettino Craxi, a former Socialist leader, filed charges with Rome magistrates on Saturday against members of the Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communists, for alleged corruption. Mr Craxi's accusations came as Mr Sergio Cusani, the Milan financier on trial for alleged handling of political bribes for the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group, repeated allegations that it had paid L1bn (Pounds 400,000) to the former Communists to win support for special tax breaks for the company. In his first television interview, Mr Cusani also said he would arrange today to hand over L20bn of the L35bn in alleged covert Ferruzzi funds he controlled. The money, alleged to have been allocated for bribes to politicians, is part of the L150bn which magistrates believe was put aside by Ferruzzi to pay political bribes during the dissolution of the Enimont chemicals joint venture.</p>

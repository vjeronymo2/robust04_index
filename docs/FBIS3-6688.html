As a result, over 1,000 Thai nationals and over 15,000  Cambodians in Pailin and nearby areas fled into Thailand today  through the villages of Phakkat and Khlong Yai in Pong Nam Ron  District of Chanthaburi Province. More people are expected to  cross the border.    He said that since the task force was unable to push such a  huge number of refugees back into Cambodia, the Chanthaburi  Marine Task Force has been instructed to separate the fleeing  Thai nationals from the Cambodian refugees, who are now being  detained at Phakkat pending repatriation after the situation  returns to normal.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA  </P> <P> A 43-year-old man was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on 238 criminal counts  in connection with the molestation of six girls. It is the most extensive case  in county history.  </P> <P> After a three-day preliminary hearing in San Diego Municipal Court, Ezra Adams,  43, was ordered to appear in San Diego Superior Court on Feb. 8 for arraignment  and trial setting.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Richard Hanscom dismissed one count, saying the prosecution  failed to present any evidence to support it.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz unsuccessfully tried to get Adams' bail increased  from $500,000 to $1 million. In declining to grant the increase, Hanscom said  that Adams is unlikely to make bail even at $500,000.  </P> <P> The last witness during the preliminary hearing was a 17-year-old girl who  cried often and appeared frightened. She held her hand at the side of her face  constantly to avoid looking at Adams.  </P> <P> She said the molestation occurred over a period of years. "He told me he would  hurt me or kill me if I said anything," she testified.  </P> <P> Several recesses were called so the girl could collect her thoughts and regain  her composure.  </P> <P> The hearing was closed to the press and public Tuesday and most of Monday, on a  motion by Katz. He said it was too traumatic for four witnesses, all under 14,  to testify in open court.  </P> <P> Adams, a heavy machinery operator, was arrested Nov. 15.  </P></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM enters standstill agreement Invesco MIM, the international fund management group, said yesterday it had entered into a standstill agreement with its single largest shareholder, the Hong Kong-based investment company, Peregrine Investments. Peregrine has recently built up a 24.7 percent stake in Invesco through its Peregrine Asset Management subsidiary and the agreement provides broadly that it will not increase that stake beyond 24.9 per cent over the next two years. Announcement of the stake had prompted speculation that Peregrine might seek to make a bid for the entire company. Peregrine has also agreed to liase with Invesco MIM before disposing of its shares in the company. Meanwhile, Peregrine Investments chairman, Mr Philip Tose, has joined Invesco MIM as a director. The agreement provides that Mr Tose or any other Peregrine representative would leave the board if Peregrine's shareholding falls below 15 per cent.</p>

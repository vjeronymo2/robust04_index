			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Observer: Pulling power Dr Peter Williams has made an attractive start as chairman of Oxford Instruments Group by announcing an order for what may be the world's biggest superconducting magnet. Doughnut-shaped and measuring about 5 metres across, it will play a key role in physics experiments by the US Energy Department at Newport News. Williams, a physicist of 46, has been Oxford Instruments' chief executive since 1986. With Sir Austin Pearce's retirement, he also shoulders the chairmanship of the diversified electrical engineering concern. The order, due for delivery in 1994, is worth more than Pounds 3m. But Williams has an ambitious eye on a still bigger American physics experiment called the superconducting supercollider, being planned by the US government in Texas. The Oxford Instruments chief says at least half the cost - put at nearly Pounds 5bn - will go on some 7,000 superconducting magnets. The US electrical industry looks sure to get the lion's share. But Oxford is one of seven chosen suppliers of superconducting wire worth about Pounds 295m, and has been approached about building some of the trickier magnets. They are not expected to pose production problems but Williams would not be caught defenceless if they did. A customer in Japan once paid Williams the compliment of saying it had never known a foreigner apologise so graciously in Japanese for his company's falling behind time.</p>

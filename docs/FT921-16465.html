			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sharp reversal of early share gains A HIGHLY volatile session opened the new year in the UK stock market, with active trading in stock index futures failing towards the close to sustain the underlying blue chip shares. In early trading the market raced through the FT-SE 2,500 mark to touch 2,530.8, an area last seen in mid-November. But London fell into negative territory when Wall Street opened smartly lower and the final reading showed the Footsie 0.3 off on the day at 2,492.8. Traders expressed disappointment at the evident unwillingness of the institutions to support share prices at the higher levels reached over the thinly traded Christmas period - especially in view of sterling's firmer performance yesterday. The Christmas advance had been in part spurred by demand for the Footsie futures contract from two leading US securities houses, and there were signs of strain between the stock market and the derivatives sector. The March futures contract, which took over from the December contract yesterday, remained at a strong premium to the cash index but the underlying stocks were sold towards the close of the trading session as Wall Street's Dow Average opened 18 down following the latest report from US purchasing managers. The early spurt put a gain of 37.7 on the Footsie but the later swing in the market showed up significantly in prices of those stocks traditionally seen as solid blue chips. SmithKline Beecham, finally a mere few pence higher, had shown a near 60p gain in the middle of the day. 'This is a worrying trend,' commented Mr Ian Stephenson at Salomon International. Extreme volatility in relatively light trading volume has become a factor in the London market, presenting market traders with significant problems. Equity turnover was slow at first but speeded up later when share prices came under pressure. The final total of 457.1m shares compared with 318.1m for the half session on New Year's Eve. Equities made little immediate response to assurances from the Governor of the Bank of England that there was no immediate need to raise interest rates, although government bond prices rose smartly. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett said that economic pessimism had been overdone in the weeks leading up to Christmas and that the London market was likely to extend its rally towards Footsie 2,700 ahead of the UK general election which must be held this year. For the moment, however, equity traders are waiting for the UK fund managers to show their hands in the London stock market. At Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, Mr Sushil Wadhwani reiterated the view that UK equities are undervalued, suggesting that the market could rise by about 30 per cent this year if the Conservative government is re-elected. Goldman questions the wisdom of moving from UK equities into government bonds. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, warned that the rise in German interest rates and possible setbacks on Wall Street could mean further downside for UK equities in the near term. However, it believes that short-run problems should not distract from longer term prospects. Kleinwort predicts that, on a year's view, UK equities will offer good, real, returns  -'well ahead of gilts and cash'.</p>

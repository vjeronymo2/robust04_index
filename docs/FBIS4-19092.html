			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Bulgarian Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov,  who arrived on an official visit to Ankara, has begun his  contacts. On his arrival at the National Defense Ministry,  Aleksandrov was received by National Defense Minister Mehmet  Golhan with a military ceremony. In a statement at the meeting,  Golhan said that Bulgaria's relations with Turkey have developed  after that country's transition to democracy. Aleksandrov  stressed that Bulgaria's relations with Turkey are developing in  the field of defense industry.    Aleksandrov later called on Chief of Staff General Dogan  Gures. At the meeting, Gures said that if the aggressors in the  Balkans are not punished this will set an example and lead to  graver results. Pointing out that the fighting in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is not between soldiers but that the Serbs  are killing civilians, women and children, Gures expressed  satisfaction over the NATO operation against the Serbs.  Aleksandrov said that Bulgaria favors securing peace without  resorting to arms in the Balkans.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERILOUS VERSES  </P> <P> While Kushwant Singh's article on Salman Rushdie's case, "How India Lost a  Great Writer" (Book Review, Aug. 27) was informative, going so far as to rue  the loss to India of a great writer, it begs what may be the question of the  heart of the matter: I mean ignorance and despotism.  </P> <P> To any disinterested reader, the novel's theme is simply and clearly that of  reconciliation: the son with the father, and a man with his natal culture. It  is the loss to Indian culture that Singh deplores, indirectly condemning, so  far it is safe for him to do so, Indian bigotry. If he is not condemning that,  then he weeps crocodile tears.  </P> <P> What Singh fails to mention, and none of the reviewers of "The Satanic Verses"  has pointed it out either, so mesmerized by the brouhaha over Rushdie's acid  mockery of false, mythologized history enshrined as articles of faith by  dictatorial mullahs, is the most likely cause of the Ayatollah Khomeini's  interdiction: his direct attack on the overthrow of the Shah's regime by the  fundamentalists.  </P> <P> In a digression of only seven pages in the American edition (210-216), Rushdie  tells in a fairy- tale style of the overthrow of the "Empress of Persia" by  waves of fanatic students. The new regime, under the "Imam," undertakes to  abolish history and replace it with eternity. Eternity in our historical world  of living things of course can only mean a living death. And that has always  been the aim of despots.  </P> <P> In retrospect, those mere seven pages may have come to seem, even to Rushdie, a  fatally gratuitous misstep. They may be what brought about the Ayatollah's ire,  and resulted in his decree of death against the writer who mocked him  personally. All the rest, the furor of demonstrations, the rioting, seems to  have followed upon the issuance of Khomeini's ukase -- the order went out, a  murder contract was publicly announced. One may be pardoned for thinking that  Islam has little enough to do with it all, since the world is well aware that  practically none of the people in those mobs of Indian and Pakistani protesters  could have read "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> So far as those seven pages written against the Ayatollah are concerned, it  should also be remarked that the defense of Rushdie's freedom to write satire  against tyrants is ultimately based on them alone, and not on the arabesquerie  of his immensely witty historical fantasies. To my recollection, none of the  many speakers in the protests against censorship of Rushdie made that point.  But that is what lies at the heart of the struggle against intimidation by  terrorists who threaten publishers and booksellers. Inasmuch as the death  sentence has not been revoked by Khomeini's heirs -- Rushdie must remain in  protective custody -- let us not forget that all who dare to criticize are  still the potential targets of terrorist attacks directed by fundamentalist  despotism.  </P> <P> JASCHA KESSLER  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE NFL: WEEKEND CLOSE-UP;  </P> <P> EVEN STEELERS GET DOWNRIGHT OFFENSIVE  </P> <P> Was any offense lost with the NFL's decision to speed up games?  </P> <P> Not by Sunday's results, when even Pittsburgh scored an offensive touchdown. In  fact, the Steelers scored four of them, three in a 17-minute span.  </P> <P> After an average of 39 points per game over the first four weeks -- two fewer  than for the 1989 season -- almost 49 points per game were scored in 11  contests Sunday.  </P> <P> Yes, defense and special teams kicked in, especially in Buffalo, where the  Bills scored 17 fourth-quarter points with defense and special teams in their  38-24 victory over the Raiders.  </P> <P> But in Anaheim, the Bengals and Rams combined for 1,040 yards as Cincinnati  won, 34-31, in overtime. (Story, C1.) Boomer Esiason threw for 471 yards and  Jim Everett had 372, making Chris Miller's career best 366 yards for Atlanta  only the third-best performance of the day.  </P> <P> Five receivers -- three Bengals and two Rams -- had more than 100 yards  receiving.  </P> <P> In Atlanta, the Falcons beat the Saints, 28-27, in a game in which there were  just three punts. Atlanta didn't punt until the third quarter.  </P> <P> Then there were the Steelers, who finally scored an offensive touchdown after  19 quarters, then added three more in a 36-14 victory over San Diego.  </P> <P> INCONCLUSIVE: This was the first week in which teams that had a week off  resumed play. The results were . . . inconclusive.  </P> <P> Two of the teams played each other, with Atlanta beating New Orleans.  </P> <P> But both the Rams and 49ers got off to slow starts, San Francisco falling  behind before winning, 24-21, in Houston. The Rams fell behind 21-0 against the  Bengals -- who had lost Monday night and spent the week in Seattle -- before  rallying to send the game into overtime.  </P> <P> The Rams lost anyway, 34-31.  </P> <P> "I really don't think the bye was a factor," said Rams quarterback Jim Everett.  "I still look at it as a positive. We had some guys injured who came back and  played very well, although we did start out a little slower than we would have  liked to."  </P> <P> MOTIVATOR GONE: The Bills kept the Raiders from finally fulfilling their wish.  That is, Art Shell was motivating his team by telling them "people think we're  the worst 3-0 team in the league," then "people think we're the worst 4-0 team  in the league."  </P> <P> Had they held their 10-point fourth-quarter lead Sunday night, they would have  been the worst 5-0 team in the league because they would have been the only one  -- the 49ers (4-0) were off a week ago and the Giants (4-0) were off Sunday.  </P> <P> HE'S BACK . . . : After becoming the star of the pregame shows with his almost  flawless performance this season, Kansas City's Steve DeBerg had a game that  showed why he's floated from Dallas to San Francisco to Denver to Tampa Bay to  Kansas City since 1977. In the Chiefs' 23-19 loss to the Colts, he threw his  first three interceptions of the season and was 16 of 36 for 212 yards.  </P> <P> AND HE'S BACK . . . : Seattle's Derrick Fenner was held to two touchdowns as  the Seahawks beat New England, 33-20. That gives him eight in his last three  games.  </P></p>

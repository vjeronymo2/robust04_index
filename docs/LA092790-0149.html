			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CERRITOS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL RAISES QUESTIONS ON STATE HOUSING MANDATE  </P> <P> The Planning Commission and city staff have been asked by the City Council to  wrestle with a litany of questions about such things as how Cerritos can  finance affordable housing and whether it can govern the sale of such homes.  </P> <P> Under state law, Cerritos must begin setting aside 20% of its redevelopment tax  money in 1995 to provide low- and moderate-income housing.  </P> <P> So far, the city has no plans on how it will meet the state mandate, although  the council discussed the issue at its meeting last week for the first time.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of things we did not know," Mayor Ann Joynt said. "Primarily,  we did not know what was legal."  </P> <P> If the city does build affordable housing, some council members have said they  want the sale of the homes restricted to Cerritos residents.  </P> <P> The staff and Planning Commission will research the questions and report back  to the council. No date was set on when they would make their report.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO PROMISES TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON REUNION TOUR  </P> <P> The three surviving members of the legendary Who said Monday they're reuniting  this summer for a 25-city, 25th anniversary North American tour -- one that  could feature kinder, gentler-to-the-ears rock concerts.  </P> <P> The reason: ear damage to Who guitarist Peter Townshend caused by years of  loud, explosive, high-decibel rock that made the Who what some critics call one  of the half-dozen most influential bands in rock history.  </P> <P> The concern is how to perform "without creating further damage to my hearing,"  Townshend told a Radio City Music Hall news conference attended by about 70  reporters and photographers and seven TV news crews.  </P> <P> "I think we'll manage somehow," he added, then joked: "We'll play very, very,  very quietly."  </P> <P> The tour, which opens June 24 in Toronto, is to play Jack Murphy Stadium in San  Diego on Aug. 22, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Aug. 26, and close in  Oakland Coliseum Stadium on Aug. 30.  </P> <P> Appearing with singer Roger Daltrey and bassist John Entwistle, Townshend spoke  bluntly, almost wistfully, about his problem during the kickoff of the latest  instance of British lords of middle-aged rock again preparing to go forth and  boogie.  </P> <P> The Rolling Stones, who like the Who now are in their 40s, also are due to  start a North American tour, possibly around Labor Day, with a guarantee  reported at between $65 million and $70 million.  </P> <P> The Who, which broke up after its last tour in 1982, but got together for the  "Live Aid" concert in England in 1985, will have drummer Simon Phillips on the  tour, succeeding Kenney Jones, who had joined the band after the death of  drummer Keith Moon in 1978. The group also will include keyboardist John  Bundrick, horns, percussion and three back-up singers.  </P> <P> The tour is expected to gross about $35 million before expenses and promoters'  fees, according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> Townshend called the tour a special-occasion-only "25th birthday party" that  will play three Canadian and 22 U.S. cities, all in outdoor stadiums, with an  average ticket price, the spokesman said, of $22.50.  </P> <P> It also will play, for charities for children and young people, two full  performances of its rock opera, "Tommy." The first set for June 27 at Radio  City Music Hall, the second for Los Angeles late in the tour. No Los Angeles  location has been set, but sources said chances are it will be the 6,600-seat  Universal Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Unlike the coming Stones trip, which will follow the release of a new album, no  album has been recorded to coincide with the Who tour.  </P> <P> "We weren't trying to resurrect the band," Daltrey, at 45 the oldest Who, told  reporters at the 35-minute news conference, aired live by the Westwood One  radio network.  </P> <P> One reason the band stopped touring, he said, is that it tired of the  "tour-album-tour rat race."  </P> <P> The band is doing this tour, he said, only as a 25th-anniversary "celebration  of the music, and an album might come and might not . . . if we do it, we'll do  it because it's fun."  </P> <P> Townshend, 43, a rock-guitar virtuoso whose early years in the band including  smashing his guitars to signal a concert's finale, has publicly spoken before  of his rock-damaged hearing.  </P> <P> The matter arose again Monday when he was asked if there will be a second  guitarist playing with the Who on this tour. Yes, he said, but didn't identify  the musician.  </P> <P> Then, sounding what seemed a cautionary note, he said that his own hearing  problem is diagnosed as tinnitus, a ringing in the ears and pain when exposed  to loud music. He wryly noted that many young rockers like to listen to rock  through their earphones, drink whiskey and play loud guitar.  </P> <P> "That's what I liked to do, and I've shot my hearing," he said, joking that on  the tour he's "going to play a bit like John Denver."  </P> <P> Later, when asked if he'd been reluctant to do the tour, he said no, that in  fact he'd been the prime mover of it, but "the problem has been the worry about  the hearing. . . .  </P> <P> "You have to realize that I'm somebody who's actually disabled. I've actually  disabled myself doing my job."  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Advance at Mayne Nickless MAYNE NICKLESS, the Melbourne-based transportation and healthcare group which takes in Parceline, Interlink and Security Express in the UK and has interests in continental Europe, said yesterday it had seen an improvement in first-quarter profits, writes Nikki Tait. Both Interlink and Parceline had put in 'strong performances', shareholders were told at the company's annual meeting. However, Mayne admitted that, in some markets, prices were under pressures and volumes were showing little increase. Mr Bill Bytheway, managing director, said that the group expected to show an improvement in profits in the coming year - helped by a resolution to problems with transport divisions in Spain and Italy.</p>

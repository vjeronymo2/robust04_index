			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Marbaix merges Asquith and Butler to create single machine tool maker TWO OF the oldest UK machine tool builders, Asquith and Butler, are being merged into one company by their new owner to create a strong force in one of the most competitive industrial product markets. Marbaix Lapointe, the machine tool side of Marbaix (Holdings), a family-owned Basingstoke-based concern, has combined the two companies, both based in Halifax, to form Asquith Butler. The Asquith site will close and the entire company will move on to the nearby Butler site. The merger is the culmination of a plan by Marbaix to broaden its presence in the machine tool industry, after buying in 1987 the Lapointe broaching machine business. Last year Marbaix Lapointe purchased Asquith, founded in 1866 and best known for its vertical machining centres. Asquith had been subject to a management buy-out in 1981. Then in February it paid a nominal amount to the publicly-quoted B Elliott engineering group for Butler, which makes horizontal machining centres. Butler was founded in 1868 and had been combined by B Elliott with Newall, the Keighley-based blade-tip grinding business, which was excluded from the sale. Marbaix was attracted by the strength of the products and the personnel at Asquith and Butler, but because of the recession both companies were losing money. 'We have put together two companies that may not have survived on their own,' said Mr Peter Cain, managing director of Marbaix Lapointe, yesterday. The merger would produce economies of scale and better utilisation of factory equipment. Asquith Butler will have annual sales of Pounds 10m-Pounds 11m and about 120 employees - a large company for the machine tool industry. Mr Cain said competition, mainly from Spain and France, was serious, but he believed Asquith Butler would make a profit this year.</p>

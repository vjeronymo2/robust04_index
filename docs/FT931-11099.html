			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / People: Reducing Ladbroke's property exposure Cyril Stein, chairman of Ladbroke Group, is handing over the chairmanship of Ladbroke Group Properties, its property division, to John Anderson, its managing director. Anderson is also joining the main board of Ladbroke. Anderson (right), aged 44, is an accountant who has worked for Ladbroke since 1971. He joined the property division in 1979, becoming finance director in 1988 and managing director in February 1991. Ladbroke says Anderson will continue to report to Stein on property matters, although he will now have more authority over the day-to-day management of the division. Anderson's chief priority is to reduce Ladbroke's exposure to property, which has proved a serious liability during the property slump of the past three years. The group plans to reduce its portfolio of Pounds 1bn of office, retail and industrial property when it can achieve reasonable prices. Anderson is also responsible for the management of Ladbroke's property assets in the business as a whole, which are worth more than Pounds 2bn. In Ladbroke's last full year, which was 1991, the property division made a loss of Pounds 12.4m after write-downs against falling values. In the first six months of 1992, losses deepened to Pounds 14.8m in the property division.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Costain expected to cut 300 jobs MORE THAN 300 jobs are expected to be lost at Costain as part of a campaign to cut overheads by 30 per cent in the group's UK engineering and construction division. The move will swell the growing tide of redundancies in the recession-hit construction industry - where more than 400,000 jobs have lost since summer 1989. The construction and engineering division is to become Costain's largest on the completion of the sale of its profitable Australian coal-mining business for Pounds 123m to Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. As a first step Costain will close its engineering and construction division headquarters in Woking, Surrey, and move staff to the group's headquarters in south London. About 70 jobs are expected to go as a result. The group also plans to rationalise its regional construction businesses operating from a network of local offices. A further 250 jobs could go as a result. The redundancy package is expected to cost the group Pounds 800,000 for the closure of the Woking office and about Pounds 3m for the rationalisation of the division as a whole. Costain is expected to make savings of Pounds 8m a year from the rationalisation. The move is the latest in a series of actions by the group to generate cash to reduce large borrowings. The number of UK-based employees, mostly in engineering and construction, has fallen by 1,400 to 2,900 in the last 18 months. Contractors have appealed to the government not to cut spending on large infrastructure projects. They have warned that unemployment in the industry will soar if projects like the Pounds 1.6bn extension to London Underground's Jubilee Line are postponed.</p>

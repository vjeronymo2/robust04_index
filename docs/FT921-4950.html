			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A BIG seller in stock index futures early in the session triggered heavy falls in the March contract on the FT-SE and in the underlying cash market, writes Joel Kibazo. March started the session at 2,560 and was squeezed higher to 2,564 within minutes of the market's opening. However, a sizeable offer of the contract at around 10am started in what one dealer called 'panic selling', sending March into retreat to trade at a discount to fair value for most of the session thereafter and also leading the underlying cash market lower. The tentative opening on Wall Street and large buying from one securities house failed to halt further falls in the contract. March closed at 2,542, some 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 6. Turnover at 7,500 was an improvement on recent levels. In LTOM, turnover was also healthy, reaching 36,401 contracts. The FT-SE 100 index option was particularly busy, trading 10,736 lots. Among stock options, Land Securities led the league table with 3,063 lots dealt. This was followed by BAT at 2,364, and Rolls-Royce, which reported full-year figures, at 2,258 lots traded.</p>

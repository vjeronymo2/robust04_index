			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT DOES LAKERS' RILEY HAVE TO DO TO WIN AWARD?  </P> <P> I do not know how the NBA coach of the year is selected. I do know that the  fact that Pat Riley has never been selected is insulting to any honest fan of  the sport.  </P> <P> After the May 14 victory over Seattle, I was sure I had watched not only a  great team but an extraordinary coach at work.  </P> <P> More than anything, that victory said for me -- "In your face, Tom Heinsohn" --  and everybody else who refuses to give this team and this coach their due.  </P> <P> MICHAEL FREAS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE DEMISE OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY TRAUMA CENTER  </P> <P> Regarding the closure of the Fountain Valley Regional Trauma Center:  </P> <P> During the past 20 years I have been integrally involved in the emergency  medical systems in Southern California. I have worked as an ambulance driver,  emergency medical technician and as a charge nurse in the trauma unit at  Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.  </P> <P> During the past two decades, I have directly observed the relationship between  the progress in the emergency medical service and patient survival. Accidents  can happen to anyone, anywhere and at any time. Sure, there are deaths from  severe head and spinal injuries. But dozens of people survive and resume normal  or near-normal activities, thanks to timely intervention.  </P> <P> Trauma centers are a vital link in the emergency medical system. Each of us has  a stake in their continued service. Every time one closes, it further burdens  the remaining trauma centers and community resources, thereby accelerating  their demise. This ultimately impacts us all personally and economically.  Paramedics delivering trauma patients to non-trauma facilities does not work.  Trauma centers have trained professionals on standby to perform dramatic  interventions that do indeed save lives.  </P> <P> The public must act now. Your children, neighbor or you may be the next  accident victim to benefit from a sound emergency/trauma program -- or die en  route to a distant facility or an inadequate one. The private sector can no  longer afford to provide costly emergency and basic medical service without  reimbursement.  </P> <P> Government continually underpays for services rendered, and the average patient  cannot cover the cost of an underinsured hospital visit. Orange County is one  of the richest counties in the country. It must have the clout to secure  continued viability of our successful emergency medical system for all members  of our society, rich and poor, young and old.  </P> <P> CHUCK LOHRSTORFER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a briefing after the extraordinary meeting of  the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] National Coordinating  Council, the SDS confirmed its intention to prompt the  resignation of the government, which it blames for the financial  crisis in the country.    If the parliament does not adopt an appropriate decision on  the cabinet's policy, the SDS will propose a new vote of  no-confidence. The SDS will organize a rally on 5 April at St.  Aleksandur Nevski Square in Sofia.</p>

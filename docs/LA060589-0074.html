			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Casino Workers OK Contracts: Workers at six of Nevada's largest hotel-casinos  ratified new five-year contracts by a near-unanimous vote, apparently ending  the threat of a crippling gaming industry strike that would have dampened a  booming Las Vegas economy. Members of Culinary Local 226 and Bartenders Local  165 ratified agreements, by a vote of 4,378 to 130, with Circus Circus, the  Tropicana, Bally's, Caesars Palace, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo  Hilton. The contracts provided for a $1.25-an-hour wage increase over the life  of the contract, a 95-cent-an-hour boost to health and welfare pension funds  and tightened job security.  </P></p>

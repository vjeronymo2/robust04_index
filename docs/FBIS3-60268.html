The environment there is already threatened enough by  uranium  mines, settling basins for uranium ore dressing, and a storage  facility for galvanic sludge, representatives said. Even the  income and the jobs that the construction of a storage facility  would bring to the region, whose unemployment rate is above the  average for the Czech Republic, would not make up for the threat  to the environment.    In the spring a meeting of all the mayors of communities on  whose territories the storage facility might be constructed is  to take place.</p>

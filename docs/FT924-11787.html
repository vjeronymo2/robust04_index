			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Monitors move to plug international loopholes THE international system of bank regulation failed to put an effective brake on the fraudulent behaviour of BCCI. Thus one of the Bank of England recommendations for reform following Lord Bingham's report is that the UK Banking Act should be amended to prevent an international bank from exploiting loopholes in the international regulatory system. The Banking Act will be reformed so that a bank will not be able to operate in the UK if the Bank is concerned that it cannot obtain sufficient information on the institution's overseas operations. One of BCCI's consummate skills was in playing regulators in one country off against those in another. These regulators are already taking steps to try to prevent any other bank from using BCCI's devices to avoid proper scrutiny. BCCI's success in eluding effective supervision stemmed from a separation between its domicile and the location of the bulk of its operations. Its overall holding company was incorporated in Luxembourg, as was one of its subsidiaries. Prime responsibility for ensuring BCCI was sound and properly managed therefore rested with the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois. In theory, this meant that the IML was responsible for monitoring all BCCI's international operations on a consolidated - or unified - basis. However, the bulk of BCCI's activities - 98 per cent of them, according to the IML - took place outside Luxembourg. As a result the IML, with its limited resources, found the task of overseeing all these international operations 'rather beyond them', according to the Bank. To the IML's credit, in 1985 it notified BCCI's other regulators that it was uncomfortable with the task of supervising this corporate octopus. A college of regulators was established in 1987, on the IML's initiative, so that regulators from eight countries would jointly take responsibility for BCCI. This college proved to be incapable of monitoring BCCI closely enough. It was not until 1990, when the Bank began belatedly to take a close interest in BCCI's activities, that regulators began to learn of the fraud at the bank. Not until early last year did the scale of the fraud become apparent. Regulators now agree that it would have been sensible for the Bank to have taken a closer interest much earlier. More of BCCI's business was in the UK than anywhere else. Only in a technical sense was it domiciled outside the UK. Over the past year, regulators have been trying to devise a way of closing the loophole that prevented BCCI from being properly supervised. The forum for debate has been the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, which comprises the supervisory authorities of the Group of 10 leading industrial countries and is chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In July the Corrigan committee issued new minimum standards which its members agreed to apply in the supervision of international banks. The committee made an unambiguous commitment that international banks would be policed rigorously on a worldwide basis by a single regulator. A bank not supervised in this way would be barred from the territories of signatories to the agreement. The minimum standards had four main features: Any international banking group should be supervised on a 'consolidated basis', taking account of its operations anywhere in the world, by a single home country authority. To set up branches in a jurisdiction outside its home country, a bank would need regulators' consent in both home and 'host' countries. A home-country supervisor should have the right to receive information on the international operations of banks under its supervision. If a country was unhappy about the international supervision of a bank whose domicile was elsewhere, it could impose 'restrictive measures' on branches of that bank on its territory. These could extend to closing down the bank. These standards will not be easy to implement. Legal impediments, for example, prevent supervisors in some jurisdictions - even in the US - from passing information on banks to supervisors elsewhere. Some regulators are concerned that the reforms do not go quite far enough. There is, for example, no formal mechanism for ensuring that signatories to the standards implement them. Meanwhile, the reforms of the Banking Act proposed yesterday by the Bank and the government will give the Bank greater powers than those necessitated by its participation in the Corrigan committee agreement. The Bank will be able to refuse authorisation to a bank if it sets up branches in countries lacking an effective supervisor, irrespective of the quality of the supervision in the bank's home country. To prevent a repetition of BCCI, trust and co-operation between regulators is essential. But equally important is the need for individual regulators to make their own judgments about the fitness of a bank - and not pass the buck to other regulators.</p>

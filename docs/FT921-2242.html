			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Sikh militants shoot 20 dead in street LUDHIANA, the industrial capital of the Punjab, has become the focus of a new wave of terrorism by Sikh militants seemingingly aimed at deterring investment in the state and undermining the legitimacy of the new state government. Militants on Wednesday night sprayed crowded streets with machine gun fire, killing 20 people and seriously wounding 20 more. This is the third such incident in a week in which militants have indiscriminately opened fire, causing large casualties. Three days ago 18 people were mowed down in Ludhiana - a town that even a year ago counted itself free from violence. A week ago 15 executives of Indian Acrylics were killed at Sangrur while on the site of a new plant being established in collaboration with Dupont, the US chemicals company. Ludhiana yesterday was placed under indefinite curfew as angry crowds blamed police and the government for failing to provide adequate security. Elsewhere in the state 16 people were reported killed in further violence. The wave of killings coincides with moderate Sikh organisations reversing their long held position of accepting that the Punjab should remain a part of the Indian union. On Wednesday,the moderate Sikh organisations which boycotted the recent state assembly and parliamentary elections in the Punjab made common cause on a public platform for the first time to call for secession from India and a separate Sikh state of Khalistan. The Sikh organisations declared that they were no longer interested in remaining part of India 'after 45 years of state repression and denial of justice'. The new stance of the Sikh moderates means a further polarisation in the state with moderates and terrorists now joining forces against the Congress state government elected last month. The newly elected members of the 117-seat state assembly were sworn in on Monday as it met for the first time in 57 months. During this period Punjab has been under direct rule from Delhi. Both Sikh militants and moderates are denying legitimacy to the assembly which they describe as a puppet body. Congress won virtually all the seats after the Sikh parties boycotted the election.</p>

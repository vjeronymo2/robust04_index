			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N.-IRAQ TALKS END SOURLY; NO PROGRESS NOTED  </P> <P> Two days of talks between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and  Iraq ended sourly here Saturday with a ringing Iraqi denunciation of the United  States and of U.N. resolutions designed to force a withdrawal from conquered  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz emerged from the talks here Saturday night  with a 10-minute no-progress monologue.  </P> <P> "This is a complex and dramatic situation. Such a situation cannot be resolved  by dramatic diplomacy. It needs patience," Aziz said, making clear that while  he had "listened carefully" to the U.N. leader, the two had found little common  ground.  </P> <P> Perez de Cuellar came to Jordan on Thursday armed with U.N. resolutions  demanding unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the ousted  Kuwaiti government and the release of all hostages held by the Baghdad  government.  </P> <P> A month of unremitting regional tension appeared to ease a notch Friday, when  Perez de Cuellar and Aziz decided to extend their talks to a second day  Saturday.  </P> <P> After a morning round of talks between legal experts, the two diplomats met  twice Saturday for more than four hours. As they talked, Jordanian officials  spoke privately of progress in substantive discussions that they expected would  continue today.  </P> <P> It didn't turn out that way. On Friday, Aziz and Perez de Cuellar had shared  the post-meeting spotlight on the steps outside Jordanian King Hussein's  limestone royal palace here in a brief encounter with jostling reporters.  </P> <P> Saturday, Aziz emerged alone, standing in stiff self-righteousness to drive  home an Iraqi position on Kuwait that has yet to contemplate the unconditional  withdrawal demanded by an unprecedented international unanimity.  </P> <P> He jabbed at the United States, a nation, he said, that "supports aggression"  and that takes a flavor-of-the-month approach to global traumas.  </P> <P> "They select an international crisis . . . and tell the world this is the most  important thing. They do this out of their selfish policies and  self-interests," Aziz asserted.  </P> <P> He pummeled the United Nations, an organization, he said, which voted sanctions  in "a hasty decision" that never allowed Iraq the chance to present its case.  </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council, Aziz said, is controlled by five major powers, some  of "which have not been good friends of this region. . . . The Security Council  is an international body, yes, but it is formed of governments, and those  governments are not neutral."  </P> <P> "Imagine if the Arabs had the power of veto in the Security Council. . . ," he  pondered wistfully. "These resolutions would not have passed."  </P> <P> In the United Nations, veto power is reserved to the five permanent members of  the council, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France,  all of which demand Iraq's unconditional withdrawal and support the use of  forceful measures to enforce a trade blockade against the Baghdad regime.  </P> <P> Iraq, backed by Jordan and a minority of Arab governments, links any eventual  withdrawal from Kuwait to the departure of foreign troops from Saudi Arabia and  demands that any talks also resolve regional problems, not just the issue of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> "This is an Arab problem. It must be resolved by Arab means," Aziz said.  </P> <P> For his part, Perez de Cuellar had almost nothing to say, pointing to his  throat as he left the palace with the grimace of a sore-throated person with no  words left. Asked by a shouting reporter if he and Aziz had discussed a  withdrawal, the Peruvian diplomat replied hoarsely, "We discussed everything."  The U.N. leader has scheduled a press conference here this morning before  leaving Jordan.  </P> <P> President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, confirmed that the  talks in Amman had produced no real progress.  </P> <P> "That's our understanding," Scowcroft told reporters at Bush's vacation home in  Kennebunkport, Me. ". . . After all, his negotiating framework is the five U.N.  resolutions, and what he went there for was to impress upon Saddam Hussein that  the world community has spoken. And so, unless Saddam Hussein is prepared to  meet that framework, why, it's difficult to see how there could be very  successful negotiations."  </P> <P> The apparent sinking of Perez de Cuellar's initiative narrows the diplomatic  search for a peaceful solution. Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet  next Sunday with Kuwait on their minds. But the only ongoing effort that  engages Iraq is a peace shuttle by Jordan's King Hussein. The monarch is in the  midst of a tour of North African and West European capitals, seeking support  for a compromise end to the crisis.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, smiling Jordanian officials expressed satisfaction that the  talks had quickly focused on concrete issues. A high Jordanian official  contended that even as delicate an issue as Iraq's proclaimed annexation of  Kuwait could be reversed through talks rather than threats of war.  </P> <P> "In one way or another, everything is on the table," he said. "One can assume  that substantive talks are under way and there can be some conclusion."  </P> <P> One official suggested that agreement could be reached by replacing Iraqi  troops in Kuwait with U.N. troops and American troops in Saudi Arabia with an  all-Arab force.  </P> <P> King Hussein has been praised by Aziz for trying to work out an "Arab solution"  to the crisis.  </P> <P> The term Arab solution has become a code word for giving Iraq a facing-saving  way out, perhaps by ceding Baghdad some Kuwaiti territory and by barring the  return to power of the Kuwaiti royal family.  </P> <P> But the unanimity implicit in the words Arab solution does not exist. A  majority bloc of Arab countries led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia are calling for  the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and reparation payments for  damage.  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Delta debt rating downgraded by S&amp;P DELTA Air Lines, the US carrier which last week slashed its dividend, yesterday saw its debt ratings downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, which said its move was based on Delta's continued heavy, albeit diminishing, losses. S&amp;P cited the impact of a slowing European economy on Delta's efforts to cut losses on the transatlantic routes it acquired from now-defunct Pan American World Airways, and increasing expenses and debt leverage from the company's requirement to implement a new accounting standard for retiree health benefits. It downgraded Delta's senior debt from Triple B to Triple B minus and its commercial paper to A-3 from A-2. Delta, which ranks with American Airlines and United Airlines as one of the three largest US carriers, cut its dividend last week from 30 cents a share to just 5 cents because of severe competition in the airline industry and the problems of digesting the Pan-Am assets. S&amp;P noted that Delta had occurred larger losses than any other US airline over the past 12 months, in spite of the fact that its competitive exposure to US carriers operating in bankruptcy and low-cost Southwest Airlines was more limited than that of its two main rivals. 'While performance is improving on the acquired routes, a sluggish economy in Germany, where Delta's Frankfurt hub is located, will slow the recovery effort,' it added. Corfo, the Chilean state holding company, plans to sell its 22.4 per cent interest in Lan-Chile, the loss-making national airline partially privatised in 1989, writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago. British Airways has announced an interest in acquiring a stake in the Chilean flag-carrier. Mr Robert Kay, BAs' general manager in Santiago, said negotiations on a purchase were taking place.</p>

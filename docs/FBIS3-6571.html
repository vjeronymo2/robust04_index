The ministers from the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum also agreed to review progress  of their work in another joint APEC conference to be held next  year in Indonesia.    "I have made numerous new friends this weekend (and) we have  established new relationships that each of us can build on,"  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in announcing the  conclusion of the first APEC finance ministers conference.  Bentsen, who hosted the two-day event, sounded upbeat about  what he called a "congenial" meeting of the minds among the 18  Pacific Rim ministers who attended the conference at a scenic  beachside hotel on this resort island.    Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also echoed  Bentsen's  sentiment. It is most gratifying that we are able to conclude  the meeting in this manner, Fujii told reporters.    Growing tension in the U.S. trade relations with China and  Japan did not appear to dilute the jovial, informal atmosphere  of an outdoor joint news conference.    "I am optimistic to work this type of concern out," Bentsen  said when asked about China's threatened "most-favored-nation"  (MFN) trade status with the United States. Bentsen also said  the U.S. is likewise "hopeful" of working out its trade disputes  with Japan. [passage omitted]</p>

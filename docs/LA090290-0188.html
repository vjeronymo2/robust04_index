			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING STOCK OF WALL STREET;  </P> <P> MARKETS: THE CRISIS-INSPIRED STOCK PLUNGE MATTERS, BUT STOCKS ARE AN UNRELIABLE  ECONOMIC BAROMETER. WHEN THEY CRASHED IN OCTOBER, 1987, NOT MUCH HAPPENED.  </P> <P> Fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis has drifted thousands of miles to Wall  Street, where the summer's rally has fizzled like a Roman candle.  </P> <P> As energy prices have soared, stock prices have plunged, capturing headlines,  spooking investors and fanning fears of recession. Overall, the market has lost  more than $324 billion in value since Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait,  according to Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> But for all the clamor, does the general public have reason to care?  </P> <P> "The stock market is just not that important -- particularly in its day-to-day  and week-to-week changes," argues David I. Levine, a professor of economics at  UC Berkeley's Walter A. Haas School of Business.  </P> <P> Despite the attention lavished on Wall Street, its significance in the grand  economic scheme remains unclear. Four out of five U.S. households own no stock  or mutual funds, excluding pension plans, according to studies at the  University of Michigan. Widespread forecasts that the crash of October, 1987,  would trigger an economic slump proved wrong.  </P> <P> Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss today's financial turmoil as unrelated to  the rest of the nation, some analysts say. Unlike the 1987 crash, it reflects  genuine economic problems that the public understands well: the damage that  higher energy costs can wreak in the form of inflation and higher interest  rates.  </P> <P> "We're not as wealthy as we were, there's no question about that," said Frank  C. Wykoff, an economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont. "(Iraqi  President) Saddam Hussein has done that to us, whether he meant to or not."  </P> <P> Economists pay attention to the stock market for a few reasons. Its changes  often mirror the public mood, as jittery stock movements seem to be doing right  now. A prolonged rise or fall may point the way to the future course of the  U.S. economy. Moreover, the skittish market has important, albeit indirect,  effects on the more plodding economy of industrial America.  </P> <P> "There is an economy of work and production, and there is an economy of  financial transactions," observed Robert L. Heilbroner, an economist at the New  School of Social Research in New York. "They are certainly bound together, but  they are certainly loosely bound together."  </P> <P> Indeed, the market's connection to things outside the financial world is tricky  to measure. Its record as economic seer, for instance, is decidedly mixed.  </P> <P> Government officials consider the stock market important enough to include in  their index of leading economic indicators, along with such weather vanes as  building permits and orders for business equipment.  </P> <P> Yet after the October, 1987, market debacle, the U.S. economy continued to  grow, with the help of lower interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve  Board. Similarly, a 190-point dive by the Dow Jones industrial index in  October, 1989, amounted to a blip on an analyst's computer screen, an economic  non-event.  </P> <P> "You pick any recession you want and you'd find the stock market started to  decline before it," said Edward E. Yardeni, director of economics at  Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "But the stock market has also  predicted a few we haven't had."  </P> <P> The market also is an unreliable barometer of spending in the economy.  </P> <P> Economists teach that declines in wealth translate to declines in spending,  perhaps a cutback of a few cents for each $1 lost. Yet the link is not easy to  establish after short-term market swings -- even huge ones.  </P> <P> Consider the 1987 slide. Between August and late October, more than $1 trillion  in "paper" wealth was erased, according to calculations by Wilshire Associates.  But to pinpoint a spending decline that is caused by short-term market swings  is like looking for "a needle in a haystack," Wykoff said.  </P> <P> A whole range of factors, including real estate values and job skills -- what  economists call human capital -- can affect a person's sense of affluence and  willingness to spend. A momentary jump in the stock market doesn't set off a  stampede of luxury purchases, and a temporary fall doesn't create widespread  panic.  </P> <P> For people to view stock market declines as more than ephemeral shifts on  paper, "I think people have to really begin to believe that it's a permanent  downward adjustment," said Dennis E. Logue, a financial economist at the Amos  Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.  </P> <P> "If the stock market blips up or blips down around some normal, long-run rate  of return, I'm not sure those blips matter very much."  </P> <P> What may matter more is the way that weakness in the market can dampen the  plans of business executives to spend and invest. When values are high, issuing  new stock can be a painless way for companies to raise investment money. When  values are low, by contrast, companies are forced to issue a larger number of  shares to raise the desired amount of cash.  </P> <P> But executives may not want to issue too many shares, in part because that  dilutes each shareholder's ownership stake in the company, said Richard J.  Sweeney, a professor of finance at Georgetown University.  </P> <P> As a result, rank-and-file workers may suffer because their wage prospects  ultimately depend on investments that will boost their productivity. "If I'm a  worker in that company, I'm not going to be getting more wages for being more  productive," said Sweeney. "That's not attractive."  </P> <P> The market also can affect some 43 million Americans who may own stock through  their private pension plans. Barring a financial cataclysm, however, the  effects are limited.  </P> <P> Most pensioners rely on a type of plan that provides a guaranteed benefit that  is not linked to market swings. Despite the October, 1987, crash, most pension  plans finished the year with more assets than they had at the beginning,  according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.  </P> <P> The same goes for retirees: Even most of those who took a hit in late 1987  finished the year better off than they were before the vast run-up earlier in  the year, EBRI found.  </P> <P> For workers and pensioners, a potential downside of prolonged weakness in the  stock market is that that their employer might be less likely to institute new,  improved benefits, said Joseph S. Piacentini, a research associate at the  institute.  </P> <P> "When the market is strong, it makes it cheaper to maintain a generous pension  plan," Piacentini said. "In the long run, with weaker markets you'd expect some  downward pressure on benefits."  </P> <P> Perhaps the least tangible way the stock market affects the overall economy is  the role it plays in shaping Americans' sense of financial security. The public  mood is important: Consumer spending amounts to two-thirds of all spending in  the economy and is tracked closely by analysts.  </P> <P> Forecasts that the 1987 crash would cause a recession assumed that  nerve-wracked consumers would hold off on major purchases, dragging down the  economy. In fact, auto sales fell after Black Monday, and there were other  warning signs of a broad slowdown. But when the crash was not followed by  ominous developments, such as a rise in unemployment, business picked up and  the economy continued to grow.  </P> <P> Today's worries are different, economists say, because they arise from  potentially serious economic problems that have nothing to do with the  spectacle on Wall Street. The current concerns also hit home in a way that the  1987 crash did not, because many adults retain distasteful memories of past oil  shocks.  </P> <P> In 1987, "People said this is just some funny gyration in the stock market, and  it doesn't affect me," observed F. Thomas Juster, a professor of economics at  the University of Michigan. "But everybody understands the effect of oil prices  on inflation. Now people say this is a real event."  </P> <P> As a result, overall consumer confidence in August plunged to its lowest level  in more than seven years, according to a survey by the Conference Board in New  York. Expectations about job availability and business conditions are the  gloomiest they have been in years.  </P> <P> But it would be wrong to cite the mercurial stock market as the main cause of  such doubts, said Jason D. Bram, an economist with the business research  organization. Job security, inflation and, to a lesser extent, interest rates  and real estate values, all influence the public's sense of well-being more  than the stock market does, he said.  </P> <P> Thus some experts would rank the latest sparks in the financial world way down  the list of what's really important to America's long-term prosperity. "If  you're worried about the future, you should be worried about infrastructure and  schools -- not the stock market and Iraq," counsels Berkeley's Levine.  </P> <P> THE VOLATILE STOCK MARKET  </P> <P> The crash of Black Monday, 1987, was part of a much larger slide that began in  late August and continued until late October. After a huge rally earlier in the  year, the market peaked on Aug. 25. The crash took place on Oct. 19, but the  market didn't hit bottom until Oct. 26.  </P> <P> This summer's rally came to an abrupt finale in mid-July, two weeks before the  Persian Gulf crisis. The recent peak was on July 16. But the slide didn't  accelerate until Iraq invaded Kuwait at the beginning of August. Stocks hit  their recent bottom on Aug. 23 and have recovered only partially.  </P> <P> The table below shows the Wilshire 5,000 index for these key periods. The index  seeks to approximate the dollar value of all stocks traded in the United  States.  </P> <P> THE CRASH OF 1987  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:2.55IN:1.89IN:2.55IN:2.55IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS"

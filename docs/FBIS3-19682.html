V."-initialled report: "1,049 Weapons Seized -- `Clear </F> Warning to International Criminals'"]    [Text] Bonn -- Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl  (Christian Democratic Union) assesses the result of the first  nationwide search operation against illegal owners of weapons as  "proof of successful police cooperation within the European  Union."    "Interpol, the Belgian police authorities, and the Federal  Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] have proved their  joining effectiveness," Bohl told WELT AM SONNTAG.    According to a now available balance sheet of a large-scale  search in 420 German towns, which was conducted the week before  last, a total of 1,049 weapons were seized, including seven  submachine guns and three fully automatic guns. In addition,  2.5 tonnes of ammunition as well as five hand grenades with  accessories were found.    Most of the weapons came from Belgium. Twelve suspects were  arrested and two arrest warrants were issued.    Said Minister Bohl: "This successful operation is a clear  warning to international criminals. Uniting the police forces  leads to determined operations and greater security. An  abolition of border checks is by far not tantamount to freedom  of international crime. I congratulate the official of  Interpol, of the BKA, and of the laender police forces on their  success."    A total of 2,247 federal and land official were involved in  the police operations in all laender.    A total of 754 apartments of 724 persons were searched, who  are suspected of having brought weapons to Germany illegally --  in particular from Belgium -- and having sold some of them  already.    The occasion of the search in the FRG was information  provided by Interpol in Brussels to the BKA in Wiesbaden.    Last November and December, Interpol had provided  information  on 1,082 cases of the purchase of guns by German citizens in  Belgium.    Minister Friedrich Bohl announced that the European police  authorities have already increased their exchange of information  considerably. This is an "advance measure" regarding planned  "bolstering measures" within the framework of the abolition of  borders. Bohl: "The European registration service already  works before it is officially introduced. This is now paying  off."    The minister announced that, when it takes over the  presidency of the European Union as of July, the Federal  Government will make a special contribution so that the European  Union can combat international crime with determination as a  "security community." Bohl: "In addition, cooperation between  the judicial, security, and customs authorities of the member  states must be improved in such a way that the latest success  against the arms smugglers becomes a normal part of everyday  police life in Europe."</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Manila wants only top banks Foreign banks that will be allowed into the Philippines under the country's liberalisation programme will be chosen from among the world's top 150 banks only, according to newly issued guidelines from the monetary authorities. A total of 31 foreign banks have signified interest in setting up shop in the country. Only 10 will be allowed to open full-service branches, although others may acquire up to 60 per cent of existing banks. Mr Gabriel Singson, head of the central bank and its policy-setting Monetary Board, says the selection should be completed in early 1995. Under the law, six of the 10 banks will be selected by the Monetary Board, while the other four will be picked by the Philippine president. The full-service banks will be required to put up a minimum permanently assigned capital of 210m pesos (Dollars 5.1m). They can open up to three branches in any location, and another three in areas to be designated by the Monetary Board. The guidelines provide that the home country of the applicant bank should extend 'reciprocity rights' to Philippine banks.</p>

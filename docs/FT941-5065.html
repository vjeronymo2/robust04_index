			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU offers hope to eastern Europe's farmers - The prospect of an end to subsidised competition from the west The prospect that the European Union might stop subsidising its farm exports to eastern Europe will be welcomed by the hard-pressed agricultural industries of the former communist bloc. EU export subsidies were strongly criticised at a conference in Budapest last week by speakers from Hungary, Poland and the Czech republic, which are struggling to restructure their farms and food businesses as part of their drive towards EU membership. The subsidies will come under the spotlight at a European Commission session later this month. It will examine how the Common Agricultural Policy and other EU systems can be modified to help eastern Europe progress towards the market economy and faster integration with the west. Export aids, together with ad hoc EU trade barriers, were blamed for preventing east European produce from competing on world markets and for damaging the few remaining healthy sectors of agriculture in these countries. 'One of the main reasons for our present problems is that our expectations of retrieving east European markets have not been fulfilled so far because we are regularly beaten in the competition on export subsidies, mainly by the exporters of the European Community,' said Mr Andras Zam, managing director of Terimpex, a leading Hungarian meat trading company. Speakers at the Agra Europe conference - on agriculture, agribusiness and the food industry in central and eastern Europe - gave graphic accounts of the plunge in production and farm employment that had followed the collapse of communism and the old Comecon trading system. In Poland, a fall in real income and the freeing of agricultural and input prices has led to a halving in agricultural income compared with 1989. Poland is no longer a net exporter of meat, milk products and eggs and only fruit and vegetable exports have held steady. The collapse of state farms, which exceptionally in Poland covered only about 20 per cent of arable land before the reforms, has pushed up the proportion of idle arable land from 1 per cent to 9 per cent. In Hungary, 20 per cent less land was sown to crops last year than in 1991 because of a lack of finance and the uncertainty surrounding land ownership and privatisation. Drought made things worse, causing a 40 per cent fall in the cereal harvest compared with the average for 1986-1990. The average wheat yield was 3 tonnes a hectare, the lowest for more than 20 years. A drop in meat consumption and a rise in input costs have led to large-scale slaughtering and a sharp fall in livestock numbers. In Hungary, the once-important pig sector has declined to just over 5m animals compared with a peak of 10m in 1983. The number of cattle is less than half that of 20 years ago. In Poland, cattle numbers have dropped by 24 per cent and pigs by 15 per cent in the past three years. Rural employment has been battered. In Hungary, about 150,000 people had lost their jobs by September 1992, representing 14 per cent of employment in the food and agriculture sector, because so many state farms and food processing enterprises went bankrupt. Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, said there were signs in some countries last year of a recovery in crop production, but the livestock sector was still in decline. None the less, those countries had the potential to be 'significant exporters of food.' The EU had to help them by going beyond its recent association agreements with six central and east European countries and speeding up the opening of its markets. The current review of the EU's Phare aid programme for eastern Europe should look at 'how one could help change farm structures, in particular in relation to the development of co-operatives, in order to rationalise production and domestic distribution networks', he said. That should overcome some of the difficulties caused by the fragmentation of farmland and assets. Mr Steichen also highlighted the paradox facing eastern Europe's agricultural policy-makers. In order to be accepted into the EU and to make a smooth transition into world trade, they must shun some of the core measures of the CAP. That theme was developed by Prof Stefan Tangermann, a leading agricultural economist who advises the European Commission, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation on agricultural strategy. Prof Tangermann said Poland and Hungary in particular had opened their food markets fully to international competition after the collapse of communism, but that the plunge in farm prices had led to pressure from farmers for protectionist measures. 'There is a trend towards introducing more protective agricultural policy instruments which have a certain similarity with those of the EU, in particular variable levies and export subsidies,' he said. Shadowing the CAP could present these countries with an intolerable financial burden, warned Prof Tangermann. According to one economic model, Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia would be spending more than Ecu3.5bn (Pounds 2.65bn) on export subsidies by 2000 if they tried to match EU farm prices. That scenario assumed that their farm output recovered, domestic consumption expanded only slightly and net exports thus rose significantly. Prof Tangermann predicted that by 2000 central Europe could have an exportable grain surplus of about 10m tonnes, a sugar surplus of 2m tonnes, the potential for net exports of 800,000 tonnes each of beef and pork, and a butter surplus of about 400,000 tonnes. 'Governments in central Europe should consider whether their current tendency to adopt 'CAP-like' agricultural policies is in their best interests,' he said. 'The optimal policy would be to be cautious about the level of support they provide to their farmers until the time they accede (to the EU).' The argument found an echo among speakers from Poland and the Czech republic. Mr Andrzej Kwiecinski, head of the agricultural policy analysis unit that advises the government, said Poland could not afford to finance an EU-style system of protection. 'The focus should be not on the present CAP, which in coming years will be significantly modified due to the MacSharry reforms and the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, but rather on the probable model that will take shape in the European Union in 10 or even 15 years,' he said. Mr Tomas Doucha, head of the Czech agriculture policy unit, said his country had to avoid the danger of land being abandoned and rural areas depopulated by adopting a policy of 'sustainable agriculture in accordance with the progressive elements and tendencies of the CAP'. In a striking parallel to the current debate in western Europe, he said farming in eastern Europe would have to concentrate not only on food production, but also 'the environment, natural resources, the landscape, and the social and cultural traditions of our rural regions'.</p>

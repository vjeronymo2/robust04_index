			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): You can run, but you can't hide from reality - Keynote / The forces that have cut building society interest have also reduced prospective unit trust income It was an oh-so-familiar story in the final quarter of last year, as another interest-rate cut brought gloom to building society savers but the stock market took another leap forward after Kenneth Clarke's first Budget. The good news, however, received a lot more publicity than the bad. Once again, playing safe was the wrong thing to do. The best returns were enjoyed by those investors who put money into some of the more volatile far eastern stock markets, especially Hong Kong where the index showed a remarkable gain of 59 per cent for the quarter and over 100 per cent for the calendar year. A year and more after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, the British economy started to look really rather good. Inflation failed to accelerate as the pessimists had forecast, and economic growth picked up to around 2 per cent. Unemployment continued its slow decline. The markets were in the right mood to celebrate Kenneth Clarke's Budget. True, some daunting tax increases were written in for the next two or three years, but the mood in the markets was bullish, and people were ready to assume that the economy would be buoyant enough to accommodate the tax burden. At the same time, the fiscal tightening meant that the menace of the towering Budget deficits was being tackled. Suddenly there was a realisation that there might be too little paper being offered to the stock and bond markets over the next few years, rather than too much. Over the Christmas period there was a whiff of buying panic as share prices raced ahead and gilt-edged yields sank below 6 1/2 per cent, the lowest long-term interest rates for 26 years. The old inflationary problems that have dogged the British economy for so many years seem at last to be fading. Few now think that the official 4 per cent inflation ceiling will be tested next year, even though VAT on fuel will affect the retail price index. Pay inflation has slipped to a remarkably low 3 per cent. The downside of that is that consumer spending will be constrained by the slimness of pay packets: most economists now reckon that a fall in saving will be required to keep the economy growing strongly. But low pay inflation, at a time when productivity appears to be rising quite fast, implies that price inflation will remain subdued for a considerable time ahead. That is the main reason why the yield on long gilts fell by a whole percentage point in the October-December quarter, from 7.46 to 6.43 per cent. Underpinning the whole bull market, however, has been the decline in inflation-proofed real yields, which are calculated on index-linked gilts. These dropped from 3.9 to 2.9 per cent over 1993 as a whole, with a third of the decline concentrated in the final three months. Not only did this help fixed-interest gilts, but it was also fundamental to the strength of equities at a time when dividends have been scarcely growing at all. The argument is that both shares and index-linked gilts offer inflation-proofed yields, with the difference being that, whereas share dividends provide growth, the index gilt income is safer. Usually investors are willing to accept a slightly lower income on index-linked gilts than on the average share, except very occasionally when dividend growth prospects are unusually good (which at present they are not). It follows that the average dividend yield could not have fallen by anything like the amount it did last year - from 4.35 to 3.37 per cent - unless underlying real yields had given a lead. So, as well as the good news about share prices, savers have to cope with the bad news about the income on their investments. This has already made last year a pretty rotten one for the building societies, with savers starting to withdraw their money and turn elsewhere. Unit trusts pulled in over Pounds 8bn in new investment during 1993 against only Pounds 0.6bn the year before, and the life insurance industry also saw money pouring into its lump sum products. But although you can run, you can't hide from reality: the prospective income on these alternative investments has also fallen sharply. People approaching retirement with personal pension plans face this problem in a very direct way. For them the good news is that their personal fund has probably appreciated by 20 per cent or so in the past year; but the bad news is that the annuity which the Inland Revenue requires them to buy at retirement has fallen by perhaps 15 per cent (and even more, for retirement at 60 rather than at 65). Of course, when inflation is low, a small income will go further, because it is not being eroded so fast by cost-of-living increases. The quantity may be smaller but the quality is better. However, when you are working out your household budgets for the first year or two of retirement you may get a bit of a shock. The mighty occupational pension schemes face the same kind of problem. On paper they had a terrific 1993, with the typical fund enjoying a total investment return of about 28 per cent. But their actuarial valuations will not be very flattering, because the sharp fall in long-term interest rates has meant that the present cost of providing for future pensions has jumped by about 25 per cent. If you want to cash in your investment gains and spend the proceeds on goods and services today, then you are genuinely better off (the same argument applies to buying houses). But the appreciation in your portfolio will not buy you more security in the future. Moreover, although established investors are cushioned, if you are a new saver - whether an individual, or a young company starting a pension scheme for the first time - you are actually worse off than in recent years. This is because the fall in prospective real investment returns means that you will have to save harder in order to achieve the same long-term benefit. If you invest Pounds 1,000 at 4 per cent compound it will grow to Pounds 2,666 after 25 years. At 3 per cent the final result will be only Pounds 2,094. Putting it another way, at the lower real interest rate you will have to save 27 per cent more in order to achieve the same result over such a period. So if the stock and bond markets were to retreat a little in 1994, not everybody should be miserable about it.</p>

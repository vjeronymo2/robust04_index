			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy grew a real  1.0 percent in the first quarter this year from the last three  months of 1993, or at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, the  Economic Planning Agency said in a preliminary report Tuesday.    Domestic demand accounted for 0.8 percent of the inflation-  adjusted growth of the gross domestic product (GDP), while  external demand contributed 0.2 percent.    Consumer spending gained 1.4 percent in the first three  months of this year, while corporate plant and equipment  investment declined 1.0 percent.    The real gross national product (GNP) in the same quarter  expanded by 0.8 percent from the preceding three months, or an  annualized 3.3 percent.    GDP and GNP are the total output of goods and services, with  GDP excluding net income from overseas.    Meanwhile, Japan's GDP in fiscal 1993 that ended March 31  remained unchanged from the previous year in real terms, while  the real GNP decreased 0.1 percent.    Of the 1.0 percent growth for the first quarter, domestic  demand accounted for 0.8 percent, while external demand  contributed 0.2 percent.    The GDP sank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993.    Consumption further gained 1.4 percent, compared with a 0.7  percent rise in the previous quarter, while plant and equipment  spending declined 1.0 percent but improved from a negative 3.8  percent in the October-December period.    Active government spending in line with pump-priming  packages  helped consolidate the upward move, the EPA [Economic Planning  Agency] said.    The real gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter  rose an annualized 3.3 percent. Of the data representing the  total output of goods and services, GDP excludes income from  overseas.    For fiscal 1993, figures released simultaneously showed that  the GDP growth remained flat, or only fractionally on the plus  side of 0.03 percent.    The 0.0 percent performance was the weakest since the  negative performance of 0.03 percent posted in fiscal 1974.    On a GNP basis, the fiscal 1993 economy shrank 0.1 percent.    Returning to the GDP, the government said that as a result  of  the fiscal 1993 showing, the current fiscal year will  technicallly see a 0.4 percent growth even if all the quarters  post zero expansion.    It said, however, an average 0.77 percent, or an annualized  3.12 percent, growth is necessary in each quarter in the current  fiscal year to accomplish the official forecast of a 2.4 percent  expansion.    Private economists agree with optimistic remarks by the  EPA's  Tanaka, saying it looks like Japan is beginning to prepare for a  major recovery.    "I think the fiscal year-end factor and a reaction to the  contraction in the fourth quarter of 1993 combined to boost the  figure for the January-March quarter," said Atsushi Miyawaki, a  senior economist at Japan Research Institute.    "But generally speaking, Japan appears on the verge of an  upward swing," he added.    Bank of Tokyo analyst Yozo Nishimura said conditions have  considerably improved and that a substantial revival can be  expected in fiscal 1995 after a gradual recovery in the current  fiscal year.    But Miyawaki said there is still a possibility of negative  growth in the April-June period in reaction to the healthy  first-quarter performance.    Personal income remains sluggish, he noted, and the major  focus will be whether the effects of the summer income tax cuts  will persist in the following months.    Nishimura was a bit more optimistic and expected flat growth  as the worst case for the April-June period.    "The risk factor is the effect of the appreciation of the  yen  against the dollar, which could throw cold water on buoyant  export activities," he said.    Economists estimate Japanese exporters have their  boom-or-bust rate set at 105 yen to the dollar.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Advocacy request rejected by Bar A ROW between the Bar and Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, was looming last night after the Bar's ruling council rejected a request from Lord Mackay to rethink its rule prohibiting barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service appearing as advocates in the Crown Court. Lord Mackay made his request to the Bar early last month. He ruled out wider rights of audience for CPS lawyers in the immediate future, and asked the Bar to consider putting a time limit of December 1994 on its ruling. He suggested that the Bar should join discussions once the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice has reported next year. Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said that the stance had nothing to do with Bar trying to maintain its monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts. Solicitors would soon have rights of audience. 'Ours is a point of principle,' he added. 'We don't think the state as monopoly prosecutor should have its cases presented in court by its own employees.' The Bar is confident of success because applications for wider rights of audience have to be decided not only by Lord Mackay but by the four designated senior judges, any one of whom can in effect block an application. Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, is one of the four and he he is strongly opposed to CPS lawyers having rights of audience.</p>

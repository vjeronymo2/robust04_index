			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (6): Big reshuffle is designed to improve company efficiency - Cadillac MR John Grettenberger, the head of General Motors' Cadillac luxury car division, has a hit on his hands. The new 1922 Cadillac Seville, GM's answer to the threat posed by cars such as Germany's Mercedes and Japan's Lexus in the luxury market, has won over not only enthusiastic praise in the US motoring press, but also customers in the showrooms. The Seville, and the new Cadillac Eldorado, introduced at the same time last autumn, have given a significant boost to the division's US car sales, which were up some 7 per cent over 1991 in the first five months of this year in an admittedly growing market. The company's market share rose by a modest one tenth of a point. Perhaps more important, the company has begun attracting back younger buyers, whom it needs to take the place of its generally elderly customers. Mr Grettenberger says the Seville has also attracted attention in Europe where Cadillac's sales have risen from just 291 vehicles in the 1991 model year to almost 1,500 in 1992. This is a much-needed morale booster for GM which has been losing billions of dollars on its North American operations, prompting a revolt by non-executive directors on its board last April. The company is now in the throes of a huge upheaval designed to slim it down and make it more efficient. Cadillac's success with the Seville demonstrates what GM is capable of in good design and engineering when it pulls all the stops out - although the group's problems are also underlined by the fact that the Seville was a year late in hitting the market. 'We decided that we were not going to bring it to market until it was absolutely correct and that required adjustments to our ideas,' says Mr Grettenberger. The name Cadillac used to define the American luxury car. But in the 1980s, along with the rest of GM, the division gained a reputation for poor quality and tired design. The past few years, however, have seen a sharp reversal of those trends: the Seville has picked up numerous design awards while Cadillac's reputation for quality has steadily improved. J. D. Powers and Associates, the car market research group, now ranks Cadillac among the leading US vehicle vendors for customer satisfaction. Much of this is due to the division's adoption of the Total Quality Management (TQM) practices pioneered by Japanese companies, which began to become popular in the US during the 1980s. TQM stresses the need to ensure top quality in all an organisation's operations, with particularly emphasis on customer satisfaction and worker participation. Cadillac's efforts resulted in it winning the prestigious Baldrige award, a national competition for TQM, although it only did so at the second attempt. The group's attention to customer satisfaction played a role in the extensive market research that went into the design and styling of the Seville and Eldorado. The proposed Cadillac vehicles, together with domestic and foreign rivals, were shown to some 8,000 people across the US who intended to buy luxury cars. 'We made a special effort to insure we had imported luxury cars there as well,' says Mr Grettenberger. One of the main messages was that Cadillac needed to improve the interior design of its cars. Younger buyers, in particular, disliked a lot of the ornamentation traditional on its models. At the same time, Mr Grettenberger needed to maintain the distinctively American feel of its cars: 'Cadillac is clearly a North American vehicle and anything we do that is not true to that would be suspect.' In the hope of attracting European buyers, the company has now begun product clinics there for vehicles it intends to introduce in 1995 and 1996. 'I think we're starting to get grass-root voices and customer input from the Continent and this has good applications for the Far East as well,' says Mr Grettenberger. Cadillac is sufficiently encouraged by its progress in Europe to have started reactivativing its largely dormant network of dealers. The message from them, says Mr Grettenberger is: 'Address the performance, handling and efficiency demands of the European market but remain American. Don't try to be a BMW, a Mercedes, in terms of overall style.' With Cadillac offering no rebates (other than a little bit of leasing support) on the Dollars 38,000 Sevilles, Mr Grettenberger says the division is making 'very good profits.' That said, Cadillac's Hamtramck, Michigan plant is operating far below its potential output, reflecting the huge overcapacity that afflicts GM throughout the group. Nevertheless, Mr Grettenberger believes Cadillac will remain largely immune from the rationalisation now shaking up the rest of the group. He also believes that the luxury car market is set to grow, but the competition will become even more ferocious because 'its still an area of the industry where you can get a good return for your investment,' he says. 'The demands of the customer are going to continually increase,' says Mr Grettenberger. He believes the ability to get repeat business will depend crucially on 'maintaining high levels of satisfaction throughout the ownership experience.' 'If you want to be a success,' says the Cadillac chief, 'you had better be sure that you're not just meeting customers' expectations, but exceeding them.'</p>

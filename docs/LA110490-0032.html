			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUIDEBOOK;  </P> <P> HOW TO VISIT ECUADOR'S SHOPPING MECCAS  </P> <P> Various American tour companies offer one- or two-day trips to the Otavalo  market and surrounding villages, often as extensions to journeys to the  Galapagos Islands or the Amazon. The fair is held on Saturdays from 7 a.m.  until noon.  </P> <P> A far cheaper alternative, however, is arranging such a tour directly with an  Ecuadorian travel firm in Quito. Least expensive, particularly if you are  adventuresome and someone in your party speaks Spanish, would be renting a car  and doing the trip yourself.  </P> <P> Getting there: American Airlines has daily flights from Los Angeles to Quito  via Miami. The lowest round-trip fare is $624. Ecuatoriana Airlines also offers  direct service from Los Angeles to Quito via Mexico City.  </P> <P> Where to stay: Hosteria La Mirage (Cotacachi, Ecuador; reservations handled  through P.O. Box 11365, C.C.N.U., Quito) is a beautifully landscaped hotel less  than four miles from Otavalo. Prices for the 14 rooms range from $40 to $60,  double occupancy, per night, including a first-class dinner and continental  breakfast at a covered patio looking out on mountain vistas.  </P> <P> Hosteria Chorlavi (P.O. Box 828, Ibarra, Ecuador) is a 200-year-old hacienda  with Old World charm that was known as the "Love Nest" when Inca men brought  their wives there on honeymoons. Double rooms are $16 per night, including use  of tennis and squash courts.  </P> <P> Hacienda Cusin (San Pablo del Lago, Ecuador; reservations handled through  Casilla Postal 428-A, Quito, Ecuador) was built by the King of Spain in 1602 as  a large cattle farm, and is the oldest hacienda in Ecuador. Horses and ponies  are available. Rooms are $35, including three meals.  </P> <P> Where to eat: Hosteria La Mirage is a superb place to sample Ecuadorian cuisine  in an attractive setting. Hosteria Chorlavi, 12 miles outside Otavalo, is  another good choice for typical fare. Dinner for two without liquor is about  $10 at each restaurant.  </P> <P> Try ceviche (shrimp or fish marinated in lemon juice), locro (potato soup made  with cheese and avocados) and llapingachos (cheese and potatoes in a tortilla  served with a fried egg on top). Ecuadorian beef is excellent and inexpensive.  Mora sherbet, a cross between strawberry and grape, is a good dessert choice.  </P> <P> Tour companies: Metropolitan Touring, C.P.O. Box 2542, Quito, Ecuador, or its  U.S. representative, Adventure Associates, (800) 527-2500, is the largest tour  operator in Ecuador. It arranges daily group trips to the market and villages  for $34 per person, including lunch. Overnight trips are $100 per person,  including meals. The day rate for a private car is $87 per person; a two-day  trip costs $199.  </P> <P> Buses for Otavalo leave frequently from Calle Manuel Larrea 1211 in Quito.  One-way fare is $2.50 for the 2 1/2-hour journey. Advance purchase is advised.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Ecuadorian Consulate, Tourist Information,  548 S.

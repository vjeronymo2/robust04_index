			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Aker falls steeply to NKr92m AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday reported a steep decline in profits before extraordinary items to NKr92m (Dollars 14m) from NKr632m for 1991 on turnover little changed at NKr13.6bn against NKr13.4bn. The group has been hit by losses in the oil and gas division, which suffered a NKr300m charge for the loss of the Sleipner platform, plus a move into the red by cement and building materials. Of the total Sleipner charge, NKr150m represents a realised loss while the remainder is a provision for future costs. 'Uncertainty continues to surround the final financial outcome of the Sleipner loss,' Aker said yesterday. The oil and gas technology division net loss, before extraordinary items, was NKr79m against a profit of NKr339m. However, its order reserve rose to NKr13bn by the end of last year compared with NKr8bn at the end of 1990. The division expects to increase turnover this year and is looking for a significant recovery. Profits are expected to be better than those which would have been recorded for 1991 before the Sleipner charge, the company said. Cement and building materials suffered a NKr79m net loss, before extraordinary items, against a profit of NKr369m. The division saw staff cut by 704 to 4,269 and capacity cut by 850,000 tonnes. The division expects profits to fall further this year. Included in group figures for 1991 is a NKr241m gain from the sale of Aker's 20 per cent stake in Noco, a small Norwegian oil company. Aker has made organisational changes at Norwegian Contractors. the unit responsible for the construction of Sleipner. Mr Jan Moksnes replaces Mr Ulf Henriksen as managing director. Mr Tom Ruud, group president, takes over as NC's chairman, replacing Mr Gregers Kure.</p>

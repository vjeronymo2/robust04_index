The  message concerns the latest developments in the talks with  Israel in light of Arab moves to ensure security for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories, disarm the settlers,  and obtain a Security Council resolution condemning the Israeli  massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This can be achieved by  providing international protection and by tangible measures by  the Israelis to ensure security for the Palestinians.    Sa'id Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, noted that  he and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid discussed U.S. President Bill Clinton's  recent remarks about the status of Jerusalem. He noted that the  Arab League secretary general promised to take the necessary  measures to back the Palestinian side should the talks with  Israel resume, especially with regard to the call for disbanding  the settlements and not recognizing Israel's measures on  Jerusalem.    Kamal added that he briefed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid on the recent  contacts held between PLO officials and Arab and international  officials, including the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, and  Lebanon. He pointed out that these contacts dealt with the  future of the Middle East peace process following the massacre.  He noted that a meeting among officials from the cordon states  [Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt and the PLO] is likely to be  held on the sidelines of the Arab League ministerial meeting in  Cairo on 26 March.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets report: Dollar steady The dollar traded steadily on the markets yesterday, with a climactic week for the currency ending in a whimper, writes Philip Gawith. The focus of attention - the October employment report - was softer than market expectations. This calmed market nerves, and reduced expectations of the Fed raising interest rates before the November 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The dollar finished in London at DM1.5235, from DM1.5146 and at Y97.8, from Y97.605. Earlier in the week, the Fed had intervened repeatedly, spending a rumoured Dollars 2bn to support the dollar. In Europe, the French franc weakened slightly after Mr Jacques Chirac announced his candidacy for the presidency next year. Some analysts fear that a stand-off between him and the prime minister, Mr Eduard Balladur, might let in the Socialist candidate, probably Mr Jacques Delors, currently president of the European commission. The combination of a firmer dollar, and a stable D-Mark, saw sterling weaken slightly, with the trade weighted index finishing at 80.6 from 80.9. Although the headline figure of the employment report was better than expected, some of the underlying figures testified to latent inflationary pressures. While bonds were undermined, the dollar did not follow suit. This breach of the recent pattern was clear testimony to the impact of Fed intervention on the markets. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, commented: 'What intervention has done is put people off selling the dollar until it becomes clear what the Fed is going to do.' The expectation is that the dollar will trade in a narrow range until the FOMC meeting. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday lent verbal support to the dollar. He told a London audience that 'We are all interested in a stronger dollar.' He added, though, that the Bundesbank also believed in a strong D-Mark. 'We have no problem with the strong D-Mark,' said Mr Tietmeyer. He was non-committal about whether the Bundesbank would participate in co-ordinated intervention, saying only that signals to the market could play a useful role under 'special circumstances'. To be successful, though, they had to be based on 'consistent and credible policies'. To many in the market, this means higher US interest rates. Whether the market will get what it wants is a moot point. Although most observers believe the Fed should raise interest to curb inflationary pressures, it is not clear that the dollar will feature much in its thinking. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, comments: 'It is a mistake to expect the Fed to hike interest rates to bolster a battered dollar ..The Fed's mandate is to maintain domestic price stability, promote economic growth and guard the stability of the financial system.' 'For the Fed to hike rates to defend the dollar, it would have to believe that a weakening dollar threatens financial stability or price stability.' In the UK, short term interest rates eased as the prospect of a near-term tightening of monetary policy receded. Three month LIBOR fell to 6 1/16 per cent, from 6 5/16 per cent. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 605m of assistance at established rates, and late assistance of about Pounds 570m, after forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn shortage.</p>

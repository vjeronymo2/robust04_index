			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Standard Chartered submits to HK inquiry Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is co-operating with an independent investigation in Hong Kong into alleged malpractice in its bullion dealing arm. The bank is understood to be forwarding information from an internal inquiry into allegations of corruption and bribery to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, an independent anti-corruption body with police powers, in order to reassure banking regulators in the UK colony. Standard said its investigation into allegations that employees of Mocatta, its bullion division, used false expenses claims to finance bribes for officials in Malaysia and the Philippines was continuing, although the Malaysian end had been completed. 'We are continuing our investigation, and keeping all the regulatory authorities involved informed on a regular basis,' said the bank. The investigation would carry on for 'as long as it takes' to sort out the issue. Standard could not confirm the involvement of the anti-corruption commission, but it emphasised that it had started its inquiry after a review of controls within Mocatta. Mr John McFarlane, the Standard Chartered director who has taken charge of Mocatta within a new division, said last week that the bank had told managers that it would not tolerate repetitions of similar behaviour. The Mocatta allegations follow the bank's suspension from new issue activity in the colony until next April because of the involvement of its securities arm in share price support schemes in a series of company flotations. The bank said last week that it had completed an inquiry in Malaysia into the disappearance of a Dollars 10,000 gold coin, which was given to a former Malaysian deputy finance minister as a 'sample' and disappeared after he passed it on to a consultant. Mr Stephen Goh, the consultant, recompensed the bank after he mislaid the coin. Standard said yesterday that it had delayed its planned secondary listings in Hong Kong and Singapore because of unfavourable market conditions. It said the decision was not connected with the Mocatta investigation.</p>

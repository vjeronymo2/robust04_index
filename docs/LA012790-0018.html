			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICERS AWARDED $100,000 IN DISMISSAL OF  FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Two Burbank police officers have been awarded $100,000 each from a man whose  lawsuit charging them with brutality was dismissed by a judge as frivolous,  authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge entered the judgment Jan. 4 in favor  of Detective Brian R. Arnspiger and Sgt. Patrick V. Lynch after the defendant,  Kent Allen Kelley II, failed to contest the suit.  </P> <P> The officers were told of the decision Thursday in a letter from their  attorney.  </P> <P> "We're happy because it's taken so long and we're finally vindicated,"  Arnspiger said. "When something like that happens, it kind of digs at you."  </P> <P> The officers, claiming malicious prosecution, countersued Kelley in 1985 after  a Burbank Superior Court judge threw out the man's lawsuit alleging the  officers brutalized him and robbed him during his arrest at a Burbank bar in  December, 1980. Police had received a call that Kelley was drunk and was trying  to pick fights and gamble at the pool table, Arnspiger said.  </P> <P> Among other things, Kelley's suit alleged that the officers handcuffed him too  tightly and threw him against the steel bars of a cell at the Burbank jail.  </P></p>

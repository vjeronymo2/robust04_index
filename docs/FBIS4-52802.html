			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  are set to resume their stalled talks on a new trade framework,  with Tokyo slated to send top-level officials to Washington as  early as next week. International Trade and Industry Minister  Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference Friday that the  officials will not carry with them any specific answers to three  new U.S. proposals made as a condition for resuming the  framework talks.    Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on  macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks  and the "objective criteria" sought by the United States to  assess progress in opening Japan's markets.    A senior ministry official suggested the Japanese  negotiators  will tell their U.S. counterparts of Tokyo's willingness to take  action to broaden foreign access to goods procured by the  government. "There is room for study in the case of government  procurement, which is under the government's jurisdiction," the  official said on condition of anonymity.    Government procurement is one of the three areas to which  Washington gives top priority in the framework talks. But the  official said the two sides are likely to run into rough going  in trying to define the goal of the bilateral talks initiated by  the U.S. to pry open Japanese markets and rectify the chronic  trade imbalance between the two countries.    Japanese and U.S. negotiators are in agreement not to go  into  details on "objective criteria" as sought by Washington but  rejected by Tokyo, which led the talks to collapse at the summit  meeting in Washington in February.    A U.S. diplomat has said it seems that U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor will not stick to his effort to pin  down objective criteria by any means if Tokyo promises to widen  U.S. access to Japanese markets on a sector-by-sector basis.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is scheduled to talk with  Kantor later in the day by telephone for their first  conversation since Kakizawa took office in late April. The  issue of how to deal with the framework talks is expected to be  on the agenda in the telephone talks.    The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and  industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Ukraine assures US about its atomic weapons UKRAINE'S President Leonid Kravchuk has assured Mr Warren Christopher, the visiting US secretary of state, that his republic is committed to becoming a non-nuclear power. But his foreign minister, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, has reiterated that Ukraine cannot dismantle all its nuclear weapons without Dollars 2.8bn of western assistance. While Mr Christopher reported that the Ukrainian parliament intended to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) next month, it is still unclear when it will dismantle its 1,656 nuclear weapons or accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear power - something President Kravchuk agreed to in 1992. Ukraine is currently the third largest nuclear power in the world. In addition to financial assistance, Ukraine is looking to the US for security guarantees to protect its borders from neighbouring Russia through 'an expansion of Nato'. Mr Zlenko said: 'The sooner we receive aid and guarantees, the sooner Ukraine will follow through with its commitments.' Mr Christopher responded that 'security assurances would certainly be within contemplation', once Ukraine became non-nuclear. Mr Christopher and his Ukrainian counterpart yesterday signed an accord under which the US will provide Dollars 175m as initial help to dismantle nuclear missiles. Two small accords were announced for enhancing the safety of Ukrainian nuclear power stations and for establishing a science and technology centre to keep highly trained Ukrainian nuclear scientists well paid and working in the republic. Mr Christopher also came to promote economic ties between the two nations, offering Dollars 155m in agricultural credits and technical assistance for 1994. The US plans to expand trade and private investment through lowering tariffs on Ukrainian goods and helping the republic join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said he would continue to press Ukraine to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. 'I understand their position, but I think it is not justified because we are making progress with Russia, too, in complying with all these agreements,' he said.</p>

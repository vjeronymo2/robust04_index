			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: SE probes into enhanced scrip pay-out underwriting THE STOCK Exchange's market practices committee is to meet today to consider whether underwriters of enhanced scrip dividend schemes should have limits placed on their ability to trade the shares of the company whose pay-outs they are underwriting. This stems from a controversial move by Swiss Bank Corporation to undercut the price offered for shares in a financing scheme for insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT, originally designed and underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The Stock Exchange and BAT were both asked to investigate a drop in BAT's share price which, some market makers suggested, had occurred at a time when it worked to SBC's advantage. There was no evidence whatever that SBC manipulated the market price for the shares. SBC attributed the drop to remarks by BAT's chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy, on the trading outlook and on news of increased competition in the key US tobacco market. Yet, some City officials have suggested that limitations be placed on the ability of underwriters of such schemes to make markets in the shares during certain periods. Also, there have been suggestions that the Stock Exchange should have the right to alter the underwriting price for enhanced scrip dividends if it feels it is appropriate. Enhanced scrip dividends have been used by several companies, including BAT, to cut its bill for advance corporation tax. BAT and other issuers of enhanced scrip dividends offered shareholders the option to earn a dividend paid in additional shares but worth 50 per cent more than the cash payout. Those investors who wanted cash could raise it by selling the additional shares to BZW, without dealing costs, at a five per cent discount to the market price. In the case of BAT, SBC announced it would buy the shares at a discount of only two per cent, effectively ensuring that investors would sell their shares to it. But on the first day of the three-day pricing period, BAT's shares fell from 851p to 825p and averaged 833p over the three day pricing period, meaning SBC had to pay investors significantly less for their extra shares than it might have had to.</p>

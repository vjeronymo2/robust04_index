			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radoje Arsenic: "It Was Confirmed That Mercep's </F> Unit Committed Crime"]    [Excerpts] The recently published confidential report of  the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) on crimes by  Mercep's "special purpose" unit, which, judging from everything,  were committed as a function of the ethnic cleansing of Serbs in  Croatia, provoked a shock in the ranks of the ruling regime that  reached its very top leadership. This entire case was given  official weight in an unusual way by precisely the chief actor  in the affair--representative in the Assembly's House of  Zupanijas (House of Parishes) and chief inspector of the  republic MUP Tomislav Mercep.    At the last 1993 meeting of the House of Zupanijas, which  started yesterday, he asked the government a representative's  question in which he requested the protection of the legal state  and the answer to the question "whether the Republic of Croatia  will undertake measures against the people who betrayed the  state secret" by publishing the above-mentioned report in GLOBUS  (about which we have reported in detail).  <H5>  The Bloody Path of the Criminal Group </H5>   It is interesting that Mercep did not deny what was written  in this text. With such a declaration he in fact confirmed the  authenticity of the MUP report, from the content of which, i.e.,  description of a series of crimes against citizens mostly of  Serb nationality (along with a few Croats), it directly follows  that, along with the immediate perpetrators, the war criminal is  the very same Tomislav Mercep who commanded this unit, the  purpose of which was obviously liquidation. This fact and the  bloody path of Mercep and his criminal group from Vukovar,  across the Pakracka Poljana and Zagreb, to Gospic and back, has  been known among the Serbs in Croatia for a long time, but his  crimes (as well as those of other criminals) have been concealed  from the Croatian public or declared "dirty Serbian propaganda."    It is even more interesting that not only Mercep confirmed  in  this manner the authenticity of the report on his own crimes;  its authenticity was also confirmed by Minister of Internal  Affairs Ivan Jarnjak, himself, responding last night in the  House of Representatives to the representative's question by  Franjo Greguric on the same topic. Greguric, namely, was  interested in the "position of the MUP in connection with the  accusations presented in the GLOBUS article on human rights  abuses by Mr. Mercep, assembly representative, and his  collaborators," as well as "about measures for the protection of  citizens and their property."    Minister Jarnjak immediately answered that, on the occasion  of this article, "a thorough investigation" had been carried out  in the MUP, that the above-mentioned confidential report was  drafted on the basis of "talks with the suspects, i.e., those  who were interrogated in connection with the tragically killed  Zec family" (it is symptomatic how persistently he avoids the  word crime and similar expressions), and that this report was  drafted "at the request of the Office for the Protection of the  Constitutional Order" (which at the time was headed by Josip  Manolic). The report was written in three copies, one was left  with the Zagreb Police Administration and two were delivered to  the above-mentioned office (which was the focal point of control  of all the Croatian intelligence services and police).    Jarnjak also said that "according to the statements of  people  who were able to obtain the report no one gave the report to  anyone outside the MUP." [passage omitted] "This material is at  the attorney general's office. Thus, he should have continued to  work on this case, and he should have been asked to start the  entire procedure. When the court establishes the validity of  this report, then someone can be charged, and the case can be  made public. I think that the case was not handled in a proper  manner and that this was ill-intentioned."    Let us recall that the state public prosecutor in the last  year was Stjepan Herceg, who recently submitted his resignation  without explanation (he did not undertake anything in regard to  this case, or at least it has not been made known to the  public), while the four murderers of the Zec family were  acquitted before the Zagreb court "because of procedural  errors." It is not hard to conclude what kind of a sign this is  for the functioning of the "legal state" in relation to the  members of the Mercep unit. At any rate, today the assembly  appointed Krunislav Olujic, an HDZ representative from Osijek,  to the office of the state public prosecutor. [passage omitted]</p>

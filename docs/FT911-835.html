			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Peters quits as Columbia Pictures' co-chairman SONY Software yesterday confirmed that the co-chairman of its Columbia Pictures Entertainment division, Mr Jon Peters, will give up his title and day-to-day management duties. This is the second shuffle of Hollywood executives this month. The move comes only 19 months after Sony paid a high premium to acquire Guber-Peters Entertainment, Mr Peters' former production company. It also comes only days after Paramount Communications appointed Mr Brandon Tartikoff to head its Paramount Pictures unit. Sony's regard for Mr Peters and Mr Peter Guber was reflected in the Dollars 200m, or Dollars 17 1/2 -a-share, it paid for Guber-Peters in 1989, at a time when the stock was trading at Dollars 12 3/4 a share and in the costly lawsuit it fought for Guber-Peters. Sony said Mr Peters would establish a new entertainment company which would be tied exclusively to Columbia. The new company would produce films, music and television. Mr Peters, a former hairdresser, is one of Hollywood's most colourful characters. He formed a relationship with Barbra Streisand in the 1970s when he was working as a hairdresser, and in 1976 helped produce Ms Streisand's remake of A Star is Born. Mr Peters joined forces with Mr Guber in 1980 and the pair produced such film hits as Batman, Rain Man and The Colour Purple before joining Sony. The duo have poured money into Columbia Pictures and its Tri-Sta Pictures unit. They are expected to spend about Dollars 700m this year on films, nearly twice as much as Paramount Pictures intends to spend. At Columbia, Mr Guber, who trained as a lawyer and had some experience of studio management, focused on corporate affairs while Mr Peters concentrated on creative matters. Rumours started in February that Peters, who had never worked inside a big corporation, was planning to leave Columbia. Mr Guber, will remain as Columbia's chief executive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source in the Democratic Republic of  Yemen says that the head of the Sanaa regime has announced that  he ordered the dispatch of a convoy of food and material  supplies for the citizens of Aden Governorate. The source  denounced this announcement, adding that Aden Governorate's  population is not beggars, and it cannot accept charity from  those who aggressed on its homeland. The source said that the  head of the Sanaa regime should rather stop shelling the  residential quarters and civil establishments in Aden, and  killing of the elderly, women, and children, in implementation  of the decision by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, who allowed  the killing of women, the elderly, and children.    He added that such a decision is not approved by religion,  morals, or human rights. Aden is also inaccessible, and it is  not in need of the charity of those who try to destroy it. He  should rather lift the injustice, corruption, and hegemony from  our brothers in the north, who are fighting to get rid of his  regime.    The source expressed regret and sadness that a people like  those in the north remain under the rule of such people, who try  to destroy everything in democratic Yemen, and try to prevent  water from reaching Aden, and destroy the electricity station  and Aden's international airport and vital establishments, and  set its refinery on fire -- though 30,000 persons depend on it  for their living. They also threatened to prevent navigation in  the Gulf of Aden, which receives foodstuffs and medicines. Then  there may be a claim that they will send medicine and food for  Aden's population.

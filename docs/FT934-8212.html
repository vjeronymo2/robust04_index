			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Politicians all at sea as violence racks Algeria: A look at the breakdown of law and order ABOUT 3,000 people have been killed in Algeria since the suspension of the elections 22 months ago that the radical Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. The violence has taken on new forms, notably the torching of factories, schools and forests. Armed bands roam large parts of the country. Some have become de facto no-go areas where army units hunt armed members of radical Islamic groups, the most notorious of which is the Movement Islamiste Arme. Many of the 350 foreign companies in Algeria have repatriated the wives and children of employees - the number of children attending the French lycee in Algiers has dropped by a third. Racketeering and anonymous threats are rife. It is not advised to travel by Land Rover, a much prized vehicle not only for terrorists but also the thousands of Algerians who make their living in the black market. Extortion is practised by local gangs - young Algerians whose despair at the bleakness of their future is matched by contempt for their leaders whom they dismiss as houkoumat mikky (Mickey Mouse government). The politicians they loathe, meanwhile, continue to talk. A Commission of National Reconciliation (CRN), which includes five civilian and three military members, meets regularly in the increasingly desperate hope of finding common ground among 'reformers', under which label a rich mixture is to be found. The now banned FIS is not officially party to these talks though there are persistent rumours that secret contacts have been established between the CRN and more moderate members of the FIS, either in Algeria or abroad. The fundamentalists for their part are apparently as fragmented as their lay brothers. But those who operate in Algeria have made clear that the Islamic leaders in exile do not speak for them. 'We are preparing a larger battle which will only come to an end when this godless regime is destroyed and the last foreigner has left Algerian soil,' one MIA leaflet said. The army, the key fount of power in Algeria since independence, remains in the background. The key challenge confronting Algeria is succession. Those who hold power and have run the affairs of state since 1962 still claim their legitimacy rests on their fight against France between 1954 and 1962. That cuts little ice either with younger Algerians - 70 per cent of whom are under 30 and mostly unemployed - or with many professionals who are voting with their feet. Hundreds of thousands are already abroad. The statistics are alarming: factories are functioning, at best, at 50 per cent capacity; 84 per cent of Algerians between the ages of 15 and 30 are without a job; 102,000 jobs were created annually between 1967 and 1990 when 234,000 were needed; farming yields are the lowest in the Mediterranean; the country imports Dollars 2bn worth of food every year, which amounts to more than two thirds of its needs. The government led, since last August, by Mr Redha Malek is committed to bold economic reform and negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and Algeria's leading creditors. The object is to loosen the noose of foreign debt which this year will absorb 83 per cent of the country's foreign income, 97 per cent of which derives from the sale of hydrocarbons. Massive injections of cash into state companies which remained unreformed have pushed up the budget deficit from 7 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 17 per cent this year. Inflation has increased officially by half to 30 per cent and the black market rate of the dinar slipped by about 30 per cent. An IMF programme, probably implemented over a three-year period, is seen as a key to future western confidence. Much depends on Algeria's capacity to implement an agreement, if one is possible. One example of gross mismanagement in the implementation of the June 1991 IMF standby deal was the way money set aside to protect the poorest Algerians against the effects of rising prices was distributed. The then prime minister, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, left the local authorities, then mostly controlled by the FIS, to do the job. They put 7m people on the list, distributed a miserly 140 dinars to each and told them it was a gift from Allah. Meanwhile the Moslem faith remains, as across the Islamic world, a powerful weapon in the hands of the wretched of the earth. Many Algerians complain that western Europe harbours radical Islamic leaders, that if France, Germany and Britain do not help them 'eradicate terrorism' they will come to regret an 'Islamic victory' not just in neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia, but right across the southern shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

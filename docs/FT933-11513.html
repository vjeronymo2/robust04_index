			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Gambling on aid Ramsgate in Kent, on the Isle of Thanet - which includes the other seaside towns of Margate and Broadstairs - is the only area in the south-east to gain full development rather than intermediate area status, which puts it on a par with areas such as Glasgow, Liverpool, Barnsley and Hartlepool. Thanet has not received aid in the past and there is a lack of familiarity with the procedures involved. Thanet District Council is telling companies which want advice on how to get aid to contact either the East Kent Initiative in Dover, which made the bid for assisted status on behalf of the area, or the DTI directly. Hotels and tourist services, on which Thanet's economy has traditionally depended, are eligible for aid.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (8): Marriages have been arranged - Aerospace swallows its national pride THE FRENCH aerospace industry, the third-largest in the western world, has been stepping up the search for foreign partners in response to shrinking national defence budgets and the continued downturn in the civil aircraft market. Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft and missiles group, led the first real rationalisation of the hard-pressed western helicopter industry, through a merger of its helicopter business with that of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to form Eurocopter. The new group, formed in January and controlled by Aerospatiale, is the world's second largest supplier after Sikorsky of the US. Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter's French chairman, believes this is the first step towards a reduction in the number of leading western helicopter makers from eight to three or four by the end of the decade. A similar strategy is behind the plans by Aerospatiale - with Dasa and Alenia of Italy - to acquire joint control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft producer. The trio teamed up last year to form a regional aircraft consortium called Regioliner, controlled by Dasa. If successful, Regioliner's bid for Fokker could help rationalise capacity in Europe's troubled regional and commuter aircraft sectors. Airbus, the four-nation European airliner group, has been considering making smaller aircraft itself, but has not objected to Regioliner's ambitions because it is concentrating on plans for a long-haul airliner for 600 to 1,000 passengers. However, the bid for Fokker must first obtain approval from the Dutch government and the European Commission's anti-cartel authorities. The Commission is no great supporter of mergers in the regional aircraft industry, having last year caused an outrage by vetoing an attempt by Aerospatiale and Alenia to buy de Havilland of Canada. Elsewhere in the French aerospace industry, Dassault, the family-controlled producer of fighter aircraft and executive jets, is discussing collaboration on a future generation of fighter aircraft with British Aerospace - a reflection of both governments' belief that Europe cannot afford more than one project of this type. If it comes to fruition, this new fighter would enter production in at least 30 years' time, and is separate from the four-nation European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) and France's Rafale fighter projects. The German government's rethink over the EFA underlines the pressures on European defence budgets. France is sticking with the Rafale, on which Dassault's future largely depends, but has had to delay first deliveries by two years, to 1998. Snecma, the main engine supplier to Dassault and Airbus, is also looking for a foreign partner. It is discussing possible collaboration on future military jet engines with Rolls-Royce of the UK. Currently, Snecma is the only European company to develop a fighter jet engine - the M88 for the Rafale - on its own. By contrast, Snecma decided long ago not to go it alone in civil engines; for the past 23 years, it has had a successful partnership with General Electric of the US. Their joint subsidiary, CFM International, had a 27 per cent share of the world market at the end of last year, making its CFM-56 family of engines the most popular on the market. All this alliance-seeking activity follows another hard year for France's aerospace companies. If anything, the pressure to restructure is more intense than ever. The industry's new orders fell by 30 per cent overall last year and sales are expected to shrink by 25 per cent in real terms by 1995, according to Gifas, the industry umbrella organisation. Aerospatiale's orders fell by 50 per cent last year, while Snecma's fell by 30 per cent. Dassault - which has not won a military export order for four years - saw its orders decline by 25 per cent. Dassault, Snecma and Sextant Avionique, the aerospace electronics group, were all forced to make job cuts. Mr Henri Martre, chairman of both Aerospatiale and Gifas, has warned that more job losses among the industry's 118,300 employees are inevitable. The industry's workforce fell by 2 per cent last year, in line with the fall in sales, but this is not nearly enough given that productivity was improving, argues Mr Martre. To fund their development, both Aerospatiale and Snecma need fresh capital. Aerospatiale has been negotiating to raise around FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) by selling a minority stake to Credit National, the state-owned bank, while Snecma has indicated that it needs around FFr750m. Dassault's main problem is the lack of export orders for its fighters. Military sales still account for three-quarters of the group's total turnover, much higher than the average for the French aerospace industry. It has high hopes for selling 100 Mirage 2000-5 multi-role combat aircraft to Taiwan, but the deal is diplomatically sensitive. At time of writing, the French government was mulling over whether to authorise the deal. A sale would be a coup for Dassault, but would anger China. France has important commercial interests in China and relations with Beijing are already strained because of French tolerance of Chinese dissident activity in Paris. The final decision, says Mr Pierre Joxe, French defence minister, must 'take into account all the short, medium and long-term interests of France.'</p>

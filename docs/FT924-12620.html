			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Production gains lift American Barrick AMERICAN Barrick, the Canadian gold producer which last year had abortive merger talks with Newmont Mining, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 49.5m in the three months to end-September. This compared with Dollars 28.2m in the same period a year earlier. Revenues were up from Dollars 92.4m to Dollars 143.5m, while earnings per share increased from 20 cents to 35 cents. American Barrick has now reported after-tax profits of Dollars 109.4m in the first nine months of 1992, against Dollars 68.4m in the same period of 1991. The company said gold production totalled 838,711 ounces in the nine-month period of 1992. This represents a substantial increase on the 595,524 ounces seen in the same months of 1991, and was attributed to a 66 per cent increase in production at the Goldstrike Mine in Nevada. American Barrick also said it had realised an average price of Dollars 426 an ounce for its gold sales this year, compared with the Comex average gold price of Dollars 346 - reflecting the company's hedging programme. It predicted that it should meet its 1992 production target of 1.2m ounces, with fourth-quarter results improving further. The shares rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 30 5/8.</p>

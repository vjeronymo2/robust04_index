			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Indian police arrested 2,000 people who tried to march on the Madhya Pradesh  state legislature to protest Union Carbide's $470-million settlement in the  1984 Bhopal poison gas disaster. About 5,000 demonstrators, many waving banners  saying "We Want Justice," marched from shantytowns affected by the gas leak  toward the legislature. The arrests were made as the marchers tried to cross a  police barricade. Critics charge that $470 million was too small a settlement.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oldrzhykh Hlavati, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA commentator </F> on energy problems, professor, doctor of chemical sciences, and  section chief at the Institute of Biochemistry and  Petrochemistry under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences: "The  Odessa Oil Terminal Seems Important Only to Our Enemies:  Reverberations Following an Item Published in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA"]    [Text] Appearing in the second issue of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  was an article by a certain Mr. Listopad entitled "Even 70 Grams  Could Destroy Odessa." This item is a classic example of an  incompetent discussion of important problems. If it had appeared  on 1 April, it could have been perceived as a clever joke.    In order to demonstrate the professional level of this  item's  author, let's analyze just a few of the "pearls" with which it  is filled to the brim.    Thus, for example, the author makes a catastrophic  prediction  concerning the Black Sea--"the world's bluest"--by subtracting  from the 2800 tonnes of oil which could get into the water 2600  tonnes, from which the sea could--so to speak--cleanse itself.  If Mr. Listopad had the slighest notion of how to deal with this  problem, he would know that in such calculations 2800 and 2600  tonnes are really the same thing. And there are specialists who  assert that the Black Sea could handle much more than this.    Another piece of nonsense in this article is the following:  "Those persons who were clever enough to catch such  oil-saturated fish, cook them, and eat them are now lying in  cancer-treatment facilities." The exact opposite of this  information is correct. Nowadays many persons ill with cancer  are being successfully treated with gasoline (by the way, in  olden times--before petroleum became a fuel, it was utilized for  treating various diseases).    Here's another "pearl": "Burning oil gives off a cloud of  ammonia, which could turn Odessa into a real graveyard within a  few hours." I do not know what kind of education Mr. Listopad  has, but in a high-school chemistry class he would deserve a  grade no higher than a "Two."    It would be interesting to know whether Mr. Listopad  accumulated this nonsense on his own or whether such  "information" was, perhaps," imparted to him at the Ecological  Academy, the president of which is the academician-economist,  Mr. Dorohuntsov--a person well-known to us by way of the  parliament. Incidentally, the principal specialists in ecology  (including that of the above-mentioned terminal) who are working  for him are also economists who have been generously awarded the  title of academician. We are remined willy-nilly of Krylov's  well-known fable about "piemakers" and "shoemakers."    The fact that Mr. Listopad's article appeared after the  decision to build the Odessa Oil Terminal was adopted leads me  personally to conclude that this is a conscious piece of  disinformation, directed at undermining the terminal, and thus  safeguarding and preserving Russia's monopoly on supplying oil  to Ukraine. Ukrainians, Russians, and members of national  minorities--to which the article's author also belongs--feel in  their own stomachs what this monopoly has brought about. The  reason why the inhabitants of Ukraine, which produces more food  per capita than Russia, have had to eat worse than the  inhabitants of Russia (particularly those in Moscow) during the  last two years is to be explained by this very monopoly. The  fact is that we do indeed buy oil in Russia at a price which--in  dollars--amounts to 80 percent of the world price. But as a  result of the fact that the exchange rate of the ruble to the  karbovanets--something which is also dictated by Russia--exceeds  the real price several times over, we in practice are paying for  this oil at triple the world price. The following paradoxical  situation has evolved: Our state obtains prices which are too  low for its agricultural products and then uses this money to  buy oil in Russia; it then refines it at Ukrainian refineries.  As a consequence of this activity, we are obtaining not a  profit, but rather a decline of our agriculture and an increase  of our debt to Russia (by the way, such a situation was already  begun by L. Kuchma, who now dreams of becoming president and  returning Ukraine to the embrace of its "elder brother"). We  should remind ourselves that Russia is alreading demanding  that--in exchange for our debts--we give it our oil refineries,  trunk pipelines, and the reserves of our underground storage  facilities. In practical terms, this means that Mr. Chernomyrdin  would be in charge of issuing heat to our apartments and houses.  Then we will be shown where crabs spend the winter.    In concluding the topic of oil terminal safety we should  remark that France--which is roughly similar to our  country--takes in approximately 80 million tonnes of oil,  whereas the United States takes in as much as 300 million tonnes  (transporting it in tankers from as far away as the Middle  East!). And there are no serious problems there except for an  occasional accident. And nobody rejects the idea of oil  terminals.    Therefore, if our terminal is built under the direction of a  firm which has worldwide experience, the "world's bluest sea"  will--perhaps--remain virtually unchanged (incidentally its  greatest pollutant nowadays is Odessa's fecal matter--something  which Odessa's people's deputies know about).    Now about the need for such a terminal. This oil terminal  must be built as quickly as possible not only because Russia is  selling us oil at triple the price prevailing on the world  market, but also because it is sending us very bitter,  high-viscosity, high-tar, and high-sulfur types of oil (based on  the principle of "It's no skin off my nose"). This has reached  the point where the Kremenchug Refinery produces diesel fuel  having a sulfur content of 1 percent instead of 0.2 percent (as  a result of which the amount of acid rain has increased by a  factor of 5). Recently, in connection with the poor quality of  crude oil, we have not even been able to make lubricating oils  (products in extremely short supply, and without which we cannot  sow our crops nor even drive to work). Moreover, as to importing  such lubricating oils from Russia, that is impossible  because--despite the enforced cutback in production at Russian  refineries due to the lack of sales, selling these oils to  Ukraine is prohibited (Moscow has issued no quotas).    In summing up, we specialists must issue the following  warning: Unless we have an alternative facility for delivering  energy sources by next winter, we will freeze like the  Armenians, or we will finally lose our independence. It is also  likely that--no matter what happens--we will have to get by on  300 grams of bread, using ration cards as they are now doing in  Georgia.    This past winter (just as during the time of the Chernobyl  catastrophe) we were saved and protected by the Sophia Mother of  God. But we must not abuse Her patience.    In my next article I will talk about what a negative and  unpatriotic role the State Committee on Oil and Gas has played  in solving our energy problems.</p>

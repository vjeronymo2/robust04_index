According to figures collected from the administrations of  the hospitals in Hebron, 31 bodies reached Al-Ahli Hospital.  Four were killed in front of the hospital during confrontations  with the army.    An Israeli settler opened fire on Palestinian worshippers as  they knelt for prayers in the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron, south of  Jerusalem, on the occasion of Ramadan.    Violent demonstrations erupted following the mosque massacre  and more and more Palestinians were killed or wounded during the  clashes between the outraged Palestinians and security forces.    The Israeli soldiers have besieged Al-Ahli Hospital with  hundreds of people inside, and when demonstrations broke out,  four Palestinians were shot dead.    Twelve bodies were brought to Alia Hospital and four bodies  were moved to the Red Crescent in Hebron.    Six bodies were carried to Makassed Hospital in Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Rosenfeld] </F>   [Text] Palestinians in the autonomous areas will be able to  sell gasoline for 15 percent less than the price in Israel as  part of the economic agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians.    Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said Friday the agreement  could be concluded at the end of this week's round of  discussions in Paris, as the sides have already reached  agreement on most of the issues on the table.    At a news conference called to report on the progress  reached  in the last round of talks, which concluded last Tuesday, Shohat  denied that the closure of the territories was designed to put  pressure on the Palestinians at the negotiating table.    However, he admitted that the closure created tension last  week with the Palestinian delegation, which, in reaction,  deferred negotiations on labor issues.    Shohat reported that the sides have reached final agreement  on agriculture, energy and industry. The sides have also  reached a conditional agreement on taxation, which will be  finalized when they agree on a Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for  the autonomous areas. Shohat added that there is still  disagreement on the creation of a Palestinian currency, which  Israel opposes.    Budget Director David Brodet said that the energy agreement  which allows the Palestinians to sell gasoline for 15 percent  less than the price in Israel may increase the competition in  Israel. However, the Palestinians received this concession from  the Israelis based on commitments by oil-producing countries to  provide them with below price crude oil.    The energy agreement, like the industry agreement, sets the  industrial, safety and ecological standards on the respective  products covered. Unlike the industry agreement, the energy  agreement sets the standards for all the petrochemicals entering  the autonomous areas. By contrast, the industry agreement only  sets standards for products that will enter Israel from the  areas. Industrial products remaining in the areas will not need  to conform with those standards.    The agriculture agreement also allows for free trade between  the autonomous areas and Israel, with the exception of tomatoes,  cucumbers, eggs, potatoes and chickens, said Brodet. Those  products will be subject to quotas which will be gradually  phased out over a four-year period.    Shohat said that discussions on labor relations will take  place this week. He added that both sides benefit from  Palestinian labor in Israel, and that Israel will impose neither  a ceiling nor a floor for Palestinian labor and will retain the  right to control the workers' entry into the country.    Shohat also said that three-quarters of the income tax  collected from Palestinians working in Israel will be forwarded  to the autonomous authorities since they will provide the  workers with services.    The only remaining bone of contention on taxation is the  rate  of VAT in the autonomous areas. Shohat reported that the  Palestinians want a VAT of between 15 percent and 16 percent,  while Israel wants it between 16 percent and 17 percent.    The sides have agreed to impose the same duties, with  exceptions for equipment essential for development of the  autonomous areas and limited imports from Arab countries. The  Palestinians will be able to impose whatever income tax rates  they want.    Shohat said that although the economic agreement could be  concluded this week, the Palestinians will only move based on  the progress achieved in the political talks in Cairo. He added  that there are no impediments on Israel's side to sign the  economic agreement before the political agreement.    If the economic agreement is ready before, only the issue of  coordinating the imposition of duties at Palestinian points of  entry will be required, Shohat said.    Shohat rejected the notion that the closure is being used as  a means to put pressure on the Palestinian negotiators. As  proof, he pointed to the NIS [new Israeli shekels] 28 million  the government is spending in the territories to fund public  works during the closure.    "The closure decision is a decision that derives exclusively  from security considerations, despite the fact that even with  the closure terrorist acts occur," said Shohat.</p>

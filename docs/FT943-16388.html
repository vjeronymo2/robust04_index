			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Mobile phone users up by 1m Mobile phone operators have gained 1m new subscribers in the past year, taking the number of mobile phone users in the UK to nearly 2.6m, Andrew Adonis writes. Vodafone and Cellnet, the two largest operators, reported a far higher growth rate for the second quarter of this year than for the same period last year, in spite of the launch of two new cellular networks - Orange and Mercury One-2-One - since last September. Vodafone recorded a net increase of 155,000 subscribers between April and June, up from 57,000 in the same period last year. Cellnet increased its user base by 128,500 in the three months, up from 54,750 last year. One-2-One, which operates only in the London area, has gained about 100,000 subscribers since its launch last September. Orange, owned by Hutchison Microtel, has been operating for barely two months and has yet to release subscriber figures. Industry sources said that June saw a slower rate of increase in new subscribers, with indications of a slowdown after the heavy publicity accompanying the launch of Orange.</p>

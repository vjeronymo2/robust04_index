			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> JOYNER-KERSEE CARRIES TORCH;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: STRUGGLING FESTIVAL NEEDED HER NAME, AND BESIDES, SHE WORKS  FOR THE SPONSOR.  </P> <P> Team Joyner-Kersee held a news conference Wednesday. That's Jackie Joyner and  Bob Kersee. Wife and husband. Athlete and coach. Business and manager. Left  hand and right hand.  </P> <P> What's in a hyphen? With Joyner and Kersee, almost too much. When Jackie  Joyner-Kersee talks, Bob Kersee not only listens, he interrupts, interjects,  interprets, extrapolates, underscores and, often, overrides.  </P> <P> The U.S. Olympic Festival was the reason for this latest exercise in  point-counterpoint. Consider it Jackie's personal Goodwill Games. Starved for  name athletes because Ted Turner's millions have lured most of them to Seattle  later this month, the festival was looking none too festive before Jackie  agreed to drop by and run a few relays, which Jackie ordinarily doesn't run.  </P> <P> In other words, she's here doing charity work.  </P> <P> "I'm here not so much to compete in an event as to lend my name and notoriety  to the Olympic Festival," Jackie said, not immodestly. "I was in the 1981, '85  and '86 festivals and I received a lot of publicity when I was considered a  nobody. I think it's important to uplight the Olympic Festival. That's why I'm  here.  </P> <P> "It is developmental. If it needs help, and if I can help it, I'm here."  </P> <P> Bob, as always, had something to say about this.  </P> <P> "A lot of athletes would rather go to Europe than come to the festival," he  said. "If Jackie was in Europe, she'd be making a pretty penny, too.  </P> <P> "But if you're going to support track and field, it's not based on money all  the time. . . . It doesn't matter who you are -- men or women athletes can find  a way to support the Olympic Festival."  </P> <P> Of course, support comes easier when you're bound to a McDonald's endorsement  contract and McDonald's has just poured loads of money into the Olympic  Festival. McDonald's to Jackie: Minneapolis is your kind of place . . . isn't  it?  </P> <P> "I'm sure they did want her here," Bob said with a laugh. "But McDonald's  didn't put any pressure on her."  </P> <P> No. Just the golden arches logo on her back as Jackie took a lap inside the  Metrodome and lit the Olympic Festival flame during last Friday's opening  ceremonies.  </P> <P> Jackie, the world record-holder in the heptathlon, isn't competing in that  event here. But she will in two weeks in Seattle.  </P> <P> "This is a good tuneup meet," Bob said. Jackie instead will run in the  100-meter and 400-meter relays and is entered in the high jump and javelin  throw -- but only as an "exhibition" entrant.  </P> <P> "If I want to go for 7,300 (heptathlon points) at the Goodwill Games, I'm going  to need the high jump and the javelin to be on."  </P> <P> And Jackie is going for 7,300. Bob has decided so. Jackie currently holds the  world record at 7,291 points, but Bob said: "If we're going to break it, I  don't want to break it with 7,292. We're shooting for 7,300 points. That's the  ultimate goal. I'd like to see her break that barrier."  </P> <P> Bob has placed 7,300 points upon the pedestal because he's been dissatisfied  with Jackie's efforts in recent meets.  </P> <P> "I guess it was around February that Jackie began to get a little spoiled," he  said. "She'd be getting six second(-place finishes), seven thirds, collecting  her money -- and not giving me my coaching fee."  </P> <P> Jackie laughed.  </P> <P> "The last couple of months, I've been doing most of the cooking at home," Bob  continued. "Jackie's been mad because I've been on her pretty hard.  </P> <P> "Jackie needs motivation. Back in '88, she had goals. She wanted to set the  world record, she wanted to win the gold medal. Now, we've accomplished those  goals, and she's chasing her own record. You look at 7,300 points and think how  difficult 7,100 was and how difficult 7,200 was, but once those goals are  achieved, you have to redo them.  </P> <P> "Jackie's motivated and wants to stay in the sport, but at times she complains  at practice how the coaches and everybody else is bringing her down. All I know  is that in '86 and '87, she'd never take off to go to the Miss USA Pageant."  </P> <P> Jackie reached over and punched Bob in the arm.  </P> <P> "I think Bobby is right about 50% of the time," Jackie said.  </P> <P> Bob pressed onward, if not his luck.  </P> <P> "Coaching Jackie, nothing surprises me," he said. "She can look shabby one week  and still come out OK. . . . At Azusa this year, Jackie played around and still  scored 6,700 points. She was ready to high jump well -- and she pulled up. She  was ready for a fast 200 (meters) -- and she came out of the curve looking like  me.  </P> <P> "I watched her long-jump at the nationals, running into a headwind on a poor  surface, and she did seven meters three times. If half of that wind had been  behind her, she'd have gone 7.30, 7.40, easy.  </P> <P> "If she worked on the long jump as hard as she does the heptathlon, she could  be the first woman to go 25 feet. I'd hate to see her retire from the  heptathlon, but if she focused on the long jump and maybe two hurdles, Lord  knows what she'd be capable of."  </P> <P> Eventually, a reporter was able to get a word in edgewise.  </P> <P> Question: How many more years does Jackie want to compete?  </P> <P> Jackie: "All my life . . . "  </P> <P> Bob: "That's probably true."  </P> <P> Jackie: "Actually, at one time, we were talking about going through '92, early  '93. But for now I'm leaving it open."  </P> <P> Besides, what would Bob ever do if Jackie retired?  </P></p>

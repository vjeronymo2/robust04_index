Section 506(b) extends the benefits of adjustment of status to permanent resident status to aliens who entered the U.S. without inspection and to certain other aliens. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule shall take effect on October 1, 1994.

L. 103&hyph;317. Section 506(b) thereof amends INA 245 to permit qualified immigrants to acquire permanent residence through adjustment of status in the United States even though they entered the United States without inspection or violated their nonimmigrant status after entry. The specific amendment to INA 245 is a new subsection (i) which reads as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically present in the United States who_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) entered the United States without inspection; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Attorney General may accept such application only if the alien remits with such application a sum equalling five times the fee required for the processing of applications under this section as of the date of receipt of the application, but such sum shall not be required from a child under the age of seventeen, or an alien who is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 at any date, who_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, resided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a lawful permanent resident; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) applied for benefits under section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. The sum specified herein shall be in addition to the fee normally required for the processing of an application under this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

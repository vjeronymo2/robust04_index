			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chairman of Audi forced to leave post Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman of Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary, was sacked yesterday. His responsibilities for marketing and distribution were taken over immediately by Mr Herbert Demel, technical development director. As expected, Mr Demel, 40, the youngest member of the quality carmaker's board, was not given the title of chairman. Instead, he will act as board 'spokesman', with the same formal rank and powers as his three remaining colleagues. The sacking was approved unanimously by a meeting of the Audi supervisory board, chaired by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, in the presence of Mr Kortum. A short statement, issued later, said his contract was to be cancelled with immediate effect. Mr Kortum's departure followed losses of at least DM200m (Dollars 115.6m) last year and clashes with Mr Piech, who headed Audi until taking charge of the VW group in January 1993. Mr Piech discussed the manufacturing site for a planned new Audi model - one of the sources of friction between the two men - at a meeting on Thursday night with Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria, Audi's home state. Mr Stoiber's office said yesterday the regional government would do everything in its power to have the car built in the state, where every seventh job depended on the automotive industry. It made no reference to Mr Piech's position on the project, which suggested he is still considering using existing spare capacity, possibly in Belgium or Saxony. Yesterday's events suggested Audi will be run more as an operating division of the group, under control from its Wolfsburg headquarters, rather than as a stand-alone subsidiary.</p>

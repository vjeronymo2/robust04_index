			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: 'No mystery' Sir, I refer to the first question and answer in your Briefcase column last week (May 7/8). If no one has heard of the Rule of Three, then it reinforces my conviction that the common stock of general knowledge can no longer be counted upon. There is no mystery about the Rule of Three. It has a sufficiently established place in the language to figure in the Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. Q-R, p882. It is defined as 'a method of finding a fourth number from three given numbers, of which the first is in the same proportion to the second as the third is to the unknown fourth' - with eight supporting quotations from 1594 to 1891. So much for the Rule of Three. The genuine mystery is how the bank concerned managed to use this simple rule to turn Pounds 9,000 into Pounds 30,000 unless the phrase was invoked as token of a probverbially arcane procedure. Are we back in Kipling's world of the 'gods of the copybook headings'?

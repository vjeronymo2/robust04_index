			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- Provisions Governing  the Accounts of Consumption Tax (hereafter referred to as the  "provisions")    The "Interim Regulations of the PRC on Consumption Tax" have  been promulgated by the State Council. Procedures and  provisions governing the accounts of consumption tax follow:    Article 1. For business accounting purposes, consumption  tax- paying enterprises should add another subsidiary entry on  "consumption tax payable" to the "tax payable" entry.    Article 2. An enterprise -- that needs to pay consumption  tax on consumer goods it produces -- should, when selling the  product, debit and list the amount of consumption tax payable  under an entry on "products' consumption tax and others;"  whereas it should credit the same amount to another entry on  "tax payable/consumption tax payable." Upon actually paying the  consumption tax, it should debit the amount from the entry on  "tax payable/consumption tax payable," and should credit the  same amount to an entry on "bank deposit." It should reverse  the debiting and crediting processes when goods sold are  returned and when taxes paid are rebated.    An enterprise exporting taxable consumer goods that receive  no tax exemption or rebate according to regulations, shall be  regarded as selling domestically, and it should carry out  accounting entries in accordance with the above stipulation.    Article 3. According to the "provisions," the amount of  consumption tax payable by an enterprise that regards taxable  consumer goods it produces as investments, should be listed and  debited under an entry on "long-term investment," while the same  amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption  tax payable."    An enterprise -- that produces taxable consumer goods in  exchange for means of production and consumer goods, or for  offsetting debts or settling fees of purchasing agents -- shall  be regarded as conducting sales, and its accounting entries  should be handled accordingly. According to the "provisions,"  it should pay consumption tax, and it should handle its  accounting entries in accordance with Article 2 of the  "provisions."    According to the "provisions," an enterprise -- that  produces  taxable consumer goods and uses them in other areas including  ongoing construction projects and non-production organizations  -- should pay consumption tax. The amount of consumption tax  payable should be listed and debited under entries on "fixed  assets," "ongoing construction projects," "non-business  expenses," or "product-marketing expenses," while the same  amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption  tax payable."    According to the "provisions," consumption tax shall be  levied on packaging materials that are sold with the products,  but that are charged separately. The amount of consumption tax  payable should be listed and debited under an entry on "other  business expenses," while the same amount is credited to another  entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." According to  the "provisions," consumption tax shall be levied on the deposit  or security on packaging materials that are overdue and that are  not returned to buyers. The tax payable should be debited under  entries on "other business expenses" and "other payments due,"  while the same amount is credited to another entry on "tax  payable/consumption tax payable."    Upon actually paying the consumption tax, the enterprise  should debit the amount from the entry on "tax  payable/consumption tax payable," and should credit the same  amount to an entry on "bank deposit."    Article 4. Contract processing on taxable consumer goods is  liable for consumption tax. When the consignor comes to pick up  his processed goods, the consignee shall withhold and pay later  on his behalf the amount of consumption tax payable. The  consignee should debit the withheld consumption tax under  entries on "accounts receivable" and "bank deposit," while  crediting the same amount to another entry on "tax  payable/consumption tax payable." If the consignor is to sell  the processed taxable consumer goods immediately after  repossessing them, he should list the withheld consumption tax  as part of the processed taxable consumer goods' costs to be  debited under entries on "contract processing materials,"  "production costs," and "independently-manufactured semifinished  products," while crediting the same amount to other entries on  "accounts payable" and "bank deposit." According to the  "provisions," the withheld consumption tax shall be deductible  if the consignor repossesses and uses the processed taxable  consumer goods to reproduce other taxable consumer goods. He  should list and debit the withheld consumption tax under the  entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable," while crediting  the same amount to other entries on "accounts payable" and "bank  deposit."    Article 5. Imported consumer goods are liable for  consumption tax which should be part of their costs. It should  be listed and debited under entries on "fixed assets," "purchase  of commodities," and "purchase of materials," while being  credited to the entry on "bank deposit."    Article 6. Various taxable consumer goods for exports that  are exempted from consumption tax should be categorized under  different accounting methods:    1. Consumption tax payable need not be calculated if the  "provisions" have directly granted tax exemption to a production  enterprise that directly exports taxable consumer goods or that  indirectly exports them through other foreign trade enterprises.    2. If an enterprise -- that indirectly exports taxable  consumer goods through other foreign trade enterprises -- adopts  the method of paying the tax first and then reclaiming it later  in accordance with the "provisions'" stipulations, the following  accounting methods shall apply:    a. A production enterprise -- that entrusts another foreign  trade enterprise to export on its behalf taxable consumer goods  -- should list and debit the amount of consumption tax payable  under an entry on "accounts receivable," while crediting the  same amount to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax  payable." Upon actually paying the consumption tax, it should  debit the amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax  payable," and should credit the same amount to an entry on "bank  deposit." When the tax paid is rebated from the foreign trade  enterprise agency that exported the taxable consumer goods, the  production enterprise should debit the amount from the "bank  deposit" entry, while crediting the same amount to another entry  on "accounts receivable." It should reverse the debiting and  crediting processes when exported goods are returned whereby  taxes rebated have to be repaid once again.    After exporting the taxable consumer goods and upon  receiving  from the taxation administration department the consumption tax  previously paid by the production enterprise, the foreign trade  enterprise agency should list and debit the amount under an  entry on "bank deposit," while crediting the same amount to  another entry on "accounts payable." On returning the same  rebated tax amount to the production enterprise, the foreign  trade enterprise agency should debit the amount from the  "accounts payable" entry, while crediting the same amount to the  "bank deposit" entry. When exported goods are returned whereby  taxes rebated have to be repaid once again, it should debit the  amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable,"  while crediting the same amount to the "bank deposit" entry.  Upon receiving from the production enterprise the consumption  tax rebated previously, the foreign trade enterprise agency  should reverse the debiting and crediting processes.    b. If an enterprise sells its taxable consumer goods to  another foreign trade enterprise which will export the goods on  its own, the production enterprise shall handle the accounts  concerning consumption tax payable in accordance with the  stipulations of Article 2 of the "provisions."    After exporting the taxable consumer goods with customs  declaration forms and upon applying for exports tax rebate, the  foreign trade enterprise exporting taxable consumer goods on its  own should debit the amount from an entry on "exports tax rebate  receivable," while crediting the same amount to another entry on  "sales costs of commodities." Upon actually receiving the tax  rebate on the exported taxable consumer goods, the enterprise  should debit the amount from an entry on "bank deposit," while  crediting the same amount to another entry on "exports tax  rebate receivable." It should reverse the debiting and crediting  processes when exported goods are returned whereby consumption  taxes rebated have to be repaid once again.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: CURTAIN IS GOING UP ON OPERA'S 5TH SEASON  </P> <P> Fall means opera, the official opening of the September social season. Peggy  Parker-Grauman and Jennifer Diener host a kickoff committee meeting at a  luncheon Tuesday at Patina on Melrose.  </P> <P> The fifth season of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera opens Sept. 4 with the  gala benefit premiere of Beethoven's only opera, "Fidelio." Parker-Grauman and  her husband, Walter Grauman, are chairing the evening and Jennifer and Royce  Diener are co-chairmen. They hope for a moonlit post-performance party on the  Music Center Plaza.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch underwrites both the opening-night performance and the gala. That  means all proceeds from the $650-a-person event can go to the opera company.  </P> <P> The executive committee includes Deborah and Tom Tellefsen, Katherine and Arpad  Domyan, Ginny and Henry Mancini, Anne and Franklin Johnson, Carol and Warner  Henry, Susana and Peter Funsten, Kathy and Bob Ray Offenhauser, Annette and  Peter O'Malley, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, Georgia Frontiere, Rosanna Hill  and Jim Gigans.  </P> <P> On the committee are Joan Hotchkis, Kathryn Klinger Belton, Hannah Carter,  Alice Coulombe, Suzanne Rheinstein, Paulette Ziffren, Barbara Davis, Flora  Thornton, Terri Childs, Jinny Geller, Enid Koffler, Winnie Schweitzer and many  more.  </P> <P> CATCH-UP: At the recent Nixon gala at the Century Plaza, there were travel  asides. Former First Daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and her son, Christopher, had  been invited to the White House earlier in the week. The story circulated that  they wished to take a gift to the White House, and that Christopher decided it  should be for First Dog Millie. Millie was routed from the Oval Office and  received her present -- not specified -- in the family quarters where Tricia  once lived. They flew to California on Air Force One for the gala.  </P> <P> Julie and David Eisenhower and their three children were house guests after the  gala at the St. Malo enclave in Oceanside, invited by Craig and Jane Gosden.  Craig Gosden was an usher in the Eisenhower wedding and an assistant to John  Ehrlichman, assistant to Nixon for domestic affairs.  </P> <P> UPSCALE: Long Ellis, Robert J. Kelleher, Jack Kramer, Gerald L. Parsky and  former U.S. Atty. Gen.

They plan cocktails and a buffet dinner followed by a Night of  Tennis at the Volvo Tennis/Los Angeles James E. West Center at UCLA. Proceeds  will benefit the Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.  </P> <P> THE WHIRL: Altovise Davis, widow of Sammy Davis Jr., plans to join Helen  Harris, president of Retinitis Pigmentosa International at the Charity Awards  Dinner Tuesday in Washington. The party will center around "Forgotten Eyes,"  the last recording Davis made. He also was co-host of the "Hope in Sight  Telethon" for four years. Harris will receive the Presidential Award.  Songwriter Carol Connors will also be honored.  </P> <P> WITH LOVE: The Commons in Pasadena will sport continental jazz with the Jake  Porter Band and gourmet fare for Hospice de Beaune at a benefit this evening  for hospice programs in the West San Gabriel Valley.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CMG ahead and plans flotation next spring Computer Management Group, a privately held computing services company operating chiefly in the UK and continental Europe, achieved increased turnover and profits before tax in 1993. The company has, subject to market conditions, decided to float on the London Stock Exchange in the spring of 1995 through a placing that will value it at about Pounds 130m. Turnover for 1993 reached Pounds 128.8m, an increase of 19 per cent on the previous year's Pounds 107.8m, and pre-tax profits rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 11.1m. Earnings per share, however, at 35.4p fully diluted were only slightly ahead of the 35.3p recorded last time. Mr Chris Banks, group finance director, said that although the company had grown some 5 per cent in Germany it had lost money there, leading to tax charges which could not be offset against losses. As a result, the tax charge grew from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 5.8m. Growth had been strong in the Netherlands, helped by two small acquisitions, but weak in the UK. There were signs that the latter was improving and the company would continue to grow in 1994. CMG is an employee-owned company with some 1,800 shareholders comprising employees, former employees and close relatives. A dividend for the year of 13.1p will be paid. Dividend cover is 2.6 times. Mr Banks said the company had decided to come to the market to improve its scope for growth, to provide liquidity for existing shareholders and to underline the company's public image. Kleinwort Benson will be adviser to the flotation.</p>

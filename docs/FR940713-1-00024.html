			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Any mechanical process modifications, other than that listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, such as hot water rinses, used singly or in combination with approved antimicrobial compounds may be used, provided the owner or operator has received approval for such use from the Administrator. The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator information and data indicating that the proposed method is effective in reducing bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces, and it will not render the carcass adulterated or misbranded or otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 381.76 would be amended by adding a heading for paragraph (a), revising paragraphs (b) and (c), and adding new paragraphs (d) through (h) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;381.76 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Post-mortem inspection, when required; extent; rate of inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line configuration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two inspection stations located on each post-mortem inspection line. The first inspection station is located immediately after the establishment sorter or sorters who are positioned immediately after evisceration. This is known as the ``on-line post-mortem inspection station.'' The second inspection station is located after the final wash and prior to the chiller. This is known as the ``on-line/off-line carcass inspection station.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Presentation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The establishment is responsible for presenting to the on-line post-mortem inspector only carcasses that are free of pathology and disease that would result in condemnation, in accordance with this part, designated for trimming or knife salvage of such conditions, or designated for reprocessing. The establishment shall present each carcass to the on-line post-mortem inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The establishment shall place a sorter or sorters immediately after evisceration and prior to the on-line post-mortem inspector to sort the carcasses and remove and condemn the carcasses, as necessary, or designate the carcasses for knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing. The establishment sorter or sorters shall be positioned on the processing line in a manner that does not impede inspection. The establishment records the reason for condemnation of every carcass for each sorter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The on-line post-mortem inspector shall assure that carcasses are appropriately designated for knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing, and that condemnable carcasses are condemned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the on-line post-mortem inspector finds any birds on the processing line that should have been condemned or designated for knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing, he or she shall stop the line for proper disposition, and require removal of such birds, and recording of condemned birds by the establishment. The on-line post-mortem inspector shall retain questionable birds for disposition by the inspector in charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass that were not designated by the establishment sorter for off-line trimming, knife salvage, or reprocessing shall be passed by the on-line post-mortem inspector, but he or she shall stop the line and the establishment shall be required to remove them for off-line trimming or knife salvage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Carcasses that are designated for off-line trimming shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment after the on-line post-mortem inspector and prior to viscera harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Carcasses that are designated for knife salvage shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment after the on-line post-mortem inspector and before the viscera harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Carcasses that are designated for reprocessing shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment after the on-line post-mortem inspector and prior to the viscera harvest and reprocessed at an approved reprocessing station, as prescribed in &sect;381.91(b). Such reprocessed birds shall be returned to the processing line by the establishment after viscera harvest and prior to the on-line/off-line carcass inspector for reinspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The establishment is responsible for presenting to the on-line/off-line carcass inspector only carcasses that are free of fecal contamination and have been properly trimmed or reprocessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

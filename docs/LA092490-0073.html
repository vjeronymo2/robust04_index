			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GASOLINE PRICE TOPS $1.38, AN ALL-TIME HIGH  </P> <P> Fueled by uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, gasoline prices have hit an all-time  high with the average pump price jumping nearly 3 cents a gallon in the last  two weeks, a leading oil analyst said Sunday.  </P> <P> American motorists are paying an average of $1.3835 per gallon at the pump,  according to the latest Lundberg Survey of national gasoline prices, which was  conducted Friday. Motorists spent an average of $1.3544 cents a gallon on Sept.  7.  </P> <P> The previous high of just under $1.38 was set in March, 1981.  </P> <P> "The new high doesn't take into account inflation, but even so, it's  significant," said Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the twice-monthly Lundberg  Survey of 13,000 service stations.  </P> <P> Oil prices have fluctuated greatly in recent days, Lundberg said Sunday, driven  by fears of a war in the Middle East in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of  neighboring Kuwait. The fear is that a war could create a serious supply  upheaval and that replacing gasoline supplies could be difficult, she said.  </P> <P> Industry experts said Sunday that there is little hope of quick relief at the  gas pumps.  </P> <P> "I don't see oil prices coming down as long as we have so much production off  the market -- what Iraq and Kuwait normally would have produced," said Kurt  Wulff, an oil analyst with McDep Associates Inc., a New York-based oil and gas  investment research firm. "I do see them coming down in the springtime when our  consumption is less."  </P> <P> Lundberg's survey showed that at self-service pumps, regular unleaded gasoline  sold for $1.2736 a gallon on the average, premium unleaded was $1.4405 cents a  gallon and regular leaded was $1.2551 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> At full-service stations, regular unleaded was $1.4959 a gallon, premium  unleaded was $1.6319 and regular leaded was $1.4783 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> At one Los Angeles Chevron station, regular gasoline was selling Sunday for  $1.24 a gallon at the self-service pump and for $1.51 at the full-service pump.  Self-service unleaded was $1.28, while full-service unleaded sold for $1.61.  Premium unleaded ran $1.45 for self-service and $1.68 for full service.  </P> <P> "The general picture is that oil prices bumped up a lot in the middle of  August, settled back a bit, and now we're right back where we were in the  middle of August," Wulff said. "The question now is where we're headed from  here. . . . If the current stalemate continues, I believe that oil prices will  strengthen further."  </P> <P> Joseph Lastelic, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said crude  oil prices started to creep up in July, then took a big jump in August. As of  two weeks ago, crude oil prices had climbed more than 30 cents a gallon since  the Aug. 2 invasion. But gasoline prices have jumped only about 20 cents a  gallon in the same period, he said.  </P> <P> "This kind of proves that the (gasoline) companies are restraining the  increases," he said.  </P> <P> Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director for Citizen Action, a Washington-based  consumer group, disputed Lastelic's view of oil company restraint.  </P> <P> For starters, he said Sunday, although the price of crude oil fell $5 a barrel  between January, 1990, and June, 1990, gasoline prices went up, "so refiners  were not passing on their lower costs to consumers."  </P> <P> Oil companies have "shown some restraint in the last few weeks, but overall the  companies have still earned a huge windfall since the beginning of August,"  Rothschild said. "They have slowed down the price increases somewhat for  consumers, but they're passing on higher prices in the form of jet fuel and  diesel fuel and home heating oil."  </P> <P> The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </P> <P> Average price of all grades of gas nationally in dollars.  </P> <P> July. 20: 1.17  </P> <P> Aug. 10: 1.27  </P> <P> 24: 1.33  </P> <P> Sept. 7: 1.35  </P> <P> 23: 1.38  </P></p>

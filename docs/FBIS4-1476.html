			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Afrikaner Volksfront leader Dr. Ferdi </F> Hartzenberg at flag-raising ceremony at Donkerhoek, Pretoria, on  26 April -- recorded]    [Text] Honorable Mr. Chairman, honorable Rev. Sarel  Cilliers, and honorable fellow countrymen. Tonight we stand at  the same point where our people stood on 31 May 1902 when they  lost their freedom after much sacrifice, much loss of life, much  struggle, but also after much faith and deep nationalism, and  the desire for freedom which drove them.    Friends, at midnight tonight, with the inauguration of the  new constitution and the lowering of the South African flag, we  have once again lost our freedom. According to this  constitution, we are again a subjected people who will be  governed by a foreign government. Friends, just as in 1902 when  President Kruger, in exile in Switzerland, received the news  that the war had been lost, that freedom had been lost, and with  that message weighing down on him, he raised himself and sent  his final message to his people. At that moment, when the  nation was at its lowest point, he said: Build, because the  future belongs to you.    Friends, President Kruger was able to utter those words  because he firmly believed that his people and all the peoples  of the world are ruled by the Holy Trinity, and therefore in the  course of the century our people again got back their freedom.  I say to you tonight, this great crowd of people gathered here  at this early hour of the morning, I say to you that what you  are doing here is what President Kruger did. When the flag was  lowered, when we lost our freedom, that was the first great step  on the road to reclaiming our freedom, when you once again  raised our flag, and when you once again raised the flag of  freedom.    Friends, that is the first step. It says to the world and to  South Africa and to all who would listen that from this moment  on, the desire for freedom and the struggle for freedom and the  ideals of the Afrikaner will burn more strongly every moment,  every day until that freedom has been regained and we are once  again free in our own fatherland. We say today that step by  step, bit by bit, we will reclaim our victory. We will keep  that which rightfully belongs to us -- our schools, our  hospitals, our local authorities. We will reclaim them until we  once again are a truly free people with our own constitution,  our own elections, in our own homeland, and where the Afrikaner  nation's flag will once again flutter over us.    Friends, the Afrikaner nation is in the vanguard, carrying  the freedom flame, because we know that after this election, and  in the months ahead, nationalism and ethnicity will once again  flare up, as is happening at this moment in Namibia/South-West  Africa. There, six peoples are in the process of breaking away  from the unitary state and from the subjection. They are in the  process of restoring their kingdoms, claiming their  self-determination and their land. Some of them, like the  Basters, are already headed for the World Court. That  nationalism is reawakening and breaking down the unitary state.    Here in South Africa, friends, the Afrikaner is in the  vanguard. We are not going to wait for 3 or 4 years before  stepping onto the road to freedom. We are beginning right at  this moment, with our feet firmly on that road. Because we have  our feet on that road, and because we have refused to sign our  freedom away and because we have refused to allow others to  decide on our future, thereby lowering ourselves to the level of  advisers on our own future, because we refused to sign away that  freedom, our hands are clean and we can demand the right of a  free people in our own fatherland with a clean conscience  [applause].    Friends, we did not sign for a subordinate position, and  that  is why I believe that the Afrikaner nation, through what it has  done until tonight, and what it will do henceforth is not only  going to be in the interest of our people; it will not only  bring our people's freedom; and that freedom which we are  striving for, friends, is not a freedom at the expense of  others. We have no desire to rule over another nation. Absent  too, however, is the possibility that another nation can rule  over us and we accept it without putting up a fight. Because  friends, we cannot be made slaves, because as freely as the  eagle flies, such is the flight of our spirit, because the  spaces of this country have fed our spirit.    And that is why, friends, I believe that what we are in the  process of doing now, the road we have chosen, the successes  which we are going to achieve, they will also be to the  advantage of other nations, because the precedent that we have  set, they too can reap good from it.    But friends, it will not only benefit our nation and the  people of South Africa, but it will also benefit all the nations  in the world who are peace-loving and who want to be free,  because world communism, which does not only want to dominate  South Africa alone, which says that once this system has been  established here -- which is their objective -- then they will  stir up the impoverished southern world against the rich north  to strike the final blow in subjecting the world to a communist  government.    And that is why I believe that what we are doing is right.  We believe it is divinely arranged -- that nations have to be  free, that their places of abode and eras have been  predetermined. And that is why we know it will be in the  interest of the rest of the world.    But friends, it will also -- at the highest level -- be to  the honor of the Holy Trinity whose name we will always profess  so that the anti-Christ will be destroyed. This befits a  Christian nation. And friends, I want to tell you tonight: We  are entering the process of trials and tribulations; we are  entering an era during which we will be tested, and this is  already evident. We have always trusted people, we have always  trusted other nations. But tonight the Afrikaner nation is  standing alone before God, where it belongs. That is where we  belong. For that reason, friends, I want to tell you tonight,  in our history there has never been a power, another nation, no  one who came to our nation's rescue. We only had one refuge,  and each time we turned to that refuge, to the King of Kings.  When we turned to Him, our nation rose again out of the depths  and was placed on the highest levels. And that is why I say to  you tonight, we are again standing there -- before our God.  And friends, I want to ask you tonight, do we not find  ourselves tonight in the most privileged position? While we  were in the depths of darkness during the last decade, we knew  where our salvation was. Once more we again know before whom we  must bow. Now we know we may not place our trust in the world,  in horses, in military vehicles and worldly forces. We must  trust in God, the three in one. And friends, is a nation not at  its pinnacle when it bows before its God when times are bad?  That is where we are standing tonight. And that is why we have  no doubts in the future. That is why we know, because the master  of the world, because He is in control. We know there is a  future. That is why we can tell each other tonight: Rise.  Walk on the big road of South Africa. Build, because the future  is ours.    Friends, let it be so, that this hour becomes the biggest  hour in our history. Because in the hour that we were  subjected, the nation turned to God; and in that hour the nation  found the power, the will and the endurance to get up and act,  and it attained its freedom. Thank you very much.</p>

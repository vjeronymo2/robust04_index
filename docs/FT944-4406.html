			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Anglo United reduces loss to Pounds 3m Anglo United, the loss-making fuels distributor and a preferred bidder for the smokeless fuels arm of British Coal, has halved its interim deficit through cost-cutting and lower interest charges. The group, which has had two debt restructurings and a Pounds 25m rescue rights issue since 1991, is also in talks with its bankers to seek support for a further refinancing and cash call to fund the Coal Products bid. The acquisition is crucial to the future of Anglo United, which faces a mature and declining market in its main Coalite smokeless fuels business. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said he hoped the negotiations would 'clear the way to achieve a successful conclusion.' Anglo is believed to have offered between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m for Coal Products. Meanwhile, Anglo announced a reduction in pre-tax losses for the six months to September 30 from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 3.2m. Sales of Pounds 90.2m compared with Pounds 236m previously, which included Pounds 135m from discontinued activities. The change reflected the Pounds 30m disposal in March of Charrington Fuels. Mr Cottam said that both the uncertainty surrounding the privatisation of British Coal and falling demand for domestic solid fuel had hit sales. In spite of these difficulties, operating profits from the core manufacture and distribution of solid fuels and chemicals rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. Cost-cutting in the Coalite business and increased market share in fuel distribution and chemicals helped to buoy profits. Anglo United's debt fell Pounds 26m to Pounds 102m, following the Charrington sale. The loss per share halved from 0.8p to 0.4p. There was no dividend.</p>

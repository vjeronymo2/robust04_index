It will be the committee's last meeting and will put  the final touches on the measures leading up to the signing  ceremonies. On the telephone from Yemen, the country's Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah told our news desk:    [Begin Basindwah recording] It was only natural that we  decide on Amman, the capital of brotherly Jordan, to be the  venue for signing the accord document, in view of the key role  played by Jordanian officials, above all His Majesty King  Husayn, in the reconciliation effort. If the signing is not to  take place on Yemeni territory, then Amman is the right choice.  We hope that when the signing takes place on 10 Ramadan [20  February] in Amman, it will mark the beginning of the end of the  crisis that--had it not been for God's providence--would have  pushed Yemen over the brink of disaster. I hope Amman's  spiritual atmosphere in this favored month will rub off on the  signing ceremonies. I am confident that his majesty's wisdom  will go a long way toward a Yemeni reunion and the closing of  ranks so we can pursue our constructive drive on the road to  unity and democracy and a glorious and immortal Yemen will  emerge, and, God willing, our country will be a source of  strength and support for all its Arab brethren.

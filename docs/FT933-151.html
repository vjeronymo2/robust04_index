			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Shares in Hogg fall after profit confusion SHARES in Hogg Group, the insurance group, dropped sharply yesterday in response to unexpectedly low profits and confusion over the way in which the company's year-end figures were reported. Pre-tax profits fell by one quarter to Pounds 5.03m in the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 6.8m in the first half last year. The shares fell from 211p to a low of 170p, before closing at 172p. But an extremely brief set of results omitting most of the detailed figures was released on the Stock Exchange's regulatory news service early yesterday morning, which inaccurately showed pre-tax profits at Pounds 5.08m. That soon led to a report on Extel, the financial news wire, that 'a major part of the company's interim results statement figures had not been published by the stock exchange' and that the shares dropped 'in the absence of sufficient background information'. The stock exchange published a more complete set of results almost two hours' later. To add to the confusion, the London Evening Standard newspaper also reported the decline in Hogg's profits inaccurately in its first edition, and later blanked out parts of the story at the request of the company. Hogg said the stock exchange had slipped up. But the exchange insisted that the company had failed to provide all the information, and the second statement was issued after a missing page in the press release had been supplied. The stock exchange said it had asked Extel to make a correction, arguing that the wire service report had suggested inaccurately that it was at fault. Hogg's results were reduced partly as a result of Pounds 1.2m in costs from unexpected cancellations of contracts placed last year through Downes &amp; Burke, its fine arts and jewellery division. Profits were boosted by Pounds 1.1m in exchange gains from dollar brokerage and currency translation at higher rates than last year. It said the underlying growth in worldwide brokerage was 2.3 per cent up on the first half last year. Turnover rose to Pounds 62.7m, from Pounds 56.1m, earnings per share were 4.71p, against 6p, and the interim dividend was maintained at 3.15p.</p>

He pointed out that even  though the Mexican Stock Market has seen a decrease in the  number of transactions, this is a natural phenomenon because of  the recent assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio [Institutional  Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential candidate]. In an  interview, Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas said stability in the  Mexican Stock Market will depend on immediate actions by the  government.    [Begin Altamirano recording] The interests of the country  should prevail over other interests no matter how legitimate  they may be. We want the death of Colosio to be cleared up and  explained. We join the demand that exists. We want an in-depth  investigation. Those responsible should be arrested and  punished with the full weight of the law. We also believe the  1994 election process should be clean and legitimate. I believe  it all goes together. Whoever wants to bet against this  situation would be sowing uncertainty and possibly violence in  the country. We do not want that. [end recording]    Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, president of the PAN in the  capital, also said the PRI should have a new presidential  candidate soon because he will have to conduct an intense  campaign as the opposition is already getting the citizens'  support.    In addition, deputies from the Party of the Democratic  Revolution [PRD] rejected all kinds of violence and sent their  condolences to the relatives of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In a news  conference, the PRD deputies demanded a thorough investigation  of the PRI candidate's assassination and demanded that those  found guilty be punished. PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas said the  commission that will investigate the attack on Luis Donaldo  Colosio has begun to operate and will be in Tijuana on Saturday  to meet with the high-ranking federal authorities. The PRD  deputy said the area where the attack took place will be studied  and a detailed report will be drafted that will be submitted on  Monday to the Congressional Permanent Commission, which will  also hold sessions on that day. That is all we have for now.</p>

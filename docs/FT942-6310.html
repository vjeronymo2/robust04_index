			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Former PM given Mondadori board seat Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday took further steps to distance himself from his business interests by appointing a respected Italian parliamentarian to the board of Mondadori, the publishing company he intends to float on the Milan bourse. However, at the same time, it was revealed that Mr Pier Silvio Berlusconi and Ms Marina Berlusconi - the prime minister's two grown-up children from his first marriage - had been given seats on the board, indicating that the media magnate has no intention of abandoning ultimate ownership of his stake in the group. The appointment of Mr Giovanni Spadolini, a Republican senator and former prime minister, is intended as a guarantee, if only symbolic, that Mr Berlusconi will keep his political and publishing interests apart. Mr Spadolini stood against Mr Berlusconi's candidate in last month's election for speaker of the senate, and lost by only one vote. A handful of the media magnate's close political and business associates have stepped down from the Mondadori board ahead of flotation, which is likely to take place in July. The company said its chairman, Mr Leonardo Mondadori, had asked Mr Spadolini to become a director 'as a guarantor of the cultural continuity and of the independence of the publishing house'. At the moment, only 2 per cent of Mondadori is quoted on the Milan stock exchange. Mondadori has now merged with Silvio Berlusconi Editore, the private company which holds the prime minister's other publishing interests, and yesterday's board meeting formally approved the plan to float up to 53 per cent of the company. The roadshow for the sale will begin tomorrow. Mr Franco Tato, Mondadori's chief executive, revealed at yesterday's meeting that the combined company would have shown a gross operating profit of L252bn (Dollars 149m) in 1993, on sales of L1,830bn.</p>

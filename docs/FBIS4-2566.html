			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 10 (XINHUA) -- It is a positive step  for China to develop a market economy with its own  characteristics, Albanian Parliament Speaker Pjeter Arbnori told  XINHUA here before his coming visit to China.    Arbnori, who is leaving for China Monday [11 April] at the  invitation of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) for  the first visit of its kind in about 20 years, will be the  highest- ranking Albanian official to travel to China since the  Albanian Democratic Party came to power in 1992.    He said that significant changes have taken place in both  Albania and China and ideology is no longer the condition for  developing relations of cooperation.    Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in China in  various areas and that is to the credit of, above all, the  introduction of a market economy, Arbnori said.    "Sure," the Albanian speaker added, "China is developing a  market economy with Chinese characteristics in the light of its  specific conditions. That is positive."    Noting that there exist no obstacles to expanding ties  between the two countries, which have broad prospects for  cooperation, he predicted that the bilateral relations will  further improve and develop.    He stressed that "Albania adheres to a very important  principle, that is to recognize only one China -- the People's  Republic of China."    He hoped that China will contribute to the peaceful solution  of the Balkan issue as it is playing an important role in major  world affairs as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.    During his visit to China, Arbnori said, he will learn more  about the NPC's work, China's experience in building the legal  system and the progress in China's economy.</p>

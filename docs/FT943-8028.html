			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Euro Disney finance chief leaves the group Euro Disney, the leisure group which recently completed a FFr13bn (Pounds 1.56bn) refinancing, yesterday announced that Mr Michael Montgomery was resigning as chief financial officer after less than 18 months in the post. Mr Montgomery, who moved to the group in April 1993 from Walt Disney, its US parent company, is the latest senior executive to leave Euro Disney. The company said Mr Montgomery, who joined the group to orchestrate the restructuring, now wanted to pursue other opportunities. He will be succeeded by Mr Xavier de Mezerac, previously head of financial planning and analysis. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, thanked Mr Montgomery for his 'outstanding commitment and contribution'. However, analysts speculated that Mr Montgomery had left because of strains in his relationship with Mr Bourguignon. 'So many senior people have left Euro Disney that it looks more and more like Hotel California,' commented one observer. The shares, which recovered slightly early this month on news that the rights issue had been 80 per cent subscribed, ended yesterday 25 centimes lower at FFr10.35. Mr Mezerac now faces the challenge of further reducing Euro Disney's debt. The company confirmed that it had used FFr5.8bn, almost all the issue proceeds, to prune its net debt to FFr16bn. Euro Disney envisages cutting interest payments by FFr400m this financial year and by FFr600m next year.</p>

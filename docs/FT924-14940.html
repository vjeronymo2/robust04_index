			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Well done, Chaps IN A financial system that seems daily to get more fragile, any step to reduce risk is welcome. For the layman, however, it is not always an unalloyed pleasure, since it is often accompanied by a realisation for the first time of just how big the risks have been. The decision by the UK banking industry to move towards a real-time system for settling large transactions is such a step, and creates just such a sense of mingled enthusiasm and dismay. The enthusiasm stems from the thought that the new system, when it comes into effect, will greatly improve the robustness of the UK's financial plumbing. The dismay stems from an appreciation of the scale of the risks the system has been running. Chaps, the system that handles large UK payments - typically Pounds 2m or so at a time - works well at a technical level. The risk it runs, however, is well summed up by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, in a speech yesterday. 'The vast volumes of business being processed through the payment system' have led, he said, 'to huge unmeasured intra-day exposures for banks, as a result of their willingness to give customers immediate use of incoming funds before being certain that inter-bank transfers would be settled.' Such intra-day exposures can sometimes exceed the capital of the banks concerned. They arise because big customers can withdraw incoming money within the day; banks are only certain that they will get the money when the settlement process has been completed at the end of the day. That settlement process takes place by netting off payments owed by one bank against those owed it by another. The net amounts are settled by drawing on the banks' accounts at the Bank of England. Risk removed Since the Bank cannot, as the lender of last resort, allow the settlement process to threaten the survival of a bank, it has become the implicit guarantor, at potential public cost, of private-sector transactions. Hence the Bank's evident desire to nudge the banking industry towards a system which avoids the risk of a failed end-of-day settlement. It does so in a number of ways. By settling in real time - that is, instantly - it removes the risk implicit in delayed settlement. By settling gross  - that is, by transferring the whole of each individual payment, not merely the net total of the day's transactions - it removes the unpredictable risks associated with netting. City's image In particular, it will remove the risk that the netting process might prove unsustainable under English law, in the event of a bank failure. London's image as a legally robust financial centre, already damaged by the local-authority swaps case, could scarcely survive another legal disaster. Finally, by routing these real-time gross transactions via the Bank of England, it creates an explicit central bank guarantee of payment. Mirrored by similar developments elsewhere in the EC, and by the recommendations of an EC committee chaired by Mr Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, this creates an opportunity to resolve the difficult issues that will arise in the creation of an integrated European payments system. This will be essential under European monetary union, and is probably inevitable in any case as a result of irreversible trends towards cross-border economic integration. Explicit central-bank guarantees of individual national payments systems allow them to be linked much less riskily than would otherwise be the case. Still, for banks and their customers there will be a cost involved in all this virtue. Today's implicit Bank guarantee will be replaced by explicit Bank intra-day overdrafts - without an interest cost, but requiring banks to offer the Bank collateral. It is perhaps not surprising that the tone with which the Bank greets this new dawn is slightly more enthusiastic than that used by the clearing banks. It would be a pity, however, if banks turned the proposed date for the introduction of the new system - 1995 - into a vague aspiration rather than a firm commitment. Appreciating the scale of the risks makes reducing them appear all the more pressing.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Italian mini-budget likely to deal with deficit overrun THE ITALIAN government is expected within the next few days to announce details of a mini-budget raising L13,000bn (Pounds 6bn) to correct an expected overrun in the L150,000bn budget deficit projected for 1993. At the same time the government has taken the unprecedented decision to present the 1994 budget by this July. This could clear the way for an early election in the autumn. The annual budget is normally submitted at the end of September, complicating any electoral calendar in the autumn. The moves came amid indications that an early change of government is likely, given political and economic uncertainty following developments in the corruption scandals affecting former premier Mr Giulio Andreotti. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has called a meeting for today with the leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and is expected to explore the possibility of finding a government with broader parliamentary support before April 18, the date set for referendums on constitutional change. Another blow for the Christian Democrat party, the largest in the ruling coalition, came with the resignation from its ranks of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement. Earlier, concern about the rise in the budget deficit and political anxieties weakened the lira. It closed at an historic low against the D-Mark of L987.6, some L11.5 down on the day. Dealers said the Bank of Italy intervened to buy the currency, which ended above its worst for the day of L991.5. Italian government bonds came under pressure. Treasury officials said they recognised the markets were nervous, but insisted market sentiment was being driven by the country's political upheavals. Among the corrective measures proposed are an increase in VAT on second homes, higher duties on the resale of used cars and advance payments of the tax on the use of gas, as well as further spending cuts. The government has had to act quickly because it has undertaken with the EC to comply with its original budget in order to receive an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.6bn) loan. The first tranche of this has already been drawn down. The agreement with the EC locks Italy into a straitjacket of tough fiscal measures, as the recession has led to a shortfall in receipts projected at L14,500bn. Spending has risen because of higher social security and unemployment costs, while no income has yet come from privatisations. Background, Page 2</p>

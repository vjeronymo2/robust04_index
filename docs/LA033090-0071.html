			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN DESERTERS GET AMNESTY OFFER  </P> <P> The Kremlin proclaimed a conditional amnesty Thursday for Lithuanian deserters,  a new conciliatory offer in the clash over independence. But Lithuania's leader  voiced distrust of the gesture and made a personal appeal for U.S. diplomatic  recognition.  </P> <P> "The freedom of Lithuania is in great danger," the breakaway Baltic republic's  president, Vytautas Landsbergis, told Congress in a letter. "We wait with  strong hearts and no weapons in our hands for your help in this difficult  struggle against militarism and aggression, in this struggle for peace and  justice."  </P> <P> Landsbergis, who presided over the Parliament's unilateral declaration of  independence March 11, appealed to Congress members to press the Bush  Administration for official recognition, saying this would prevent Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from committing a "gross mistake."  </P> <P> Not a single foreign country has recognized Lithuania's independence, which  Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership reject as illegal, and President Bush has  come under attack from restive U.S. lawmakers for his reticence. Landsbergis'  letter, read aloud by its author in Parliament, was clearly intended to turn up  the heat.  </P> <P> However, the United States has also never recognized the Kremlin's right to  govern in this land, since Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Estonia and  Latvia, were forcibly annexed by the Soviets in 1940 and stripped of their  independence.  </P> <P> In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked Thursday  why Bush had not indulged his penchant for personal diplomacy and called  Gorbachev about Lithuania. He replied that the dispute is a "complex and  sensitive matter."  </P> <P> "The corollary is that we would not want to take moves that disrupted that  diplomatic effort," Fitzwater said, "and the President simply feels this is not  time to make a direct contact to Chairman Gorbachev for those reasons."  </P> <P> In Prague, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel offered in a message to  Gorbachev and Landsbergis to help mediate the situation.  </P> <P> "I am convinced that the only possible solution in this difficult situation is  an open and just political dialogue between representatives of the Soviet Union  and Lithuania. Czechoslovakia . . . is ready to facilitate this dialogue  through its services and neutral grounds."  </P> <P> The Kremlin's conciliatory offer toward deserters comes two days after the most  brutal incident of the secession conflict, when Soviet paratroopers raided  hospitals in Lithuania's two largest cities, Vilnius and Kaunas, and seized 23  conscripts who had deserted from the armed forces, reportedly beating some of  them.  </P> <P> The Kremlin's use of military muscle outraged Landsbergis and Prime Minister  Kazimiera Prunskiene, who demanded that Gorbachev act to return their  "kidnaped" citizens. The Soviets said the conscripts were simply being forced  to return to military service, which is compulsory for most Soviet young men.  </P> <P> According to Landsbergis, more than 800 Lithuanians have deserted from the  armed forces in recent weeks because of the independence proclamation or the  brutal treatment meted out to Baltic draftees. Many Lithuanians believe they  should not serve in the army of a "foreign" country.  </P> <P> In an obvious attempt to reduce frictions over the deserters, the Soviet  Defense Ministry announced Thursday that it would not prosecute missing  Lithuanians who give themselves up and agree to resume their service, which  runs for two years in the army and three in the navy.  </P> <P> "Unrepenting deserters, however, will be tracked down, apprehended and punished  in line with the law," the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted a ministry  spokesman as saying. Penalties for refusing to serve in the armed forces range  from three to seven years in prison.  </P> <P> The Defense Ministry did not say when the amnesty would expire, and Landsbergis  reacted warily.  </P> <P> "I don't have much trust in this promise of amnesty," he told a news  conference. "There have been many times when high military officials lied to  us, and we have some idea of the terrors that happen to these young men when  they return to their units."  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Frants Markovsky of the Soviet General Staff told Tass that 51  deserters have already been sent back to their detachments. Whether or not that  number includes the 23 rousted Tuesday from the two hospitals, the statement  means that hundreds of Lithuanian conscripts are still at large.  </P> <P> Despite Landsbergis' suspicions, there were further signs Thursday that the  Lithuanians' position was softening. Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas  announced that the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, had appealed to citizens  to turn their firearms over to police for safekeeping, as Gorbachev had  demanded March 21.  </P> <P> The deadline for voluntary compliance with Gorbachev's order expired Wednesday,  with officials then having the task of seizing weapons. Lithuanian leaders  initially said that Gorbachev had no right to tell people in an independent  nation what to do, but changed their minds to discourage house-by-house  searches by soldiers and possible incidents.  </P> <P> "We can't let people face the force of the Soviet army alone," Ozolas said in  an interview. "They would then feel as though they can't be safe and nobody  will protect them."  </P> <P> Soviet television said Thursday night that 5,000 rifles, pistols, shotguns and  other firearms are being kept in a warehouse, along with about 1 million rounds  of ammunition. Ozolas said the Council of Ministers' resolution, approved late  Wednesday and read on television, asked Lithuanians to bring their guns to  local police precincts, where they will be put in temporary storage.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Lithuanian government put off as too confrontational its  controversial plans to establish its own border controls, customs service and  frontier guards, steps that would have effectively separated the republic from  the rest of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Landsbergis also indicated a new flexibility on holding a referendum on the  question of secession, as demanded by the central government, which contends  that ethnic Russians and Poles -- roughly 20% of the republic's 3.7-million  population -- as well as many Lithuanians want to remain in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Landsbergis reiterated Thursday that he was ready to talk about a referendum,  suggesting that the question to put to Lithuanians was: "Do you wish to become  part of a  </P> <P> foreign country?"  </P> <P> However, the republic's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, who spoke  at the same news conference, said the question should be whether voters favor  secession or not, as though Lithuania were still legally a part of the Soviet  Union. He said such a vote would give the leadership powerful legitimacy in  Moscow's eyes.  </P> <P> "I have no doubts about the possible results of a referendum, but I'm saying a  referendum would be an additional ace in our negotiations," declared the  Communist leader, who advocated a slower course toward independence than  Landsbergis but joined the new government as a deputy prime minister to support  the cause.  </P> <P> Despite its recent backing away from confrontation, Lithuania has had no luck  in persuading Soviet authorities to open formal talks on independence,  Landsbergis said.  </P> <P> "We are seeking contacts with Moscow, but it's very hard to establish contacts  with a brick wall," he said.  </P> <P> As the dispute over Lithuania persisted, a new headache for Gorbachev loomed in  the neighboring Soviet republic of Estonia, where the legislature, now  dominated by a pro-independence faction, convened Thursday in a session  expected to vote on suspending the Soviet constitution.  </P> <P> According to Estonian Communist Party officials, the 105-seat chamber will  likely declare only Estonia's laws valid on the republic's territory, but not  issue a proclamation of independence as Lithuanian lawmakers did.  </P> <P> "It is not a matter of proclaiming an independent Estonian republic; it is  aimed at showing that we are apart from the Soviet Union," Henry Soove, a  senior party official, told the Reuters news agency in the Estonian capital of  Tallinn.  </P> <P> The Estonians will also debate a declaration of support for Lithuania. Estonian  leaders have been aghast at Moscow's military pressure on their neighbor.  </P> <P> Schrader, a free-lance journalist, reported from Vilnius, and Times staff  writer Dahlburg from Moscow.  </P></p>

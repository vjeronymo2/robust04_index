			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADY PLAN FOR LATIN DEBT DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: TREASURY SECRETARY'S SCHEME NEEDS MONEY AND A STRONGER COMMITMENT  FROM INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO MAKE RULES MORE FAVORABLE.  </P> <P> Ten years after the debt crisis first hit, a large number of Latin American  countries, including all the major economies, still cannot service their  liabilities and grow economically. Imports have declined by roughly $40  billion. Investment as a percentage of gross domestic product has fallen, from  23% to 16%. Clearly, the Latin debt crisis is more than a prolonged liquidity  problem.  </P> <P> The overextended condition of borrowers and creditors was abruptly spotlighted  in 1981-82, when interest rates zoomed and the prices of the region's primary  export commodities plummeted. True, many Latin Americans had recognized the  problem before then. But the creditor governments acted as if the loan  arrangements were between a neighborhood bank and small-town customers.  </P> <P> When financial crises as Gargantuan as the American savings-and-loan fiasco  occur, governments usually intervene to keep the financial system solvent and  sustain domestic output and employment. Though these "public bailouts" violate  traditional liberal economic theory, they generally prove to be good policy if  health is restored to the ailing institution.  </P> <P> The Latin America debt problem surely cries out for such comprehensive action.  The initial efforts of the industrialized countries, however, aimed at  stabilizing only one side of the international system -- their domestic  economies and private banks. They succeeded admirably.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, this success seriously impaired the economic performance of the  indebted countries. When this fact was recognized by then-Secretary of the  Treasury James A. Baker III in 1985, the solution he offered was too little,  too late. Not until March, 1989, when Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F.  Brady announced his plan, did a more comprehensive debt-relief framework  emerge. Perhaps its most important feature was to restore balance to the  distribution of costs and benefits associated with managing international debt.  </P> <P> The Brady plan would enhance and accelerate Latin debt reduction by enabling  banks to liquidate their "old debt" in one of two ways. Either a country could  buy back its debt at a significant discount or take on "new debt," again at a  discount, by changing its "old debt" into creditor equity.  </P> <P> For this approach to work, some public funding would be needed, either to  finance the buy-backs or, more important, to offer the guarantees that would  make "new debt" attractive to a creditor. Private banks could also be  encouraged to participate by modifying legal, regulatory, accounting and tax  codes that govern them. Thus, the Brady plan intended to stimulate policy  reform and economic growth in debtor countries through voluntary, case-by-case,  debt and debt-service reduction.  </P> <P> Certainly a step in the right direction. But the Brady plan has collided with  difficulties:  </P> <P> It is seriously underfunded. The existing pool of committed public money -- $30  billion -- can finance only a fraction of needed reduction. The Economic  Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that at least three  times that sum is needed to have an effect.  </P> <P> Private banks in most industrialized countries still lack any incentive, or  face any punishment, that might spur them to settle their Latin American  claims. It is thus essential -- and practical -- for the governments of  creditor banks to change the regulatory, accounting and tax rules.  </P> <P> The Brady-inspired negotiations have been cumbersome, drawn-out affairs.  </P> <P> Mainly for these reasons, many observers, in debtor as well as in creditor  countries, have mistakenly declared the Brady plan all but dead. Its conceptual  framework is solid. Most important, the means to make it work are well within  reach: By global standards, a commitment of $90 billion seems a small price to  pay for putting Latin American and Caribbean nations back on their financial  feet. Most of that commitment does not have to be "up front." It need only be  in the form of contingent liabilities. Further, most of the multilateral  institutional framework is in place, although the International Monetary Fund  should be more assertive in guaranteeing financing.  </P> <P> The Brady plan thus contains most of the ingredients necessary to eliminate the  Latin American and Caribbean debt overhang. Its potential could be further  reinforced by establishing a multilateral debt agency under the aegis of the  World Bank and/or the IMF. This agency could lessen the inefficiencies of the  current piecemeal approach to debt reduction and lower its ultimate public  costs.  </P></p>

First she says that she came to agree with her  husband that their workloads should be along "traditional" lines. She then  blames the women's movement because she has a double workload, while her  husband's workload hasn't increased.  </P> <P> What the women's movement taught us was that when two people work outside the  home, two people work inside the home. If she really wants a traditional  arrangement, she would quit her outside job.  </P> <P> MIRIAM ALBERT  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

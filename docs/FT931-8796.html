			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Duo preaches rewards of rigour: South Africa has accepted the need for economic reform It took the ruling National party in South Africa more than 40 years to come to its senses about apartheid, and it was the economic failure of the policy  -not its moral repugnance - which finally tipped the balance. Now, with the National party on the point of abandoning its hegemony and entering government with the African National Congress, it is keen to put behind it the peculiarly South African form of state socialism which bolstered apartheid. It fears that the ANC might otherwise decide to ape this policy, using the state to further African interests at the expense of the Afrikaner. So at the last moment, the National party has been converted to economic discipline, to the kind of free-market policies without which post-apartheid South Africa cannot flourish. Faced with an economy which can only employ just over half of the available labour force, where productivity is low and real wages high by international standards, and where the civil service is large and inefficient, there is no alternative to economic reform. That has been true for years, and it has not previously stopped Pretoria from denying reality. But the country's finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, finally seems to have removed the blinkers from both government and opposition eyes. With a clever slide show demonstrating the depths of the economic crisis, which he has presented to everyone from the cabinet to the leaders of the ANC, Mr Keys has concentrated the minds of politicians on the need for a rapid political settlement. More than anything else, this has driven progress in the constitutional talks between the National party and the ANC which last week yielded an outline agreement on power-sharing. Mr Keys, with his commitment to tight fiscal policies, is a powerful ally for Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank. Mr Stals has fought for years to instil monetary discipline. Last year, he managed to restrict money supply growth, as defined by the broad measure of M3, to within a tight target of 7 to 10 per cent. The finance minister, who took office last May after a successful career as executive chairman at Gencor, the country's second-largest mining company, says South Africa has now entered a 'sane economic era' which can lay the basis for future growth. The credit for that must be shared between Mr Keys and Mr Stals, whose uncompromising monetary policy has helped push inflation to a 15-year low. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of just under 10 per cent in December (see chart.) There are also signs that inflationary expectations are also beginning to fall. Fund managers, for example, are expressing renewed interest in fixed-interest securities. But Mr Keys' achievement in promoting economics to the centre of the political debate should not be underestimated. Through force of intellect and personality, he has frightened the politicians out of their previous leisurely approach to negotiations, while maintaining good relations with both sides. More technocrat than politician (probably the main reason for his success), Mr Keys has gained the respect of the ANC. But more important, he has won over the president, Mr F W de Klerk, who alone can authorise the painful economic restructuring now being planned. Pretoria has yet to release details of the restructuring programme, but Mr Keys has made clear that stimulating investment is the centrepiece. That can only be achieved by reducing government consumption expenditure so as to channel more of national income into private fixed investment, and by restoring investors' confidence after years of political uncertainty and high inflation. Mr Keys has taken his reform message to every forum that will listen. He mourns the fact that gross domestic fixed investment has fallen from 26 per cent of national income in 1983 to 16 per cent now - only 1 per cent more than is needed simply to replace worn-out and obsolete capacity. That, he says, is the most important element restraining economic growth, which has been negative for each of the past three years. A modest recovery, to real growth of between 0.5 and 2 per cent, is expected this year. Government expenditure is the obvious target to free more funds for investment. Mr Keys points out that government consumption spending has risen from about 10 per cent of national income in the 1960s to more than double that now. Over the same period, Japanese government consumption spending was held to 9 per cent of national income. But politically, there could hardly be a worse time to restrain government expenditure. Many blacks expect a multi-racial government to make up for the deprivations of apartheid overnight. Scope for cuts is also limited, although Mr de Klerk (under Mr Keys' influence) has said that civil servants must take a large pay cut in real terms, of perhaps 3 to 5 per cent, in the coming fiscal year. Taxes will also be increased, while civil service personnel should be cut by 5 per cent by the end of March. Nonetheless, the budget deficit, which is expected to end the financial year at more than 8 per cent of gross domestic product, will probably remain high at 6 or 7 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1993-94. Finance department officials say that to cut the deficit to 5 per cent of GDP would require drastic action, the equivalent of a 7 percentage point rise in value-added tax (now 10 per cent). Despite the deficit, finance ministry officials point out that spending targets were largely achieved this year. They say that the deficit resulted from a revenue shortfall due to recession and severe drought, and they predict spending will show only a very modest real increase next year. Mr Stals says he believes 1993 will set the tone for the new South Africa. If Mr Keys proves to have the courage of his convictions on curbing government spending - and crucially, if the ANC and the trade unions resist public protests against such measures - then the central bank governor predicts this 'can easily become a decisive year in which the foundations will be laid for future economic development'. With the labour force shrinking by 2 per cent in 1991 and 3 per cent in the first half of 1992 - adding to the 40 per cent of the economically active population already without formal employment - something must be done to revive growth. But nobody believes anything can be done quickly. Indeed, many economic commentators are sceptical that inflation will remain in single figures, as the finance minister has promised, and that economic growth will resume. But with Mr Keys at the Finance Ministry and Mr Stals at the central bank - posts both could retain in an interim government - South Africa has the best chance in years of breaking out of what Mr Keys calls 'the down-and-out trap'. And unless economic success can be achieved, South African democracy will rest on fragile foundations.</p>

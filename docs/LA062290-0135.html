			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> NO MORE MANHOLES AFTER NAME CHANGE  </P> <P> The state's capital has struck down sexism in its streets by changing the name  of its manholes to "maintenance holes." The change was signaled at a City  Council meeting as members approved amendments to an ordinance concerning the  use of sewers.  </P> <P> No one called attention to the name change, although the issue received  national attention in late April, when it was reported that officials were  looking for a practical non-sexist term. Two city civil engineers proposed,  tongue-in-cheek, a "Manhole Terminology Change Contest," and it was suggested  that the female majority in the mayor's office and City Council was behind the  proposal. However, officials denied that they had put any pressure on the  Public Works Department. Department Director Melvin Johnson said that  "maintenance hole" is practical, because it will spare the department from  having to revamp its maps, which designate manholes as "MH."  </P></p>

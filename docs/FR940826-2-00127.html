			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex states that it has had experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and has not encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely, proper and adequate notice is given. An information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. As noted above, the number of shares of each component stock in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock splits, reverse stock splits, a rights offering distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component stocks. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer of a component stock, if the stock remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the components' relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In the event of a stock replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining portfolio components in the same weighting tier as the stock being replaced will be calculated and that amount ``invested'' in the stock of the new component, to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to time substitute stocks, or adjust the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changing conditions in Israel. However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of Index component stocks to less than nine or increase the number of component stocks to greater than fourteen without prior Commission approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Expiration and Settlement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

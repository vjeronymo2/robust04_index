			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Mao  Zhiyong visited Dongguan Township, Linchuan County, from 2 to 6  April to conduct a survey. He stressed that the current  situation is indeed excellent in rural areas and that the  peasants have shown a greater initiative in promoting  production, especially in growing grain. Party and government  leaders at all levels must conscientiously implement the  guideline laid down by the central meeting on rural work and  work really hard to stabilize grain output and help the peasants  increase their income. [passage omitted]    Local peasants told Mao Zhiyong: Now that the party central  authorities attach importance to agriculture and have offered  good policies, the grain price has been rising and thus farming  promises good returns. Mao Zhiyong replied happily:  Agricultural production is subject to very strict seasonal  conditions. It is now time to start spring farming. You should  never miss the right time for farming. I hope you will have a  deeper understanding of the importance of agricultural  production and rural work. In particular, you must pay great  attention to grain production--it is necessary to keep the grain  sowing area stable. At the same time, it is necessary to keep  an eye on key measures for promoting production, with the focus  placed on raising per-unit-area yield with a view to increasing  the gross output. [passage omitted]    Mao Zhiyong noted: During the main grain growing period, we  must not only ensure a steady increase in grain output but also  make every effort to help the peasants increase their income so  that they will become rich sooner. [passage omitted]    Mao Zhiyong pointed out: + In order to increase their income  and become rich sooner, our peasants should promote a  diversified economy, improve management, and expand production  scale while developing grain production. [passage omitted]    Mao Zhiyong said: As far as the rural work is concerned, we  have many tasks to perform but the most basic matter is to work  in a down-to-earth manner to intensify grass-roots  organizations. To do a good job in this aspect, we must focus  our attention on building organizations at the village level  with party branches as their core and on developing the economy  at the village level, thus ensuring that all duties are  undertaken by the right people and sufficient funds are  allocated to run the businesses.    Mao Zhiyong said: At the moment the situation is excellent  in rural areas. However, we still need to remain cool-headed,  work in a down-to-earth manner, and further explore bright  prospects. We have set out the key tasks and our leaders at all  levels certainly need to further improve their work style, go  down to the grass-roots level, publicize the policies among the  peasants, adopt appropriate measures to help the peasants  promote production, and solve the actual problems. [passage  omitted]    After his stay in Dongguan Township, Mao Zhiyong also paid a  visit to Suji Township, which has long been a cotton producing  area. There he conducted a survey on this year's cotton  production, publicized rural policies among the peasants, and  encouraged the peasants to grow more cotton, do a better job,  and fulfill this year's cotton output quota.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Iberia plans Pta760bn investments IBERIA Airlines would invest Pta760bn (Dollars 7.35bn) between now and 1996 to carry out medium-term strategic plans, chairman Mr Miguel Aguilo, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid. He told a government committee the plan foresaw an average annual revenue rise of 13.7 per cent between 1992 and 1996, and a 9.5 per cent rise in costs. This should mean profits of about Pta4.9bn in 1992, rising to Pta55.9bn in 1996. He said 51 per cent of the investments would come from internal cash-flow, 33 per cent from bank debt, and 16 per cent from the company's recently-authorised Pta120bn capital increase. The state airline's financial costs are projected at Pta23bn a year until 1996, with total debt rising from Pta240bn at the end of 1992 to Pta345bn at the end of the period. Mr Aguilo said Iberia was not seeking alliances with European airlines. 'Alliances with European partners are not envisaged for now as our main priority is the strategic plan,' he said. He said the plan involved a greater international profile, improved service and a stronger role in European, Latin American and east Asian markets. Mr Aguilo said Iberia's fleet would incorporate 130 new aircraft between 1989 and 1996, and that 50 others would be retired from service during this period. Spain's new high-velocity train (AVE) and development of the country's road network threatened Iberia, he said. Domestic traffic was expected to grow by only 7.7 per cent, against a European average of 11.7 per cent, between 1992 and 1996. Mr Aguilo said Iberia had not yet signed contracts to build its own terminal at Barajas airport in Madrid. Nor had it decided whether to sell its headquarters in the centre of the capital. Iberia made a group pre-tax loss of Pta51.32bn in 1991, after Pta26.11bn the previous year.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: PM 'regrets anguish' of unemployed IT WAS a press conference that Mr John Major would preferred never to have given. But as the storm over pit closures engulfed his government yesterday the prime minister had no alternative at the end of the Birmingham summit but to give his personal account of why the government was right to put 30,000 miners onto the dole in the midst of the longest recession since the 1930s. So as the international press filed out from the traditional EC presidency end-of-summit briefing last night, Mr Major faced the largely hostile questioning of a group of political correspondents scenting blood. He looked tired and slightly irritable. But he survived with no more than a few nicks. The House of Commons next week will be a great deal rougher. The prime minister began with the good news - reminding his audience that the 1-point cut in base rates would provide a further stimulus to recovery. And if the press thought the government indifferent to the needs of businesses, he offered assurances that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would spend the next few weeks talking to the captains of industry. His insistence that the 2-point reduction in interest rates and the hefty devaluation of the pound over the past month would do nothing to re-ignite inflation brought a cynical silence. His audience's judgment was that the government had panicked. But it was the pit closures the journalists wanted to hear about - and more specifically whether Mr Major would be forced to announce his second U-turn within a month. He gave a creditable performance. He dismissed suggestions that the government was callous or indifferent about the miners: 'I know and regret the anguish faced by anyone finding himself unemployed.' He reminded critics that more often than not he was accused of shirking hard decisions. Now one had been taken, and although there was no pleasure in taking it there was a determination to face the economic reality that there was no market for much of British Coal's production. 'We made the announcement sooner rather than later because we thought it right to remove the uncertainty and because we did not think we would make a difficult decision easier by putting it off,' he said. 'We have to get on with helping miners and their families and beating the recession.' Miners were emerging from a day's work to find piles of coal growing, Mr Major said. 'Stocks are increasing by more than 1m tonnes every month and as a result of that we have been spending Pounds 100m a month of taxpayers' money to keep pits open even though their product has no market and is not likely, alas, to have any market in the future.' He was pressed on the timetable. Could the closures be phased? Perhaps anticipating the backlash from Tory back benches next week he said simply: 'I do not anticipate any changes in the timetable.'</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kubota refocuses computer side Kubota is to restructure its computer-related business by largely withdrawing from hardware and putting more emphasis on software. The Japanese parent company will dissolve Kubota Graphics, its subsidiary in California which has developed hardware, at the end of the year. This will result in a special loss of Y15bn (Dollars 155m), but will not affect Kubota's forecast of parent net profit of Y19bn for the year to March 31 1995, the company said. Kubota, Japan's leading manufacturer of farm equipment and iron pipes, diversified into the computer industry in 1986. Yesterday, it announced a 13 per cent increase in mid-term parent recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y14.1bn from Y12.4bn in the corresponding period last year. Kubota's decision to pull out of workstation development and manufacture ends its eight-year struggle in an industry characterised by increasingly fierce competition. Kubota has been selling three-dimensional computer graphics workstations it has developed, but only about 3,300 units have been sold in the past eight years. The company diversified into three-dimensional graphics workstations at a time when it was still a niche market, but competition has since intensified with the spread of open systems. Kubota has been pursuing a restructuring effort since the new president took office last year with a particular emphasis on pulling out of loss-making businesses. In mainline business, Kubota saw a better-than expected rise in profits on sales up 4 per cent at Y340.6bn, compared with a previous Y326.7bn.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: The inside story of a model multinational - Ian Rodger explains how ABB has grown into the largest power engineering group in the world Hardly a week goes by without ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss international engineering group, being cited as the model multinational industrial enterprise of our age. Management consultants, economists and social scientists swarm around it, studying it, testing their hypotheses and searching for clues to emerging trends in company development. Journalists besiege it for interviews, knowing that anything ABB says will be read eagerly throughout the world. In many respects, ABB is the model multinational. It operates in 140 countries and carries out core product development, as well as manufacturing, in at least a dozen countries. Its ownership and top management are increasingly international. Earlier this year Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, wrote in the FT about the need to build multinational teams for a global company. 'As business gets more globalised, the competitive advantages of multinational teams increase. Any single-nationality corporate culture will run into problems as soon as it aims to integrate larger operations from other countries,' he said. 'At the same time, we strive to develop a global corporate culture for all members of our multinational teams. One key element is having a common language. English was chosen at the outset, although a minority of the present 218,000 employees have English as their mother language. 'Today, all executives use English as their common language and ABB's currency for global reporting and consolidation is the US dollar. Most importantly, from the very beginning ABB established a common set of values, policies and operational guidelines to safeguard and promote a group-wide umbrella culture.' Even ABB's choice of Zurich as a headquarters, only a short flight from every major centre in Europe and with efficient access to every continent, reflects the company's multinational thinking. ABB was formed in January 1988 from the 50/50 merger of Asea, the Swedish electrical engineering and robotics group, and Brown Boveri, the Swiss power engineering and railway equipment makers. The main shareholders of both groups recognised that moves to privatisation and deregulation in many countries would mean an international restructuring of their main businesses was inevitable. Only the biggest and strongest would survive the shakeout and Asea and Brown Boveri recognised they had little chance alone. Together their chances would be greatly enhanced, with Mr Barnevik, who had already established an international reputation at Asea, as chief executive. Mr Barnevik recently divided the development of ABB to date into two phases. The first, from 1987 to 1990, he said, was dominated by acquisitions to give the group critical scale in the biggest markets while taking out excess capacity. By far the most important were the 1989 acquisition of the power transmission and distribution operations of Westinghouse Electric and the takeover of Combustion Engineering. Through these operations, the group acquired a US base with sales of Dollars 5bn and a competitive nuclear power generation technology. Since 1991, the group has been in a consolidation phase, although acquisitions have continued to figure prominently, with a special emphasis on central and eastern European countries. Also, a new business development thrust in the fast growing Asian countries was launched. Overall group employment has stabilised at just above 200,000, although this has been the net result of massive acquisitions offset by redundancies averaging 1,000 people a month last year. This and an annual turnover of Dollars 28.3bn last year makes ABB the largest power engineering group in the world, and one of the most widely spread. A little over half of 1993 group revenues came from western Europe, nearly a quarter from Asia and a fifth from the Americas. Profits, after doubling in the two years following the merger, stagnated at the beginning of the 1990s, last year reaching Dollars 1.19bn before taxes and extraordinary items. However, through rationalisation, ABB has managed to turn a Dollars 2.1bn net debt at the end of 1990 into a Dollars 242m net liquid position at the end of last year. Mr Barnevik's initial management approach was to push operating responsibility down to the operating units and eliminate intermediate layers of control. In doing so, the group created some 5,000 profit centres. Executive board members carried both divisional and regional responsibilities in the now conventional matrix structure. However, last year he modified this structure significantly, reducing the number of divisions, or segments as ABB calls them, from seven to five and undoing the matrix at executive board level. The idea, he said, was to improve the group's ability to respond with all its resources to customer demands for large, complex system projects. Although still a young group, ABB has already developed a unique corporate culture, where nationality no longer determines an employee's prospects. The one glaring deficiency in the structure is its capital. ABB is still owned entirely by Asea and BBC. While both the Asea and BBC shares are quoted and are much more widely held than they used to be, group executives believe that its credibility as a multinational would be greatly enhanced by a conversion of these into ABB shares. There are significant technical and legal difficulties in achieving this, largely because there is no ideal jurisdiction in which to base a multinational entity like ABB, and the dominant Swedish and Swiss shareholders of Asea and BBC do not want to lose their influence. But Mr Barnevik believes it will happen in the next few years, a period he calls the 'the expansion phase'. This phase seems to have got under way in the first quarter of this year, with a 20 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Dollars 246m.</p>

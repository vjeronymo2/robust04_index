			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR'S LEADERS VOTE TO BOLT ISRAELI COALITION;  </P> <P> ACTION STEMS FROM DISPUTE OVER PEACE PLAN; WOULD BRING DOWN GOVERNMENT IF  IMPLEMENTED  </P> <P> Leaders of Israel's Labor Party proposed Monday to withdraw from the ruling  coalition and bring down the government in protest against a toughened stand on  Palestinian elections taken by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Shimon Peres, Labor's party chief, also clarified his own  stand on elections on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, outlining  positions that directly counter limits set by Shamir. Foremost among his views  is the insistence that Israel be prepared to give up land in exchange for peace  with the Arabs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Political Storm  </P> <P> If the threat to break up the coalition is carried out, necessitating new  elections, it would create a political storm here less than nine months after  bitterly fought elections and delicate negotiations gave rise to an uneasy  partnership between rightist Likud and center-left Labor.  </P> <P> A rump session of the Labor Party advisory bureau voted 45 to 2 to leave the  coalition. The bureau is made up of 120 party leaders, most of whom stayed  away, so it is not clear just how united Labor is in its willingness to break  with Likud. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who voted with the majority, called  for the party to establish its own criteria for Arab elections but to delay for  three weeks any decision on pulling out of the government.  </P> <P> The final decision will rest with Labor's 1,200-member Central Committee. No  date was set for a meeting, leaving time for the back-room compromises  characteristic of Israeli parliamentary crises.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, statements by Peres and other leaders were the fullest expression  of dissatisfaction with Labor's junior role in the Shamir-led government. Since  the coalition was forged last December, numerous members on Labor's left wing  have lobbied to pull out, saying that the stands of the two parties over Middle  East policy are incompatible.  </P> <P> Last week, Likud imposed strict limits on Shamir's plan for elections in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, bringing the contradictions to a head.  </P> <P> "We will not be a fig leaf for Likud. We will not be a fig leaf for a tragedy,"  said Peres, who invoked a Jewish funeral prayer to add: "We will not say 'God  full of mercy' over the grave of this peace plan.  </P> <P> "In view of the latest events, which seriously harmed the government's peace  initiative, it would be proper to . . . dismantle the present government,"  Peres added in a letter that will be sent to Shamir if the Labor Party decides  to pull out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Decision Is Final'  </P> <P> "If there is no peace initiative, the decision is final," Peres warned on a  later news broadcast.  </P> <P> Shamir stunned Labor Party leaders by giving in to demands from Likud's right  wing to alter his election plan. Under the original proposal, agreed to by the  coalition government, Arab voters would select delegates to work out a period  of limited autonomy for Palestinians; final disposition of the territories  would be left to later talks.  </P> <P> Under prodding from Ariel Sharon, the hawkish trade and industry minister,  Shamir added several specific conditions: no territorial concessions by Israel,  no participation in the vote by Arabs who live in annexed East Jerusalem, no  talks at all until the Arab uprising ends and yes to more Israeli settlements  on the disputed land.  </P> <P> Since the Likud decision, Shamir has played down the action by portraying it as  a mere confirmation of previously held positions. But Labor Party officials  objected, as did U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who termed the  conditions "not helpful."  </P> <P> Peres unveiled his own, more liberal conditions Monday. Israel should give up  the occupied land, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, in order to ensure that  the boundaries of Israel would encompass a Jewish majority, he said. "We are in  favor of territorial compromise if it brings peace," Peres stated flatly.  </P> <P> East Jerusalem Arabs could participate in the election, Peres said, although  the vote should not physically take place in the city. The Arab uprising need  not end before talks with Arabs get under way because such a condition would  "transmit a veto into the hands of extremists."  </P> <P> Peres called for a halt to construction of five new settlements that Labor and  Likud had agreed to build when they signed the coalition agreement. "We must  decide that there is no room for the five settlements at this time," he said.  </P> <P> Peres, who also holds the title of deputy prime minister, rebuked Shamir for  trying to put limits on topics that elected Palestinians could discuss --  including the desire for an independent state. "The elections must be  political, with completely free speech," he asserted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Independent Government'  </P> <P> He spoke in hazy terms of an "independent government" that would emerge from  the Arab vote. It was not clear whether he was going beyond Shamir's concept of  limited self-rule for the Palestinians.  </P> <P> Under Peres' election scheme, foreign observers would be welcome to scrutinize  the election. Likud had said there was no need for formal oversight.  </P> <P> Rabin, who first broached the subject of Arab elections, had hoped to delay a  showdown with Likud over details until talks with Arabs were well under way.  But as Labor rose up against the Likud proposals, he too spoke out.  </P> <P> "The Likud decisions damaged severely the chances of carrying on the peace  initiative," he said Monday, challenging Likud to find an Arab partner for  peace.  </P> <P> "If they can succeed in convincing Arabs to come to negotiate when they are  telling them that (the West Bank and Gaza Strip) will never have foreign  sovereignty, that we will impose our sovereignty upon all the territory, they  are welcome to try," he said.  </P> <P> Rabin tentatively outlined his own view of how to create an environment for  Arab elections: a halt to new Israeli settlement of the occupied land, a  commitment to exchange some occupied land for peace with the Arabs and an  agreement to later include Palestinians from abroad in negotiations on a final  settlement -- a condition that could open the way for participation of the  Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Likud leaders immediately cautioned Labor against bringing down the government.  Shamir's top aide, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said that Labor should stay on for "the  benefit of the nation." Political observers viewed the statement as a means of  reminding Labor that it could bear the blame for toppling the government in a  time of crisis.  </P> <P> Housing Minister David Levy said that Labor had done the Arabs a favor by  creating a ruckus; now, he said, the Palestinians do not have to respond to the  peace plan in any form.  </P> <P> In an unusual departure, the Bush Administration openly intervened by advising  Rabin and Peres not to be too hasty in pulling out of the coalition,  government-run Israel Radio reported. Washington has been trying to find common  ground between the Israeli government and the PLO on settling the Israeli-Arab  conflict. U.S. envoys have attempted to persuade the PLO to endorse some  variation of the election plan in order to get peace talks off the ground.  </P> <P> In turn, Washington has pushed for Israel to be prepared to give up at least  some of the occupied land. The stand put the Administration on Labor's side in  the ultimate test of the peace proposal.  </P> <P> On Monday, Secretary of State Baker said that he will send an envoy to  Jerusalem later this month to ascertain whether the Jerusalem government is  still "serious" about seeking peace through Palestinian elections. Baker spoke  to reporters in Poland, where he is part of President Bush's visiting  delegation.  </P> <P> Political analyst Shlomo Avineri foresaw a double-edged dilemma for Labor:  Leaving the government opens the party to an unpredictable electoral test, he  said, but staying in would mean submission to its direct ideological opposite,  the right wing of Likud.  </P> <P> "My guess is that Labor wants to pressure Shamir to come back to a middle  position," Avineri observed.  </P> <P> The mood of the country is considered to have shifted toward a hard-line  position on treatment of the Arabs, at least in the short run. Emotions were  heightened last week when a Palestinian steered a bus off a highway, killing 14  Israeli passengers.  </P> <P> Columnist Aryeh Naor argued that Labor's move presents Shamir with a challenge  to put his party's program into effect or back off once and for all. "He cannot  keep using the Labor Party to legitimize his program," Naor said.  </P> <P> Both analysts viewed the strain in the coalition as the logical conclusion to  an untenable partnership. They pointed out that the previous Labor-Likud  government, formed in 1984, was based on a consensus on dealing with two main  issues confronting the country: disengagement from the war in Lebanon and  reducing runaway inflation.  </P> <P> The present coalition, on the other hand, papered over differences on the main  issue of the day: how to end the 19-month-old Arab uprising and bring peace  between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  </P> <P> "The chickens are coming home to roost," said Avineri. "As long as no one got  into details, the parties could pretend to go along with each other. But once  specifics were raised, the government was absolutely bound to fall apart."  </P></p>

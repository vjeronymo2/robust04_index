			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marina Lebedeva and Vladimir Ardayev: "Human </F> Rights in Conference Hall and Outside It"]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- The International Conference  on Human Rights, "Public Organizations and Power: Interaction  in a Democratic Society," has ended in Alma-Ata.    The discussion corresponded fully with the main theme of the  conference. But the "thorniest" aspects inevitably concerned  events unfolding nearby, outside the conference hall of the  Alma-Ata sociopolitical center.    Formally, following the adoption of the new Constitution and  the reconstruction of the main legal base, practically no laws  remain in Kazakhstan which directly violate human rights --  human rights must not be violated by law here. But this year's  elections have shown the weakness and lack of coordination of  the social associations and their vulnerability before the  "party in power," something that CSCE observers emphasized, as  well as the undeveloped state or almost complete absence of  independent mass media in Kazakhstan.    One example confirming the fairness of this analysis came up  straight away on the first day of the conference's work. On the  eve of its opening, 16 May, an unsanctioned rally of pickets,  several of whom had declared a hunger strike, broke out on the  square outside the building of the parliament, which had  gathered for the latest stage of its first session. The militia  drove the hunger strikers out of the square, and five of them  were arrested. This was prompted by an actual parliament  decision, which essentially outlawed not only obvious  demonstrations, but also "other gatherings of citizens."    The speech by V. Lyubushkin, a deputy from the North  Kazakhstan Oblast Council [Maslikhat], devoted to the "Russian  question," was a dramatic one. He cited "acts of intimidation  to others," applied by the Kazakhstani authorities toward those  who are trying to defend the rights of the Russian-speaking  population, as a state policy distortion that is exacerbating  this question. Thus, Boris Suprunyuk, chairman of the "Russian  Community of North Kazakhstan" and a journalist, is under arrest.    The conflictual situation arose during the work of the civil  rights conference with the sociopolitical newspaper  KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA -- the most popular Russian-language  publication in the Republic. Quite recently, the "Kazakhstan"  television and radio broadcasting company was transformed into a  corporation under the control of the authorities by being merged  with a private television company -- and a presidential  representative was appointed in it, in the person of press  service leader I. Romanov.    At IZVESTIYA's request, assessing the conference that has  ended, Burkutbay Ayaganov, deputy chief of the internal policy  section in the president's apparatus and the Kazakhstani  Republic Cabinet of Ministers, who participated in it, called it  "effective," and said it testified to democratic Kazakhstan's  desire to become a rule-of-law state.    When asked to comment on the cases of the violation of human  rights which occurred in the past few days outside the  conference hall, the deputy chief of section answered that he is  not prepared to do so as he does not have sufficient information  at his disposal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- On 23 May, President  Carlos Menem conceded that the disagreement that broke out in  the cabinet over the establishment of a Secretariat for  Community Protection "may affect the Constituent Assembly," but  only "marginally," he hastened to add.    Menem acknowledged that "there were some arguments" over the  issue of the secretariat, although he made it clear that "there  is no confrontation" and that activities "are going on as usual."    The head of state commented that "this situation will affect  the Constituent Assembly, but not in a major way; it will have  only a slight, practically insignificant bearing on the  assembly." He confirmed that he will attend the opening session  to be held in Parana [Entre Rios Province] on 25 May.    Menem did not rule out that "as in any election campaign, an  offense of defamation, insults, and slander will be launched."    He noted that newspaper headlines, which reported on  controversies within the cabinet, "will have some effect on  people's way of thinking," but he stressed that "this does not  influence the working of the administration in the least because  there were only arguments, and not confrontations as the media  reported."    The president labeled the arguments within the cabinet  "normal," "especially in a government like this, in which  changes are really dramatic." Hence, one "should not be  surprised or alarmed."    With regard to the Secretariat for Community Protection,  Menem said it will be "like any other thing that was established  at cabinet level, many of which came directly under the  jurisdiction of the president."    Menem, speaking on the La 9.90 radio station this morning,  said "it is a secretariat like any other. The problem lies in  the fact that there are eight laws on security, and they must be  made compatible with the areas in which they are inserted."    He pointed out that the government "has been working" on the  establishment of this secretariat "for a year." He nevertheless  conceded that "perhaps information about the subject was  deficient; some hasty words were uttered, and the events that  are now public knowledge supervened."    Notwithstanding this, he reiterated that "these kinds of  organizations pertaining to people's security already exist in  the leading countries of the world, and it never crossed their  minds to think they are like the Gestapo. These words  (Gestapo-KGB) are used in the world of politics to stir up  uneasiness among citizens," he added.    Menem again said that "once the law on ministries is amended  following the constitutional reform, there will be a new  ministry that will be entirely and exclusively charged with  ensuring that the community is protected."    He went on to say that "those who feel ill at ease are  obviously the ones who are going to wield less power and are  therefore trying to create problems in the community."    The head of state believes that "those who are openly  against  the establishment of this secretariat are those whose actions  seek to destroy the peace that reigns in Argentina, cause  problems for democracy, and hamper the complete freedom we enjoy  in our country."</p>

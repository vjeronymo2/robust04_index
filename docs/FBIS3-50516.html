			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (AFP) -- The Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity (URNG) said today that it "totally and  absolutely rejects" the Guatemalan Army's report on the URNG's  alleged links with the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN),  which began an armed struggle in Mexico on 1 January.    Luis Becker, a member of the URNG's political-diplomatic  commission, told AFP that "the report (issued by the Guatemalan  Army) aims to misinform to create confusion and problems."    He insisted there are no links between the URNG and EZLN,  and  he stressed that "we absolutely respect the political situation  (in Mexico), and therefore we refrain" from issuing an opinion  on the emergence of the guerrilla movement in Chiapas State in  southern Mexico.    In Guatemala, the Army said today, there "are signs" the  URNG  "might be involved" with the guerrilla EZLN, which is occupying  several towns in southern Mexico.    Becker said he does not know whether the "disinformation"  seeks to prevent the return of thousands of Guatemalan refugees  who live in Chiapas and other southern Mexican states and who  for several months have been preparing to return to their places  of origin.    The Guatemalan guerrillas, who are planning to hold a round  of peace negotiations with the Guatemalan Government on 6  January, have said that they will issue a communique "later" on  the "disinformation" spread by the Army about their links with  the EZLN. The EZLN has said there are no foreigners in their  movement and that their members come from various Mexican  locations.</p>

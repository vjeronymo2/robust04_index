He is the equal of Vin Scully in baseball and Chick Hearn in  basketball, but now radio listeners are deprived of his voice.  </P> <P> Now that the Kings finally have a single radio station that can be heard  throughout Southern California, they need to return their greatest asset to the  listeners.  </P> <P> MARK S.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] board of governors overwhelmingly  adopted a resolution Monday referring the North Korean nuclear  dispute to the United Nations Security Council.    The vote on the resolution, sponsored by 17 board members  including the United States, Britain, Germany and Russia, was 25  for, one against and five abstentions.    China, whose position on the issue had attracted the most  interest, abstained along with India, Indonesia, Brazil and  Lebanon.    The only opposing vote was cast by Libya. Cuba and Syria did  not take part in the voting.    The resolution contained wording that said the IAEA will  notify the UN Security Council of the matter.    However, it is believed the resolution is more than an act  of  notification as it indirectly urges the Security Council to  implement countermeasures, observers said.    The resolution expresses the most serious concern ever by  the  IAEA board of governors over the possibility that North Korea  has diverted nuclear material for other than stated purposes.    It asks IAEA Director-General Hans Blix to report the  resolution not only to all IAEA members but also the United  Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.    The resolution specifically mentions that the IAEA could not  prove that North Korea had not used nuclear material for nuclear  weapons or nuclear explosive devices. The observers deemed it  significant that the IAEA has used the terms "nuclear weapons"  and "nuclear explosive devices" for the first time in its  resolution on the North Korean issue.    The resolution, consisting of seven items, expresses regret  that the IAEA was unable to fulfill the Security Council's  request to resolve the dispute because of North Korea's  uncooperative attitude.    It recalls that the Security Council instructed Blix last  May  to report back to the council on how the issue was progressing,  thus indirectly requesting that the Security Council eventually  deliberate countermeasures.    At the same time, the resolution urged North Korea once  again  to allow unfettered IAEA inspections, implement the nuclear  safeguards agreement and fulfill its obligations as a signatory  to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    The IAEA said the North Korean problem will remain a major  pending issue and warned that, if Pyongyang does not fulfill its  obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement, it will take  follow-up steps in accordance with its charter including  disqualification and suspension of technology cooperation.    In his opening report to the board meeting, Blix said  inspection of the radiochemical laboratory was a must and North  Korea had already agreed to allow it.    Despite its earlier agreement, North Korea refused to let  IAEA inspectors check the laboratory, making it impossible to  determine whether the Stalinist state had diverted nuclear  material for non- peaceful purposes since the last inspection in  February.    Blix warned that the IAEA would no longer remain silent on  the issue.    The IAEA is ready to send experts again to check facilities  they could not inspect last time. In order to do so, North  Korea must offer the UN watchdog a clear commitment that it  would allow all inspections.    The North Korean representative denounced the resolution,  charging that the IAEA had reached a hasty and irrational  conclusion and was putting unjust pressure on Pyongyang.</p>

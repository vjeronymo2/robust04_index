It is memorable chiefly for Ron Goodwin's unforgettably repetitive music. The Couch Trip is yet another example of Hollywood's ambivalent relationship with psychiatry. An escaped lunatic replaces a celebrity sex therapist offering advice on a radio programme, and is wildly successful with the punters. (10.20 BBC1). C4 shows the 1946 American version of The Postman Always Rings Twice with Lana Turner as the beautiful predatory woman and John Garfield as the smitten drifter. 'Ossessione' had more class but, considering the Hays Office rules, this one is surprisingly successful at conveying the heat of the sex (11.40). The Masque Of The Red Death is Corman's best horror movie. Better still, Nicholas Roeg photographed it before turning director.

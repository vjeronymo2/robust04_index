			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Court backs job security in pregnancy British women who are sacked as a result of becoming pregnant will be able to claim a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 - and thus much higher compensation awards - following a ruling in the European Court of Justice. The decision was played down by ministers but welcomed by the Trades Union Congress and the Equal Opportunities Commission. It could result in more Pounds 100,000-plus awards similar to those made to women soldiers sacked by the Ministry of Defence. Mr Ira Chalphin of the Institute of Directors said, however, that the ruling would make women of child-bearing age less attractive to employers. 'The law is increasingly saying to employers 'beware of these people',' he said. The case was taken to the European Court of Justice by Mrs Carole Webb, 25, of West Drayton, London, who was dismissed from her clerical job at EMO Air Cargo in June 1987. She had been taken on as a replacement for another woman soon to begin maternity leave but was dismissed when she discovered that she too was pregnant. Mrs Webb said this was a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act and took her case to an industrial tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the the Court of Appeal, losing in all three places. The House of Lords then ruled that there was nothing special about pregnancy that should cause a woman to be treated differently from a man or woman unavailable for work on medical grounds. It asked the European Court of Justice for a preliminary judgment on the issue. The European Court of Justice disagreed with the Lords, finding that pregnancy cannot be compared with male illness and that Mrs Webb's dismissal therefore amounted to sex discrimination. Hitherto women have been able to claim compensation for dismissal when pregnant under either employment protection rules or under the Sex Discrimination Act. But cases under the Sex Discrimination Act have often failed on the grounds that a man would not have been treated differently, and employment protection cases have been subject to a compensation limit of about Pounds 16,000. The European Court of Justice's ruling insists that pregnant women are entitled to the protection of the law from the first day of employment, rather than after two years of service. In the next significant case before it, expected to be by the end of this year, the European Court of Justice will rule on whether women should receive full rates of pay while on maternity leave.</p>

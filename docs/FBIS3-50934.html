			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 7 Jan (EFE) -- Drug trafficking is spreading  throughout Peru. Today there was a report on the discovery of  pits for soaking coca leaves and making basic cocaine paste in  areas of the country previously untouched by drug trafficking.    According to newspaper reports, four soaking pits were  discovered in a house in Puerto Maldonado, the capital of the  jungle department of Madre de Dios, which borders Brazil and  Bolivia.    The discovery, which was made by the General Narcotics  Directorate, has confirmed reports that drug traffickers -- who  may have expanded their operations from Ayacucho to Cuzco in the  Andean region -- are moving to Madre de Dios.    Authorities arrested the owner of the house and seized  precursor chemicals such as ammonia and kerosene used to make  basic paste.    Peru is the world's largest producer of the coca leaf, the  raw material for cocaine, followed by Bolivia.    The newspaper EXPRESO also revealed today that an Army  colonel and commander are currently on trial for keeping 114 kg  of basic cocaine paste seized in a 1992 counternarcotics  operation in the Huallaga River Valley in the northern jungle  department of San Martin, an area known for drug trafficking.    The newspaper identified the officers as Colonel Eduardo  Alvarado and Commander Walter Bue, who were accused by General  Eduardo Bellido, who was chief of the Huallaga Front's  political-military command at the time of the operation.    There are two other drug-trafficking cases in this same area  that presumably involve an Army noncommissioned officer and a  National Police officer.    It was also reported today that the Peruvian Navy discharged  two officers and a technician who were arrested by the New  Orleans Police (United States) for carrying pure cocaine.    Lima's EL COMERCIO newspaper revealed today that three  sailors were arrested on 19 November 1993 in New Orleans after  disembarking from the Navy vessel Ilo. The Navy members were  identified as Jorge Saldias, Raul Baylon, and William Tello.    Based on a confidential report by the National Police  Narcotics Intelligence Department, EL COMERCIO revealed on 3  January that the production of washed basic cocaine paste in the  country for 1993 reached 600 tons.    According to the report, not even 1 percent of that amount  produced in Peruvian cocaine-producing areas -- specifically,  the Peruvian central jungle and the Huallaga River Valley -- was  seized during 1993.    The drug traffickers used over 2 million tons of basic paste  to produce 600 tons of basic cocaine paste, which is  subsequently washed to be "exported" by light Colombian planes  flying to Peru.    The new development is that cocaine farmers not only grow  the  plant but also make the raw basic paste from the leaves they  soak. They then take the paste to storage centers designated by  Peruvian drug traffickers to be shipped to Colombia by light  planes or crafts.    In addition to the Huallaga River Valley, the basic paste is  produced in the Mayo River Valley, San Martin Department and  Alto Maranon River, Amazonas Department -- both of which are  located in the country's northern jungle, and in the areas  between the Ene and Apurimac Rivers in the central jungle.    Other major cocaine areas include those of Puerto Inca and  Puerto Bermudez in the jungle of Pasco Department in the  Peruvian central mountain range.</p>

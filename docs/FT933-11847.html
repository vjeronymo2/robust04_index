			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / US urges Asia to help curb N-arms THE US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday urged Asian countries to help curb the spread of nuclear weapons and warned them that the growing sophistication of their economies meant Asia could become an important source of equipment for missiles and for chemical and biological weapons. 'This is a growing problem for Asia because economic and technological development means the region can now produce chemicals, sophisticated electronics and other products and services that the proliferators want, but are now denied in Europe and the US,' he said. 'Asia is at the stage when its participation in international agreements and establishment of export control regimes are most important.' He was addressing the annual meeting between the six foreign ministers of the Association of South East Nations (Asean) and their 'dialogue partners' from the EC, the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Asean comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The main weapons proliferation problems raised at the talks in Singapore concern North Korea, which is suspected of having a nuclear weapons programme in breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), and China, which is accused by the US of exporting parts for medium-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Western countries, however, are also worried that Asian companies are starting to supply lethal equipment and technology outside Asia. In March a shipment of eight steel reactor vessels which could have been used for making nerve gas or mustard gas were seized in Singapore on their way to Libya under a UN arms embargo against Tripoli. They were made in Malaysia. Libya said the vessels were for making lubricated mud used in oil drilling. Several other foreign ministers joined Mr Christopher yesterday in emphasising the importance of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, after the first informal gathering on Sunday of a new, 18-member Asia-Pacific forum to discuss security issues. Western ministers defended their interpretation of human rights and democracy in the face of criticism from Asean leaders, and called for the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained Burmese opposition leader. 'Some have argued that democracy is somehow unsuited for Asia and that our emphasis on human rights is a mask for western cultural imperialism,' Mr Christopher said. 'They could not be more wrong. In fact, democracy has been strengthened over the last decade around Asia, in Taiwan and Korea, in the Philippines and Thailand, in Mongolia and elsewhere. The yearnings for more freedom are not a western export; they are a human instinct.' The meeting also moved closer to calling a special meeting to review the conflict in Cambodia after United Nations peacekeepers leave next month, Reuter adds. 'Involvement in the post-UNTAC (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) political framework would help prevent the unravelling of the election achievements and develop a constituency of opinion on the need for the international community to help provide stability in post-election Cambodia,' Asean said.</p>

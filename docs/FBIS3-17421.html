Perhaps this is why the all-knowing and  all-understanding democratic press has not informed its readers  of a fact which could, if people were so inclined, be called  sensational. Namely, that the Russian Federation General  Prosecutor's Office has not applied the amnesty to the former  security minister. He is still under investigation.    I telephoned defense attorney D. Shteynberg yesterday:    "Viktor Pavlovich and I visited Gaydanov, the new chief of  the investigations administration, and he informed us of the  reason for what I would term this lawlessness."    It turns out that the Prosecutor's Office is waiting for the  State Duma to adopt a decree on the procedure for applying the  amnesty. This may be required for some people, but as far as  the political prisoners are concerned, the Duma has already made  everything perfectly clear -- the amnesty is to be applied  forthwith! I believe that the Prosecutor's Office is  maliciously violating the constitutional principle that all are  equal before the law.    Of course, the exception made for V. Barannikov could be  considered an annoying misunderstanding. It could be claimed  that, in the course of the struggle which A. Kazannik waged  against the presidential entourage, striving to release A.  Rutskoy, R. Khasbulatov, and their associates as quickly as  possible, he forgot about the man in the hospital. But that  explanation is one for dimwits. There is another, more likely,  theory.    The "collective Rasputin" with which, we recall, the former  security minister finally quarreled on the eve of his  resignation has forgotten nothing and has not forgiven him. It  is as if they are hinting to the recent inmate of Lefortovo,  from where he was transferred to the hospital after a heart  attack, that, even though now "at liberty," he is still wholly  in the hands of "their man" -- A. Ilyushenko -- a direct  presidential appointee. And this is why conclusions must be  drawn.    Needless to say, it is no secret that Viktor Pavlovich knows  a very great deal about the "secrets of the Kremlin court." For  instance, which dollar incomes are used to educate the sons of  certain highly placed grandees in prestigious foreign colleges,  which of them have accounts in what bank, or which of them are  involved in corruption or the trade in natural resources. He  could also talk about why one of those close to the court -- a  fervent opponent of the CPSU -- is nicknamed "Tanya."    Naturally, the amnesty will eventually be applied to V.  Barannikov. But the pointed playing on the sick man's nerves  points to the invisible deal that they are trying to foist on  him. Something along the lines of "you keep quiet and we'll set  you free."</p>

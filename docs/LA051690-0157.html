			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINATRA SITS DOWN ON THE JOB  </P> <P> Frank Sinatra brought the house down but had to sit down on the job to do it.  </P> <P> "When you get to be my age, you got to sit down once in a while," Sinatra said,  pulling up a stool and crooning "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" in front  of a sellout Radio City Music Hall crowd that gave him several standing  ovations.  </P> <P> Sinatra, 74, sang for nearly an hour Tuesday night, pumping his fists, jabbing  his finger and joking with fans who kept calling for "New York, New York" that  he was going to sing "Secaucus, Secaucus" instead.  </P> <P> He credited "My Way" with "doing more for my career than just about any other  song," but recalled hating it at first.  </P> <P> And as a huge backdrop of the Manhattan skyline was lowered to the stage,  Sinatra closed with "New York, New York."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SPILL OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> Your editorial regarding the oil spill off Huntington Beach misses the point  entirely ("California Takes a Bad Spill," Feb. 9).  </P> <P> As long as our engines of economic growth continue to be driven by fossil  fuels, those fuels must be transported by tanker fleets.  </P> <P> Furthermore, as long as tankers continue to traverse the oceans, there will  inevitably be accidents and spills regardless of how "safe" any one particular  ship may be built.  </P> <P> If individuals and corporations are given no viable alternative to  petroleum-based fuel products, society must accept the inherent risk that the  transport of those fuel products presents.  </P> <P> No matter the regulations, rules, standards or penalties proposed, it will  happen again; maybe in five days, maybe in five years. Just don't cover your  heads in the sand and pretend the problem will just go away. It won't.  </P> <P> DREW J. PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

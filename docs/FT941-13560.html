			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: J Rothschild Assurance premium income rises A rise of almost 2 1/2 times from Pounds 101m to Pounds 250m in new premium income at J Rothschild Assurance was largely due to an even sharper increase in new single premium products. Single premium income advanced from Pounds 82.7m to Pounds 221.4m, while annual premium income rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 18.3m). The company has been in business for only two years. In both annual and single premium products, there were greater percentage increases in pension than in life premium income. However, life single premiums were the largest component with income of Pounds 165.2m. Sums assured rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 900m), while funds under management increased from Pounds 290m to Pounds 715m. Sir Mark Weinberg, chairman, said that the size of the J Rothschild partnership, which comprises the sales force, had grown from 400 to 500 last year, and that much of the rise in new business came from greater productivity.</p>

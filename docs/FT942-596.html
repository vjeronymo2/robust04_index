			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Central banks hold fire Foreign exchange markets were caught in a stalemate yesterday as participants waited for a repeat of Friday's central bank support of the dollar, which failed to materialise, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar remained very weak and closed in London at Y99.865 against the yen, from Y100.9 on Friday. Earlier the US currency had touched a post-war low of Y99.50 during Japanese trading. Against the D-Mark the dollar finished at DM1.5758, more than two pfennigs down from Friday's close of DM1.5972. In New York the dollar improved to end at Y100.45 and DM1.5830. In spite of the dollar's weakness, it avoided going into freefall as some had feared and this lent support to bond and equity markets. Many observers had expected central banks to continue Friday's intervention, but others said that the failure of their earlier efforts had forced them to pause and reassess their objectives. In Europe, meanwhile, the D-Mark fell victim to profit-taking as investors cashed in on the currency's recent bout of strength on the back of the weak dollar. The Belgian franc, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo all finished firmer against the D-Mark, but it was stronger against the French franc and the Italian lira. Traders reported that the only central bank intervention in support of the dollar came from the Bank of Japan during Japanese trading. Market estimates were that the BOJ bought Dollars 750m to Dollars 1bn supporting the currency, but to little avail. The dollar's woes were aggravated over the weekend by the resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's eight-week-old minority coalition. The departure of the prime minister raised doubts about whether the US and Japan would be able to reach an accord over trade issues at next week's G7 summit in Naples. Mr Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ International in London, said intervention was probably a 'waste of time' given the skittish state of market sentiment, where signals were likely to be misinterpreted. 'The market is going through quite a frantic period and reassessing its views about the dollar,' said Mr Hannah. He said failed intervention, such as on Friday, was worse than inactivity because sentiment was adversely affected by a failed attempt to arrest the dollar's decline. The IBJ analyst said the central banks would probably let the market turmoil run its course for a while before acting again. He predicted that they might wait until late-July or August before acting. But Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in Europe, said central banks might act this week 'to restore their battered credibility after Friday's debacle'. He predicted that they would fail unless such a move came in tandem with a strong signal on interest rates. The danger, added Mr Persaud, was that central banks would see intervention as a substitute, rather than a complement, for higher rates. Most observers agree that central bank concern is rooted not in dollar weakness in itself, but in the ramifications that this might have for financial markets and the world economy in general. Mr Hannah disputes the view held by some in the market that US and German authorities are unconcerned about dollar weakness. He said there was a danger of a 'free- fall' scenario whereby a sharp fall in the dollar translated into increased US inflation, higher US interest rates and a general brake on world economic recovery. In this case, Germany, in particular, would have a lot to lose since its recovery is still in an early stage. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, will also be mindful of the possible political damage he could suffer in October's national elections, should the economic recovery falter. Prices in the interest rate futures market were volatile, while volume was fairly subdued. Sentiment in short sterling was buoyed by the positive showing in gilts, and the back-month contracts were particularly well bid. The December future saw nearly 18,000 lots traded and ended at 93.73, two basis points up from Friday's close, but 10 basis points above the low for the day of 93.63. The December 1995 contract closed at 91.52, leaving it 18 basis points above where it started the day. The December Euromark contract traded nearly 18,000 lots and finished four basis points firmer at 94.89. In the German money markets, call money traded slightly higher at 4.90/5 per cent, from 4.85/4.95 on Friday, as banks sought funds ahead of end-of-month reserve requirements and pension payments. In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 671m of assistance, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 650m. Overnight money traded between 4 and 5 per cent. Sterling ended at DM2.4498, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs weaker. Against the dollar it finished higher at Dollars 1.5547 from Dollars 1.5422. The market ignored newspaper reports that the UK chancellor will today raise his growth forecast for the economy.</p>

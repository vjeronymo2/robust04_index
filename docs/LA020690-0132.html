			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PACIFICA CLINCHES SPOT IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The net-cutting ceremony was abruptly halted but Coach Rhett Heckel's  water-soaked head told the story Monday night as Pacifica High School clinched  its first Southern Section playoff berth in 17 years with a 60-54 victory over  host Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The victory moved third-place Pacifica (11-9, 9-3) three games ahead of  fourth-place Garden Grove (9-12, 7-5) with two games remaining. The top three  teams in each league are guaranteed playoff berths.  </P> <P> Pacifica broke the game open in the second quarter by outscoring Garden Grove,  10-4. The teams were tied, 12-12, late in the first quarter when Pacifica  scored 17 consecutive points for a 29-12 lead.  </P> <P> Garden Grove failed to score until forward Mark Perry made a 14-foot jump shot  with 1 minute 48 seconds left in the second quarter. Garden Grove never  recovered, but managed to narrow the deficit to six points at the buzzer when  Perry scored his 16th point.  </P> <P> "It's the first time our school has qualified for the playoffs since 1973,"  Heckel said while being doused with water by center Mike Maher. But the  celebration ended when Garden Grove administrators stopped Pacifica guard  Gerald Hernandez in the midst of cutting down a net.  </P> <P> And Pacifica's stay in postseason play may be short-lived if it continues its  sloppy ballhandling. Pacifica committed 29 turnovers Monday night.  </P> <P> When Pacifica successfully executed its passes, it usually got a  high-percentage shot from Maher or teammate Randy Schulze. Schulze led all  scorers with 22 points and missed only three shots.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Coach Dewey Van Cleave calculated that his team would have to win  one of its two remaining games to qualify for the 4-A division playoffs, where  40 teams are vying for 32 berths.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 87, Los Amigos 76 -- David Green scored 26 points and Paul  Preuss had 19 as Rancho Alamitos (17-4, 11-1) held off Los Amigos (1-18, 1-11).  Los Amigos got within one point with about five minutes remaining, but Preuss  made six of seven free throws and Eric Moore had seven of his 16 rebounds in  the final quarter.  </P> <P> Kennedy 68, Santiago 55 -- Jim Barker had 20 points and seven rebounds and  Jermaine Galloway had 11 points, nine rebounds and five blocked shots for  Kennedy (14-6, 11-1). Mike Camasco had 15 points and 11 rebounds for Santiago  (7-13, 3-9).  </P></p>

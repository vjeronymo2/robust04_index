			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY OKS RESOLUTION ON INTERNMENT AFTER SKIRMISH  </P> <P> Igniting acrimonious debate, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) on  Thursday attacked a resolution calling for California schoolchildren to be  taught that the Japanese internment during World War II was a violation of  human rights, not an act of military necessity.  </P> <P> Ferguson, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and veteran of three wars,  touched an angry nerve among his colleagues when he stood during a full  Assembly session and shouted his objections to a resolution that blamed the  internment on "race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political  leadership."  </P> <P> "I don't mind you saying that it was a failure of political leadership for  Franklin Roosevelt," he said in a slap at the Democrats, "but what you're  saying is that the brave men and women of this country -- your fathers and  mothers and your grandfathers -- were a bunch of racists. And that's why they  did this."  </P> <P> "Of course they made a bad decision," Ferguson said. "It was a terrible thing  to do. But 50 years (later), sitting in this chamber, when the biggest risk in  your lives is getting reelected or safe sex, what right do you have to question  the motives of your fathers and mothers and your grandfathers and uncles?"  </P> <P> Ferguson's objections touched off an unusually emotional verbal skirmish,  during which fellow lawmakers ganged up on the Orange County conservative and  accused him of trying to whitewash history.  </P> <P> The strongest condemnation came from Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg  (D-Sacramento), whose wife was placed in a Japanese internment camp when she  was 4-years-old.  </P> <P> "I hesitate to say that your opinion is contemptible and I will not," Isenberg  said in a tight voice. "I will say this: It is deeply offensive to every single  piece of what this country is about and you should be ashamed."  </P> <P> The fight was over a non-binding resolution, sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie  Speier (D-South San Francisco), that calls on school officials and textbook  manufacturers to revise accounts of the internment and describe it as a mass  violation of human rights. Such an "accurate and objective" account of how the  government imprisoned 110,000 Japanese would omit the traditional excuse of  national security, the resolution says.  </P> <P> The Assembly gave final approval to the resolution by a bare 41-10 vote in the  80-member body, with most Democrats voting for it and many Republicans  abstaining.  </P> <P> Before the vote, Ferguson -- perhaps best known for his attempts to have  Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a former anti-Vietnam War  demonstrator, declared a traitor and ousted from the Assembly -- stood up to  ask for a one-week postponement so he could rally veterans groups against the  resolution.  </P> <P> Claiming he was "sick of this liberal trashing of America," Ferguson fumed at  what he said was the ungrateful second-guessing of his younger peers.  </P> <P> "Perhaps all of the 17- and 18-year-old kids who joined and fought for you,  that was the dumbest decision we ever made, maybe," said Ferguson, a veteran of  World War II, Korea and Vietnam. "Maybe by now you'd all be speaking Japanese  or maybe you'd all be speaking German by now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Carefully Worded'  </P> <P> "Yes, we did make some dumb decisions, but who are you to sit here and call  your parents racist because they made a decision that they thought was  important and needed at the time?"  </P> <P> Speier parried Ferguson's objections by pointing out that her resolution was  "carefully worded" to reflect the findings of a special federal commission  convened by former President Reagan to study the Japanese internment.  </P> <P> "What we're saying to our young people is, 'Yes, we do make mistakes,' Mr.  Ferguson," Speier said. "We have made mistakes in many wars. We make mistakes  every single day of our lives and we can't be ashamed of that fact."  </P> <P> Here is the roll call by which the Assembly voted final passage of the Japanese  internment resolution on Thursday, 41 to 10:  </P> <P> Democrats for (39): Bane, Bates, Brown, Burton, Calderon, Campbell, Chacon,  Condit, Connelly, Cortese, Costa, Eastin, Eaves, Epple, Farr, Floyd, Friedman,  Hannigan, Harris, Hauser, Hayden, Hughes, Isenberg, Johnston, Katz, Killea,  Klehs, Lempert, Moore, Murray, O'Connell, Peace, Roybal-Allard, Sher, Speier,  Tanner, Tucker, M.

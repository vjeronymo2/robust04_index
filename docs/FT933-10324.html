			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Britain to join astronomy project BRITAIN is to join one of the decade's largest astronomy projects, the Science and Engineering Research Council said yesterday. Almost all of the Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.5m) it plans to contribute to the Dollars 176m Gemini project will find its way back to UK industry for high-technology contracts. The scheme is a collaboration between the US National Science Foundation and the governments of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The National Research Council of Canada also hopes to join the programme. UK universities and the council's laboratories will participate in the design and development of technically advanced systems. The council said collaboration with strong partners would transfer technology to the UK. British companies may take part in international tenders for optics, electronic light detectors and the structural framework of the two telescopes that are to be built. The telescopes will be positioned on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and in Chile. The locations have been chosen for their reliably clear weather and will offer UK astronomers the latest equipment with which to study the skies. The telescopes will be unusually large, using main mirrors eight metres across to gather visible and infra-red light. They will be 10 to 20 times more sensitive than existing telescopes and will be used to study the chemical composition, large-scale structure and origin of the universe. The Hawaiian telescope should start operation in the third quarter of 1998 and the Chilean telescope two years later.</p>

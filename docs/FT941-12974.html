			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mitel continues strong recovery The strong recovery at Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits and telephone equipment that was formerly controlled by British Telecom, continued in the third quarter, writes Robert Gibbens. Profit for the three months ended December 24 was CDollars 7.9m (USDollars 6m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 1.4m, or one cent, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 129m, up 15 per cent. Nine-month profit was CDollars 15.9m, or 13 cents, against a loss of CDollars 9.3m, or 15 cents, on revenues of CDollars 351m, ahead from CDollars 305m. Strength in the December quarter came largely from higher PBX sales in the US and rising demand for specialised circuits.</p>

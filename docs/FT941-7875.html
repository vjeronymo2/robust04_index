			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Washington strives for an early Uruguay Round start The Clinton administration, influential members of Congress and the US business community yesterday pushed for swift passage of Uruguay Round legislation, paving the way for implementation of new world trading rules six months earlier than agreed in Geneva last December. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, indicated that the US would be willing to move forward the starting date to January 1 1995. All that stood in the way, he said, was agreement by Japan, which must call a special session of the Diet (parliament). Early implementation of the Round has been sought by Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director-general. The Round took three years longer than expected to conclude, and numerous issues - environment and competitions policies among them - await the attention of Gatt members. Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman of Texas Instruments, ann-ounced formation of a coalition, representing 200,000 companies, called Alliance for Gatt Now. Passing Gatt implementing legislation must be 'a top priority this year', he said. Mr Kantor said the administration would begin a big drive on the legislation after the Gatt deal is signed on April 15 in Morocco. Democratic and Republican members of the House ways and means committee, which has final jurisdiction over the legislation, pledged support, with one Republican member, Mr Bill Thomas, vowing that a majority of his party would support passage. Opposition in the business community, expected by some members of Congress, has yet to surface. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association had threatened to oppose a Gatt deal without improvements in proposed rules governing patents. That did not happen, but Mr Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the PMA, appeared before the House trade subcommittee in support of the pact, apparently persuaded by agreement among many countries to eliminate pharmaceutical import duties. PMA support was contingent on the US 'vigorously' pursuing unilaterally improvements in intellectual property protection in 'patent-infringing countries during the unduly long and discriminatory implement period for pharmaceutical patent protection.'</p>

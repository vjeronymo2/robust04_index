			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses halved in late recovery THE EXPECTED shakeout in the UK stock market got under way yesterday after the first round of trading news from this week's company reporting list gave the signal for increased profit-taking. Falls in share prices were emphasised by the readiness of marketmakers to strike prices lower in the hope of picking up cheap stock, and by the absence of the US buyers who provided the impetus for last week's rise to an all-time peak on the FT-SE 100 Index. Traders were not pleased by reports on trading progress at Tate &amp; Lyle, and the shares fell sharply. The departure of the chief executive of BPB Industries was also taken badly by the stock market. The market was soon sliding lower and by mid-session, the Footsie showed a fall of nearly 30 points to the 3,070 area. The loss of the 3,100 mark had been widely seen as a distinct possibility but traders were glad to see a recovery set in yesterday afternoon. The rally was helped by good performances from a handful of blue chip stocks. The recovery was encouraged by a rally in UK government bonds which replaced early losses with very small gains at the longer end of the market. Strongly rising prices for UK bonds have provided support for equities, as fund managers have watched bond yields fall. By the close, the FT-SE had virtually halved its early loss to show a final reading of 3,085.1, a net 14.9 off on the session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, at 3,495.7, lost 16.5. The late rally in equities was accompanied by a heartening increase in trading volumes, which had been low when prices were falling. The day's Seaq total of 612.2m shares compared with only 476.2m on Tuesday when the London market was making a slow return from its three-day Bank Holiday weekend. Tuesday's retail business was worth only Pounds 1.06bn, at the low end of recent daily averages. 'It looked as if the US funds decided to let a bit of steam out of the London market,' commented the head trader of a leading US securities broker which acts for a number of transatlantic clients. There was significant profit-taking in a number of the stocks recently favoured by US investors, including Vodafone, the portable phone manufacturer. A US firm was understood to be particularly active on the put side of the London traded options market in Vodafone. With a number of important companies reporting progress this week, sector analysts were busy changing forecasts and urging investment moves across the range of the stock market. The weakness in Tate &amp; Lyle raised new queries over the decisions likely to be made at the next meeting of the FT-SE Index committee which advises on additions and deletions from the 100 stocks comprising the Index. However, the final picture was more mixed than the fall in the Footsie suggested. ICI benefited strongly from brokerage recommendation and there were several firm features among the interest-related stocks. Equity strategists were prepared to wait and see how far the market correction will run. Mr Robin Aspinall, chart specialist at Panmure Gordon, warned that 'even a bullish technical analyst' would expect a correction to carry the Footsie back to 2,850.</p>

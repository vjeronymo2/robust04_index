			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option A requires air emission controls on all TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers managing hazardous waste with any detectable volatile organic concentration as determined at the point where the waste is generated (i.e., a volatile organic concentration action level of 0 ppmw). Under Option A, tanks use a cover vented to a control device except for tanks handling certain hazardous wastes. Tanks in which the organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank is less than 10.4 kPa (approximately 1.5 psi) may use a cover without additional controls. All surface impoundments use a cover vented to a control device. Containers use cover and submerged fill for loading hazardous wastes into the containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option B requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The control requirements are the same as described for Option A with one exception; surface impoundments used for storage of hazardous waste and surface impoundments used for treatment of hazardous waste by a process not requiring aeration or agitation of the waste require covers only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option C requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 500 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Option B. Option C is the same control option selected as the basis for the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option D requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 1,500 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B and C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option E requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 3,000 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B, C, and D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Control Option Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA estimated nationwide organic emission and cancer risk reductions that would be achieved if air standards were implemented for each of the five control options. The ``baseline'' nationwide organic emissions from TSDF are estimated to be approximately 1 million Mg/yr. The estimated nationwide TSDF organic emissions assuming implementation of the individual control options are 30,000 Mg/yr for Option A, 41,000 Mg/yr for Option B, 48,000 Mg/yr for Option C, 51,000 Mg/yr for Option D, and 90,000 Mg/yr for Option E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assess the risk of contracting cancer posed by exposure to organic emissions from TSDF, the EPA used two measures of health risk: Annual cancer incidence and maximum individual risk (MIR). The annual cancer incidence parameter represents an estimate of population risk and, as such, measures the aggregate risk to all people in the United States estimated to be living within the vicinity of TSDF. The MIR parameter represents the potential of air emissions from a particular source to cause cancer in the most exposed hypothetical individual under the assumptions used in the risk and exposure assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimation of these health risk parameters requires the EPA to make several critical assumptions regarding the TSDF plant configurations and operating practices, the composition of wastes managed at these TSDF, the cancer potency of the organics contained in these wastes, the emission of these organics to the atmosphere from TSDF sources, and the exposure of people living near TSDF to these air toxic emissions. The complex interrelationship of the various assumptions prevents the EPA from definitively characterizing the estimated health risk parameter values as being overestimates or underestimates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Successful Lasmo bid may boost UK warrants sector - Derivatives If Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.7bn (Dollars 2.58bn) hostile bid for Lasmo, its fellow UK oil explorer, proves successful, one spin-off will be the creation of the third largest issue in the developing UK warrants market. The all-paper offer of shares and warrants would, if the bid goes through, create Pounds 105m worth of warrants, on underlying shares worth Pounds 612m. So far this year, the amount of warrants issued on UK company shares has totalled Dollars 8.5bn equivalent, not far behind last year's Dollars 9bn total and far ahead of the Dollars 2bn-odd volume recorded in 1991 and 1992, according to Euromoney Bondware. But the UK sector still lags behind the much larger German market, where warrants worth Dollars 24bn have been issued so far this year, compared with Dollars 27.5bn last year. In essence, these warrants are little different from options: they give the holder the option to buy shares in a particular company at a pre-determined price, within a certain period. But warrants differ from listed options, traded on exchanges, and over-the-counter options, which are specially negotiated bilateral agreements, in several ways. One raison d'etre for the market is that for some fund managers, warrants are 'qualified assets' - that is, they are allowed to buy them - while options are not. This is because warrants are classified as securities, since they are bearer, freely-transferable instruments which can be cleared either through Euroclear or Cedel, the two main European clearing houses, or through domestic clearing systems. Warrants also tend to be long-dated, and to be priced far out-of-the-money (that is, the exercise price is not set close to the current share price). Within the warrants market itself, the largest issues, such as those by Hanson and BTR in the UK, are launched by the companies themselves. In addition, banks and securities houses often issue 'covered' warrants - warrants on individual company stocks, which already exist. They can do this subject to investor demand, provided they have the approval of the company concerned. A retail investor looking for, say, Nestle warrants may not care which type he buys, but there are often price disparities. In particular, because covered warrants are often only traded only by the issuing house, the investor is extremely dependent on that firm's commitment to making a secondary market. Because only one house may be trading that issue, it is also inadvisable to go 'short' - because it may be extremely difficult to get hold of the warrants later. Due to its somewhat esoteric qualities, the market often behaves rather strangely. 'Warrants often become cheap when the market rallies; at the moment they are quite expensive because the UK stock market has fallen,' says Mr Richard Burns, vice-president, equity derivatives sales, at Salomon Brothers. 'Prices tend to be slow to react.' The market's liquidity has come in for considerable criticism over the years. 'Some banks have issued warrants at the wrong price and have not taken care of their deals in the secondary market and that has given the market a bad name,' admitted one warrants trader. There have also been accusations that some houses issue warrants in order to achieve an impressive position in the league tables, and may not alway be able to place the warrants subsequently. Nevertheless, the market's continued growth shows it remains attractive for some investors. Individual warrant issues, for example, may be more liquid than the traded options on an individual stock. 'If you want to get exposure to Spain, you could buy stock index warrants: the warrants won't be more liquid than the future, but, if you want a more defensive position than the future, they may be more liquid than the options,' said one trader. In addition, there is what one trader called 'operational arbitrage' - more simply, 'people like to just write one ticket'. For some investors, the process of buying a warrant is attractive simply because it is more straightforward.</p>

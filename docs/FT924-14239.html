RCA Victor 09026 60992 2 (three CDs) THE LATEST recording of Mussorgsky's last operatic epic launches an important Philips series of Russian-opera recordings by the great opera company of St Petersburg. (War and Peace and Queen of Spades will follow). What exactly to call this great company has been a thorny business for Philips: a grandiose Kirov logo is blazoned at the top of the box lid, while lower down the appellations Kirov (name of company) and Maryinsksy (name of theatre) are both offered. This question of names Soviet and pre-Soviet is not insignificant - it is a consequence of the tremendous changes in Russian life and politics (which the Kirov-Maryinsky confusion betokens) that this formerly inconceivable link-up between a western record company and a Russian opera-house could have come about. In many ways Khovanshchina is an ideal first offering for such a series. A 'musical drama' in six scenes written to catch the temper and the pulse of a nation at a crucial moment in its history - Peter the Great waiting in the wings while rebellious nobles and religious fanatics struggle for supremacy or survival - it seems in this superbly colourful, gripping, and authoritative Kirov reading a hot-off-the-press artistic vision. The work is famously problematic: a tangle of mostly unorchestrated sketches posthumously edited by Rimsky-Korsakov and in our century re-edited by Shostakovich, it has a narrative surface disjunct, awkward to negotiate and for non-Russian listeners laden with confusions. Yet by means of apparently illogical fragments of plot gathered from across the widest spectrum of Moscow society, there are developed with magnificent grandeur the opera's themes of power, honour, belief and duty confronted with the winds of change. For this reason any Khovanshchina cannot help possessing a degree of 'relevance': in the light of recent Russian history it is an opera that grows more starkly modern by the minute. It is also an opera that, though capable of providing opera-house thrills on the largest scale, benefits considerably from repeated listening. And, indeed, it is admirably represented on recent recordings - Abbado's 'live' 1990 Vienna set (DG) and Sony's same-year issue from Sofia (in its 'Russian Opera' series) are both impressively cast, conducted and argued in editorial terms. What (to my mind) sets the new Kirov Khovanshchina above both is an idiomatic vividness in the orchestral and choral sound that is strictly incomparable. People who fear that the trends of internationalisation facing the arts and artists of eastern Europe will end by ironing out national distinctions of style, timbre and attack can take a measure of comfort from the artistic stance of Valery Gergiev, young Kirov Opera chief and conductor of the Philips series. He is passionately concerned with re-evaluation but also with preservation. In contrast to Abbado's reading, obviously more gracefully nuanced in its phrasing, he offers a gust of urgency that animates Mussorgsky's plain musical invention into a state of almost continuous dramatic excitement. This affects the the entire cast. Vocally, only one of the singers can be placed in the great Russian line: the mezzo Olga Borodina as the prophetess Marfa, a voice of youthfully lustrous beauty and a manner at once noble and intense which sheds on the whole work a special glow. The leading basses (Okhotnikov as Dosifey, Mingelkiev as Khovansky) and tenors (Steblianko as the cultivated schemer Galitzin, Galuzin as the dissolute Andrey Khovansky) are all worthy singers outpointed by one or other of their counterparts on the rival recordings. The wholeness of the performance, and its majestic sweep, render such point-making unimportant. It makes an unfair companion to RCA's new Queen of Spades - a conflation of 'live' recordings taken at Ozawa's concert performances in Boston and New York last year. The American chorus sounds hard-working, painstaking and just plain foreign. The conducting, though expert in cultivating glossy orchestral playing, only intermittently taps the high theatricality of Tchaikovsky's sounds and harmonies. The leads, Atlantov and Freni, are two experienced performers here shown some way below their best form - he forceful but often crudely loud, she making eloquently lyrical use of a soprano instrument no longer fresh. First-rate accounts of Tomsky by Leiferkus, Yeletsky by Hvorostovsky and the old Countess (in spite of melodramatic touches) by the veteran Maureen Forrester add to the value. But this astonishing opera still awaits a modern recording that is both locally idiomatic and (as it were) internationally impassioned. Will Philips and the Kirov combine to produce it?</p>

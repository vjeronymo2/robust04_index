			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the </F> Jerusalem committee, by 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut in Jerusalem; date  not given]    [Text] Chairman of the Jerusalem committee Faysal  al-Husayni has admitted that there is a letter of assurance from  the Israeli Government regarding the future of Jerusalem and the  institutions there. He said: "I can say that, among other  things, there is an assurance in the letter that the Palestinian  institutions in the city will not be harmed." However, he  declined to disclose the contents of the letter, saying: "This  letter was written in such a way as not to be public." In a  lengthy interview with AL-NAHAR, he stressed that the Jerusalem  committee has not yet been formed because this requires certain  measures. He noted, however, that this does not mean that the  components of the committee are not operating. He said that he  will visit the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia in the next few  days to obtain support for the Jerusalem committee to perform  its tasks in the face of the challenges imposed on the  Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem by the Israeli Government.  When asked if Palestinian President 'Arafat will visit  Jerusalem, he said: " I believe that 'Arafat will visit  Jerusalem under Palestinians banners."    [Arna'ut] A few weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin  denied that he gave 'Arafat a letter of assurance on Jerusalem,  but a few days ago, he affirmed that there was such letter.  There is talk about two letters exchanged between the two  parties regarding Jerusalem. Is it true that such letters were  exchanged?    [Al-Husayni] Yes, there is a letter of assurance. Among  other things, the letter reassures us about the status of  Jerusalem and the institutions there. I do not want to talk  further on this issue because this letter was written in such a  way as not to be published. But, I can say that, among other  things, the letter includes assurances that the institutions in  Jerusalem will not be infringed upon.    [Arna'ut] So why this Israeli campaign against the national  institutions in Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that the campaign is partly a  reaction  to the moves of the Israeli right wing. There is a Palestinian  move not only in response to the Israeli statements but to  Israeli practical measures. These statements by both parties  triggered a very sensitive situation. Rabin seems to be trying  to protect his political image before the Israeli right wing and  to change some of his stances. When we consider these stances  we see that they contravene the nature and spirit of the  [Palestinian-Israeli] agreement [as published]    [Arna'ut] Did the meetings between you and Israeli Police  Minister Moshe Shahal take place on the basis of the letter of  assurance?    [Al-Husayni] The fact that we said that the talks over the  future of Jerusalem can be discussed at a later stage does not  mean that the issue of Jerusalem cannot be discussed at present.  The talks on the future of Jerusalem were postponed to discuss  the situation in Jerusalem and Palestinian-Israeli relations in  Jerusalem. We agreed to discuss these issues which were the  topics of discussion between me and Shahal. However, these  meetings and their effectiveness are affected by the general  political atmosphere. If the negotiations in Paris face a  crisis, they affect the meetings in Jerusalem. Similarly, a  crisis in the negotiations in Cairo and Oslo and the setbacks in  implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement indirectly affect the  meetings in Jerusalem.    [Arna'ut] Are these meetings continuing?    [Al-Husayni] Yes.    [Arna'ut] How can Shahal, who is the chairman of the  committee on saving Jerusalem, be your counterpart in discussing  facilities for the Jerusalem public?    [Al-Husayni] I am also the chairman of the Jerusalem  committee which is also a committee for saving Jerusalem.    [Arna'ut] How?    [Al-Husayni] We are both interested in the issue of  Jerusalem. The one who speaks for Jerusalem is supposed to be  representative of the authorities and not a Palestinian envoy to  the Israelis. The official facing us is representative of the  Israeli authorities with their good and bad sides and hence we  are aware that he has a certain status and a say in matters and  he steers this committee. We agreed to hold talks with him to  determine the steps that can be taken.    [Arna'ut] What is your information on the Israeli committee  on saving Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] This committee was formed by the Israelis  because they felt that the time for deciding on the issue of  Jerusalem is approaching and so they want to avoid placing this  issue on the agenda. Hence, they are trying to take measures to  strengthen their position when the negotiating process begins.  This is what prompted us to form the Jerusalem committee to  demand that the Arab and Islamic world support it, because the  Israeli committee is not only supported by Israel but by the  whole world.    [Arna'ut] Certain Palestinians say that a bylaw was prepared  for the Palestinian Jerusalem committee but no practical  measures have been taken.    [Al-Husayni] We announced that we want to form this  committee  but have not yet done so because this requires certain  procedures. However, this does not mean that the components of  the committee are not operating. The Jerusalem committee in the  old city is functioning to defend and renovate the buildings in  the old city within the means available. When we say the  Jerusalem committee we do not mean the major Jerusalem committee  with the same resources given to it. We are working to  establish an initial budget through which the Jerusalem  committee can function and expand its work. We do not mean a  major committee whose expenses we cannot afford.    [Arna'ut] Does this mean you will kick the ball back into  the Arab court to gain support for the Jerusalem committee?    [Al-Husayni] Yes. I will visit the Gulf and Saudi Arabia in  the next few days to end this matter.    [Arna'ut] Has Saudi Arabia extended aid to the Jerusalem  committee before?    [Al-Husayni] Saudi Arabia has given specific aid, but not to  us directly. It provided aid to the PLO to assist some existing  institutions and to meet its obligations and needs for the  implementation of the agreement. Everybody knows that the PLO  needed this aid to begin the implementation of the agreement.    [Arna'ut] A few months ago you stated that in the next two  years Jerusalem residents must launch a battle to prove that  Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic. What measures did the  Palestinian side take in this regard?    [Al-Husayni] A number of things. The battle of Jerusalem is  a political, diplomatic, economic, social, educational, and  cultural battle. On the political and diplomatic levels, we are  doing our best. This place, the Orient House, is one of the  areas that has made a great effort toward that end. I believe  that we gained a preliminary presence. This place has turned  into a meeting place for the Palestinians with foreigners as  well as among the Palestinians themselves to discuss several  internal issues. At the economic level, this center has  endeavored to call for an economic workshop on Jerusalem, and I  believe we must convene such a conference in Jerusalem as soon  as possible to send a message to the Israelis that Jerusalem's  importance is not just religious. The Israelis must realize  that this is the Palestinians' religious, political, economic,  and educational capital. Conferences must be held in Jerusalem  and funds must be obtained for economic projects, educational  seminars, and conferences of this nature so that the Israelis  may realize that Jerusalem's fate is not a foregone conclusion.  Finally, the Palestinian capabilities, skills, and expertise  must be geared toward defending Jerusalem. At the present  stage, I believe that we must think of establishing a new  college, for instance, to be part of the Jerusalem university  and not part of other Palestinian universities. If there is a  possibility for renovation or new investments, this must be done  in Jerusalem. Jerusalem needs at least 30,000 housing units on  an urgent basis to meet its requirements, and this requires more  activity than what we are doing now.    For this reason, we thought of establishing the Jerusalem  committee, which will comprise shadow institutions for all the  other institutions existing in Jerusalem. Each department  within this committee will follow up the work of its Israeli  equivalent to pursue things and put pressure to gain the  Palestinian rights in Jerusalem.    [Arna'ut] However, the Palestinian institutions are meeting  in Ramallah and Bethlehem instead of Jerusalem.    [Al-Husayni] This is one of the serious mistakes, where  committing them is tantamount to acknowledging a fait accompli,  something that we do not wish to do.    [Arna'ut] It seems that the Israeli side views the Orient  House as the link between the foreign consulates in Jerusalem  and the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Husayni] The Orient House had a specific role to play  before the agreement was signed and it will continue to play  this role. We were offering services to the PLO in Tunis at the  political level, and we are ready to offer these services to the  Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho.    [Arna'ut] If the Orient House is transferred, will foreign  consulates be opened in Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Husayni] It is very clear that the consulates are  present  here to represent the Palestinians inside and outside Jerusalem.  Thus, under the current situation, it is not enough for them to  play their role toward Gaza and Jericho and so they will play  their role toward Jerusalem here and then with the authority  [sentence as published], and we coordinate with the authority.    [Arna'ut] You had your own stand on the Cairo agreement,  yet you took part in the meeting held by the leadership to form  the Palestinian authority. It was announced that you would be  given a ministerial portfolio but this was denied later. Is  there any Israeli pressure on the question of the participation  of Arabs from Jerusalem in the Palestinian authority?    [Al-Husayni] There is not going to be such a portfolio,  about  Jerusalem. But there are responsibilities in this matter. As  to my responsibilities, whether I am in the authority or not,  they will be devoted to the Jerusalem issue.    [Arna'ut] In the final negotiations on Jerusalem, will you  ask Israel to pay the money it has levied from the Palestinians  in the city during the years of occupation?    [Al-Husayni] Yes.    [Arna'ut] That is the arnona [property tax] and taxes?    [Al-Husayni] We will ask for the taxes levied on services  that have not been given.    [Arna'ut] Are you preparing studies and statistics on this  issue?    [Al-Husayni] Yes. There is a special center for planning and  studies.    [Arna'ut] Private housing projects are under way in  Jerusalem  now. But we have not heard about large housing projects by the  Palestinian side. Why?    [Al-Husayni] Our basic problem is that there are potentially  7,000 building licenses. But building on the land given us is a  complicated matter, that is, this land includes common land and  some of it is not ready for building upon. I believe that  committees should be formed to resolve the problem of these  lands. Countries usually confiscate lands in this way. We must  conclude an understanding between the owners of these lands and  the concerned reconstruction parties in Jerusalem. There must  be agreement between the land owners and those concerned and we  must find a way to solve the problem of this land.    [Arna'ut] Palestinians in Jerusalem are complaining that a  services establishment in Jerusalem is encouraging owners to  rent their houses to foreigners at the expense of Jerusalem's  Palestinians. Has the Jerusalem committee not thought of taking  measures against it?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that we are not supposed to rush into  renting too much to foreign establishments at the expense of the  Palestinians. The staff of such an establishment must in fact  look for new ways and to contact those who own buildings which  are, for example, appropriate to be offices. It is better to  let foreign establishments pay to build on the sites that are  fit to be office complexes and to leave the houses in Jerusalem.    [Arna'ut] Yehuda Olmert said that he will close Orient  House.  What is your response?    [Al-Husayni] He has said so and I believe that what he said  does not serve the cause of peace or Israel.    [Arna'ut] Do you believe that President 'Arafat will visit  Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni]I believe that 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem  under  the Palestinian flags.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: International audit comparison falls into trap Sir, International comparisons offer notorious elephant traps. Andrew Jack's article, 'UK auditors charge more but take longer to report' (December 28), based on a published survey, is guilty of not comparing like with like. The survey provided data on audit fees for only 10 countries, whereas full information was available on the length of time companies take to report. Thus the comparison of fees excludes, inter alia, the US, Canada, Japan and the whole of Europe (except for the UK and the Irish Republic). A comparison of audit fees charged in G7 countries would be much more telling than the one we are offered between developed and developing economies. On the comparison of reporting lags, it is the company, not the auditor, that is responsible for the reporting process and therefore for the timetable. The implication of the article, that companies produce their financial statements and then wait with varying degrees of patience for the auditors to start work, is incorrect. An indication of the delay that the audit process builds into the reporting process would indeed be interesting, but is probably not measurable and is certainly not available. Audit fees are based on a complex mix of factors, such as the intricacy of the company's business, the strength of its controls, the quality of the staff needed to carry out the audit, and so on. Mr Jack's article omitted one of the most interesting conclusions of the survey: that in Australia and the UK - the largest industrialised countries in the fee sample - companies in similar industries tended to pay 'very similar' audit fees. 'The audit services industry is very competitive in large industrialised countries,' the survey concludes.

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Fresh splash of green: Signs of recovery in the art market A painting by Matisse was sold at auction in New York last month for a record Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) and a Monet for Dollars 12.1m. This week in Paris a Van Gogh fetched FFr55m (Pounds 6.5m). And in London on Wednesday a Goya was bought by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, for Pounds 4.95m. The international art market is suddenly sprouting green shoots after more than two years of decline and despair. Undoubtedly a revival of interest in acquiring art, generated in the US, is restoring confidence to the auction houses of Paris and London, and to hard-pressed antique dealers. But the revival is selective and fickle. At best it might persuade owners of important works of art that they can now consign them to auction with a good chance of making a sale; at worst it marks the end of the recession, but with any general revival still in the future. The fall in the art market was sudden and sharp. The cracks were already appearing at the New York auctions in May 1990 when a Japanese paper manufacturer, Ryoei Saito, bought a Van Gogh portrait for Dollars 82.5m and a Renoir music hall scene for Dollars 78.1m, by far the highest prices ever paid for works of art. Alongside the records there were a disturbingly high percentage of unsold lots. By the next round of important art sales in London in December 1990 the fall in demand was apparent. Christie's auction totalled Pounds 10.3m, compared with Pounds 76.5m a year earlier, while Sotheby's only managed Pounds 6.6m as against Pounds 76m in December 1989. The auction houses were hit hard. Sotheby's fell into loss, and Christie's saw its profits fall sharply. But they had partly been responsible for creating the heights from which the market fell. They offered guarantees to important sellers and loans to prospective buyers, encouraging speculative purchases, especially among the Japanese. The fastest growing market had been for post-1870 art which quickly came to represent almost 50 per cent of auction houses' turnover in the late 1980s. The recent sprinkling of high prices reflects a very different market. Most dealers have too much debt, and too many unsold works of art, to be big buyers, and the Japanese are almost totally absent - except as sellers. But new collectors are appearing, many of them Americans who think that the US is moving out of recession and that art looks a better home for surplus money compared with the low interest rates offered by the banks. The Matisse went to a first-time buyer, as did the Monet. To date the revival in the art market is concentrated on undoubted masterpieces, which have an international appeal, and works of interest specifically to American buyers. Sotheby's auction of American paintings earlier this month was its best in this field for 2 1/2 years, totalling Dollars 11m. Latin American art is even more buoyant, reflecting the resilience of the regional economies such as Mexico and Venezuela. At Sotheby's, a brothel scene by Colombian artist Fernando Botero went for Dollars 1.54m in an auction which brought in more than Dollars 10m and was 90 per cent sold. There are also encouraging bids coming from east Asia. The Japanese are still licking their wounds but the Koreans, Taiwanese and some Hong Kong Chinese are competing fiercely for Asian works of art. Contemporary Chinese paintings represent a new market which is helping auction houses make good some of their losses on the impressionists. Last month, a painting by Zhang Daqian sold for more than Pounds 600,000. Even the tricky area of contemporary art is looking up. This is one area where American artists, in particular the abstract expressionists of the post-1945 New York school such as Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns, are pre-eminent. This is the art sought by rich Americans, especially the new rich. Charles Saatchi this month reckoned the market was strong enough to absorb 14 works from his collection in New York. He was over-optimistic and five were unsold but the most expensive, Andy Warhol's Marilyn X 100, found a buyer at Dollars 3.74m. This was less than its estimate, and much less than the Dollars 7m that Saatchi had been asking for it privately, but he will have shown a profit on the picture. A work by Johns made Dollars 2.3m and one by Pollock Dollars 1.98m. Both sold below estimate but at least the owners, who probably paid comparatively little for the paintings in the 1970s, were prepared to risk exposing them at auction. Prices for top quality impressionist and contemporary art have fallen by about 40 per cent and are back to the levels of around 1988. But good pictures now attract interest. In London an important Kandinsky abstract made a solid Pounds 5.5m, the first time a modern work has broken the Pounds 5m barrier since the market collapsed. And although the first major work by Francis Bacon to appear since his death was well below the Pounds 1m target, its price of Pounds 735,000 would be regarded by many as fair. If sellers are prepared to accept lower estimates on their works, there is now a market. But many owners are still chasing the prices of the late 1980s. This is particularly true of British art, which is bought mainly by British collectors and which mirrors the depressed state of the economy. A Turner Venetian watercolour, which had set a record for an English watercolour of Pounds 440,000 in 1988, was unsold last month, with bids failing to reach Pounds 400,000. Despite such setbacks, signs of an upturn in the art market are now reaching the dealers and auction houses. In recent months, closures have become rarer and trade is picking up. The 17 dealers in London's Cork Street stayed open for a weekend last month and enjoyed a high level of interest. One, Leslie Waddington, sold Pounds 250,000 worth of art; another, the Redfern, 20 works. The Bill Jackson Gallery was visited by 2,000 people. Eskenazi, an oriental dealer, opened an exhibition of rare Chinese lacquer on Monday and has already sold three pieces to museums, with three more reserved. Like the economy at large the art market's recovery is likely to be hesitant and fitful. But as Christmas approaches, the mood is considerably more cheerful than it has been for the past two years.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Spanish PM tries to limit the damage High-level corruption and financial misdemeanours appear set to keep the centre-stage in Spanish politics. New parliamentary committees are being set up to investigate party funding and the financial affairs of Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain. Facing acute embarrassment and pressure for heads to roll over the latest controversies, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, has tried to limit the damage to the minority socialist government's reputation through a series of new anti-corruption measures. These include establishment of a special prosecutor's office, tougher penalties for offenders, and increased powers for the audit tribunal, which monitors public sector accounts. The scope of rules obliging senior officials to declare their personal interests will also be widened. At the end of an angry two-day state-of-the-nation debate on Wednesday, the government narrowly avoided a special parliamentary investigation into the so-called Filesa affair, involving alleged illegal contributions to party funds through a group of companies in the late 1980s. Instead, a parliamentary committee will investigate the funding of all parties since 1979, when the first elections were held under Spain's current democratic constitution. A separate committee will look into the business dealings of Mr Mariano Rubio, Bank of Spain governor from 1984 to 1992. He was interviewed by prosecutors earlier this week about allegations that he channelled profits from stock investments into a secret account hidden from the tax authorities. Mr Rubio has said he was 'not aware' of holding a secret account or cheating the taxman. Another committee is already investigating Mr Lus Roldan, former head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, in a controversy involving alleged commissions on building contracts and payments from so-called 'reserved' funds. Parliament voted on Wednesday to bring these reserved funds under its own control rather than that of ministers. The series of allegations and the government's belated response in proposing a crackdown on corruption has put Mr Gonzalez clearly on the defensive. A poll commissioned by El Mundo, the investigative anti-government daily which published the latest allegations in the Rubio affair, showed yesterday that almost 57 per cent of respondents considered him responsible and 46 per cent thought he should resign. A majority of almost 60 per cent, including a large proportion of Socialist voters, sought the resignation of Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister at the time Mr Rubio held office and now the leader of the Socialist parliamentary group.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: BTR Nylex disposes of adhesives subsidiary BTR Nylex, an Australian subsidiary of BTR of the UK, yesterday said it had sold ACI Hong Kong, its adhesives business in the colony, to National Starch and Chemical for about ADollars 17m (USDollars 11.8m) Mr Alan Jackson, chairman of both BTR and BTR Nylex, said the sale was in line with the group's strategy of disposing of peripheral businesses. 'ACI no longer fitted because BTR is moving (to) high-tech industries,' he said. National Starch is a subsidiary of Unilever, the US chemicals group. It makes adhesives, resins, speciality chemicals and starches. BTR Nylex reported a net profit of ADollars 182.5m for the six months to June 30, compared with Dollars 151m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Mr Jackson said the company had a strong balance sheet and was poised to 'burst forth in the 1990s'.</p>

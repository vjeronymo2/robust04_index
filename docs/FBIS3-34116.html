Our correspondent told us that Israel asked  for the postponement for two reasons:    1. To try to hold secret talks with Syria parallel to the  Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo. The [London-based] AL-HAYAH  reported this, citing Syrian sources. It said the Israeli  negotiators have asked for secret negotiations, but the Syrians  have been categorically rejecting any secret contacts or any  departure from the course of the negotiations as established in  Madrid and continued in Washington.    2. To take a break to assess the results of Geneva summit  between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad.    These two reasons have been confirmed, as our correspondent  told us in a direct telephone call this morning. He added a  third reason:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The two reasons  have been confirmed, and our radio has learned of a third  Israeli reason for the postponement: Raising the level of  representation at the next round of talks. During their  meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres asked U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to try to get the  concerned Arab parties, especially Syria and Lebanon, to raise  the level of negotiations. [end recording]    Our correspondent said that no official date for the  resumption of the 12th round of peace talks has been fixed. The  negotiations will resume on 15 February at the chief delegates'  level.    What did the State Department spokesman say?    [Begin correspondent recording] A State Department spokesman  said that after consultations with the concerned parties, the  cosponsors of the peace process proposed suspension of the peace  talks being conducted at the chief delegate level for a short  time to give the parties enough time to consult with their  governments. The negotiations will resume on 15 February with  the same format--at the chief delegate level.    The truth, however, is that the U.S. announcement is based  on  an Israeli request. Heads of the Arab delegations, therefore,  are dissatisfied. In our conversations with them, the heads of  the Lebanese and Syrian delegations did not show any enthusiasm  for the decision, and they initially decided to stay in  Washington during the hiatus and to contact their governments by  telephone and facsimile.    The U.S. State Department spokesman ruled out the  possibility  that a tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is imminent. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

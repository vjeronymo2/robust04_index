			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Focus will be on core businesses THE ICI left behind after spinning off Zeneca is the world's sixth largest chemical group, with sales of more than Pounds 8bn a year. It still manufactures a large range of products: from bulk petrochemicals to high-performance plastic films, from chlorine and caustic soda to paint and explosives. However, the range of activities is likely to be much narrower by 2000. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the new ICI, says the company 'is going to focus during the 1990s on areas where we can be successful globally'. That will mean continuing the process, started two years ago, of selling or closing down activities in which ICI is not one of the world's top three companies. The UK-based petrochemical (olefins and aromatics) and chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) businesses are high on the disposals list. 'The decision taken in the early 1980s to restrict petrochemicals and chlor-alkali to Europe turned out to be wrong,' says Mr Hampel. 'The error of judgment was to believe that the industry could be operated on a regional rather than a global basis.' He believes that the world petrochemicals industry is about to undergo large-scale restructuring, which will end up with about five global groups manufacturing on an integrated basis from oil and gas feedstocks to finished plastics. ICI is not going to make the investment required to be one of them. Another error of the 1980s, as ICI moved away from bulk commodity chemicals, was to expand into too wide a range of higher value-added products. That too will be corrected, Mr Hampel says. 'Some businesses in the portfolio will not survive. Those that are not global or not making an adequate return on capital must go.' The global businesses on which ICI will be relying for growth to make up for cuts elsewhere include: Paints. ICI is the world's largest paints manufacturer and, with its Dulux and Glidden brands, is particularly strong in decorative finishes. Explosives. The 1990 acquisition of Atlas in the US made ICI the undisputed global leader in explosives. The products are used mainly in mining and quarrying, although ICI hopes that safety airbags for cars will represent a fast-growing new market: a mini-explosion of sodium azide fills the bag with gas in the event of a crash. Chlorofluorocarbon substitutes. Although ICI is losing revenue through the global phase-out of CFCs to protect the ozone layer, it is investing heavily in ozone-friendly hydrofluorocarbons to replace them. The leading substitute HFC134a will be manufactured in the UK, US and Japan. Specialised plastics. By swapping ICI Fibres for Du Pont's acrylics division, ICI became the world's leading producer of acrylics. It is also strong in polyurethane foams and polyester films. The paints and explosives businesses have traded steadily through the recession. During the three years from 1990 to 1992, sales have held at about Pounds 1.6bn a year for paints and Pounds 550m for explosives, while profits were Pounds 115m for paints and Pounds 55m for explosives. The outlook for both divisions is for slow, steady growth in turnover and profits. In contrast, the remaining parts of ICI - materials and industrial chemicals  -have suffered a decline in sales and profits. They made a trading loss of Pounds 42m on Pounds 5.4bn turnover in 1992. There is an opportunity for a sharp revival in profits as the world economy recovers, but analysts see no prospects of the exceptional returns in the late 1980s. Mr Hampel says ICI will inevitably remain an essentially cyclical company, but his long-term aim is to achieve on average a 20 per cent return on capital employed. The other executive directors of ICI will be Mr Chris Hampson, Mr Rob Margetts and Mr Colin Short. Non-executives will be Sir Anthony Pilkington, Miss Ellen Schneider-Lenne and Mr Paul Volcker.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES: DEMERGER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 30, 1992: demerger plan announced Jan 1, 1993: completion of separate corporate structures Feb 25: demerger and rights issue confirmed April: Zeneca pathfinder prospectus to be issued mid-May: rights issue to be underwritten; formal demerger proposals go to shareholders late-May: EGM votes on demerger early June: Zeneca rights issue; shares start trading  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------- ICI  ----------------------------------------------- Balance sheet (Pro forma Dec 31, 1992)  ----------------------------------------------- Net debt (pounds)                   600 million Shareholders' funds (pounds)        4.0 billion Gearing (%)                                  15  ----------------------------------------------- Employees                               73,600* Headquarters                Millbank, London UK  ----------------------------------------------- *After planned job cuts  -----------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------- ZENECA  ----------------------------------------------------------- Balance sheet (Pro forma Dec 31, 1992)  -----------------------------------------------------------                                 Pre-rights     Post-rights  ----------------------------------------------------------- Net debt (pounds)              1.7 billion     400 million Shareholders' funds (pounds)   300 million     1.6 billion Gearing (%)                            567              25  ----------------------------------------------------------- Employees                                          31,400* Headquarters                           Millbank, London UK  ----------------------------------------------------------- *After planned job cuts  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Tees and Hartlepool was last years most acrimonious trust-port privatisation TEES and Hartlepool, the UK's second-biggest port, was the first and most acrimonious of the five trust-port privatisations that took place last year, Rachel Johnson writes. Its Pounds 180m sale to Teesside Holdings provoked controversy because it went neither to its managers and employees nor to the highest bidder. Mr Charles Lloyd of Price Waterhouse, who advised the government on the sale of the trust ports, said it was difficult to assess the extent to which privatisation had been a commercial success. 'The recession has diminished tonnages and it will take several years to see whether privatisation has had a material impact on performance,' he said. Teesside Holdings announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m in the 12 months to April, but said the profit could not be compared with the previous year's Pounds 9m because the sale of the port had altered its financial structure. Turnover was up 10 per cent. The sale to the private sector has left the port's new owners much freer to invest in improvements such as warehousing and other dockside facilities. But last November Teesside lost a valuable contract to import and export cars for Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer with a Sunderland plant.</p>

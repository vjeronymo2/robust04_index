As was reported by Aleksandr Karpov, deputy  governor of the oblast, the electoral commissions did not remove  any of the aspirants and nominated candidates from the  preelection race. All of them have been registered and are  continuing the preelection campaign.    Despite the fact that the legislative assembly of the oblast  will have very limited powers, a lot of people were found who  want to become deputies. Today, 106 candidates are aspiring to  25 deputy seats, and in a district of the Volosovskiy Rayon,  eight aspirants are campaigning simultaneously for one seat.    Preparation for the elections to the municipality are also  moving ahead at full speed. The candidates are also displaying  activeness here: There are 1,031 aspirants for 430 seats in the  preelection campaign. The sharpest rivalry of the candidates  developed in Slantsy, where 40 persons are vying for seven  seats. In addition, the voters in Shlisselburg will also have to  elect a new city mayor, who will replace his predecessor, who  was removed several months ago for various violations. In  addition to the ballots with the names of the candidates, on the  day of the forthcoming elections the residents of the oblast  will receive sheets for voting in the referendum on the by-laws  of Leningrad Oblast.    But the elections of representatives of a new type in the  localities of the oblast--elders--have already started, and 671  elders have been elected to date.</p>

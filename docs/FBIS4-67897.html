			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Satish Kumar] </F>   [Text] Dr. A.Q. Khan represents the national pride of  Pakistan. The story of his achievement is the story of  Pakistan's nuclear bomb, the story of how faith and  determination on the part of a nation can convert a dream into a  reality.    Dr. Khan was not an ordinary person, but his own country  took  time in recognising his talent. A highly qualified engineer in  physical metallurgy, and a specialist in uranium enrichment,  when he applied for a job in the Pakistan Steel Mills in Karachi  in 1967, he was rejected. He returned to Holland to pursue  further research in his field.    After India's nuclear explosion of May 1974, Dr. Khan wrote  to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offering to return to Pakistan. Mr.  Bhutto examined the background and experience of Dr. Khan and  encouraged him to return. When finally, in January 1976, Dr.  Khan accepted the offer and declared his intention to return,  Mr. Bhutto got excited, thumped his fist on the table, and said,  ``I will see the Hindu bastards now.''    The project was launched straightaway. An important element  in its implementation was the selection of an appropriate site  for establishment of the uranium enrichment plant. Dr. Khan and  his colleagues inspected a number of sites, viz. Haripur,  Tarbela, Hassan Abdal, Cambelpur, Fateh-Jang, Bannu, Kohat,  Sargodha and others. Finally, Kahuta, a few miles south-east of  Islamabad, was chosen because of being close to the capital,  located in the middle of the mountains, and somewhat isolated.    The accomplishment of uranium enrichment up to the desired  level has rightly been described as the story of a miracle by  Mr. Zahid Malik, a close friend of Dr. A.Q. Khan, and the author  of the book ``Dr. A.Q. Khan and the Islamic Bomb.'' The story  began in August 1975 when the Pakistan Embassy at Brussels  enquired about high frequency inverters from a company in  Holland. These highly sensitive electronic instruments control  the spinning of the centrifuge and Pakistan procured them from  at least four countries.    Western authors who have been trying to chase Pakistan's  nuclear weapons programme admit that tracking these Pakistani  purchase was difficult detective work. The purchasers' expert  handling of secret purchases and their daring and expert actions  always placed then one step ahead of the foreign detective and  secret agencies deployed to stop the supply of nuclear materials  to Pakistan. In the business of nuclear equipment which has  billion of dollars worth of black market, nobody in 1978 knew  what Pakistan was up to. Regular purchases had started in 1976.    In March 1979, the CIA informed the U.S. government that  Pakistan was commissioning the centrifuge plant for the  production of weapon-grade uranium and that the already  installed inverters were sufficient for ten thousand centrifuges  enough to produce one hundred and fifty kilograms of enriched  uranium per year. This was sufficient for six to seven nuclear  bombs. America immediately took up this matter through its  Ambassador. The economic aid that was to be given to Pakistan  in April 1979 was gradually reduced and finally stopped  completely.    Pakistan's dream of having a nuclear bomb goes back to the  days of the 1965 war, when it felt disillusioned by America's  suspension of military aid. About a year and a half to two  years after the war, a request was made by Pakistan for a  plutonium reprocessing plant to a French firm, SGN [expansion  unknown]. Within a few weeks of becoming the President and  Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto, on 20 January 1972 convened a meeting of selected  Pakistani scientists from home and abroad at Multan. At this  meeting, Mr. Bhutto stressed upon the scientists his wish for  Pakistan to be a nuclear power as soon as possible.    His chief scientific advisors, Dr. Abdus Salam and Dr.I.H.  Usmani declared it to be impossible because Pakistan did not  have the basic infrastructure. Mr. Bhutto would not take ``No''  for an answer. According to Mr. Bhutto's Press Secretary Khalid  Hassan, Mr. Bhutto decided to remove Dr. I.H. Usmani and  appointed Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan as the new Chairman of Pakistan  Atomic Energy Commission. According to Zahid Malik, Dr. Abdul  Salam and Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan further convinced Mr. Bhutto that  a reprocessing plant was necessary for the Pakistani bomb.  Therefore in 1972, Pakistan entered into negotiations and made  a formal request to France for the procurement of a reprocessing  plant. In March 1973, Pakistan entered into an agreement and  signed a contract with the SGN for the preliminary design of the  plant.    On 8 August 1976, U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger,  came to Pakistan and offered to supply 100 A-7 Corsair jet  fighters if it agreed to cancel the reprocessing plant deal. At  the same time, stoppage of all military and civil aid under  Symington amendment was threatened if it did not. In April  1977, Bhutto, while addressing the National Assembly, attributed  the political agitation against him to ``a certain power against  Pakistan.'' Later in 1977, when Mr. Agha Shahi was in Paris to  work out the modalities of executing the contract, the French  Foreign Minister offered to supply a ``Coprocessing Plant'' in  place of the Reprocessing Plant.''    In January 1978, President Carter again visited Paris and  held discussions with Mr. Giscard d' Estaing. Prior to his  departure for Paris, Mr. Carter had already granted landing  rights for the French ``Concorde'' at Kennedy airport. The  prospect of the sale of Concordes to the U.S. seemed more  lucrative to France than the sale of a reprocessing plant to  Pakistan. France began to yield to American pressure. On 5  June 1978, France finally decided not to execute the contract.    But Pakistan's efforts to acquire nuclear weapon capability  through the uranium route continued unabated. Pakistan acquired  this capability by the end of 1986 and found a way of announcing  it to the world in early 1987. Zahid Malik has taken great  pains to establish the point that Indian journalist Kuldip  Nayar's interview with Dr. A. Q. Khan on the basis of which  Nayar had written that Pakistan had already acquired the atomic  bomb was ``concocted.'' The interview which took place in  Islamabad on 29 January 1987 was published by the London  OBSERVER on 29 February. Mushahid Hussain who took Nayar to  A.Q. Khan's house has also been castigated. One wonders,  however, how a massive intrusion of this sort into a most highly  guarded secret domain of Pakistan could have taken place without  some official design behind it. More so, when the context was  the ongoing military exercise by India called the 'Brasstacks'.  In any case, General Ziaul Huq did not lag behind in announcing  to the world through a series of interviews particularly the one  with the TIME magazine in March 1987, that Pakistan had acquired  the nuclear capability.</p>

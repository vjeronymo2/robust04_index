			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Law Urged to Protect the Health of Workers"] </F>   [Text] Labour Ministry officials are pushing for a draft  law on occupational disease control in the wake of the many  serious cases of industrial dust pollution reported recently.    They also are urging an education drive to make workers in  enterprises, especially in foreign-funded and private ones,  aware of protecting their health, rights and interests through  current regulations.    Last year, more than 10,000 new industrial projects were  checked on occupational safety and hygiene, according to Lin  Xiaoning from the Labour Ministry.    Those factories which did not pass the examination have been  ordered to make improvements within a fixed time before going  into operation.    But Lin did not give the exact figure of the factories  failing to pass the check.    He complained that some enterprises and even local  governments had ignored poisonous dust and other materials that  brought great harm to workers' health.    A report by the local health department shows that at least  5,000 shoe workers are suffering from benzene poisoning in  Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. With 4,000 shoe producers, shoe  making is a major industry in the city.    The Beijing-based Health News reported that 72 to 73 per  cent  of the workshops in the city's shoemaking industry had benzene  density in the air beyond allowed limits.    A woman worker was killed by the poisonous air at a  privately- owned shoe heel workshop where four women worked in a  nine-square metre room. The consistency of benzene in the air  was found 20 times higher than the State standard.    The Beijing-based China Environment News also reported a  similar situation in the foreign-funded shoemaking industry in  Hainan Province.    It said the provincial government officials have decided  that  any projects likely to cause environmental pollution would not  be introduced into the country's largest special zone any more.    The capital city of Beijing is also not exempt from the  problem.    The municipal government has promised to help check  poisonous  dust in foreign-funded enterprises.    According to Lin Qiu, Deputy Director-General of the Beijing  Labour Bureau, the health of about 100,000 workers is affected  by poisonous dust in local enterprises.</p>

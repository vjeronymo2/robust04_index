			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway desperate to head off slide in oil output Norway's Labour government is proposing a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities and stem a steep decline in crude oil production after 1996. The country is western Europe's biggest oil producer with daily output of 2.4m barrels, and is the fourth biggest crude oil exporter in the world. Oil companies argue the best way to boost activities is to ease the stringent tax regime. But in a White Paper presented last Friday to the Storting, Norway's parliament, the controversial tax issue went unmentioned. In the White Paper, the government recommended that exploration acreage be expanded by 16 per cent and rules for exploring in the Barents Sea be reformed to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries. A number of proposals were made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Environmentalists and fisherman fiercely oppose the move to expand exploration to the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern coast of Norway, and to new areas of the Norwegian Sea, off the coast of mid-Norway. Under the proposals, in the Skagerrak, just four exploration wells will be allowed to be drilled; only one rig will be allowed to work in the area at a time; and, drilling during the summer - peak harvest season for prawns - has been ruled out. In the Norwegian Sea, six wells will be allowed in the Nordland VI area during a limited period of the year with just one rig operating at a time. In the Barents Sea, where 52 wells have so far failed to yield any commercial discoveries, changes to licensing conditions have been proposed to cut the cost of exploring there. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only will output decline dramatically in two years time, from a peak of 2.6m barrels a day, but the country is also faced with stiffer competition for oil company investment. Last year Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat exploration wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. . . an 'unsatisfactory result', says the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, and far less than in the previous two years. Investment in the petroleum sector is forecast to fall dramatically in two years from about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1993 unless new oil fields are discovered. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing 40m tonnes for those now being developed. Blocks located within the new acreage are to be offered for licence application by the beginning of next year, with award by the start of 1996. This timetable, says the government, could enable development to commence by 2005 with first production in 2010.</p>

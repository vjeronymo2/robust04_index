			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Brown hits at Tory policy on jobless Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday said that Britain would be the only country at the jobs summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations next week to press a policy of industrial de-regulation. 'The philosophy toward the unemployed of 'pile them high and sell them cheap' - the exclusive reliance on de-regulation dogma - has not worked and will not work,' Mr Brown said. He said the government was still 'trying to export de-regulation at the moment - at a time when even America has rejected it'. Mr Brown accused the government of behaving like 'wreckers' in opposing proposals for co-ordinated action on economic growth and job creation across the western world. He said British ministers were 'negative and carping' towards an investment strategy to reduce unemployment, and were pandering to the free-market policies of the Tory right wing. Mr Brown was commenting on the government's jobs strategy before a G7 summit in Detroit next week hosted by President Bill Clinton. The summit - which will be attended by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary - reflects the Clinton administration's determination to look for concerted solutions to the rising level of unemployment in the developed world. The shadow chancellor plans to be in Washington on the eve of the summit to promote Labour's ideas for a G7-wide approach to unemployment problems. In particular, he will be calling for: A pan-European cut in interest rates and the creation of a European Recovery Fund. The rejection of de-regulation as a 'miracle cure' and the adoption of policies to increase employer and employee investment in training. A series of fresh jobs initiatives, including the waiving of National Insurance con-tributions for employers who take on the long-term unemployed and the creation of a transnational University for Industry.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Exodus of Names from Lloyd's slows NAMES ARE leaving Lloyd's of London at a far slower rate than expected, according to a senior member of the insurance market's governing council. About 1,600 Names, the individuals who provide capital to underwrite insurance risks, are expected to leave at the end of this year, compared with almost 4,000 who resigned in 1991. That would leave Lloyd's with just over 20,000 Names next year. Members of the governing council are becoming increasingly optimistic about the market's prospects as they await the outcome of a poll of Names, which is in effect a vote of confidence in the council. Voting ends at noon on Friday and the result should be known that afternoon. Names are voting on several resolutions, including a proposal from a dissident group to rescind the levy imposed in June to top up Lloyd's central fund, which aims at ensuring that the insurance liabilities of bankrupt Names are met. It would be an embarrassment to the council if Names voted to rescind the levy. However, the senior council member said that such a vote would have a symbolic effect only as it is impossible for the Pounds 500m raised with the levy to be returned. 'It could, however, prevent us from making further such levies.' Meanwhile, it emerged that the exodus of Names would lead to a reduction in the market's underwriting capacity from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 9bn. But Lloyd's has taken some special measures to boost the amount of business that an individual can underwrite for a given stock of capital to offset the affect of the Names' resignations. The effect of these measures could be to maintain the market's underwriting capacity at Pounds 10bn. The council is also pleased that the average underwriting capacity for each Name is rising, from Pounds 340,000 in 1988 to Pounds 455,000 this year and an estimated Pounds 500,000 next year. It believes this shows that only individuals with the appropriate financial resources are continuing to participate in the market. The council also believes that the market's productivity is improving. Its ratio of overheads to income appears to have risen because of costs associated with redundancies, but it is convinced that underlying running costs are falling. One reason for this is a reduction in the number of syndicates, which pool Names resources. Smaller syndicates are being absorbed by larger ones, leading to economies of scale.</p>

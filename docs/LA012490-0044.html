			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI PROPOSES ANTI-GRAFFITI REWARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles residents would receive $1,000 rewards for providing information  leading to the conviction of graffiti vandals and people who illegally dump  trash under an ordinance proposed Tuesday by Councilman Ernani Bernardi.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he modeled his proposal after a similar ordinance enacted 1 1/2  years ago in Palmdale, where three residents have been awarded the money for  reporting graffiti offenders, Palmdale city officials said.  </P> <P> "We need to try and utilize every tool we have to fight graffiti," Bernardi  said. "This certainly is an idea worth exploring."  </P> <P> The details of the proposed ordinance or the source of the reward money fund  has not yet been determined. Bernardi said he included trash-dumping in the  proposal because like graffiti, it too "disfigures many communities."  </P> <P> The Bernardi motion will be studied by the City Council's Public Safety  Committee.  </P></p>

He  emphasized in an interview with INTERFAX that this was likely to  happen unless Russia ceased to use force and blackmail and  started to use diplomacy and negotiations in its relations with  the mountain nations.    He thinks that Russia is encouraged in its ill-conceived  North Caucasian policy by "certain quarters in the West who want  Russia to disintegrate and lose statehood."    Dudayev believes that the abundance of weapons and  uncontrolled militias had contributed to making the region  unmanageable. This situation affects Russia itself.    He said that "weapons are moving from the Caucasus into the  depths of Russia where armed fascist and nationalist bands are  formed."    In Dudayev's view, "this complicated situation is likely to  aggravate, making a new Caucasian war possible. Those in the  Russian leadership who play into the hands of the West and lead  Russia to a collapse while making a lot of noise about keeping  it united and indivisible have a significant role to play in  this process."    He said that Chechnya was prepared to look, jointly with  Russia, for ways to stabilize the Caucasus.</p>

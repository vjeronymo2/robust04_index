			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: TEXACO STRESSES THE 'SHARE' IN 'SHAREHOLDERS'  </P> <P> Texaco -- the big oil company that in the last two years has endured  bankruptcy, a $3-billion lawsuit settlement and sale of about $5 billion worth  of its assets -- made really important news the other day.  </P> <P> At the suggestion of the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of  its major shareholders, Texaco appointed a new director to its board -- John  Brademas, president of New York University and formerly a powerful member of  Congress.  </P> <P> Why is that news? Because it establishes a precedent of pension fund  shareholders acting directly to influence policy in a major company and thus  marks an evolutionary step in the development of U.S. corporations. It could  well be a healthy development, leading to greater stability and long-term  investment vision among U.S. corporations.  </P> <P> But a bit of background is needed to understand why. For years the stock of  America's companies has been increasingly owned by the retirement funds of  other companies, state and local government agencies and nonprofit institutions  such as universities and hospitals. Employees, in other words, own American  business. Which was precisely the intent of one of the originators of the  pension system Charles E. Wilson, a president of General Motors. In 1950 --  according to "The Unseen Revolution," by Peter F. Drucker -- Wilson devised a  plan for an employee pension fund that would invest in the common stock of  other corporations.  </P> <P> The idea caught on. Within a year after Wilson introduced his plan at GM, 8,000  similar pension funds were set up. And today, according to Columbia  University's Center for Law and Economics, the pension funds have almost $1.8  trillion invested, own more than 20% of all the company stock in the land and  more than 33% of the 50 largest corporations. They are potentially what Wilson  saw them as, a great, stable and democratic source of financing for U.S.  industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Cooperative Spirit  </P> <P> But only potentially. Unfortunately, as the pension funds grew they acquired a  reputation as indifferent owners that sold company stock at the first sign of  faltering profit, and that jumped at buyout offers from corporate raiders.  Studies showing massive short-term trading by pension funds reinforced that  reputation, and the irony emerged of an employee ownership system being cursed  for putting employees out of work.  </P> <P> By contrast, Texaco's agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement  System (CALPERS) is being hailed as evidence of a new cooperative spirit. Dale  Hanson, chief executive of CALPERS which owns 763,200 Texaco shares, had asked  Texaco President James W. Kinnear last spring for the right to nominate a  director and otherwise press shareholder concerns. Texaco, of course, had made  mistakes costly to shareholders, among them its takeover of Getty Oil which had  resulted ultimately in bankruptcy and a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil. Even as  Hanson and Kinnear conferred last spring, Texaco faced a proxy fight from  takeover artist Carl C. Icahn -- so Kinnear agreed to Hanson's request.  Thereupon, CALPERS and other pension funds backed management in the proxy  fight, and on Monday, Texaco management kept its part of the bargain by  nominating Brademas to the board.  </P> <P> The stock market was immediately displeased, seeing management-shareholder  cooperation as lessening chances of a renewed takeover battle for Texaco, a  company that according to several analysts is now rich with cash and oil  properties worth more than the market price of its stock. Texaco's stock fell  at news of the agreement.  </P> <P> Is the market perspective correct? Will cooperation condemn shareholders to  undervalued stock and eliminate chances for takeover bonanzas? No, of course  not, says Hanson of CALPERS, which has $47.2 billion in pension assets and  share ownership in more than 1,300 companies. "We'll consider all offers," he  says -- while being careful to separate real offers from illusory ones, like  Icahn's, with more talk than money behind them.  </P> <P> Texaco, for its part, is going to make a distribution to shareholders of $1.7  billion, or $7 a share, to make up for dividends they lost during its  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The reality is that increased participation by major shareholders could produce  more intelligent communication between owners and managers and a vast  improvement on the jumpy, nervous system of today. In any event, we'll see more  of it.  </P> <P> Having won their point at Texaco, the big pension funds such as CALPERS are  sure to carry their quest for direct influence to other big companies.  </P> <P> The special irony is that it was the same Texaco, with a 1984 blunder, that  sparked the new shareholder activism. At that time, with Texaco selling for  about $35 a share, the wealthy Bass brothers of Ft. Worth started buying the  stock.  </P> <P> Texaco's management at the time, fearing a takeover move, paid the Bass  brothers $50 a share to sell their stock and go away. CALPERS and other pension  funds were enraged at such "greenmail," and thereupon formed the Council of  Institutional Investors to fight for their interests.  </P> <P> Their first big victory was Brademas' appointment on Monday by Texaco --  corporate America's unwitting pacesetter.  </P></p>

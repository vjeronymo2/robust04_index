			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont warns PM on 'short-termism' MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday warned the prime minister that his government would not survive unless it concentrated on credible policy objectives and stopped making decisions for short-term presentational reasons. In an electrifying resignation statement to a crowded Commons, Mr Lamont also revealed that the prime minister had vetoed his attempts to give the Bank of England independent status with control over interest rate policy. The prime minister and his increasingly grim-faced frontbench colleagues listened attentively as Mr Lamont, in breaking the self-imposed silence he has observed since being sacked 10 days ago, condemned the government for allowing opinion polls and Conservative party managers to exercise too much influence over its actions. Mr Lamont insisted: 'In politics you should decide what is right and then decide the presentation - not the other way round. 'Unless this approach is changed, the government will not survive - and will not deserve to.' After recalling his leading role in securing Mr Major's appointment as prime minister in succession to Mrs (now Baroness) Thatcher, Mr Lamont said he still believed that he had made the right choice. In a passage addressed directly to the prime minister he stressed that the over-reliance on opinion polls went to the heart of the way in which the government conducted itself and resulted in too much short-termism. Mr Lamont said: 'We give the impression of being in office but not in power. Far too many important decisions are made for 36 hours' publicity.' Dealing with his decision not to resign after Black Wednesday, when sterling was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism, he revealed that Mr Major 'made it clear to me in writing that he had no intention of resigning himself and that I should not do so either'. The prime minister had told him that he regarded 'attacks on his chancellor as coded attacks on himself'. Mr Lamont emphasised that membership of the exchange rate mechanism had been the policy of the whole government, and that he had played no part in the original entry decision made in 1990 by Lady Thatcher, Mr Major - the then chancellor - and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. While admitting that he would probably not have supported sterling's entry into the ERM in 1989 he said he had not believed then that a fixed exchange rate system was doomed to break up. 'Those who hold that view presumably blame Lady Thatcher for commiting us to a policy that was bound to fail, but I do not take that view now, and I did not then,' he said. He explained that on becoming chancellor in 1990 he believed that membership of the exchange rate mechanism could be made to work, and that he had done all he could to make it work. The former chancellor told the House: 'It certainly did enable us to get inflation down dramatically. Indeed, without the ERM, I doubt whether the government would have had the courage and determination to get it down.' The ERM policy, he said, had broken down because German policy developed in a way which he believed to have been mistaken and which had not been anticipated, not least when German interest rates were raised last year. The restrictive effect had caused him increasing concern last summer, and he had put the idea to the prime minister that sterling's membership of the ERM should be temporarily suspended. 'He made it clear that he did not want to do that. Probably he was right. I accepted it.' Mr Lamont acknowledged that it would not have made any difference because 'we would have been overtaken by the same events in September that ultimately hit us'. He defended his decision not to increase interest rates last summer in a bid to keep sterling in the ERM, maintaining it was not an option because of the position of the domestic economy. Mr Lamont said: 'I did not believe that it would have been credible, and I am sure that I was right.' He had not devalued within the ERM because it would have meant higher interest rates at a time when lower interest rates were needed. Mr Lamont said there should be no question of rejoining the ERM being on the agenda during the present parliament, and he welcomed statements already made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, expressing the same view. Mr Lamont urged the prime minister and the chancellor to accept that nothing would be more effective in establishing the government's credibility than making the Bank of England independent of the Treasury. 'It is my greatest regret that after two-and-a-half years of trying I have failed to persuade the prime minister of this essential reform,' he said. While confirming that he had been in general agreement with the prime minister on interest rate policy, Mr Lamont said he did not believe that even the timing of interest changes should be affected by political considerations. 'Interest changes should never be used to offset some unfavourable political event. To do so undermines the credibility of the policy and the credibility of the chancellor.' There was laughter from the opposition when in commenting on the cabinet changes after his dismissal, Mr Lamont said he wished the prime minister well and hoped that they would produce 'whatever advantage for him and the government that he intended'.</p>

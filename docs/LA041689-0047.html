			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: A TOUR OF ENDANGERED LANDMARKS  </P> <P> There is no rest for preservationists in Los Angeles, bombarded as they are by  conferences and crises.  </P> <P> Several thousand are expected to gather here this week at the 14th annual  California Preservation Conference to review the movement's successes and  challenges.  </P> <P> Scheduled at the historic Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles are the usual  symposiums to discuss the finer points of restoration, rehabilitation and  recycling; the latest twists and turns in local land-use laws and landmark  ordinances, and the drift of funding for preservation projects.  </P> <P> To lighten the proceedings, conference planners are offering "L.A.'s Great Open  House," featuring 19 tours of historic sites and scenes. They include the El  Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park, the Long Beach and San Fernando  Valley ranchos, Hollywood Boulevard, the movie studios, and historic houses and  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Not scheduled but appropriate would be another tour, "Endangered Landmarks,"  reflecting some of the harsh realities of preservation today.  </P> <P> For despite the movement's achievements of the past decade and a rising public  appreciation of preservation, development and economic pressures continue to  mount, threatening historic buildings, districts and neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The tour would start downtown, along Broadway, a national historic district.  </P> <P> Many of the marvelous movie palaces there, exhibiting a range of exuberant  architectural styles that flowered in the 1910s and 1920s, are on shaky  financial grounds and worse for wear. A few simply aren't making it anymore and  are primed to be picked off by speculators interested more in the value of  their sites than the buildings.  </P> <P> The frail hope of such groups as the Miracle on Broadway is that the palaces  will be saved under some sort of cultural resources plan, to be used as a dance  gallery, rehearsal halls or small theaters to augment the Music Center.  </P> <P> Such a plan would only consume a small fraction of the public and private funds  earmarked for the center's latest expansion.  </P> <P> Also on the tour would be the Brockman Building and the former Coulter's Dry  Goods store, both of which lend a sense of history and scale to 7th Street  between Grand and Olive avenues.  </P> <P> This delicately detailed Romanesque-style commercial strip dating back 70 years  is threatened by a slickly packaged multi-use mega-project being planned by the  local office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill for the Japanese investment firm  of USA Pacific Atlas.  </P> <P> The next stop would be the southeast corner of Lafayette Park Place and 3rd  Street, for a glimpse of the ravaged McKinley Mansion, once a proud example of  the rich Italian Renaissance style. Its owner was stopped from brazenly, and  illegally, demolishing the structure over last New Year's weekend, but not  before inflicting serious damage and opening it up to vandalism.  </P> <P> Preservationists hope that the damaged mansion can be moved to a location where  it would be repaired and appreciated. Also obviously in need of repair are the  city's ordinances to protect such landmarks from illegal demolition and to  force the culprits to restore them.  </P> <P> Next on the endangered tour would be the Menlo Avenue National Historic  District, on Adams Boulevard in the North University Park area.  </P> <P> The district is a rare street, lined with gracious two-story Craftsman-styled  houses dating back to the turn of the century. Architectural delights, they are  the focus of a valiant restoration effort to bring some desperately needed  stability to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, under an ill-conceived and politically motivated plan, the city's  Community Redevelopment Agency is proposing to bulldoze much of the block to  make way for a Boys Market.  </P> <P> One would think that the site for the market could be adjusted to spare the  landmark houses or another found in a neighborhood pockmarked with  garbage-strewn vacant lots and liquor stores.  </P> <P> But apparently, local Councilman Robert Farrell wants the houses and their  community-conscious residents to go, and has pressured the CRA to contradict  its commitment to preservation as a tool for neighborhood renewal.  </P> <P> The tour, unfortunately, continues.  </P> <P> Among other stops is the Ambassador Hotel, Bishop Conaty High School, Queen of  Angels Medical Center, the Whittier Theater and half a dozen branch libraries.  Each is affected in some way by shifting economics, politics and public tastes  and needs.  </P> <P> Then there is the Ennis Brown House in Los Feliz, a Frank Lloyd Wright  masterpiece that is slowly crumbling for lack of funds for repairs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Getty Trust's architectural preservation program continues to  perfect its application process. Perhaps if the program, instead of being  housed in pricey office space, was relocated to the Ennis Brown House under a  leaking roof and above a shaky foundation, a way would be found to  expeditiously fund the repairs.  </P> <P> More generally endangered is no less than a quarter of the entire city of South  Pasadena; the Miracle Mile, both the commercial buildings along Wilshire  Boulevard and many of the fine, dated apartment complexes off it, and Bonnie  Brae Avenue, south of MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> In South Pasadena the culprit is a poorly planned freeway; in the Miracle Mile  and on Bonnie Brae Avenue, insensitive development, confused political  leadership and ineffectual city planning.  </P> <P> The list, and the tour, could go on and on.  </P> <P> Many communities may not have a particular landmark of historic interest that  is threatened, or indeed may not have a landmark at all. But their struggles to  preserve, in their buildings and landscapes a sense of time, place and pride  are to be encouraged.  </P> <P> It is these struggles for a livable city, built upon the fragments of the past,  that will set the agenda of the preservation movement in the coming years,  symposiums and tours not withstanding.  </P></p>

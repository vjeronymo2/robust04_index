Bush said the 28 states that already use competitive bidding in the  Women's, Infants' and Children's program have saved $300 million this year and  have been able to serve 500,000 more people. Bush signed the Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act on Air Force One while flying to Dallas for a  speech. The measure "will save an additional $40 million and allow 68,000 more  needy pregnant women, infants and children to participate in WIC," Bush said in  a statement. Bush said he is "firmly committed to helping nutritionally  deficient children obtain improved nourishment that will give them a better  start in life."  </P></p>

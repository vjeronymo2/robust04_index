			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTRAGE BOILS UP AS A KING'S IRON GRIP LOOSENS;  </P> <P> NEPAL: ANGRY DOCTORS TELL OF VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS. OFFICIALS NEGOTIATE WITH  THE NOW-LEGAL OPPOSITION.  </P> <P> Dr. Satyan Man Rajbhandari, his arm in a sling and the rest of his body badly  bruised, stood before two senior government ministers and nearly 100 of his  fellow doctors Tuesday night and described what happened the night that  democracy came to this remote Himalayan kingdom.  </P> <P> After him came another doctor, and then another. And sitting there listening to  all this, and to the cries of outrage that the accounts elicited, was King  Birendra's interior minister, Nain Bahadur Swanr.  </P> <P> It was an extraordinary display in a kingdom that has spent the last 30 years  under repressive rule. Never had Nepalese confronted their rulers in such a  way.  </P> <P> Tuesday's dramatic scene at the Nepal Medical Assn. was a taste of the future  for this impoverished nation of 18 million as it struggles to join the ranks of  new democracies.  </P> <P> "This is a very dicey period," said one diplomat here. "It's precisely this  mood of the doctors that adds to the uncertainty.  </P> <P> "We're not talking about a bunch of wild-eyed radicals. These are highly  educated professionals who were at the forefront of the pro-democracy movement.  And if the king fails to move fast now with reforms, these people will be back  in the streets and, the next time, the king may well not survive it."  </P> <P> The doctors told one another Tuesday night of the horrors they had faced on the  streets.  </P> <P> It was just one hour after Birendra's historic announcement Sunday night  declaring an end to the monarchy's monopoly on power, Rajbhandari recounted,  that he received an emergency call that his brother had been shot. The brother  had been among the throngs defying a curfew order to celebrate in the streets  and was cut down by soldiers who had not yet heard of Nepal's new age of  democracy.  </P> <P> "I rushed from the hospital, but when I reached the spot where my brother lay,  the police pulled me out of the ambulance, forced me to lie face-down on the  street and then kicked and beat me into unconsciousness," the doctor said.  </P> <P> "Shame! Shame!" the roomful of doctors shouted angrily in unison.  </P> <P> Dr. Bharat Pradhan, head of Bir Hospital's emergency room, told how he drove a  second ambulance to rescue his fallen colleague, only to be turned back by  soldiers who threatened to kill him if he tried to pass.  </P> <P> Finally, Dr. Lok Bikram Thapa, the hospital's chief surgeon, told the huge  gathering about his telephone call to Swanr, now seated just a few feet away.  </P> <P> "I appealed to the minister to order his police to allow our doctors through,  but the minister told me: 'You just shut up. You doctors are all troublemakers,  and if you don't stop your foolishness, I'll send the police to shoot you all  and burn down your hospital.' "  </P> <P> "Murderer! Murderer!" the doctors screamed at the minister seated before them.  "Fire the bastard."  </P> <P> Finally, Swanr stood up to defend himself, spending 15 minutes pleading for  forgiveness. But it was clear that the elation of the Nepalese over their  new-found democracy is not as powerful an emotion as their rage. When the  minister had left the room, the doctors voted overwhelmingly to reject his  apology. On Wednesday, they demanded that he resign.  </P> <P> In the days since the world watched hundreds of thousands of Nepalese dance,  chant and sing in the streets, the king's four handpicked Cabinet ministers  have been locked in intensive negotiations with the leaders of the country's  now-legal political parties. Their goal is to create a tripartite interim  government that will amend the constitution and schedule national elections.  </P> <P> But infighting has begun among the opposition parties that led the eight-week  protest movement, a disparate coalition of seven Communist parties and the  centrist Nepali Congress Party.  </P> <P> The Communist leaders are demanding that the king dissolve the rubber-stamp  National Assembly before they will join an interim Cabinet, while some Congress  Party leaders privately have indicated that they will join without any  conditions.  </P> <P> Negotiations are further hampered by a deep mistrust of the palace among  political leaders who were jailed for years after Birendra's father outlawed  party politics in a 1960 palace coup.  </P> <P> There is also sharp disagreement among the three factions about how to punish  the corrupt and abusive members of the hard-line Cabinet that Birendra fired a  week ago in a desperate bid to defuse the crisis. Loud chants calling for  former Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha to be hanged filled Katmandu's  streets during Monday's massive democracy celebration, indicating the depth of  sentiment for revenge. He had ordered police to open fire on demonstrators  during weeks of protest.  </P> <P> But senior government officials and independent analysts say that any extensive  investigation into public corruption and abuse of power would lead directly to  the king's palace, which is believed by most Nepalese to have been the real  power behind the appointed council of ministers.  </P> <P> In interviews with several senior Nepalese officials, it was clear that the  palace knows it has moved only halfway toward full democracy.  </P> <P> "We are all aware, including the king himself, that this is going to be a very  turbulent transition," the newly appointed foreign minister, Pashupati Shamsher  Rana, said in an interview Tuesday. "We are also aware that we have to  re-establish a lot of trust, and we have to restore the credibility of the  crown. But, clearly, the king has taken a very major decision. It is a major  shift in direction, so there is really no going back on that now."  </P> <P> It is equally clear, though, that the image of the king, a symbol of Nepalese  nationalism needed to protect the country's sovereignty from Indian influence,  has suffered badly during the eight weeks of pro-democracy protests.  </P> <P> The king, and to a greater extent, his wife, Queen Ratna, have been derided as  thieves or worse in slogans chanted in the streets. Nepalese from all walks of  life now believe that the queen and her family secretly have been running the  country from behind the king's robes for the past two years. Posters throughout  the city picture the king's mouth closed with a zipper held shut by a small  queen.  </P> <P> "The people themselves are trying to isolate the blame on the queen, in part  because everyone knows the monarchy is a necessary foil against interference  from our big southern neighbor," said a senior government official who asked  not to be identified by name.  </P> <P> There are other reasons to help explain the level of popular outrage.  </P> <P> "More than 90% of the population in Katmandu believes that the queen and her  family have stolen millions from the country," said a primary school teacher  who identified himself only as "a true democrat" at Monday's celebration rally.  "But we also blame the king for creating an entire cult of corruption  throughout our society."  </P> <P> However, the anger of the doctors, nurses and other medical professionals in  the capital is rooted in more than palace scandals and rumors of corruption.  </P> <P> After weeks of removing bullets, stitching up the gashes caused by riot sticks  and watching patients die as a result of the government's policy since February  of meeting protest with force, the hospital staffs organized their own  protests, which many analysts cited as the turning point for the pro-democracy  movement.  </P> <P> Their anger reached fever pitch Friday when police gunned down scores of  unarmed demonstrators as they began marching toward the palace gates. Several  government sources said that huge demonstration convinced the king that he was  politically cornered.  </P> <P> But the bloodshed also convinced the doctors at Bir Hospital that much more is  needed than the king's brief announcement Sunday legalizing political parties.  </P> <P> "We have only come halfway -- in fact, not even halfway," said a doctor in the  hospital staff room Tuesday. "Something has begun, and the people are waiting  to see where it will go, but no one is satisfied."  </P> <P> Another doctor added, "The world will forget what has come before here in  Nepal. It is always that way. But we will not allow the Nepalese to forget."  </P></p>

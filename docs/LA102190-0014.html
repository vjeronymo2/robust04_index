			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> *** ART BLAKEY AND THE JAZZ MESSENGERS "I GET A KICK OUT OF BU" SOUL NOTE  </P> <P> Ironic it is that the vaunted drummer's first domestic release in a couple of  years arrives within a week or two of his demise on Oct. 16. Sadly, this band,  captured in Milan in November, 1988, is not one of his best.  </P> <P> Still, it embodies a timeless Blakey aspect: He always allowed -- no,  encouraged -- his players to use the bandstand as a school to learn how to  play. That process is in action here, particularly via the performances of  trumpeter Philip Harper and saxman Javon Jackson, who consistently scuffle on  both medium tunes like "Yang" and the flag-waver, "I Get a Kick Out of You."  Trombonist Robin Eubanks seems more relaxed on his feature on "Lover Man" but,  for maturity, we turn to pianist Benny Green, who delivers one sizzling,  blues-drenched solo after another. When he plays, one shakes one's head in  agreement, rather than disappointment. ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

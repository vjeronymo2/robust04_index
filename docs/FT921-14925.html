			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UN team due in Croatia today THE first team of 50 United Nations observers arrives today in Croatia on a fact-finding mission aimed at deciding whether 10,000 UN troops will be deployed throughout the republic. The team, drawn from UN peace-keeping forces in the Middle East, will set up communications links between the Croatian, Serbian and federal army forces. One group of observers will remain in Croatia, and part of the second group is expected to be sent to the ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'The UN's first task will be to establish liaison groups between the three sides in the conflict,' said Mr Joao Mira Gomes, the deputy spokesman for European Community monitors based in Zagreb. 'The UN observers will then recommend to New York if the appropriate conditions exist for sending the blue helmets,' a western diplomat added. The federal army will today open a liaison office in Zagreb - in the same hotel as the EC - following an agreement reached at the weekend in Pecs, Hungary, between the EC, the army, and Croatia. 'This liaison office is necessary because there must be guarantees that the ceasefire agreement will hold, and the safety of the EC and UN observers can be ensured,' Mr Mira Gomes said. EC monitors do not want any repeat of last week's incident in which a federal army jet shot down an EC monitors' helicopter, killing all five members on board. Mr Mira Gomes said the UN observers will also work closely with the EC monitors to ensure the implementation of the latest ceasefire, which was forged by the UN earlier this month and which still appears to be holding. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's envoy to Yugoslavia, has insisted that a ceasefire is a precondition for deploying any UN troops. If deployed, the UN forces would be sent to three regions of Croatia, including the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, south-western Croatia. Deployment will be linked to the complete withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia, and the disarming of all Croat and Serb paramilitary units. But Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, is refusing to disarm his units. The thorny issue of EC recognition of the former Yugoslav republics will be the focus of deliberations this week, beginning with a meeting today in Lisbon of senior officials from Community governments. The decision on recognition depends on a report by Mr Robert Badinter, head of an EC arbitration commission, on whether the republics seeking independence have met human rights obligations. The report, originally due to be circulated to Community governments at the weekend, is now not expected to reach them until today, officials said. But Germany has already formally recognised Slovenia and Croatia, although in deference to its EC partners it has agreed not to implement its decision until tomorrow. The German Foreign Ministry yesterday said protocols would be signed in Ljubljana and Zagreb on Wednesday, changing the German consulates there into embassies. The Vatican yesterday also formally recognised Croatia and Slovenia, both of which are mainly Roman Catholic.</p>

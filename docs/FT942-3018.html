			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody receives Dollars 200m capital injection Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has received a Dollars 200m capital injection from its parent, General Electric, and has liquidated one third of its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in recent weeks. The moves appear designed to increase the company's financial flexibility and reduce its exposure to volatile bond markets. However, GE hinted that Kidder - whose profits last year jumped to Dollars 439m, after several disappointing years under GE's ownership - had performed poorly in recent months. Mr Dennis Dammerman, chief financial officer of GE, said that Kidder's performance 'so far in 1994 is well within GE's management's expectations considering this year's difficult environment for the securities industry'. Kidder chairman Mr Michael Carpenter revealed details of the company's capital increase and sale of securities in response to reports in the US that suggested the firm was under-capitalised and struggling with an illiquid securities portfolio. At the end of 1993, Kidder had just Dollars 778m of equity capital supporting a securities portfolio valued at Dollars 73bn. This made it substantially more highly geared than other Wall Street houses. However, unlike other houses it is backed a triple-A rated parent. Nor does it rely on its own balance sheet to raise funds cheaply in the capital markets, since it does not have a stand-alone credit rating of its own. The capital injection was made to plug the hole left by what Kidder has claimed were phantom trading profits of Dollars 350m reported by Mr Joseph Jett, former head of its government bond trading desk. Mr Jett has disputed Kidder's claims, saying that everything he did was with the full knowledge of senior Kidder executives. The Jett difficulties have since given way to concerns about Kidder's activities in the mortgage-backed bonds market, which has proved highly volatile since early this year. This market had been Kidder's biggest source of profits, with the bank handling 24 per cent of all new issues of bonds in the first quarter of this year. However, new issue volume during April and May, at around Dollars 10bn a month, was just a quarter of its level in January and February, according to Securities Data, leading to lower underwriting fees.</p>

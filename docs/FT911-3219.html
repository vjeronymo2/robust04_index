			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Olivetti suspends dividend as net profits fall sharply OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office-equipment group, suffered a severe fall in net profits last year to L60.4bn (Pounds 27.36m) from L202.8bn in 1989. It is suspending the dividend on its ordinary shares. The fall in profits, in line with the forecast made by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, earlier this year, reflects pressures facing Europe's computer manufacturers. The company blamed currency factors and a sharp fall in demand in Europe and the US for the decline in earnings. It said it would pay a dividend of L70 and L125 a share on its preference and savings shares, respectively. Olivetti is obliged to pay a minimum 12.5 per cent return on the L1,000 nominal value of its savings shares. Mr Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director, said sales in the first four months of this year were down 4 per cent compared with the same period in 1990. Turnover last year was L9,037bn against L9,031bn in 1989. Olivetti's ordinary shares fell by L101 to L3,769 at yesterday's Milan fixing, which took place before the results were announced. Savings shares declined L65 to L2,780. Mr Albert Alonzo, an Italian market analyst at Nomura, said the fall in profits was in line with expectations, while the share price had already discounted the earnings announcement. 'There's no room for a dividend when you're asking for financial support from the government', he said. Earlier this year Olivetti reached agreement with the government and unions on a package of job cuts and early retirement involving 7,000 workers. The restructuring costs for the layoffs resulted in a net extraordinary charge of L50bn against Olivetti's 1990 pre-tax profits, which fell to L124bn from L355bn in 1989. Analysts believe Olivetti has had some flexibility in accounting for job cuts announced last November. However, it says it has absorbed the full cost on the 1990 accounts. Olivetti said sales, administrative and general costs last year had been kept in line with 1989. Nevertheless, net indebtedness surged to L744.5bn from L406.6bn in 1989. Prospects for the current year would be overshadowed by increasingly unpredictable and uncertain market conditions, according to Mr De Benedetti. 'In this uncertain context, it is necessary to reduce structural costs and to rationalise production activities', he said.</p>

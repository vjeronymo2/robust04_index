			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 LEGISLATIVE SESSION: THE FINAL HOURS;  </P> <P> STATE BUDGET BILL DIES; COUNTY BRACES FOR CUTS;  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH  </P> <P> Counties lost a chance at an additional $25 million in mental health funds when  the Legislature adjourned early Saturday without passing a $146-million  spending bill, a development that leaves Los Angeles County bracing for a new  round of budget cuts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials say they had been counting on passage of the  budget bill to provide money to help prevent the shutdown of five mental health  clinics. Los Angeles County's share of the $25-million statewide allocation  would have been $7.3 million.  </P> <P> But state officials believe that Los Angeles County will still have enough new  state funding to help support its mental health programs. Under a bill passed  by the Legislature on Thursday to implement the Proposition 99 cigarette tax,  Los Angeles County would receive about $360 million for health programs, some  of which could be used to eliminate pressure for mental health program cuts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $2 Billion in Aid  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian noted during a press conference Saturday that counties  will receive about $2 billion in new financial aid from the state this year  when cigarette tax funds and other money is counted.  </P> <P> "The counties are receiving a tremendous amount of money this year," Deukmejian  said. As to whether the money will be used for mental health programs,  Deukmejian said, "that is going to be a decision that each county is going to  have to make for itself, depending on its own priorities."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County was counting on the additional mental health funds to make  up for earlier Deukmejian Administration mental health program cuts.  </P> <P> The $7.3 million would have been enough to prevent the closing of five mental  health clinics and forestall cuts in funding to dozens of privately operated  facilities, county mental health Director Roberto Quiroz said.  </P> <P> The county last June was forced to close three mental health clinics because of  a budget shortfall. County officials have warned that if no additional funding  is provided, five more mental health clinics will close, reducing the number  countywide from 28 a year ago to 20.  </P> <P> Despite the money in the pipeline, during its budget deliberations in June, the  Board of Supervisors provided enough money to keep the clinics open only until  Oct. 1.  </P> <P> However, "the latest round of cuts could cripple us," said Susan Mandel, past  president of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies and head of a  privately operated mental health clinic in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The county supervisors have complained that the state has required the county  to provide mental health programs without providing adequate funding.  </P> <P> In the absence of a state bailout, the county could keep the mental health  clinics by dipping into an estimated $14-million windfall in property tax  revenues discovered after approval of the budget. However, supervisors have  been reluctant to commit local funds to mental health, which they claim is a  state responsibility.  </P> <P> Douglas P. Shuit reported on this story from Sacramento and Richard Simon from  Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH TOY; INSTRUMENTAL IN L.A.'S GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Joseph Toy, 44, past president of Christopher Street West, the principal  sponsor of the two-decade-old annual Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Pride Festival  that last June drew 300,000 people and about 300 participating units to the  streets of West Hollywood. The nonprofit group -- named for the street in  Greenwich Village where 20 years ago police raided a homosexual bar, sparking a  demonstration and the birth of the gay rights movement -- each year awards more  than $100,000 to gay and lesbian support groups. Toy was an administrator for  the Automobile Club of Southern California when he died Monday of complications  of AIDS at a Long Beach hospital.  </P></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Major defends Tory record MR John Major, the prime minister, will today set the stage for the most closely fought British general election since 1974 by launching a vigorous defence of the government's economic record. With a final draft of his party's election manifesto completed late on Thursday night, Mr Major will tell a Conservative local government conference in London that the average citizen's lifestyle has improved immeasurably over the past 13 years. His stress on increased prosperity since the Conservatives' took power will be backed with figures showing the sharp rise in young people taking up places in higher education and the spread in ownership of consumer durables across the population. But the Labour opposition yesterday seized on BT's plans to cut 25,000 jobs to put rising unemployment under the political spotlight in the run-up to next week's Budget. At a hurriedly-called Westminster news conference, senior frontbenchers called on the prime minister to take 'the urgent action necessary' on training, jobs and investment. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, said 125,000 jobs had been lost since the New Year and independent forecasts now showed 400,000 more were at risk. Mr Major is expected to highlight the government's education policies and its new national lottery scheme, announced yesterday, as fresh evidence of its determination to extend choice and improve the quality of life. But the speech to some 300 Tory councillors is not intended to herald the general election campaign, now thought most likely to be announced on Wednesday - just 24 hours after a tax cutting Budget. His rallying call to the party is expected to come at Torquay next Saturday when Mr Major addresses the Tory Central Council. Government ministers were last night welcoming new figures showing a sharp reduction in Britain's current account deficit last year to its smallest annual shortfall since 1987. However, City economists were treating the figures warily, claiming the downward revision from a provisional Pounds 5.8bn to Pounds 4.4bn was the result of 'unsustainable' features that emerged in the fourth quarter of last year. Labour's warnings come as part of the opposition's strategy to 'box in' Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he puts the finishing touches to what is thought certain to be a tax-cutting budget. Labour strategists believe that even if the Budget were to include many of the measures the Opposition has been demanding, the government is vulnerable to attack for failing to act earlier.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Armenian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the  Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry yesterday. The message states:  Armenian Republic's rayon centers and settlements in  Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, Tavushskiy have been subjected to  unprecedented shelling by Grad launchers and long-range  artillery from Azerbaijan's Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons as of  1030 on 29 December.    Certain sectors along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border,  particularly Sisianskiy Rayon, were also subjected to artillery  shelling during the day.    Considerable material damage has been inflicted on these  rayons. Material destruction has been caused, and there are dead  and injured among the peaceful population.    Against the background of the large-scale offensive that was  launched against Nagorno-Karabakh on 21 December, Azerbaijan's  military operations cannot be interpreted as anything other than  a renunciation of the process of peaceful resolution of the  Karabakh problem and another attempt to drag Armenia into the  war.    The Armenian Foreign Ministry is making a firm protest to  the  Azerbaijani side, stressing that such a policy is dangerous for  the stability of the entire region and does not conform with the  position of the international community.    By rejecting the efforts of the CSCE's Minsk Group, the  peacemaking mediation of the Russian Federation, and the UN  Security Council resolutions, Azerbaijan has virtually isolated  itself from the international community.    By firmly rejecting such a political stance by the  Azerbaijani side, the Armenian Foreign Ministry is authorized to  declare that Armenia reserves the right to respond in a like  manner if these operations are repeated.    At the same time, we appeal to the sagacity of the  Azerbaijani side and call on it be realistic and resolve its  problems with Nagorno-Karabakh exclusively through peaceful  means and in conformity with the internationally accepted norms.</p>

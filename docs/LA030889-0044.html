			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3 SEX SHOPS AGREE TO MAKE CHANGES  </P> <P> Three San Fernando Valley sex shops have agreed to provide more indoor and  outdoor lighting, hire security guards and more closely monitor customers'  activities, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said Tuesday.  </P> <P> As a result, the city will drop a lawsuit filed in January in which it sought  injunctions against the stores under nuisance-abatement statutes, Hahn said.  </P> <P> Hahn said Le Sex Shoppes in North Hollywood, Studio City and Canoga Park have  been "neighborhood problem spots" where numerous arrests for lewd conduct have  been made in the past two years.  </P> <P> The Studio City shop is fighting closure on another front.  </P> <P> Under a city law requiring such shops to be at least 500 feet from residences,  the shop was scheduled to be closed at the end of March. However, the store's  owners filed a lawsuit challenging denial of an extension request and were  given permission to stay open until an April 14 hearing in Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P> <P> The city granted the other two shops three-year extensions of the March  deadline to allow them time to get out of long-term leases.  </P></p>

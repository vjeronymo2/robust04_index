			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Slack fuel demand hits Japan's gas companies - Utilities Japan's gas utilities were hit by sluggish demand for fuel during the exceptionally hot summer and a cut in charges in order to pass on the benefits of the strong yen to consumers. The companies reported sharp falls in household demand as families refrained from cooking hot meals due to the record temperatures, and overall use of hot water fell. Tokyo Gas, Japan's largest city gas supplier, fell into the red, posting a half-year recurring loss - before extraordinary items and tax - of Y4bn (Dollars 40m), on a 5.7 per cent decline in sales to Y347bn. The company reported after-tax losses of Y4bn. Gas sales to households plunged 10.2 per cent while the rate cut hit sales by Y9.3bn. For the full year to next March, the company, which has more than 7.5m customers mainly in Tokyo and five prefectures, expects a 25.9 per cent fall in recurring profits to Y27bn on a 2.9 per cent decline in sales to Y802bn. Interim recurring profits at Osaka Gas dropped 88.5 per cent to Y1.3bn while sales fell 4.2 per cent to Y274.3bn. After-tax profits plunged 83.6 per cent to Y948m. Sales of gas to households fell 10.8 per cent, while industrial demand rose 8.7 per cent due to an increase in usage of gas-fuelled air conditioning. For the full year to next March the company expects an 18.1 per cent decline in recurring profits to Y31bn on a 2.9 per cent fall in sales to Y621bn. Osaka Gas is Japan's second largest city gas supplier, servicing more than 5.5m customers mainly in Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe.</p>

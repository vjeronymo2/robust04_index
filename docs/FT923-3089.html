			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Greek tourist group sells leisure facilities EOT, the Greek state tourist organisation, is to sell a hotel chain, six marinas and three casinos in the first large disposal of state-owned assets to be made in the government's two-year-old privatisation programme. Other Eot properties to be offered for sale will include two golf courses, on the islands of Corfu and Rhodes, and a dozen campsites around Greece. The Xenia hotel chain, with 50 properties, is to be broken up so that larger units in leading resort areas can be sold in a package with other assets, such as a marina, a privatisation official said. The government has appointed Arthur Andersen, the international accountants, to carry out a review of Eot's assets and plan a strategy for their disposal. Most of the hotels, leased to private Greek operators, run at a loss and are badly in need of refurbishment. The chain's overall debts amount to Dr400m (Dollars 2.2m). Eot holds a monopoly on marina and casino operations in Greece. Both are profitable, but considerable investment would be required to bring them up to the standards of similar facilities in the western Mediterranean, according to Eot officials. At a later stage, another eight marinas still under construction will be offered for sale. Eot also plans to issue up to 10 new casino licences to private operators. Meanwhile, the state-controlled Ionian Bank is seeking bids for the Athens Hilton, owned by its subsidiary, Ionian Hotels, and for a new Hilton nearing completion on Rhodes at a cost of Dr13bn.</p>

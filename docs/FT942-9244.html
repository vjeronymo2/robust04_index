			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Emu goalposts are still firmly in place Sir, Your report, 'Emu fans ready to move the goalposts' (May 12), risks perpetuating a myth about the Maastricht convergence criteria. To understand the treaty's provisions about public finance, it is necessary to appreciate that there are two relevant protocols, not one. The 60 per cent debt-to-GDP and 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratios are contained in the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure. The figures are 'reference values'. They form only part of the criteria to be applied. The treaty requires other factors to be taken into account by the Commission in deciding whether to invoke the excessive deficit procedure and by the council in determining whether there is an excessive deficit, if and when the procedure is invoked. The second protocol is on the convergence criteria. As regards public finance, this protocol merely requires that a state shall not be the subject of a council decision that it has an excessive deficit. It is to this protocol that the judgment of the German Constitutional Court refers in pointing out that the treaty only allows the criteria to be changed by a unanimous council decision, thus ensuring a German right to veto any weakening of them. This is clearly correct, but does not mean that the reference values have become rules. That would not be an interpretation of the treaty, but a rewriting of it. The treaty as it stands requires a highly complex exercise of judgment by the Commission and council and allows them a considerable margin of appreciation.

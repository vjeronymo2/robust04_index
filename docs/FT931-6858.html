			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indian company buys east German paper mill DALMIA, one of India's largest private companies, yesterday moved closer to establishing a bigger foothold in Europe following its purchase of a cellulose and paper mill in the eastern German state of Thuringia, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The purchase of Zellstoff-und Papierfabrik Rosenthal, which was arranged by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of east German industry, coincided with the visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to south-east Asia. The enterprise, which has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of sulphite and cellulose, and 6,000 tons for paper production, last year achieved a turnover of DM153m (Pounds 64.8m). Traditionally, its turnover was earned on the domestic market, but following a restructuring, which cost DM46m, sales to west European countries now account for 90 per cent of turnover.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo picks up as Hong Kong falls 2.2% Buying by public funds and arbitrageurs lifted prices during the afternoon session and the Nikkei 225 average gained 0.9 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 182.94 higher at 19,751.55. Investors were initially discouraged by Tuesday's sharp decline on Wall Street and the market saw a low of 19,487.70 briefly after the opening. However, a rise in futures prompted active arbitrage buying, while a rebound in Japan Telecom provided further support, and the Nikkei rose to a high of 19,752.55 just before the close. Volume remained below 200m shares for the third consecutive session, at 197m against 161m. Traders now expect most investors to remain absent ahead of the October 27 listing of Japan Tobacco. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 9.26 at 1,582.05, while the Nikkei 300 put on 2.39 at 289.89. In spite of the rise in the indices, losers led gainers by 491 to 478, with 212 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.72 at 1,300.27. Japan Telecom was ahead Y340,000 at Y4.14m after hitting a record low of Y3.73m in the morning. Some dealers had feared initially that investors looking to purchase Japan Tobacco stock would sell high-priced former state-owned companies' shares to raise funds. But NTT recovered Y15,000 to Y877,000 after a three-day fall, and East Japan Railway improved Y8,000 to Y483,000. Nippon Shinpan, a consumer credit company sold on Tuesday on fears of financial problems at its subsidiaries, rebounded Y27 to Y785. The company denied rumours that its finance affiliates were suffering from mounting bad loans. Paper and pulp issues were stronger on hopes of improving demand. Honshu Paper rose Y32 to Y650 and New Oji Paper added Y20 at Y1,020. High-technology stocks were mixed. Sony declined Y30 to Y5,770, but NEC rose Y30 to Y1,220 and Matsushita Electric Industrial firmed Y10 to Y1,580. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 6.30 at 21,969.28 in volume of 9.6m shares. Buying by public funds supported the index. Roundup There was a conventional response in the region to Wall Street's overnight losses, but several markets moved higher. HONG KONG was rocked by the US sell-off, the Hang Seng index losing 205.76 or 2.2 per cent at 9,298.36 as October Hang Seng futures broke down in the last 15 minutes of trading. Turnover expanded from HKDollars 3.19bn to HKDollars 3.60bn. Property shares again led the market down, with Henderson Land dropping HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 46.40 ahead of its results. Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 55.50 and Hysan Development HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 20.20. The mainland Chinese companies' H-share index fell 41.45 or 3 per cent to 1,326.07. However, SHANGHAI's A share index shed 11.1 per cent on plans to ban same-day settlement, closing 90.11 off at 723.37. SYDNEY blamed programme selling as the All Ordinaries index dipped 18.3 to 1,979.8. Turnover increased from ADollars 364.7m to ADollars 439m. News Corp recovered 4 cents to ADollars 8.10, dealers saying the media group had been oversold since announcing, last Friday, its intention to issue limited voting preference shares. SEOUL lost ground after three days of rises, the composite index closing 7.35 down at 1,057.24. The Finance Ministry announcement that it would raise the limit for foreign shareholdings on the market to 12 per cent from the current 10 per cent by December 1 failed to boost prices. WELLINGTON's NZSE 40 index shed 1 per cent for the second consecutive day, ending 22.49 lower at 2,035.01. Turnover picked up through the session and finished at NZDollars 42m. MANILA drew comfort from lower domestic inflation figures which helped the market to overcome a soft start. The composite index gained 19.7 at 2,973.31, but volume fell to 1.9bn shares from 3.2bn. Megaworld Properties and Holdings led gainers, closing 8 per cent up at 13.50 pesos on news of its link with another group to develop a 215-hectare property in Cavite. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on institutional bargain hunting and the composite index rose 8.06 to 1,133.72. KLI Holdings led activity, adding 40 cents at MDollars 6.00 on new projects totalling MDollars 4.8bn. KARACHI ended higher on demand for synthetics and selective blue chips on expectations of good annual results and increased dividends. The KSE 100-share index closed 13.91 higher at 2,324.67. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index, up 10.27 at 2,380.83, rose for the sixth consecutive session after a late revival of interest in property shares. In the property sector, CDL rallied 20 cents to SDollars 8.35 and DBS 4 cents to SDollars 4.94. JAKARTA firmed as local investors, net sellers in the run-up to Tuesday's launch of Indosat, the telecoms group, returned to the secondary market. The market index picked up 2.91 to 503.64.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material, is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris) is considered asbestos containing waste subject to &sect;61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material). EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with &sect;61.150.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste, provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions, prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material ``friable'' for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Waste Disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> A. Disposal Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with &sect;61.154 or to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with &sect;61.155. During the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> B. Waste Shipment Record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 4.B.1. For each load of asbestos waste that is regulated under the NESHAP, a waste shipment record (WSR) must be maintained in accordance with &sect;61.150(d). Information that must be maintained for each waste load includes the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

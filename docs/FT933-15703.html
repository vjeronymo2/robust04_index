			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hamper side behind 14% rise at Farepak Farepak, the USM-traded mail order distributor and food processor, achieved a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.51m in the year to April 30. Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. The Christmas hamper mail order business lifted sales 15.5 per cent and the total number of agents rose 13 per cent to 55,000. This division provides the bulk of pre-tax profits. The company was confident that its Pounds 8.5m investment in acquiring 20 year access to the mail order database of the Littlewoods Home Shopping Group and the acquisition of the Littlewoods Hamper Business in April this year meant that further strong growth was anticipated this year. A final dividend of 4.1p brings the total to 5.75p (5p).</p>

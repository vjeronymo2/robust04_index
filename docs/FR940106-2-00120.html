			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx represents that, as a general matter, the AUTOM system has functioned well, servicing member firms options orders. The Phlx states that two major groups of figures best reflect the performance of AUTOM: (1) The capacity figures; and (2) the order flow figures. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  First, the Phlx believes that information regarding AUTOM's system capacity shows that AUTOM continues to have the ability to service the volume of incoming orders. Specifically, the Phlx represented, in February 1993, that it would make enhancements to systems capacity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the ability of the system's hardware to properly route orders and service potential order volume) if order volume during peak time exceeded 80% of CPU capacity. The Exchange represents that since making these representations with respect to AUTOM's capacity, this 80% level has not been attained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from J. Keith Kessel, Staff Counsel, Phlx, to Monica C. Michelizzi, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated November 19, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Phlx also believes that an analysis of current customer order flow demonstrates that the system capacity is adequate to handle the current and potential number of orders transmitted through the system. Specifically, the Phlx represents that only about two-thirds of all orders placed on AUTOM are executed because the other one-third of the orders are too far away from the market to receive execution. The orders routed through AUTOM that receive execution are either automatically executed through Auto-X or are manually executed by the receiving Phlx specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Phlx believes that AUTOM continues to facilitate smooth and liquid markets on the equity options floor, and otherwise represents a favorable development for all concerned parties. The Phlx further believes that AUTOM has performed well, servicing member firms' options orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Phlx, therefore, believes that it is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder for the Commission to permanently approve the AUTOM system. Specifically, the Phlx believes that the current proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 11A. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation of the AUTOM system provides for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in Phlx equity options through the use of new data processing and communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time. The Commission also believes that the extension of the pilot program until December 31, 1994, will provide the Exchange with a better opportunity to study its operation and effectiveness prior to permanent approval of the program. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f and 78k&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Phlx is in the process of modifying and upgrading the computer system on which AUTOM operates. Before granting permanent approval or any further extension of the pilot, the Commission expects the Phlx to submit a full report, by November 1, 1994, describing the effect these modifications have had on the operation of AUTOM and updating the information, submitted to the Commission on November 24, 1993, which set forth the benefits provided by AUTOM, the degree of AUTOM usage, including the number and size of the orders routed through AUTOM and the number and size of the orders automatically executed through the Auto-X system, and the system capacity of AUTOM and Auto-X and any problems that have been encountered with the routing and execution features. The Commission also requests that the Phlx submit its request for an extension of the pilot or permanent approval by November 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

[passage omitted]    "Today the UNMOs (military observers) gave us reports of  very  significant withdrawal of Serb forces of the hills around  Sarajevo," UN Protection Force Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman  said.    "Up until now, the reports from the UNMOs have been of  individual vehicles and pieces of equipment. Today, they're  talking about convoys of equipment moving out of the hills," he  added.    "A major, very significant withdrawal is going on," he said.    General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, "has received information from senior  levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will have their  equipment out of a 20-kilometer (12-mile) zone within 36 hours,  that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night,"  Aikman added.    Journalists in and around the capital however saw no  immediate sign of the withdrawal.    There was no new activity at the Lukavica barracks, main  headquarters of Serb forces in the Sarajevo suburbs. And  armoured vehicles deployed along the front line in front of the  barracks which had disappeared in the previous few days were  again put into combat position Thursday. [passage omitted]    Aikman said UNPROFOR's contingent in Sarajevo was continuing  to receive reinforcements and its staff now numbered 3,500 men,  an increase of 500 in less than a week.    A British armoured unit consisting of 170 men, equipped with  14 Warrior tanks, was expected to arrive here from the central  Bosnian town of Vitez on Friday. [passage omitted]</p>

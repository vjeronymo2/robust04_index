			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / A trying time for debit victims THE experience of losing money, combined with having to persuade a bank or building society that the withdrawal was not your fault, is often traumatic. In some cases it has led to illness. Mrs Jean McConville's doctor says she has suffered from nervousness, lack of sleep, headaches and vomiting as a result of her year-long tussle with Barclays Bank. The dispute started in July last year when Mrs McConville and her husband James, from St Helens, Merseyside, had their Barclays Connect cards stolen. Although they reported the loss immediately they were later debited Pounds 406 for auto-teller machine withdrawals. Mr and Mrs McConville say they could not have made the withdrawals: they had never used their cards to withdraw cash. In fact the couple destroyed their personal identification numbers (PINs) as soon as they received them, without memorising them, keeping the cards to guarantee cheques. 'The whole episode has caused us great distress,' says Mrs McConville. 'As a result of the unauthorised withdrawals, three direct debits were refused and one cheque bounced. Our reputation has been tarnished.' Mr Vincent Leigh, an electrical engineer from Stalybridge, Cheshire, found his family a target for suspicion after he was debited Pounds 3,200 on a TSB bank card he had never used. The bank suggested his parents might have made the withdrawals. 'They were made to feel like criminals, even though they are an elderly couple who have banked with the TSB all their lives,' says Mr Leigh. 'My parents do not know how to use a video recorder, never mind a hole in the wall.' Their innocence was established when Mr Leigh remembered he had kept the envelope containing his PIN number - unopened. The TSB gave Mr Leigh an ex gratia refund of Pounds 3,200, although no explanation was provided. When Mr Richard Hancock, a manager in a computer services company, found that Pounds 6,070 had been withdrawn from his NatWest account without his authority, the bank pointed first to his wife, then to his children. 'The bank manager even suggested that my six-year-old son or eight-year-old daughter could have made the withdrawals as a result of blackmail,' says Mr Hancock. Mr Denis Whalley - the solicitor representing 400 'phantom-withdrawal victims' - claims he has eliminated cases where someone other than the holder could have had access to the card and PIN. If Mr Whalley is successful in his action against the banks and building societies, thousands of card holders may have their bank balances - if not their faith in auto-teller machines - restored.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: JAL sees Y8bn loss as sales decline JAPAN Airlines (JAL), Japan's leading international carrier, said yesterday it expected to post a pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars 61.7m) in the year to end-March owing to a fall in business travel. The forecast compares with pre-tax profits of Y24.8bn last year, and a forecast issued in October of Y14bn. JAL, in common with most international carriers, has had difficulties keeping its flights full, but has been unable to cut significantly its high, fixed running costs. A revival in international travel following the Gulf war has not materialised on the scale expected, and the company said a cost-cutting programme would not be enough to offset the decline in sales. JAL said that as a result of the global recession, international passenger revenue is expected to drop by 4.6 per cent from last year's total of Y573.2bn. Total sales for the company are expected to decline from Y1,118.9bn to Y1,112bn. International cargo traffic has also dropped as a result of slow business conditions, with sales expected to decline by Y11.2bn, or 7.2 per cent. After-tax profits are expected to fall from Y13.71bn a year ago to a loss of Y4bn. A 5 yen per share dividend will none the less be declared.</p>

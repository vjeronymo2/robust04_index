			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bleakness of US economy overstated Sir, In 'Three cheers for a weak dollar' (July 6), Wynne Godley and William Milberg fall into the trap of heralding economic disaster through the extrapolation of some unpleasant trends in the US trade deficit. In practice, economic disasters are much flagged but seldom arrive as alarming trends turn into cycles. This will be the case in the outlook for US trade. Godley and Milberg argue that world output would have to rise 1.5 times as fast as US output for the trade deficit to remain a constant share of gross domestic product, and they intimate that this is unlikely. They conclude that far from being resisted, a gentle dollar slide now is preferable to the vertical drop that would follow if rising external deficits led to a loss of investor confidence in US assets. But the reality is far less bleak. The pattern of US exports is shifting in favour of Latin America and east Asia, regions where economic growth outstrips that in the US, not by 1.5, but by an order of 2 to 3 times. In 1990, only 27 per cent of US trade went to these two regions, but just three years later, in 1993, this had risen to 35.6 per cent. In the process, US exports to Latin America and east Asia leaped 37 per cent, while exports to the rest of the world grew a paltry 2.1 per cent. A staggering 88 per cent of US exports growth since 1990 can be attributed to the growth of exports to these two regions. The US appears to have maintained a comparative advantage in industries only now opening up to international trade, such as financial services. Between 1986 and 1993, global exports rose 88 per cent in merchandise goods and 105 per cent in services, while the US share of global service exports inched up from an already high 20 per cent. Fears of serious current account problems for the US are therefore overstated and suffer from neglecting the shift under way in the pattern of US exports towards the new industries and the new industrial power houses. Assuming Godley and Milberg's trends are indeed off mark, further dollar depreciation should be resisted as it will serve to shove the global economy off balance. Further dollar weakness threatens to derail the fragile economic recoveries in Europe and Japan and to aggravate inflation pressures growing in the US. Where exchange rate changes worsen global economic imbalances rather than soften them, as today, policy makers should readily consider countervailing action.

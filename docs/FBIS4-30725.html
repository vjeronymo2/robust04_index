			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Tourism is in the process of holding  discussions with an Australian consultancy for the  implementation of the proposed U.S. $500 million comprehensive  casino and international airport project at Sihanoukville.    Speaking to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, Under Secretary of State for  Tourism, Chenda Sophea Sok said: "The Australian consultancy,  Lewis &amp; Partners, are among those who have been holding  discussions with the Ministry of Tourism."    "The chosen consultancy will have to draw up the terms of  reference for the calling of international tenders, marketing  and promotional aspects of the tenders worldwide and related  aspects.    Lewis &amp; Partners have the knowledge relevant to the  implementation of casinos and integrated casino-related  commercial and tourism projects. However, they will have to  rope in, as with other proponents, the relevant real expertise  in casino operations," Chenda said.    He added that the successful consultancy will have to work  with the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) and the Ministry of  Tourism for the final preparations of the international tender.    "With the establishment of the CDC and the impending  ratification of the Investment Law, the international tender for  the casino and the airport project will have full transparency  and professionalism."    Chenda said that the international standard airport to be  built on the existing airstrip, about 18 kilometres from the  town centre of Sihanoukville, will serve as the catalyst for  growth and investments.    "The airport will offer operational synergy to investors and  casino patrons will be ferried to the island casino, most  probably located on Koh Puos island, just off the Sihanoukville  navy base."    The entire project is expected to be completed by 1997. The  key words and essentials which the Ministry of Tourism and the  CDC will be looking for is financial capacity, expertise and  professionalism.    THE CAMBODIA TIMES has learnt that the casino project at  Sihanoukville will be the only one as this will be one of the  terms of reference demanded by the proposed investors of the  project.    As such there will not be any other casinos situated  elsewhere in the nation, such as in Siem Reap and Koh Kong as  initially expected.    Lewis &amp; Partners was established in 1986 as a small  dynamic  agency specialising in Brisbane commercial sites and related  projects.    Currently, they have ventured into various aspects of real  estate development, including the Gold Coast of Australia and  various other international standard projects.    Chenda added that among the early interested parties for the  casino and comprehensive tourism project at Sihanoukville were  two large public-listed Malaysian companies, Pilecon Bhd and  Genting Bhd.    Genting Bhd already operates the casino in Malaysia and also  operates various other casino and other hotels worldwide.    "With the establishment of the CDC and the new Investment  Law, the proposals submitted by the two Malaysian companies will  be integrated into the international tender."    "The tenders are to be completed by year end and a  memorandum  of understanding with physical works targeted to commence in  early 1995," Chenda added.    He added that the Royal Government had decided to initiate  the comprehensive casino and airport project as the casino  project alone will see the payment of "Up-Front Funds" to the  Government.    These funds can then be used for other related  infrastructural development projects, THE CAMBODIA TIMES has  learnt.    Besides the casino, Chenda said that various proposals have  also been received for quality seaside resort projects at  Sihanoukville.    "These are currently under review and will be forwarded to  the CDC for its comments soon after the proposals are made more  concrete and transparent," he added.    The casino, airport and hotel are expected to contribute  greatly towards the socio-economic growth of Sihanoukville and  create numerous employment opportunities.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current Guideline makes it clear that SJI will accept audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, in satisfaction of the annual fiscal audit requirement. Grantees who are required to undertake these audits in conjunction with Federal grants may include SJI funds as part of the audit even if the receipt of SJI funds would not require such audits. This approach gives grantees an option to fold SJI funds into the governmental audit rather than to undertake a separate audit to satisfy SJI's Guideline requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute requires that non-profit grantees perform an A&hyph;133 type of audit if they receive payments totalling more than $50,000. These audits must be conducted in accordance with the Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and must include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. An opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and the results of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. A report on the grantee's internal control structure over financial reporting; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. A report on the tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on the financial statement amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For grantees receiving SJI grant payments totalling $50,000 or less during their fiscal year, the annual fiscal audit may be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, grantees that receive payments from the Institute of more than $50,000 in a fiscal year must have their annual audit conducted in accordance with Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States rather than with generally accepted auditing standards. Grantees that receive $50,000 or less from SJI in a fiscal year must also submit an annual audit to SJI, but they would have the option to conduct an audit of the entire grantee organization in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; include SJI funds in an audit of Federal funds conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circular A&hyph;128 or A&hyph;133; or conduct an audit of only the SJI funds in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. (See Guideline Section XI.J.2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Does SJI have a CFDA number? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Auditors often request that a grantee provide the Institute's Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for guidance in conducting an audit in accordance with Government Accounting Standards. Because SJI is not a Federal agency, it has not been issued such a number, and there are no additional compliance tests to satisfy under the Institute's audit requirements beyond those of a standard governmental audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, because SJI is not a Federal agency, SJI funds should not be aggregated with Federal funds to determine if $50,000 or more in assistance was received in a fiscal year. For example, if in fiscal year 1994 grantee ``X'' received $10,000 in Federal funds from a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and $20,000 in grant funds from SJI, the new SJI requirements would not be triggered. The same distinction would preclude an auditor from considering the additional SJI funds in determining what Federal requirements apply to the DOJ funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees who are required to satisfy either the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, and who include SJI grant funds in those audits, need to remember that because of its status as a private non-profit corporation, SJI is not on routing lists of cognizant Federal agencies. Therefore, the grantee needs to submit a copy of the audit report prepared for such a cognizant Federal agency directly to SJI. The Institute's audit requirements may be found in Section XI.J.2. of the Grant Guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following Grant Guideline is proposed by the State Justice Institute for FY 1995: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

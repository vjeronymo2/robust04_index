			<p>CSO     [Text] Indonesia now has Air Combat Maneuvering Range  (ACMR) fighter training facilities using Global Positioning  System (GPS) technology, which is capable of monitoring the  movements of fighter planes at all positions within its range.    The ACMR facilities built at the Pekanbaru Airfield in Riau  are one type of bilateral cooperation between the Republic of  Indonesia Armed Forces (ABRI) and the Republic of Singapore Air  Force (RSAF). Plans are for ABRI's Commander in Chief and  Singapore's Commander of Defense Forces to dedicate the ACMR  Building today (22 March); the ministers of defense and security  (MENHAN) of the two countries will sign the inscription and cut  the ribbon.    Dr Yeo Ning Hong, Singapore's Minister of Defense,  accompanied by the secretary general of Singapore's Ministry of  Defense Lim Siong Guan, by Air Force Chief of Staff Brig Gen Bey  Soo Khiang, and by Navy Chief of Staff Commodore Kwek Sien Jin,  were in Jakarta yesterday to meet with a number of Indonesian  officials, including Minister of Defense and Security Edi  Sudradjat.    Plans are for the group of Singaporean defense and security  officials to leave for Riau this morning together with a group  headed by the Minister of Defense and Security of the Republic  of Indonesia to attend the ceremony dedicating the ACMR Building  at the Pekanbaru Airfield.    In yesterday's meeting at the Department of Defense and  Security, Edi Sudradjat and Yeo Ning Hong discussed  technological developments in the field of defense and security,  in particular the development of aerospace technology. The two  ministers of defense and security also discussed efforts to  increase cooperation between the two nations.  <H5>  ACMR Excellence </H5>   The purpose of constructing ACMR training facilities in  Pekanbaru is to increase the skills and quality of training in  air firing for ABRI and RSAF fighter pilots, who up to now have  gotten firing training from the air or at the Air Weapon Range  (AWR) in Siabu, Riau.    The ACMR facilities are equipped with Air Borne Pod training  equipment made available by the Singapore Air Force. The Air  Borne Pod equipment is located on the undercarriage of the  fighter planes, which allows the maneuvers made by the fighter  planes in the vicinity of Pekanbaru to be captured by the  Satellite and Radar Tower Erection and by Real Time Tracking and  Positioning (RTTP) monitored on Base Control Debriefing Station  (BCDS) screens.    This ACMR system is capable of monitoring fighter planes  within a fixed radius of the AWR Siabu region. Air Force  KADISPEN [Head of Information Services] Col J. Paryanto told  reporters recently that the ACMR is able to monitor aircraft  movements within a radius of about 100 miles. In addition, the  ACMR is also able to monitor interception and firing movements  carried out by the plane and at the same time give the fighter  pilot guidance, instructions or corrections from the display  room.    The ACMR is also able to record all of fighting maneuvers in  the air, which allows the collection of more concrete and  accurate material for discussion by the fighter pilots. It is  said that these two air-borne capabilities will have a positive  effect on reducing the cost of firing training.    It is well known that the ACMR used by Indonesia and  Singapore has more reliable monitoring capabilities than the  ACMR used by the United States, Japan, Korea and Thailand, which  are only able to monitor the movements of planes in positions  which have already been determined.    Up to now joint Air Force training, especially with  Thailand,  has used Thailand's monitoring equipment, the Air Combat  Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI).</p>

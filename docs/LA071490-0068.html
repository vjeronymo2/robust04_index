			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3RD FATAL CRASH RENEWS CALL FOR BLOCKING SHORT CUT  </P> <P> The death of a motorcyclist last month on a residential street in Studio City  has intensified a decade-old debate over ways to control the traffic that jams  the road.  </P> <P> The fatal crash June 3 on Laurel Terrace Drive, a narrow street running  diagonally south of the intersection of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards in  Studio City, was similar to a collision at the same spot in 1984 and another  fatal accident on the street in 1976.  </P> <P> Although the city installed stop signs at Laurel Terrace Drive and Laurel Grove  Avenue -- the site of the two most recent crashes -- and restricted access to  Laurel Terrace Drive during the morning commute, some residents of the street  say tougher action is needed.  </P> <P> Joe Rinella, a member of the Studio City Residents' Assn., wants the city to  block his neighborhood off from outside traffic. He has asked the city to  install water-filled barrels at three intersections on Laurel Terrace Drive and  nearby streets to discourage commuters bound from the Westside to the west San  Fernando Valley from using Laurel Terrace as a shortcut.  </P> <P> The barrels would be inexpensive, could easily be removed, and would make "this  area a mouse maze," he said.  </P> <P> City officials say Rinella's plan, first advocated in 1988 and raised  periodically since then, simply would increase traffic on Ventura and Laurel  Canyon boulevards, both of which now are operating at what the city considers  to be capacity.  </P> <P> A city Transportation Department traffic survey of Laurel Terrace Drive  conducted this year found that 6,000 vehicles use the street daily, said Jim  Sherman, principal transportation engineer for the Los Angeles Department of  Transportation.  </P> <P> The average Valley residential street carries between 4,000 and 5,000 vehicles  each day, but some streets in Valley residential areas are used by as many as  14,000 cars, Sherman said.  </P> <P> The accident rate on Laurel Terrace Drive is not "significantly different than  any other streets," Sherman said.  </P> <P> Still, homeowners say they see too many speeding cars on their street. Glen  Rocklin, who has lived on Laurel Terrace Drive since 1984, wants the city to  prevent non-resident drivers from entering the street during the morning and  evening rushes. "You do whatever's necessary to keep cars moving on the main  arteries that were designed to deal with the traffic," he said.  </P> <P> The installation of stop signs at Laurel Terrace and Laurel Grove after the  June 3 crash reduced the speed and volume of traffic, residents said.  </P> <P> Diana Brueggemann, an aide to Councilman Michael Woo, said further relief will  come to homeowners on the street when two additional left-turn lanes are built  for the use of northbound Laurel Canyon Boulevard traffic turning onto  westbound Ventura Boulevard. That would unknot tie-ups at that intersection and  reduce the need to use Laurel Terrace as a shortcut.  </P> <P> Residents and officials also say they hope a periodic traffic survey now under  way will persuade the city to reduce the speed limit on the road from 30 m.p.h.  to 25 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Laurel Terrace Drive remains a favorite shortcut of commuters in the  Valley. "It's almost a joke," Los Angeles Police Officer Dale Turner said of  the ease with which he catches speeders on the street. "There's no challenge  here at all."  </P></p>

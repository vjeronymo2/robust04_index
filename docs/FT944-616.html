			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Charity and the law - Briefcase Following the death of my grandfather a few years ago, a sum of money was raised and put into a trust. This money is now being used for educational and cultural purposes. The trustees, of whom I am one, have been considering whether to seek charitable status. I have read the relevant literature produced by the Charities Commission. But I need to do further reading on the powers and duties of trustees. Could you refer me to the standard works covering this area of the law? The Charities Commission produces a series of leaflets and we would recommend Responsibility of Charity Trustees (CC3) and Investment of Charitable Funds: Basic Principles (CC14). If these are not sufficient, the commission also publishes a video: Charity Trustees: The Crucial Guide to Trusteeship. For more detailed information, you might like to consider Tolley's Charities Manual, published by Tolley Publishing Company, 2 Addiscombe Road, Croydon CR9 5AF as being the most comprehensive work on all aspects of the subject.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

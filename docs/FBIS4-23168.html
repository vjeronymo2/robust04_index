			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has appointed a committee to begin drafting  legislation to outlaw discrimination in banking. This could  include forcing banks to disclose details of loans and deposits.  ANC Banking and Finance President (Leo Morrison) says an act to  this effect is to be tabled soon for discussion. He told a  conference in Pretoria that a similar act in the United States  had virtually outlawed discrimination by banks on the basis of  gender or race. Banks there were obliged to disclose detailed  information on deposits and loans by bank branches. Details of  rejected loan applications, for example for mortgage bonds by  members of specific communities, were also made public. Mr.  (Morrison) said the American legislation could provide the basis  for similar legislation in this country.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Bush-Yeltsin Summit: Yeltsin appeals to Congress for aid legislation PRESIDENT George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin yesterday hailed 'the threshold of a new era' as they concluded the first summit meeting of the US and Russia. The two leaders finished their meeting by formally signing the summit's greatest concrete achievement: an agreement to slash their strategic nuclear missile forces by two thirds and eliminate the multiple-warhead intercontinental missiles which they saw as the greatest threat to peace. Mr Yeltsin said that, even before the implementation of the agreement, he had taken Russia's multiple-warhead SS-18 missiles off alert. He added - and Mr Bush concurred - that it was not worth arguing about cutting British and French nuclear weapons, in that the number of missiles involved was insignificant compared with the 21,000 warheads held by Russia and the US. The summit also yielded a string of further treaties aimed at preventing double taxation of companies operating in the two countries and protecting US investors in Russia, as well as agreements to co-operate on space exploration, the prevention of arms proliferation and the development of joint systems to provide early warning against missile attacks. In all, 39 agreements were signed, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russian acting prime minister, offered for exploitation three oilfields in western Siberia with combined proven reserves of 4.4m tons, as well as two goldfields in eastern Siberia. Mr Yeltsin may not have won any more promises of economic aid but he increased his chances of receiving the aid that the US has already promised with his dramatic plea to the US Congress to pass a bill that would help Russia in its difficult transition to a market economy. The Freedom Support Act would combine aid measures specifically targeted at Russia with approval of a Dollars 12bn US contribution to the International Monetary Fund. This contribution is not directly tied to Russia but without it the IMF would be handicapped in its efforts to co-ordinate the Dollars 24bn package that the leading industrial countries have agreed to provide. The Russian leader warned the US that, in its own interests, it must play its part by supporting his political and economic reforms. Some Congress members said they had been swayed by Mr Yeltsin's speech but Mr Thomas Foley, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, warned that many were still reluctant to vote for Russian aid while the US faced so many domestic problems. Mr Yeltsin said, however, that neither US aid nor the Dollars 24bn package agreed by the leading industrial nations - which cannot be triggered until Russia has achieved a stand-by agreement with the IMF - would save his country. 'The most important thing is that they will open the door for the influx of private capital. That will be a matter of hundreds of billions of dollars,' Mr Yeltsin said. Editorial comment, page 20</p>

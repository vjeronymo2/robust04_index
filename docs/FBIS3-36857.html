			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feb 09, BNS -- Russian militant nationalist  Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy voiced  outspoken threats against each and every one of ethnic Estonians  if Estonia decided on legal action against his representative in  the country.    "Warn the Estonian Government that even if a hair should  fall  from the head of the representative of Russian Liberal  Democratic Party, Pyotr Rozhok, the Estonian Government will  have to think about the fate of 900,000 Estonians," Zhirinovsky  told a BNS correspondent today.    "I swap one Rozhok for 900,000 Estonians," he said when  asked  to comment on charges brought against the representative of his  party in Estonia. Rozhok has been charged for instigating  inter-ethnic hostility.    "If Rozhok is put into an Estonian jail, end will come to  Estonia and Tallinn. We will implement such measures that the  Estonians will forget that they are Estonians," Zhirinovsky said  without hiding his emotion, then turning his back to the BNS  correspondent.    The extremist leader's remarks were hailed by the group  accompanying him.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (15): Differentials will be published - Kevin Done explains the next step towards harmonising EC car prices FROM May, carmakers will have to publish comparative EC price-lists for selected new vehicles twice a year under a plan agreed with the European Commission. The scheme will mark the next step in the vexed debate over carmakers' pan-European pricing policies. Publication of the price lists is aimed at helping car buyers to shop for bargains across EC borders. The lists, agreed while Sir Leon Brittan was EC competition commissioner, are aimed at increasing the pressure on manufacturers to bring car prices more into line across the EC and to make it more difficult for car dealers to discriminate against foreign buyers. The investigation of carmakers' pricing policies across Europe is set to intensify over the next two years. In mid-1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire. The motor industry has been warned by the EC competition directorate that a renewal of the block exemption will depend largely on car manufacturers' adherence to EC limits on car price differentials across Europe. The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the long term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year. During 1992 both the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission published reports on car prices in Europe. Neither report removed the widespread confusion over price differences, but the EC report in particular drew attention to many cases where price differentials had exceeded the block exemption guidelines. According to a survey late last year by Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, the prices of certain new models can vary by more than 40 per cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are mostly within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission. Certainly UK new car prices, which have previously provided consumer groups with much of their ammunition, appear to have been brought much more into line with the rest of the EC through a combination of recessionary pressures and last September's devaluation of the pound. Motor retailers in the UK have been disappointed about the lack of action by the Office of Fair Trading in the wake of last year's MMC report, and they are particularly concerned about the price distortions that result from carmakers offering very large discounts on direct sales to some large fleet operators. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the franchised retailer division of the UK Retail Motor Industry Federation, says that 'the MMC annual review spells out several items which raise the price level in the UK, in particular the deep discounts which large fleet owners obtain from suppliers, which distort the price structure for other buyers'. Direct sales from manufacturers to large fleets at enormous discounts were not fair to motor retailers or their customers. 'Such discounts have to be paid for by everybody else and they effect both new prices and used car values.' The pricing debate has recently been widened beyond Europe, however, by a report from Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, which claims that whatever the price differences within Europe, European car buyers in general are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars as consumers in the US and in Japan. Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in relation to household income. The report was the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between Europe and the other main world markets, the US and Japan. According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45 per cent higher than in the US. On average, it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks less. The Commission's plan for the biannual publication of price lists is not legally binding, but EC officials have indicated that if carmakers do not co-operate they will risk losing their jealously guarded right to operate their sales and distribution through exclusive dealerships. Every manufacturer that sells cars in the Community will have to select a representative model from each part of its product range and publish the prices in 10 EC countries. The carmakers will also have to supply information about the price of five common options - anti-lock braking systems, air conditioning, right-hand drive, automatic gearbox and power steering - and details of warranty, roadside assistance options and delivery costs. Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before and after tax, in Ecu and local currency. Comparative figures for Denmark and Greece - where car tax of more than 100 per cent distorts selling prices  -will be omitted. The Commission agreed to drop its original demand that manufacturers should supply information about all possible models and options on the grounds that it would be too time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for consumers. Manufacturers are still likely to argue that realistic comparison is difficult because dealers in some countries are prepared to offer large discounts on the list price of certain models. However, they will also hope that by being more open about comparative prices they will stave off the abolition of selective distribution.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Arrears will be paid off - United Nations THE US plans to pay off Dollars 98m (Pounds 64.9m) of its arrears with the United Nations next year, with another Dollars 163m in 1995, to complete its dues to the international organisation, writes George Graham. The Clinton administration budget also proposes Dollars 620m for UN peacekeeping operations in 1994, including Dollars 22m to pay off US arrears and a Dollars 175m reserve for unanticipated needs. Another Dollars 293m is allotted to pay for the peacekeeping force in Mozambique, already deployed but not anticipated in last year's US budget. Including money set aside in the defence budget, peacekeeping accounts for more than Dollars 1bn in the overall fiscal 1994 budget. Aid for Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union is increased to Dollars 704m from Dollars 393m this year - although the package President Bill Clinton announced in Vancouver last week included Dollars 1.6bn of money previously allocated but not spent. The bulk of the aid budget continues to go to Israel (Dollars 3bn) and Egypt (Dollars 2.1bn). The administration also proposes to pay the first of the three Dollars 1.25bn instalments it has pledged for the 10th replenishment of the International Development Association, a World Bank offshoot which provides loans at concessional rates to the poorest developing countries.</p>

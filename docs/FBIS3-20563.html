			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Peixin (2799 1014 2450) of State Council </F> Development and Research Center: "Why There Is a Shortage of  Circulating Funds for Industry"]    [Text] Since the implementation of the macro-economic  control program in July 1993, there has been a shortage of  circulating funds for industry in China. Even now, this  situation has not been alleviated. In some districts,  enterprises have stopped production completely or partially,  because they have no money to buy raw materials or pay wages. We  must conscientiously study and analyze this situation.  <H5>  Why Are Circulating Funds for Industry Insufficient </H5>   The issue of insufficient circulating funds for industry is  really something which has cropped up in the course of  exercising the macro-economic control. However, we should point  out that due to the high rate of growth of our national economy,  this phenomenon had actually appeared since the first half of  1993. The macro-economic control and the tightening of the money  supply have aggravated this situation.    The high growth rate of the national economy demands even  more circulating funds for industry.    1. According to an analysis, the amount of investments in  fixed assets was more than 700 billion yuan in 1992 and 1.1  trillion yuan in 1993 of which the portion of projects completed  and went into operation cost about one trillion yuan. The  minimum circulating funds needed was 100 million yuan. Under  ordinary conditions, the amount of circulating funds needed was  about 30 percent of the fixed assets. Therefore, the amount of  circulating funds needed to buy new equipment for production  would be approximately 100 to 300 billion yuan.    2. The amount of loans used as circulating funds for  industry totalled 1.5 trillion yuan at the end of 1992, and the  total industrial output value rose by more than 20 percent.  Thus, there is a need to increase the amount of circulating  funds for industry by 300 billion yuan.    3. The prices of industrial raw materials have increased.  According to statistics compiled, the prices of capital goods  have increased by 30 percent, and the cost of investment by 40  percent. On the basis of the price increases of capital goods,  we need to duly increase the amount of circulating funds by 450  billion yuan. Due to the high rate of growth and the decontrol  of the prices of capital goods, the amount of circulating funds  needed would exceed one trillion yuan, of which tens of billion  yuan are needed in support of national construction projects. It  is precisely for this reason that from October 1993, the  specialized banks had poured capital into industrial enterprises  in the form of loans and in other forms, while the central bank  had helped the specialized banks in doing refinancing. Although  the reserve ratio of the specialized banks on their deposits  rose from approximately 1 percent to 13.9 percent, some of their  funds have not been released yet. Nevertheless, we should admit  that the banks have truly increased the amount of loans used as  circulating funds for industry. Then why is there still a  shortage of money on the market? From the aforementioned  estimates, we should realize that due to the rapid rate of  growth of the industrial output value and the acceleration of  the price reform, we inevitably need a large amount of  circulating funds. In seeking a high rate of growth, we must  pour in a large amount of capital and fixed assets. Without  money, we are unable to develop our economy. We must also pay a  price for the pricing reform and expand the supply of  circulating funds for industry. Right now, many of the  state-owned industrial enterprises in China still remain on the  track of planned economy. Their efficiency is still quite low.  It is difficult for the whole society to keep pace with the  excessively high rate of growth with its current accumulation.  This would inevitably cause inflation and price increases, and  make factories pay more for their raw materials. From this, we  can see that we actually need and can achieve a higher rate of  growth in the development of our economy, but the rate of growth  is still dependent on the monetary and material supplies, and  the amount of material supplies (including those additionally  produced and those imported from abroad) is still determined by  the amount of available funds (including Renminbi and foreign  exchange). To believe that the rate of growth should be as high  as possible without taking into consideration the amount of  available funds and that even if inflation swells, it will not  affect the rate of growth is an unrealistic idea.  <H3>  How To Tackle Issues Regarding Shortage of Circulating Funds  for Industry </H3>   According to a bank survey, the reasons causing shortage of  circulating funds for industry are as follows:    1. Some of the enterprises in the fields of textile, coal  and chemicals are not doing well in selling their main products  and they have a large stockpile of manufactured goods. They owe  others a great deal of money, while others also owe them a great  amount of money. No matter the money is easy or tight, the  enterprises have little circulating funds.    2. Enterprises recklessly raised funds and borrowed money,  and there is always a constant flow of money out of the  district, causing a shortage of funds in a certain district.    3. Enterprises have insufficient circulating funds. Ten  percent of the 5,000 large- and medium-sized enterprises fail to  maintain a definite percentage between their circulating funds  and their total capital, while 20 percent of them fail to  maintain a fixed amount of circulating funds. The situation in  smaller enterprises is even worse. They mainly rely on bank  loans. Once the bank tightens the money supply, they are in  trouble.    4. A part of the circulating funds is used as investments in  fixed assets. When enterprises have no money to develop  technical innovations, they use circulating funds to do so.    5. Enterprises continue to manufacture slow-moving products.    6. Enterprises owe each other more and more money. This  situation is worse in the fields of machine-building, building  materials and iron and steel industry. It is mainly because of  investment curtailment and lack of construction funds.    The aforementioned examples indicate that shortage of  circulating funds for industry has existed long time ago. it is  main because of the fact that enterprises' tax burdens have  already accounted for 90 percent of their net revenue (or the  total amount of profits and taxes). This percentage may reach 94  percent for some large enterprises. Enterprises have lost their  function for self-accumulation. Meanwhile, the financial  authorities have also stopped appropriating any fixed amount of  circulating funds for enterprises. Nor would they allocate funds  to help enterprises develop technical innovations. Enterprises  have no accumulations of their own, and they are unable to  develop technical innovations without money. Naturally their  products will become unmarketable. Such enterprises cannot  compete with their counterparts which are not state-owned. When  our national economy was rapidly growing in 1992 and 1993, signs  of reckless fund raising and money borrowing and illegal use of  circulating funds to develop technical innovations had cropped  up. After China exercised the macro-economic control, the  phenomenon of chain debts surfaced among enterprises. Therefore,  the basic contradiction is the fact that our state-owned  industrial enterprises are still on the track of planned  economy, while they are losing their abilities for  self-accumulation and self-development. Whenever the bank  tightens the money supply, there will be an even greater  shortage of funds. Right now, state-owned enterprises are slow  in carrying out reform and they lack vitality. This is the main  reason why they are short of funds. The state-owned enterprises  are unable to keep pace with the rapid development of our  national economy. They can neither advance nor retreat. To  earnestly reform the mechanism of state-owned enterprises, help  them reduce their tax burdens and truly invigorate them is the  only way to fundamentally tackle the issue of money shortage for  the enterprises.</p>

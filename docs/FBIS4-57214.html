			<p>BFN     [Text] Marc Louis Bazin, leader of the Movement for the  Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, MIDH, rejects the  initiative from the senators of the [Senate] Office led by  Sansaricq. It is a dead-end operation, the MIDH president  asserted in our microphone:    [Begin Bazin recording] The 11 May operation has no serious  basis, neither on the constitutional level nor on the level of  relations with other nations. Furthermore, the fact that it  closes the door to dialogue inevitably complicates and delays  the solution to the crisis.    In regards to the embargo -- in other respects as  reprehensible -- far from lightening the consequences, it is  going to exacerbate getting supplies, the impossibility of  export, increasing prices, the exchange rate of the gourde,  unemployment, and, in a more general way, the living conditions  of the huge majority of our compatriots whose survival in the  current situation depends every day on a miracle and challenges  all rationality. The 11 May operation is therefore a dead-end  situation. MIDH rejects it.    Today there is no longer time to cloud the issues by adding  fuel to the flames. In these worrisome hours when we are openly  threatened by foreign military intervention, the priority of  priorities for every Haitian should be to do everything possible  to spare the country new crises and tough humiliation.    Therefore, each of us should agree to sacrifice part of our  pride and our ambition and consent, in good faith, to a  realistic compromise which reinforces the chance of democracy  and safeguards our independence. The nation expects the effort  of such a compromise. The nation is not resigned to the  inevitable. It is, on the contrary, convinced that with a  minimum of courage and a sense of responsibility nothing is  impossible and that from now until 21 May, we would be spared an  escalation toward absurdity and distress.

Demand for international service is growing faster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than demand for U.S. domestic service, and most major U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines are now providing and planning to expand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international operations. Between 1983 and 1993, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international component of U.S. airlines' route networks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), grew from around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16% to over 27%. U.S. airline revenues from international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air service nearly tripled from $6.3 billion to $17.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion. Moreover, forecasts indicate that U.S. carrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international traffic, measured by RPMs, will increase to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> almost one-third of their total system traffic by the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just as important, the pattern of demand for international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service has changed considerably. First, the regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of U.S. carriers' international revenues has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed dramatically, as the primary focus of carriers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion moved beyond Europe to meet new demand in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emerging markets of Asia, the Pacific Rim and Latin America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1983, the Atlantic accounted for 48% of our carriers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international revenues, while the Pacific accounted for 32%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By 1993, the Pacific had grown to 46% while the Atlantic was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only 37%. The fastest growing sectors of the international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation market are new and relatively undeveloped markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During this same period, revenues in the Pacific grew 286%,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Latin America 151% and in Europe 116%. Second, from 1983  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 1993, the number of international aviation city-pair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets in which U.S. airlines participate has grown by more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than a third, reflecting the major expansion of air service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and carrier networks throughout the world and the increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispersion of demand. Many of these city-pair markets are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively small, generating only a few passengers per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Towards a Globalized Aviation Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rapid growth of demand for international air service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wider dispersion of traffic in city-pair markets are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary factors influencing the development of the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service industry. Carriers are increasingly finding that they cannot remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitable unless they can respond to this changed demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To compete effectively, carriers today must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrestricted access to as many markets and passengers as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To meet demand and to improve their efficiency, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers are developing international hub-and-spoke systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that permit them to combine traffic flows from many routes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the ``spokes'') at a central point (the ``hub'') and transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them to another point either directly or through a hub in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another region. Just as U.S. carriers developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hub-and-spoke systems to tap the broad traffic pool in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestic market and to provide the most cost-efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service for hundreds of communities that could not support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct service, international air carriers are developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> world-wide hub-and-spoke systems to tap the substantial pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of international city-pairs. Internationally, an even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger portion of traffic moving over hub-and-spoke systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will require the use of at least two hubs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a hub in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the U.S. and Europe for a passenger moving from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interior U.S. point to a point beyond the European hub).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This increases the complexity and interdependence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components of the system (both the spokes and hubs) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of multinational traffic rights to the success of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, carriers wishing to establish global networks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a higher quality and quantity of supporting route  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority than they have sought in the past. Airlines will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become increasingly concerned with every market that enables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them to flow passengers over any part of their system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> network. These airlines will be looking for broad, flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to operate beyond and behind hub points, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the hub-to-hub market between two countries. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present, governments operating in a bilateral context  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> naturally focus on opportunities for their respective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers to serve the local market between their two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries. In a bilateral context, services destined for or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coming from third countries receive less consideration. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future, governments will have to adjust their focus to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bargain for the bundles of rights that will permit airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop global networks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carriers can either serve markets themselves (direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service) or provide service through commercial arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other carriers (indirect service), whether on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional interline connecting basis or under a closer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial agreement between the carriers, such as code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sharing. Carriers will develop service products_single-plane, on-line connecting, interline connecting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> joint service_that respond to the preferences of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveling public as measured by passenger willingness to pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for differences in the quality of service and that take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account their cost structure and market strategy. To the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greatest extent possible, airlines should be free to set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices and offer various service products in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger preferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 13 (CTK) -- Chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will  probably arrive for a four-day private visit to Slovakia on June  25, Jozef Lauko, a lawyer and one of his hosts, told CTK today.  As it is not possible to rule out "complications in Russia's  domestic development or other unpredictable circumstances," as  in May when his visit was canceled, the date of the visit is  only preliminary, Lauko added. However, Ladislav Mojzis, the  owner of a Bratislava restaurant and the second host, has  received a fax confirming the arrival of a seven-member  delegation headed by Zhirinovskiy.    The agenda of Zhirinovskiy's visit does not include any  meeting with Slovak politicians. He will see the Gabcikovo  water project and the memorial to the Soviet war dead at the  Slavin cemetery in Bratislava. According to unofficial  information, Zhirinovskiy has asked the Czech and Slovak  embassies to say what they thought of his visit; while the Czech  Republic has made it clear that his arrival is not desirable,  the Slovak authorities have said they cannot block a private  visit due to the agreement on visa-free relations between the  two countries.</p>

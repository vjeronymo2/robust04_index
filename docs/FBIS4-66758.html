			<p>CSO     [Text] Many questions are raised in the Egyptian society  about the future of Egyptian industry. This questioning is due  to the economic reform and the changes taking place in the  Egyptian arena, the most important of which are privatization  and trade liberalization. It is also due to the new factors that  make industrial cooperation with the outside world imperative.  In addition, goals for increased exports present the best means  to both increase industrial activity and apply the latest  industrial technologies.    Though the ferromanganese industry, which is one of the  Egyptian strategic industries, lay idle for many years, millions  of pounds have been invested in it. Major and important changes  have taken place in this industry leading to major problems  which are currently related to keeping pace with the  international demand for its products of ferromanganese and  meeting its exports obligations. This change has come about  because of sound economic management. This management is based  on acquiring information and conducting export-related studies,  which consider competition and market study in order to achieve  its goals. In fact, since the Sinai Manganese Company made use  of market and scientific studies, as well as international  periodical newsletters that deal with this industry, it is no  longer isolated from international markets and has started  penetrating them. The successful results that this company has  met with prove that, with regard to the public sector, these  results are due to the sound economic policy adopted by the  Sinai Manganese Company. Such a policy takes into account and  closely monitors the different economic changes that effect  production and export. It also advocates good quality and stands  for competition, especially at the present stage. The Sinai  Manganese Company has successfully applied this strategy.  Engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, the company chairman and executive  officer, initiated this policy and has worked diligently to  apply it. His efforts made it possible for the company to export  to Japan, Germany, and other countries. Engineer 'Id's strategy  and efforts also rendered good results in marketing the  company's other products in the domestic market. What are the  landmarks of the Sinai Manganese Company's economic and  production strategy within the framework of existing  investments, particularly relating to meeting its urgent  marketing demands and taking into consideration that the  company's vital investments lie in the ferromanganese industry?    We met with engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, chairman and  executive officer of the company, in order to become acquainted  with the new path of the ferromanganese industry in both world  and domestic markets. Engineer 'Id stated with clear and precise  words that could be considered important economic indicators,  that: "Currently, we are concerned with meeting the European  markets' demands especially in view of the uneconomic work  conditions existing in the ferromanganese factory now operating  at capacity. There should be quick new investments to meet the  demands of urgent exports. The current export schedule is a  continuation of past exports. This condition is due to the fact  that contracts for ferromanganese exports are made at  three-month intervals. Prices are stabilized throughout each of  these periods. This short contracting period has the advantage  of allowing for an increase in prices every three months."  Engineer 'Id also indicated that: "The company's export goals  are based on both its export potential and the economic gains  from exports." He further stated that the Sinai Manganese  Company has unlimited demands for its exports.  <H5>  The Ferromanganese Industry's World Market: Factors the </H5> Company Should Consider Regarding Competition    Because our conversation with engineer 'Id covered the world  market and rising exports, it was inevitable that we discuss the  factors that the Company considered that allowed it to enter the  world market. The chairman and executive officer of the Company  responded to our inquiry by saying: "In order for the company  just to enter the ferromanganese world market, we had to adopt a  graduating pricing strategy that started with a price that was  5-percent lower than the world market price. However, we offered  this lower price for a limited period only in order to make sure  that our company entered in competition with other companies. In  the meantime, we studied all the information relevant to  movement in these world markets.  <H5>  Actual Export Figures </H5>   The chairman and executive officer of the Sinai Manganese  Company reported that in 1993 the company had exported more than  10,000 tons of ferromanganese worth $4 million. The Company is  expected to export more than 15,000 tons in 1994.  <H5>  Gypsum Ore and Calcified Gypsum: Production and Exports </H5> Capacities    Besides the ferromanganese project, in the framework of a  policy of harmonized production, the Sinai Manganese Company is  also producing gypsum ore and calcified gypsum. Engineer 'Id  remarks: "There is no problem exporting gypsum ore, because the  Company has exporting contracts in 1993/94 to export 60,000 tons  to the Arab Gulf region. Meanwhile, the Company has already  exported gypsum ore worth $500,000. In addition, it exported  20,000 tons of sand for glass to the European market in 1993/94.  Actual sales of calcified gypsum were 120,000 tons, which  represented 40 percent of the factory's capacity." At this  point, engineer 'Id raised a vital point about which he had been  thinking, namely that of changing the activity of the factory in  order to make use of its potential and its workers. It is worth  mentioning that, since restarting operation of the  ferromanganese factory and the manganese mines, the number of  workers in the Company has increased to 300.  <H5>  Capital, Investment, Role Demanded and Workers' Share </H5>   It is necessary to reform the financial structure of the  Sinai Manganese Company in order to make it capable of meeting  its industrial, strategic, and vital goals. These reforms are  necessary for many reasons. Among these reasons is the fact  that, since the world market--particularly the markets of Europe  and the Arab Gulf--have opened to the Company's ferromanganese  and gypsum exports, there have been changes in the Company's  patterns of production and exports. The Company also has other  potential, such as its port, which is currently busy for 30 days  [as published; probably should read "300 days per year"]--a  great success for all workers. The different categories of  workers appreciate the rise in the Company's exports. As a  result of these changes, though the Company's invested capital  remains fixed at 10 million pounds, its projects are valued at  220 million pounds: therefore there is the need to reform the  Company's financial structure, as was mentioned above. Engineer  'Id believes that, in order for the Company to meet its  industrial, strategic, and vital goals, it is necessary to  reform the Company's financial structure. In short, these  reforms are rescheduling the Company's loans, and making them  long-term loans with low interest rates as well as having the  Investment Bank contribute to the Company's capital. Currently,  35 pounds are paid as interest for every ton of calcified  gypsum, the price of which is 80 pounds, and 380 pounds are paid  as bank interest for every ton of ferromanganese. Engineer 'Id  adds: "We have already asked the holding company to raise the  Company's capital to 60 million pounds in order to achieve a  balance between actual investment and current export  expectations, which are embodied in privatization, trade  liberalization, and the recent agreements."</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (9): Unease and jasmine in LA 'Is the City of Angels going to hell?' THE QUESTION was asked on the cover of Time magazine in April. Los Angeles, more accustomed to throwing the spotlight on resident stars than to airing its dirty linen in public, is still reeling from the year of national scrutiny following the worst riots in recent American history. Tensions have eased considerably in recent months, although many of the underlying social problems remain. Apart from a few burnt shells of buildings on the outskirts of Beverly Hills, however, visitors to LA are unlikely to see the worst of the damage which was largely confined to the city's poorer areas, such as South Central. It is easy to overlook the city's problems on a warm spring afternoon with a hint of jasmine in the air, when the smog has been blown from the basin, bringing the surrounding mountains into sharp relief. Los Angeles, at least for most visitors, is awfully close to paradise. In LA, however, paradise is only accessible by car. The city is building an integrated rail system to relieve the appalling congestion on its streets, but the system is still in its infancy. All of the major rental agencies are represented at the airport and throughout LA. Car rental rates are reasonable, and bargains are often advertised in local papers. If the thought of jumping straight into a freeway traffic jam after hours on an international flight does not appeal, most hotels offer airport pick-up, and there are also cabs and shuttle services. The Super Shuttle (tel 213 775-6600) is less expensive than a cab, and will drop you straight to the door, but advance reservations are necessary. Visitors who plan to avoid car rental should note that cabs cannot be hailed on the street. LA is blessed with some of the most luxurious hotels in the country, including the Hotel Bel-Air (213 472-1211) and the Four Seasons at Beverly Hills (310 332-3442). The famous Beverly Hills Hotel, home of the more famous Polo Lounge, is closed for renovation until 1994. Downtown, the Biltmore (213 624-1011) is a glorious example of Spanish architecture, LA-style. The hotel has been beautifully restored. Other choices include the New Otani Hotel &amp; Garden (213 629-1200). For a taste of Hollywood chic, try the Chateau Marmont (213 656-1010). Restaurants abound in the shame, but it would be a crime to visit Los Angeles without sampling its version of Mexican cuisine. Locals recommend The Border Grill, Taxco, Casablanca and Casa Carnitas.</p>

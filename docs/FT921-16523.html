			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Mud flies in fight over Shannon airport's status: An international gateway that may lose the compulsory stopover that feeds its industry SHANNON airport, in the west of Ireland, is fighting for its life. At stake is what is known as 'the Shannon stopover' and the airport's designated status as the Republic of Ireland's international gateway to the US and Canada. Last month, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IAPA) added its voice to a growing lobby in Ireland for abolishing the stopover, opening the possibility of direct flights between the capital, Dublin, and US cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. At present, all transatlantic flights in and out of Ireland must call at Shannon, under a US-Ireland agreement dating back to the 1960s. This, says Captain Donal Lamont, an IAPA leader, is holding back expansion and fleet renewal plans of Aer Lingus, the national carrier. Most business travellers (the most profitable market segment) to and from the US now go via London's Heathrow, as the latter has direct access to 26 US gateway airports, while Dublin/Shannon only has four. Aer Lingus operates three ageing Boeing 747 jumbos to Chicago, New York and Boston, but wants to open a route to Los Angeles using two leased Boeing 767s. The jumbos will have to be replaced within five years. But, unless Aer Lingus can win back business travellers, says Capt Lamont, it will be unable to generate enough revenue to renew the fleet, and may even have to curtail some of its transatlantic services this year. The debate has divided all the main political parties. At stake is the future of the national airline against the economic survival of the Shannon hinterland. Supporters of the stopover claim that as many as 100,000 jobs depend on it, directly or indirectly. Shannon airport was created out of cow pastures beside the Shannon river in the war years of the 1940s, when propellor-driven aeroplanes on transatlantic journeys needed a refuelling stop on the edge of western Europe. It became the world's first duty-free airport in 1947. When longer-range jet airliners, not needing Shannon, appeared, the government of the day began to promote tourism in the west of Ireland and established the world's first industrial free zone around the airport. The airport became the focus of regional development, and the stopover was made compulsory in order to ensure that development continued. Considerable investments have been made in tourism and the electronics industry, and 70 per cent of transatlantic tourists visiting Ireland get off at Shannon. Mr Foster Kerrison, co-ordinator of the Shannon Status Committee, a group lobbying to keep the airport's position as an international gateway, believes abandonment of the stopover would put an end to all other scheduled services to the airport, on which much of the industry in the region depends. This is despite assurances by Aer Lingus that it will keep a daily transatlantic flight to Shannon throughout the year. 'The airlines would only fly into Shannon when it is profitable,' he says - that is, during the summer tourist season. Dublin airport, he adds, would have to invest large sums if US carriers were to open new routes to Ireland, with the possibility of direct flights to Dublin, whereas Shannon is at present working at only half-capacity. Apart from Delta Airlines, which flies out of Atlanta in the US, Aer Lingus has a virtual monopoly on the Dublin/Shannon-US routes. If other US carriers were to fly directly to Dublin, Aer Lingus could face stiff competition. Says Mr Kerrison: 'We are not convinced that Aer Lingus has done its sums correctly.' One alternative under consideration is to develop Shannon as a hub for transatlantic flights from regional UK airports. Few of the latter have scheduled direct services to the US, and travellers must go via the increasingly congested Heathrow or London's Gatwick. There was an interesting development last month - an agreement by Aer Lingus and one of the former Soviet republics to operate a joint service to the US, using Shannon as a connecting airport. The small republics' airlines only have short-range aircraft but, by using Aer Lingus as the transatlantic carrier, they could contemplate operating routes to the US via Shannon. Aeroflot, the Soviet national carrier, already has a big refuelling facility at Shannon for its own transatlantic services. Use of that seems to be part of this latest deal. The stopover debate is likely to be intensified, especially as Mr Seamus Brennan, Irish transport minister, indicated recently that he might be willing to rescind the arrangement if increased traffic to Ireland would result. The two opposing lobbies are not even talking to each other at present, their debate taking place through the media in sometimes vitriolic exchanges. 'There are some places I'm afraid to go to in Dublin right now,' says Mr Kerrison.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Passion with artifice - Ovid's challenge to modern poets AFTER OVID: NEW METAMORPHOSES edited by Michael Hofmann and James Lasdun Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 320 pages Few books amount to a 'myth kitty' (Larkin's famous abhorrence) as convincingly as Ovid's Metamorphoses. Stories like those of Venus and Adonis, Pyramus and Thisbe, Baucis and Philemon, and Orpheus and Eurydice - paired off like names on ancient windscreens - are close to the heart of European culture. Painting, sculpture, opera, drama, poetry - what would they have done without Ovid's telling of these tales? Improved no end, Larkin might have said. Can you imagine him, or Amis, getting stuck in to Ovid? It shows how poetry has changed. No one today, I think, would claim that Ovidian meaning and mastery are as important to us as they were to Shakespeare, or Ovid's great Elizabethan translator, Golding. The affection, belief, technique, and sheer energy responsible for a work like Golding's can be found singly but not all together. The you-do-this-bit I'll-do-that procedure of After Ovid seems predictably of our time, as does AD Melville's worthy but regressive blank verse effort in translating the whole poem a few years ago. This is some of the whole poem gone over by many hands, some of them short on latinity. Ovid is an amazingly resourceful and tireless poet. In showing how these 42 poets rise to the challenge the book offers a fascinating sampler of contemporary styles and local solutions. Ted Hughes, for example, who contributes more to the book than anyone else, uses a choric free verse in his version of Ovid's account of Creation. In 'Venus and Adonis' he employs unrhymed stanzas, mainly of three and five lines. Readers of Hughes's book on Shakespeare will know how important this story is to his interpretation of the plays and poems. It is apt that the most Shakespearean of contemporary poets should translate a story told by Shakespeare. It is also pleasant to report that this is Hughes's best work for some time. Surprisingly, Seamus Heaney chooses pentameter couplets in writing about Orpheus. However, the lines run on through approximate rhymes so that the effect is far closer to what readers expect of Heaney than John Dryden. Still, it is not quite sparky enough for Ovid. Quicker tetrameter couplets from Derek Mahon ('Pygmalion and Galatea') seem a touch more Ovidian, as do Paul Muldoon's lines of different lengths, also rhyming in couplets. The New York poet, Kenneth Koch, goes for broke: Look at this lovely river maid, who bears the name of Io/ Her youthful beauty caused in Jove such ache that 'Me, oh] my, oh?'/ He cried, 'She must be mine]' . . . Peter Reading and some others are more classically astute, in Reading's case with the sound of dactyls - an echo of Ovid himself. Some of the poets seize a lyrical moment or passage rather than a longer haul of narrative. In 'Mrs Midas', Carol Ann Duffy is as inventive as Ovid in whose Metamorphoses Midas's queen does not appear. But Ovid, the poet of transformations, of one form changing into another, sanctions just about any poetic liberty you care to name. His great poem is a wonder-book of passion as well as a goldmine of artifice. Engaging with the Metamorphoses has led some of the best poets now writing to sprightly and delightful responses.</p>

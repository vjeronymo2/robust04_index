Caldera assumes the presidency on 2 February.    On his way to Brazil, Lage stopped in Caracas for a few  hours  where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich  and Venezuelan businessmen.    The Cuban leader told reporters that the ties between both  nations are at a good level, and he said he had reasons to hope  that those ties would continue to progress because both nations  are very close.    Lage commented that in general that relations between the  Latin American governments and the people are progressing and  strengthening.    Lage exchanged points of view with Ochoa Antich on the  situation in Cuba and Venezuela. Ochoa Antich visited Havana  four months ago as part of the consulting mechanism that exists  between the foreign ministries of the two nations.    On the approximately $45 million debt that Havana has with  Caracas, Lage reiterated his government's willingness to find a  solution to meet this commitment.    Lage said: Currently our economic conditions are difficult.  It is difficult for us to cancel this debt soon; however,  together we could find -- in a spirit of understanding and  cooperation -- formulas that will allow Cuba to slowly pay off  its debt.    Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba, and  Norberto Hernandez Curbelo, Cuban ambassador to Venezuela, also  participated in the discussions.</p>

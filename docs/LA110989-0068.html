			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE PINK;  </P> <P> WEEKLONG FESTIVITIES CELEBRATE THE 25TH BIRTHDAY OF PINK PANTHER  </P> <P> He sells fiberglass and Brazilian yogurt, eats lunch with Japanese office  ladies, brings silent cheer to sick children and hovers above Macy's  Thanksgiving parade. One look at him, and you start mouthing his song.  </P> <P> He's hot -- hot pink -- and today the Pink Panther turns 25. This week, which  his creators have dubbed "Paint the Town Pink" week, he is celebrating with a  slew of visits to hospitals, cheerleading contests at malls and a  celebrity-studded charity fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Monday, he was honored with proclamations in Hollywood and in Culver City,  where his home office, MGM/UA Communications Co., is located.  </P> <P> To accept his Culver City award, the debonair cat was chauffeured in a 1959  pastel pink Cadillac convertible from the MGM/UA building kitty-cornered from  City Hall. The 6-foot-tall, slender panther, dressed in black-sequined tuxedo  jacket with tails, ruffle-front shirt and metallic silver bow tie, hopped over  the car door, waving and landing elegantly on his watermelon-sized feet. "He's  the Fred Astaire of cartoons," said Friz Freleng, 82, who created the cat with  Dave DePatie. "He doesn't dance, but he's very graceful."  </P> <P> "Pink," as he's affectionately called at MGM/UA, caused a stir among the  residents who had come to the City Council meeting to talk about housing and  budget issues. Councilman Steven Gourley read a proclamation calling Pink a  "citizen of the world (who) has kept a special place in his heart for Culver  City," while the rest of the council sang the Pink Panther song. Pink, his jaws  fixed in a grin, kissed Mayor Jozelle Smith.  </P> <P> The now-famous cat had humble beginnings, his name coming from the pink jewel  stolen in the first "Pink Panther" film.  </P> <P> Freleng, also a mastermind behind Porky Pig, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety Bird and  Bugs Bunny, was asked by director Blake Edwards to fashion an animated title  for the 1964 movie, in which Peter Sellers tries to stop David Niven from  nabbing the legendary "Pink Panther" gem. Henry Mancini had not yet written the  snappy Pink Panther tune, but gave Freleng a tempo to go by. "It was 7 1/2  minutes long -- probably the longest title that was ever done" at that time,  Freleng said.  </P> <P> Pink "became silent because he couldn't talk over the title," Freleng said. He  also became "a real egotist," pushing signs with his name onto the screen every  time the credits to the human actors appeared.  </P> <P> That first title led to other titles in the six Panther sequels. Freleng and  DePatie also entered into a partnership with Edwards and producers Marvin and  Walter Mirisch to make theatrical cartoons, such as the Oscar-winning "Pink  Phink," shown before the features in theaters. From the 1970s to 1984, Pink  Panther cartoons aired on networks Saturday mornings. Today, the cartoons can  be seen on cable television in the United States. They are still aired  regularly abroad. "There is no language barrier," Freleng says of his pantomime  panther.  </P> <P> There seems to be no sales barrier, either. The cat, at 25, has become a  salesman as well as an industry in his own right. Worldwide, there are more  than 250 licensees with more than 2,000 Pink products, that rake in retail  sales of $300 million annually, says Mike Georgopolis, president of licensing  and merchandising for MGM/UA. The company declines to disclose how much it  earns in Pink Panther royalties.  </P> <P> In Italy, boys and girls buy hollow Ferrero-brand chocolate eggs, to find a  surprise inside -- plastic pieces that they put together to make a 2 1/2-inch  tall Pink Panther in cowboy, English bobby or one of 10 other guises. In  Brazil, Pink is on television, pushing Batavo yogurt -- and those who buy it  get a Pink Panther sticker with each carton.  </P> <P> In Japan, where a premium is put on Hello Kitty, Snoopy and other embodiments  of cuteness, Pink has his own line of eyeglass cases and handkerchiefs. "OLs"  -- office ladies, the Japanese slang for secretaries, clerks and other office  workers -- can bring their lunch in sleek Pink Panther bento boxes that come  with Pink Panther-adorned chopsticks.  </P> <P> Back in the United States, plush Panther dolls first came out in the mid-'60s,  riding the success of the movies, said Georgopolis. Pink Panther merchandise  has since exploded to include slippers, night shirts, beach towels, key chains,  Christmas ornaments, notebooks, pendants and Hallmark cards. The Lange Pink  Panther ski boot -- hot pink with Pink Panther at the heels -- retails for  $450, according to Susan Notarides, MGM/UA vice president of marketing and  operations. A 15-inch tall plush Panther sells for $25; the four-foot version  goes for $120.  </P> <P> Last month, Pink graced boxes of Kellogg's Froot Loops. Since 1980, he has  rolled out pink Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation in TV commercials. "We  thought (he) would fit -- he's the same color as our product," said Fritz  Lalendorf, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. marketing manager, who noted that most  other brands of insulation are yellow or off-white. Peter Craighead of the ad  agency Ogilvy &amp; and Mather, who helps manage the fiberglass advertising,  said "sales have responded positively" to the Panther.  </P> <P> Pink also prances at NFL games. In the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, he  floats in the air, swinging a 70-foot tail and dressed in a floral-print  bathing suit, inner tube and scarf. "Only the Pink Panther is silly enough to  go out in November with this get-up on," Notarides said.  </P> <P> The suave cat is a "cradle-to-grave" character -- like Mickey Mouse, he appeals  to all ages, Georgopolis said. But Pink stands out because "he is known by his  music, not only by his looks and his color," Georgopolis said. "The Japanese,  Italians, Brazilians, the British, can all whistle the Pink Panther theme."  </P> <P> Like many other stars, Pink balances his money-making with philanthropy.  </P> <P> A pilot "Pink Says Think" campaign on college campuses has such slogans as  Exercise your mind, energize the body, and Refuse to abuse. The Panther appears  as a poised, if not preppy, college character, with sunglasses, polo shirt with  the collar turned up and vest. The message is that "you can be real cool, but  think about it while you do it," Notarides said.  </P> <P> His favorite part of this week, Pink explained in pantomime, is visiting  children in Southland hospitals, where he wins them over by patting their hands  or stroking their cheeks with a bulbous paw.  </P> <P> Tonight, he schmoozes at Ed Debevic's in Beverly Hills, at a fund-raiser for  the Starlight Foundation of Southern California, which grants wishes to  seriously ill children. Party-goers can bid for original Pink Panther animation  cels, Pink Panther ski boots and other Pink paraphernalia and eat pink  shortcake with raspberry sauce.  </P> <P> Creator Freleng, said he had not envisioned Pink's success when the cat came  out of "the end of my pencil."  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that he's lasted this long," Freleng said. But, calling Pink a  "magician and egotist" and "a sophisticated bum," Freleng said, "he's somebody  everybody would like to be like -- in front of the screen all the time -- to be  strong, to be able to push themselves to the front."  </P></p>

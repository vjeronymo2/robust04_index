			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Superfos trebles interim earnings SUPERFOS, the Danish construction, chemicals and packaging group, said advances by its packaging, road-building and chemical divisions resulted in an improved first-half 1992 pre-tax profit of DKr36m (Dollars 6.4m), compared with DKr12m in the same period last year. The group said its grain and feedstuff activities had done well in spite of poor prices and forecasts that its whole year 1992 result would be much better than 1991's DKr158m profit after tax and minorities. Superfos gave no exact estimate of its expected result for the whole of the year, but its first-half 1992 net profit after tax and minorities was DKr29m, compared with DKr10m for the same period in 1991.</p>

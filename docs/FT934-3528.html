			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Julian Hodge Bank hits Pounds 8.13m Profits of Julian Hodge Bank, the family-owned Cardiff bank, rose from Pounds 5.32m to a record Pounds 8.13m pre-tax in the year to October 31. The figure included a surplus on investment sales of Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 1.3m). The bank, which specialises in commercial and industrial lending, is chaired by Mr Julian Hodge, son of Welsh financier Sir Julian Hodge who founded the bank seven years ago. Mr Hodge said the bank had increased its deposit base by a quarter to Pounds 24.7m despite a period of low interest rates. Shareholders' funds had more than doubled since 1988 to stand at Pounds 48.4m. 'The current economic outlook is the most promising for a number of years,' he said.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (10): Surge of foreign capital - The growing multinational presence Pakistan has opened its arms to overseas investment with some of the most liberal economic policies yet seen in Asia: it has been rewarded with an inflow of foreign capital which is the envy of some of its neighbours. In the past four years, successive governments have reduced tariffs; deregulated the market; made the rupee fully convertible; and begun to sell-off state industries. The moves, encouraged by the World Bank and IMF, have resulted in a total of Dollars 1.24bn of direct investment being attracted since 1990. Portfolio investment has risen to Dollars 865m - a figure likely to rise sharply after the public listing earlier this year of Pakistan Telecommunications, the state telephone company. While foreign fund managers have been wooed by privatisation, more than 200 multinational companies have embarked on joint ventures and partial acquisitions. Their presence is reflected on the Karachi Stock Exchange, where the KSE-100 is peppered with foreign names such as ICI, Lever Brothers, Glaxo, Shell and Reckitt &amp; Colman. The government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has also signed a host of lucrative investment deals which, according to the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce, could push the total value of direct investment beyond Dollars 25bn by the end of the decade. 'It is an extremely positive environment for foreign investment,' says Mr Nisar Memon, president of the chamber. 'We've seen an acceleration which has surprised even those who said it would never happen.' The cynics point out, however, that initial contracts signed by overseas companies may not be taken up. There is also concern that the growth in portfolio investment has not been matched by any sizeable increase in direct investment. This has remained steady at Dollars 300m-Dollars 350m a year, while portfolio investment has increased from Dollars 84m in 1990 to Dollars 339m last year. 'The challenge now for the government has to be converting portfolio investment into direct investment,' says Mr Farrukh Khan, chief executive of Karachi-based BMA Capital Management. 'For that to happen there has to be better infrastructure, consistent policies and a solution to the law and order problem.' With limited reserves to spend on infrastructure projects and no end in sight to violence in Karachi, the government is in a difficult position. It has secured some invaluable investment projects - dominated by the Dollars 1.6bn Hub power project, backed by National Power of Britain and Xenel of Saudi Arabia - and others are tantalisingly close. But business leaders warn that unless it gets a grip on unrest in the commercial capital, the investment effort will be undermined. Mr Byram Avari, chairman of the diversified Avari hotels and manufacturing group, warns: 'Direct investment will suffer if disorder worsens. Pakistan may be considered too risky and companies could have trouble raising loans for developments.' There are similar concerns at ANZ Grindlays Bank, where general manager, Mr Azhar Hamid says: 'We need strong arm tactics to control the situation. If Sindh and Karachi are not stable it will be a serious blow to investor confidence.' At the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce, Mr Memon admits security measures could affect the cost of setting up in Pakistan but he takes heart from the fact that most multinationals have maintained a presence despite periodic outbreaks of violence. The government has played down the security fears, concentrating instead on its privatisation record - Rs13bn has been raised from the sale of 60 state companies - and its success in attracting investment from south-east Asia and the Pacific Rim. Its satisfaction is understandable. Toyota, Honda and Suzuki have established joint ventures; South Korea's Hyundai Motors has submitted outline plans for a plant in Lahore and, in the biggest deal yet, Hong Kong business leader Gordon Wu has signed an agreement to build an Dollars 8bn coal-fired power station. Investors in the energy sector have also stepped up their activity. Union Texas Petroleum plans to spend Dollars 173m over the next three years, while Lasmo - the UK exploration group - is moving towards full production in its Kadanwari gas field, where Dollars 180m has been invested. Mr Joel Dykstra, business co-ordinator at Lasmo's international division, says the group may consider bidding for state-owned gas facilities. National Power is looking at Pakistani privatisation issues too. Mr Philip Smith, director of treasury, says it 'would take an interest where there's an opportunity to develop a stake'. All this suggests that overseas executives are not as concerned about the law and order problem as their Pakistani counterparts, but other hurdles remain. One senior western economist in Islamabad warns that difficulties in raising debt finance could slow down the pace of investment. Concerns remain that corruption, too, may prove a powerful deterrent to some companies. One foreign executive, who asked not to be named, says his company paid Dollars 3.6m to 'fixing agents' who helped secure a lucrative deal. Emerging markets analysts in London warn that although Pakistan has stolen a march on its neighbours, growing investment opportunities in countries such as India may dent the inflow of foreign capital. 'Companies and institutions are using spare cash to chase these deals. If something deterred them or they saw better prospects elsewhere, the flow could dry up in six months,' says one analyst. Some investors are also said to have been unnerved by the government's handling of the PTC sale, which was overshadowed by errors in its prospectus and problems with voucher distribution. With Dollars 15bn of privatisations planned before the end of the decade, the government is, therefore, keen to reassure investors and has turned to the Pakistan Investment Board to help overseas companies. This provides a one-stop shop which smoothes the way through the bureaucratic maze and obtains ministerial authority for new projects. 'We market a package of incentives tailored to investors' needs,' says Mr Mohib Ullah Shah, secretary of the PIB. Citing its success in winning approval for new investment, he adds that ICI Pakistan received clearance for a Dollars 400m plant to manufacture pure terephthalic acid within 30 days. Mr Naseem Mirza, chairman of the company, was impressed. 'There was a time when that would have taken three years,' he says. 'We have overcome the problems because we've been here for a long time. New investors have more anxieties - for them it may not be so easy.'</p>

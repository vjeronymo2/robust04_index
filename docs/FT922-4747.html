			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Pay packages fall for staff transferred to Continent BRITISH COMPANIES are significantly cutting the pay packages they offer to staff transferred to jobs in continental Europe, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. This means that expatriates will no longer be able to bank all or most of their salaries while living on generous allowances or incentive payments. Most will be offered transfers abroad on terms matching those for locally recruited staff, possibly with temporary allowances to cover local housing costs and children's education. The research, by the CBI and Mercer Fraser, the consultancy, is based on a survey of nearly 200 companies. Half had a turnover of Pounds 200m or more, and half employed more than 2,000 people worldwide. Foreign-service premiums, included in the traditional packages as an incentive for working abroad, were considered no longer applicable to the Continent. Most organisations provided some sort of assistance with the housing needs of people transferred abroad, but many were considering ending this system because of its cost and to bring the housing more into line with that of locals. Companies, however, regarded assistance for the education of employees' children as sacrosanct. Miss Sue Shortland, head of the CBI's relocation group, said: 'A common salary structure will make transfers easier. However, there are serious barriers in the way - like tax, pension and social security systems.'</p>

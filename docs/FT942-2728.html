			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario targets Japanese investors with Y100bn issue The Province of Ontario achieved a minor feat yesterday, in view of current market conditions, when its Y100bn offering of seven-year bonds put it well ahead of its funding programme for the current year. According to joint lead manager Daiwa, Ontario has now raised CDollars 4bn of its borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn for 1994, although the province also expects to pre-borrow a further CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn for next year. The offering was launched during Tokyo's trading day since the bonds were targeted mainly at Japanese investors, who were attracted by the 4.40 per cent coupon. Syndicate managers said that the pricing of the bonds was aggressive when compared with other euroyen deals. For example, Italy's seven-year bonds were trading at a yield spread of around 35 to 40 basis points over Japanese government bonds. However, they pointed out that Japanese investors looked at coupon levels rather than yield spreads when they made investment decisions. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. There was talk in the market that most of the orders for Ontario's bonds went to the joint lead managers - so much so that members of the syndicate resorted to selling their allocations back to them. There were also reports that a similar situation had occurred shortly after the launch of the Kingdom of Belgium's long-awaited Dollars 500m offering of five-year eurobonds, the other main deal of the day. The pricing of Belgium's bonds, at 24 basis points over the when-issued five-year Treasury, was widely regarded as spot on. When the bonds started to trade, the spread was unchanged despite the volatility in the underlying Treasury market. The market is gearing up for Fannie Mae's first global bond offering, which is scheduled to be launched next Wednesday. Joint lead managers J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch held a conference call with syndicate members late yesterday afternoon. The offering is widely expected to raise up to Dollars 1.5bn, have a 10-year maturity and be priced to yield around 25 basis points over Treasuries.</p>

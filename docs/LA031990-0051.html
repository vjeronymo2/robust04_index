			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> COMEDY AS PAIN RELIEVER TESTED  </P> <P> Researchers will try to determine if laughter really is the best medicine by  showing comic films to about 150 nursing home residents in the Carolinas.  </P> <P> The study will use films such as those by the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields to  see whether humor reduces requests for nonprescription pain medication, said  Fran McGuire, head of the project.  </P> <P> A small-scale film study two years ago found what appeared to be "dramatic  decreases" in requests for pain medication, he said. That could have been the  result of chemical changes in the body relieving pain or the result of reduced  stress, which would reduce pain.  </P> <P> However, McGuire said that study was so limited that no conclusive findings  could be documented. The new study will attempt to broaden the scope and come  up with findings that could be used by nursing homes to improve their  residents' quality of life, he said.  </P> <P> In addition to classic comic movies, Clemson researchers will use the "I Love  Lucy" and Three Stooges television shows, said Rosangela Boyd, who tested films  at a nursing home in Seneca, S.C.  </P> <P> "They did not find modern comedies, such as 'Three Men and a Baby,' to be funny  nor did they like any of the films with offensive language," she said.  </P> <P> McGuire said he suspects classic films are preferred because they may bring  back good memories. Also, slapstick humor can be enjoyed without having to  follow a plot or understand nuances of dialogue.  </P></p>

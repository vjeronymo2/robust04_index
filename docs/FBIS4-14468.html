			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian </F> Cabinet of Ministers concerning a package of agreements on  Russian troop withdrawal signed in Moscow on 15 March]    [Text] In support of signing and ratification at the Saeima  [parliament] of the Republic of Latvia of a package of  agreements initialed at the intergovernmental negotiations  between the Republic of Latvia and the Federation of Russia on  March 15, 1994, the Government of the Republic of Latvia  stresses that signing and ratification of the agreement on  Russian troop pull-out from the territory of Latvia by August  31, 1994. After talks which had lasted for two years, for the  first time there has finally emerged a chance to solve a part of  issues which are of vital importance to Latvia, which would lead  to strengthening the sovereignty of Latvia. By stating the  deadline of Russian troop withdrawal, the chances to secure  international control of the process are considerably increased.  Signing of the agreement will show once again Latvia's  willingness to join the community of European nations as a full-  fledged member of the community. A number of countries over the  world have voiced their support of initializing the agreement,  describing it as a success of Latvian diplomacy.    Drafting an agreement on temporary operating of the Skrunda  radar base in the Republic of Latvia was a compromise, and the  Latvian Government had set a series of conditions for adopting  it, which have been accepted by the Russian part, namely,  internationalization of the site, establishing the international  control over the facility, its civil status, and security  guarantees for Latvia. The aspects have been discussed at  numerous consultations with Western countries. Signing the  agreement would rule out a possibility to put to operation the  second tier of the Skrunda radar base and would allow to launch  an immediate dismantling of the eventually most dangerous part  of the facility. An exact date for terminating the operations  of the remaining part of the Skrunda radar base, 31 August of  1998, has been stated. The Skrunda site being stationed in the  territory of Latvia without a respective agreement stating the  exact deadline for its operation, would mean uncontrollable  functioning of the facility in Latvia to last for an unspecified  period of time.    Under the agreement the Russian part would be allowed to use  only a strictly stated limited number of its own experts to  secure functioning of the site. The agreement does not envisage  any possibility to bring to the site a new equipment or  additional contingent of experts, or to carry out modernization  of the facility.    Compliance with the agreement is to be monitored by a  special  tri-lateral commission, including also representatives of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The control  over the process of carrying out the agreement exercised by the  CSCE, is not the sole guarantee, it is secured also by Latvia's  participation in the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme.  The agreement would foster cooperation opportunities between  Latvia and Western structures of collective security by showing  that Latvia is a politically mature nation which is able to  implement a compromise policy also in the interests of the  international community. Additionally to the rental to be paid  for the Skrunda radar base being stationed in Latvia, the  Russian part commits itself to compensate for the damage caused  to the local environment, if any. Persons which would arrive to  Latvia to maintain the facility, would go under the general visa  regulations.    The agreement on social status of the Russian retired  militaries and their families does not provide for their legal  position in the Republic of Latvia, which would be envisaged by  the legislation of the Republic of Latvia. The claims by the  Russian part to grant these people Latvian citizenship are ruled  out. In the agreement the Russian part commits itself to  continue payments of pensions to the retired militaries, as well  as to compensate the health service provided for these people.    The Government of Latvia admits that the agreements contain  some concessions which would bear hard on Latvia. The  government, however, maintains that stating the deadline for  Russian troop withdrawal is the top priority which would open  the door for a real pull-out of the army from the territory of  Latvia as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Falling sales to British Gas cut Victaulic to Pounds 11.8m Falling sales to British Gas helped to depress 1993 pre-tax profits at Victaulic, maker of pipeline products for the gas, water, and construction industries. Profits fell by 12.5 per cent from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 11.8m. Total turnover edged ahead from Pounds 101.2m to Pounds 101.4m, although the latest figure included Pounds 900,000 from Action Hose Couplings, acquired in August. The group said that since 1991 its sales to the UK gas industry had fallen by 47 per cent. Last year sales to British Gas declined by about Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 22m. Mr David Stewart, managing director, said yesterday that although it was now clear that British Gas would keep its pipeline distribution system, it would not be clear until autumn how much it would be able to charge independent producers to use it. 'It is difficult for British Gas to review their investment programme, and we expect no great recovery in sales to British Gas this year', he said. The group has reacted by pushing to open up new markets, and increased export sales from Pounds 9m to Pounds 15m. Exports accounted for 23 per cent of group turnover last year. Lindapter, a specialist fixings maker acquired late in 1992, contributed Pounds 4.5m to turnover, and Action Hose Couplings a further Pounds 1m. Net cash at the end of the year was up from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 14.3m, and the group is looking for further acquisitions in order to diversify from the UK water and gas sectors. Earnings per share eased from 20.3p to 18.4p. The group is proposing to lift the final dividend from 5.3p to 5.5p, making the total pay-out 8p (7.8p). Mr Stewart said the dividend rise was justifiable, given the strong balance sheet, high cover and cash generative nature of the group.</p>

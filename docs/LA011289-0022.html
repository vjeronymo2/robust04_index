			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: GETTING STEERED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  </P> <P> Question: I think I have a wheel-alignment problem on my 1986 Dodge van,  because sometimes I have to turn the steering wheel about 20 degrees to keep  the van going straight. A dealer said the steering box was defective and would  have to be replaced at a cost of $350. He claimed steering boxes are a problem  on large vans and usually need to be replaced every 40,000 miles. Your  comments, please. -- A.N.  </P> <P> Answer: The steering box or steering gear is not usually the cause of an  off-center steering position. What's more, unless the steering wheel is  pulling, an off-center wheel position may only require an inexpensive alignment  to correct.  </P> <P> A mechanic usually can center a steering wheel by adjusting the tie-rod ends  during an alignment. The steering wheel can go off center as the steering  system wears or when the front end goes out of alignment.  </P> <P> The steering gear, which converts the rotating motion of the steering column  into the lateral motion needed to turn the front wheels, can wear out. When it  does, a car or van usually will wander or weave in driving. The steering will  feel loose.  </P> <P> In the Chrysler steering system, there are two adjustments possible to correct  looseness that occurs as the gears wear out. At some point, the steering gear  cannot be adjusted any further, but that seldom occurs by 40,000 miles.  </P> <P> Q: I have a 1981 Oldsmobile 88 with a diesel engine. About every 10,000 miles,  I have to return to the dealer to have a D ring replaced in the  diesel-injection pump. It's only covered under warranty until 50,000 miles.  Isn't there some way General Motors Corp. can make a part that won't wear out?  -- W.J.  </P> <P> A: The part you refer to has troubled many diesel owners and has been  redesigned a number of times, GM officials say. The part keeps the governor  assembly on the injection pump in place. Without it, the pump doesn't work.  </P> <P> The problem has been that engine heat causes the part, made from a synthetic  material, to deteriorate. GM believes that it has solved the problem with the  D-ring design on its 1985 models. Dealers expect to soon receive the new  version of the part, so check back with your dealer again in the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> Q: I just bought a 1987 Honda Accord LX. When do I need to change the oil, and  how often do I need to change it? -- R.M.M.  </P> <P> A: The owner's manual recommends changing the oil every 7,500 miles. You should  not make the first oil change any sooner, because the manufacturer uses a  special oil in the engine to help break it in.  </P> <P> But most auto experts suggest that after the break-in period you should change  your oil more frequently. A change every 3,500 to 4,000 miles will probably  keep your engine running cleaner and longer.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ku Pon-yong] </F>   [Text] North Korea decided on 13 June to withdraw from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in response to the  international community's sanction pressure regarding the  nuclear issue, and the development is gaining public attention.    The ostensible reason for North Korea's withdrawal is to  repulse the IAEA resolution against North Korea. It can be  further interpreted that North Korea will not respond to the  international community's demand for the assurance of nuclear  transparency for the time being even if the UN Security Council  imposes sanctions.    However, it is early to determine whether the measure would  extend to North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. According to international law,  a country which has withdrawn from the IAEA could be free from  obligations as a NPT member state within 24 hours. It is highly  probable that North Korea would withdraw from the NPT judging  from North Korea's announcement that it refuses all IAEA  inspections and would regard the IAEA's demand for inspections  as a declaration of war.    The government authorities provide two different  interpretations on North Korea's strong measure. Since  sanctions by the international community are inevitable anyway,  North Korea intends to be free from the restrictions of  international organizations and proceed with the development of  nuclear weapons with its existing plutonium. The withdrawal  from the IAEA means that North Korea would not accept any ad  hoc, routine, or special inspections on its past nuclear  activities and would not be restricted by any international  organizations regarding its future nuclear programs.    On the other hand, some people believe that it is one of  North Korea's brinkmanship strategies to maximize the effect of  the nuclear card. North Korea estimates that even though it  becomes a nonmember of the IAEA, it could continue  behind-the-scene negotiations with the United States to  accomplish its goals and then return to the IAEA again. North  Korea believes only a strong measure could bring about a rapid  development of its relations with the United States.    North Korea may be gambling on reversing the situation, in  which it has brought on international sanctions by continuing  the refueling, with a single blow. The withdrawal may reflect  North Korea's intention to gain the third round of talks with  the United States or at least proceed with the development of  nuclear weapons taking hostage the ROK which wants "to avoid war  by all means."    North Korea's reaction has such a complex background that  its  focus will be revealed only after the follow-up measures,  possibly the withdrawal from the NPT or deporting of IAEA  inspectors, are taken. There is a strong prospect that North  Korea's intention may be revealed through former U.S. President  Carter, who is scheduled to pay a personal visit to the North on  15 June.</p>

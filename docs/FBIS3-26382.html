At the party, noted figures of  various democratic parties, noted personages without party  affiliation, members of the National CPPCC Committee living in  Harbin, pertinent responsible comrades of the provincial party  committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee,  and the provincial government, and patriotic figures from  various circles met together to celebrate Spring Festival.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial  party committee, paid Spring Festival calls to all figures  participating in the party and expressed heartfelt thanks and  deep respects for the hard work done in the past year by various  democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations,  nonparty figures, and the friends on various circles of society.  He said: Over the past year, the vast numbers of cadres and  the masses in the province made great efforts to study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, went all out to help implement the 12 major  events defined by the provincial party committee, around the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and  made great efforts to overcome the difficulties in systems,  structures, funds, and transportation, thus promoting economic  development, political stability, national unity, and social  progress of the province.    Sun Weiben said: In 1994, China's economic reform will step  on a new stage that is as extensive and profound as never  before. For the province's economy that has been seriously  bound up by the traditional planned economic structure, it will  be a new opportunity of development. It requires the people  throughout the province and the figures on all circles to  enhance morale and surmount difficulties with one heart and one  mind in an effort to make Heilongjiang vigorous and strong.    Sun Weiben expressed hope that all democratic parties,  industrial and commercial federations, and nonparty personages  would utilize their wide contacts with domestic and overseas  areas and their advantages in talents and knowledge to make new  contributions to invigorating Heilongjiang's economy and bring  benefits to Heilongjiang's people.

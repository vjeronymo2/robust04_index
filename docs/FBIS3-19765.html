			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- North Rhine-Westphalian  Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor has called for an immediate  stop of all arms deliveries to Turkey. In an interview with DPA  on Saturday [19 March] the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] politician said that, in view of the Ankara regime's  escalating military attacks against the Kurdish people, the  federal government must impose a complete arms embargo.    Otherwise, the minister said, "Germany will be contributing  to Turkey's slide into a maelstrom of military violence from  which it will not be able to escape." Schnoor stressed:  "Anyone who supplies military weapons to a NATO partner without  making sure that these weapons are not used against minorities  in this partner's country gives people reason to flee instead of  eliminating such reasons."    The SPD politician emphasized: "A tragedy is taking place in  southeast Turkey that will not be without effect on the internal  peace of our country." According to him, many more than 70,000  mostly Kurdish refugees have come from Turkey to Germany over  the past there years. This corresponds to the number of  inhabitants in a city like Castrop-Rauxel in the Ruhr area. At  the same time, the recognition quota for asylum applications is  higher than for any other primary country of origin.    Against the background of escalating conflicts between the  Turkish army and the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is  also becoming increasingly violent in Germany, Schnoor warned  the Turkish Government "to give political reason priority over  military operations."    On the occasion of the forthcoming Kurdish New Year Nevruz,  the minister appealed to Kurds in Germany not to let themselves  be tempted to commit criminal acts, neither by the PKK nor by  other organizations. The celebrations will begin next Monday  and will probably be held throughout Germany until mid-week.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Minorco jumps 43% after operational shake-up Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted natural resources company controlled by the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, had been firmly established as an operating, rather than a holding company, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said yesterday. In spite of relatively weak metals prices for nearly all of the past 12 months, he reported that Minorco's operating earnings jumped by 43 per cent from USDollars 139.8m to a re-stated Dollars 200.5m. Earnings before tax for the 12 months to June 30 were lower at Dollars 308.8m, against Dollars 340m, because of reduced financial income and earnings from equity accounted investments as well as higher exploration expenditure. Minorco was finally transformed into an operating company during the past year by the transaction which merged into it the international, non-diamond interests of Anglo American and De Beers. The new assets included a wide range of natural resource and industrial interests in South America, European paper and packaging interests managed by Mondi European Holdings, Cleveland Potash, the UK's only potash mine, and a portfolio of investments based in South East Asia and Australia - most notably a 19.9 per cent interest in Normandy Poseidon, one of Australia's biggest gold producers. The company also bought a 50 per cent interest with Mondi in Aylesford Newsprint, which has started a Pounds 250m expansion project in the UK, while its Terra offshoot is to acquire for Dollars 400m the Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals group, more than doubling Terra's production of nitrogen fertilisers and establishing it as a major methanol producer. Minorco, looking to expand its shareholder base and improve its international profile, has converted its unsponsored American depositary receipt programme into a sponsored programme by appointing Morgan Guaranty Trust as sole depositary. Earnings before extraordinary items were down from Dollars 251.9m to Dollars 221.9m or from Dollars 1.12 a share to 99 cents. Profit after extraordinary items was Dollars 226.3m, against Dollars 339.7m. Minorco is paying a second unchanged interim dividend of 38 cents. In order to change to calendar year accounting, the company is reporting for an 18-month period to end-December. It intends to pay a final dividend of no less than 38 cents.</p>

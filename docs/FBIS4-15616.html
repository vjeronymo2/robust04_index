			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia may have army bases in former Soviet  republics only under formal lease agreements. The republics  where it will have bases are to retain ownership of the leased  territory and property. A worker on the staff of Ukrainian  President Kravchuk said that in an interview with Interfax. The  man preferred to remain unidentified.    The Kravchuk Administration felt the naval facilities of  Sevastopol could be leased to Russia but must still be regarded  as Ukrainian naval facilities on lease to Russia. If they were  regarded as Russian property, said the unidentified  Administration spokesman, the situation would compare to that  around the Guantanamo base in Cuba.    In the meantime, chief Aleksandr Kluban of the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry's press service told Interfax-Ukraine that the  deployment of Russian armymen outside Russia was not Ukraine's  headache. He said Russia had so far made no such proposition to  his republic.</p>

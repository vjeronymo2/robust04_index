			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baku, 25 May -- For the first time since the  split which occurred two weeks ago following the withdrawal of  15 members of parliament [MPs] in protest against the signing by  the republic of the Bishkek protocol, the sitting of the  National Assembly of Azerbaijan started this afternoon with a  full quorum.    Speaking on behalf of the "rebel" MPs, Tofik Gasymov, who  had  been foreign minister under the Elchibey regime, explained that  their decision to return to the meeting hall was taken in order  "not to provide any more reason to the authorities for slander  and blackmail." However, he stated, the group of MPs he  represents remain of the same opinion. "We are against not only  the Bishkek protocol, but also the introduction of Russian  troops into the region in the guise of CIS peace-making forces,"  he stressed. The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict should be  settled, in his view, within the framework of the United Nations  and the CSCE. He also feels that to solve this complex problem  it is necessary to return to the trilateral peace initiative of  Russia, Turkey, and the United States. As for separation forces  and international observers, the MP is convinced that they can  be brought in and stationed in the conflict zone, but only after  the appropriate decision by the UN Security Council.    More hardline was the speech by Etibar Mammadov, the leader  of the influential opposition party--National Independence of  Azerbaijan--who announced his resignation as a member of the  National Assembly. According to his assertion, over recent days  the republic has seen a campaign of blackmail unfolding against  the opposition, which differs from the authorities in approaches  to settling the conflict.

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Central banks of main industrial countries should assist Russia by stabilising external value of rouble Sir, Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister of the Russian federation and minister of economics and finance, in his article, 'Russia needs three kinds of economic aid - and quickly' (January 22), appealed for western funds to help stabilise or peg the external value of the rouble. Western advisers have proposed a rouble stabilisation fund of between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 6bn. I recommend that the task of stabilising the external value of the rouble be assigned for the foreseeable future to the central banks of the main industrial countries. Monetary and fiscal control are necessary conditions for stabilising the internal and external value of a currency. Let us assume that Russia succeeds in creating a fiscal framework consistent with the non-inflationary financing of essential public expenditures and a central bank capable of delivering tight money it has yet to achieve either). Those with unbounded confidence in the operation of markets might argue that no stabilisation fund for the rouble would then be required. If the rouble is left to float freely, there is no need for intervention and therefore no need for a stabilisation fund. The rouble will find its market value which (by definition) is also its equilibrium value. This argument does not stand up. Until the credibility of a framework of monetary restraint and fiscal prudence is established (and this will take time) a freely floating exchange rate makes no sense, especially in a country with no informative history in which to anchor exchange rate expectations. Intervention to peg the rouble at some target value will therefore be necessary. It does not, however, follow that Russia must possess a fund of convertible currencies. Someone must be willing to intervene, but that someone need not, and in my view initially should not be, the central bank of the Russian Federation. All necessary intervention can be performed by the central banks of the main western industrial countries acting in concert, perhaps through a single agent. The Bundesbank comes to mind. The Russian central bank should pursue monetary targets consistent with non-inflationary growth. Those managing the western rouble stabilisation fund would buy or sell roubles in exchange for a basket of convertible currencies to stabilise the value of the rouble in terms of the Ecu, the SDR or some other currency basket. This scheme does not require placing billions of dollars-worth of foreign exchange under the immediate control of a Russian institution with an atrocious record of monetary irresponsibility. In addition, the western rouble stabilisation fund would not suffer from credibility problems and speculative attacks, since it would be backed by the combined resources and records of the western industrial countries. As Russia achieves monetary and fiscal respectability, its central bank can build up its international reserves and begin to share in the interventions in the rouble market.

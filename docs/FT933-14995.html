			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Private View: Change of keeper for the giant panda THERE IS a toy panda for sale in the lobby, a baby gorilla and a cuddly fruit-bat. The garden outside has been allowed to grow wild - to the vexation of neighbours. The office in the Swiss commuter village of Gland, mid-way between Geneva and Lausanne, is the innocent-looking habitat of the international secretariat of the World Wide Fund for Nature. Inside, the fur has been flying. A series of revelations and criticisms over the past five years have clouded the reputation of the world's biggest wildlife charity. Tired of the battle, Charles de Haes, director-general of the WWF, is stepping down. In his place the trustees and their president the Duke of Edinburgh have chosen his deputy, Dr Claude Martin, a Swiss biologist. The conservation movement is a political jungle. Under de Haes, a businessman originally seconded from Rothman's, the South African tobacco company, the WWF has taken a pragmatic rather than purist line: it negotiates with unpopular Third World governments and accepts money from industry and official aid agencies. But it has also been accused of wasting money, for example on an unsuccessful panda-breeding project in China. There have been rows with national organisations and the US branch withheld funds. In the late 1980s a senior WWF official was involved in a freelance operation in which British mercenaries, funded by former WWF president Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, were supposed to infiltrate the rhino-horn smugglers. A cull of the rare Peruvian vicuna, agreed by the WWF, turned out to have no scientific justification and the director-general was accused of negotiating for the rifles. Dr Martin seems more the tree-hugging type. Although he inherits a salary reported to be Pounds 100,000 a year and is proficient in the conservationist jargon - in three languages, moreover - he has also worked in the field, which makes him popular with the staff. He separates his domestic rubbish, drives a seven-year-old Renault and though living only 12 minutes from the office takes the train in order to conserve the planet's natural resources. I asked him if he would get a limousine when he takes over in October. He found it funny. 'A very long black one, like one of these American things that never stop?', he laughed. 'Great]' When I asked what changes he would be making, he retreated into bureaucratic imprecision. He mentioned decentralisation, keeping the family of national WWF bodies on the same track, scrutinising the value of aid agency money, and 'the need to focus resources.' Forests are his first love and he will accelerate the WWF's shift of emphasis away from furry animals towards their habitats and the needs of their human occupants. In 1991-92, the WWF's total income recovered to over SFr50bn (Pounds 22.10bn), but legacies and individual donations more than halved, falling for the second year running. I suggested that the WWF was also losing the war to save the animals for whose survival people give money. The panda, for instance . . . 'But look what happened in China,' he replied. 'China does not consist only of pandas. It is a huge country of great biodiversity. The panda for us, besides being our emblem, was a way to become active there. Because we had access there is a tremendous environmental debate in China today.' So it was worth it even if the panda disappears from the wild? 'It was definitely worth embarking on. A species is very often a point of entry into a wider conservation debate.' Even if that species doesn't survive? 'Even if the status of a species gets worse and worse.' He claimed the 30-year-old project to save the Bengal tiger had been a success, becoming a forest conservation programme to help many other species besides the tiger, whose numbers had doubled in 20 years. Species have been dying out for millions of years, I said. Is there any reason apart from sentiment why we should bother to preserve the ones close to extinction? 'You know, this question is often posed to us. I think a lot of people have confused two things. There have always been extinction rates but what we are experiencing now is a much more man-induced change in biodiversity.' 'Biodiversity', like 'sustainable development', is a big buzz-word in the conservation movement. It is often employed to suggest that somewhere in the Brazilian jungle there lurks a cure for cancer. I suggested that in a world full of laboratory medicines it was a weak argument for saving the rainforest. 'I agree with you. For two reasons: people down there (in the rainforest) would not preserve it for the sake of finding some strange plant. Secondly, it falls flat on emotional grounds. Most people want to preserve tropical forest because it means something to them, because it has a value, an ethical value, not for some utilitarian possibility.' But what is the real difference between human pressure and a giant meteorite wiping out the dinosaurs? 'In an evolutionary process one species normally is replaced by another. If you have artificial destruction, like burning a tropical forest, everything goes. This is really the threat to biodiversity worldwide, that there might be a much faster breakdown not just of species numbers, but whole eco-systems. What happens if the marine eco-system breaks down?' Our children are environmental militants, I said. You have been brainwashing them and they give you money. Shouldn't you be teaching them about birth control, not saving tigers and pandas? 'We are not the International Planned Parenthood Federation. On the other hand we are making the link quite clearly to population numbers', Martin replied. Family planning did not work unless people had stable livelihoods, which in turn depended on managing their resources. 'I studied forest conservation in west Africa. You start to realise this layer of vegetation is not just a kind of living space or a place where people can hunt and gather, it is far more. It is a part of their culture. It becomes equivalent to social stability in their whole community. This is extremely interesting.' I am sure it is interesting, I said, but the truth is most people don't live in forests. They live in slums on the edge of cities, or they are migrating to cities. 'Ninety per cent of the Indian population is rural. Yours is very much the perception of a tourist who sees Delhi and Bombay. The majority of the African population is rural.' Aren't you trying to stop the evolutionary clock and at the same time arrest what the Third World sees as development - factories, houses, cities? 'We are not against that. It's wrong to say we trying to halt evolution or that we want to preserve the world as a huge museum.' I asked Martin why, if local people's interests were important, the WWF had supported the ban on the ivory trade. He said the decision was practical not theological. Few African countries could control the culling of their elephants. Talking to local people about land management is one thing, I said, but persuading the Chinese not to buy tigers' penises or the Japanese not to kill whales is another. 'This is the linchpin of the whole ivory debate. You can't possibly talk to every Chinese and convince him with education programmes.' The only hope was to persuade governments: Japan had been persuaded to ban ivory and China had said it might restrict some as yet unspecified imports. Was there a moral imperative to save the environment? Martin replied that apocalyptic forecasts, the product of 'linear thinking', had been discredited. In the late 1970s he had forecast that by 1990 there would not be a tree left standing in Malaysia. 'So a lot of people stopped looking in a statistical way. Our position is a moral one. We have a responsibility not just for humans' sake but for what people perceive as being the Creation.' You mean, your new pitch is 'our figures may be all wrong but our moral message is wonderful'? Martin laughed amiably. 'No, that would be too extreme. We are talking of the ethics of conservation.' What is the moral justification for saving the angonoka tortoise? 'It would be inappropriate if I said that's the solution to saving the world. It is a very tiny bit of it.' How does it contribute to the bigger solution? 'It enables us to establish possibilities how to save species in general. My first project was similar.' After the University of Zurich, Martin went to Kanha National Park in central India to save the Barasingha deer. 'I got engaged in a fascinating ecological problem which took me far beyond the deer but in the end provided a solution to save that species as well. A species disappearing is only the tip of the iceberg. Once you have an understanding of what goes wrong you can do many more things. The result was a total review of the management of all the forest areas in central India.' So where a species dies out under pressure from man, its disappearance is a symptom of an ailment in the system which will damage man himself? 'Ultimately, yes.' During a two-day retreat at Assisi in 1986 the WWF got declarations of support from leaders of five world religions. Martin described himself as a non-religious biologist, adding: 'Even with the most fantastic evolutionary theories you can't explain everything. So Creation is a very useful substitute. This is where I believe this feeling of moral obligation comes from.' So the real impetus of the movement is an ethical one? 'I think there is an ethical imperative for conservation. When I was dealing with tropical forests it struck me that people here, mostly never having been in a tropical rainforest, have an extremely strong emotional tie to the notion of a fantastic tropical world full of species. They almost have a tropical forest in their own belly. 'You can ask why. It has to do with childhood, with fantasies. Fantasy is an extremely important question: maybe there was at some time an evolutionary tie of humanity to forests. There is something very, very special about the notion of forests.' Was that your primary motivation? 'Difficult to say. Yes, I had fantasises as a child. I had dreams of far-away places, adventure. But I also had parents who were out-door people and knew a lot about nature and species.' Is this ethic what keeps you sitting at your desk? 'It's certainly a strong motivation. But I also believe we can show how the world's resources can be conserved.' Claude Martin is an optimist. It will need more than optimism to put the fur back on the panda.</p>

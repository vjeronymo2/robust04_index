			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK LABELED 'EVIL MONSTER' IN BAIL HEARING  </P> <P> Calling Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick an "evil monster," her ex-husband's  brother urged a San Diego Superior Court judge Thursday to deny bail to the La  Jolla socialite.  </P> <P> If Betty Broderick -- who stands accused of murdering her ex-husband and his  new wife -- is freed on bail, she is likely to contact her two sons, the  younger two of her four children, which would "destroy them emotionally," said  Larry Broderick, a Denver-area forest products executive.  </P> <P> Larry Broderick also claimed at a brief hearing Thursday that Betty Broderick  has threatened him and the two boys -- who now live with his ex-wife in  Colorado -- with physical harm. He said Betty Broderick is an "evil monster in  a harmless-looking package who will murder again if given an opportunity."  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan put off a decision on bail until  next Tuesday.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick, 43, who did not speak at Thursday's hearing, faces two counts  of murder in the Nov. 5, 1989 shooting deaths of her ex-husband, Daniel T.  Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick.  </P> <P> After a monthlong trial, a San Diego Superior Court jury announced Nov. 20 that  they were deadlocked, 10 for murder, two for manslaughter. Prosecutors have  indicated that Betty Broderick will be tried again.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Jack Earley argued at Thursday's hearing that Betty Broderick  should not face first-degree murder charges at a second trial because jurors  told him they had decided against that charge.  </P> <P> To lodge first-degree charges again would violate the guarantee against double  jeopardy, Earley contended.  </P> <P> Whelan put off deciding that unusual request until next Tuesday, too.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, the prosecutor in the case, said Tuesday that  she would oppose any reduction in charges or bail for Betty Broderick.  </P></p>

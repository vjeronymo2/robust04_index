			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, May 16 (AFP) -- A local all-news FM radio  station was off the air Monday in unexplained circumstances.    Reliable sources said transmissions were halted following  harsh criticism of the military during a talk show on THE NATION  radio at the weekend. Reached by telephone, the armed forces  spokesman, Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani,  categorically denied the military had ordered the station to  shut down.    Calls to the radio station went unanswered Monday, and staff  members at The Nation daily, which provides programming to the  station, said they did not want to discuss the issue. One  employee described the situation as "sensitive." Another  station said management of THE NATION radio had indicated the  station was shut for three days for "maintenance."    Reliable sources said management of the radio station would  meet Monday evening with officials of the Army's Territorial  Defense department, which has the rights to the frequency on  which the station broadcasts.</p>

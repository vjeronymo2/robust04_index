			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Coles Myers advances over year COLES Myers, the Australian retail group, yesterday reported an 8 per cent increase in operating profit to ADollars 598.7m (USDollars 394.1m), before abnormal items, for the year ended July 25. After tax and abnormal items, the increase was slightly higher - up 11.1 per cent to ADollars 411.8m. Sales, adjusted for the sale of the majority of Coles Myer's interest in Progressive Enterprises and Sandhurst Dairies, rose by 3.7 per cent to ADollars 15.2bn. On an unadjusted basis, sales were essentially flat. The retailer said that it was pleased with the results, given the recessionary climate. The strongest performances came from the Kmart, Target and specialty group divisions. Coles admitted that the profits from its supermarkets division were only 'marginally' ahead of last year, but that performance here had strengthened in the second half of the year. The Myer Grace Bros department stores, however, saw lower profits and weaker margins - a trend blamed on the 'reduced levels of discretionary spending'. Coles said that sales for the year overall were steady, but that turnover had been disappointing in the final three months of the financial year. Coles added that the 'signs of economic recovery are still tentative' and conceded that the effect of this hesitant upturn on its own operations was 'uneven'. However, it suggested that the previously-announced investment plan should help sustain future performance. Lend Lease, the financial services and property investment group, yesterday announced that it was buying the Yarmouth Group, a US-based asset management business. Yarmouth has around ADollars 10bn in gross property assets under management and manages client portfolios worth around ADollars 6.5bn. Among its interests is the management of some 15 regional malls in the US, whose gross value is put at USDollars 2bn-plus. No price was announced for the acquisition, and Lend Lease said the consideration would be related to performance and payable over a five-year period.</p>

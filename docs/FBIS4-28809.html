			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Mitsui and Co., Japan's  giant trading house, will look into the possibility of a 400  million dollar liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) project in Vietnam  in conjunction with three foreign partners, a Mitsui official  said Friday [10 June].    The three other parties involved are Vietnam's public oil  company PetroVietnam, British Gas PLC and TransCanada Pipelines  Ltd., the official said.    Depending on the result of a feasibility study to be  conducted soon, the parties involved in the project will set up  a joint concern as early as this year to explore natural gas  flowing out of an oil field off the southern Vietnamese coast.    The project calls for laying a 130-kilometer pipeline  linking  the oil field with an LPG plant in Vung Tau, southeast of Ho Chi  Minh City.    Production is slated to begin in the latter half of 1996 at  the earliest, with annual production of some 260,000 tons  intended for export to Japan, China and Southeast Asia as well  as for use at local power plants, the official added.</p>

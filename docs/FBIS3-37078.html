In a press interview the Armenian president claimed that 500  Turkish officers and some 1,000 officers and noncommissioned  officers from the former Soviet republics are currently training  the new Azerbaijani Army, which has recently achieved some  success in the war, which has been going on for six years.    Levon Ter-Petrosyan says that he has received assurances  from  London that there are no British "mercenaries" with the  Azerbaijan Armed Forces. There have been reports that Western  oil companies which have interests in Azerbaijan are recruiting  Britons to help the Baku government recover the land it has lost  to the Armenians.    According to Western sources, the Armenians are occupying  about 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. Nearly 1 million  Azerbaijanis, that is one-sixth of the country's population,  have been driven out of their cities and villages. Many of them  are refugees on the border with Iran.    Ter-Petrosyan said that the West and Russia must work  together to end the conflict before it expands to include the  entire region.    Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concludes a four-day  visit to Britain today. At a working breakfast yesterday the  president answered questions put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT:    [Taheri] What is the aim of your visit to London?    [Ter-Petrosyan] The main aim of my visit is to ask British  Prime Minister John Major to raise the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh  during his upcoming visit to Moscow. He has agreed to renew  peace endeavors.    [Taheri] What exactly do you want to see happen in  Nagorno-Karabakh?    [Ter-Petrosyan] The ideal formula is for the people of  Nagorno-Karabakh to obtain their right to self-determination.  However, I am aware that the ideal formula cannot always be  achieved. This is why we are looking for a compromise formula  to end the war. We proposed that this aim be attained in three  stages: First, a cease-fire. Second, consolidating the legal  status of Nagorno-Karabakh through international arbitration,  and that should be done in a manner that does not allow  Azerbaijan to revoke or reverse the decision. And finally,  lifting the blockade Azerbaijan is imposing on Armenia so as to  coincide with the Armenian forces' withdrawal from the  Azerbaijani territory it is currently occupying.    [Taheri] You maintain that your government is not  interfering in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. In what circumstances  will you intervene?    [Ter-Petrosyan] An all-out war will take place if the  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh are exposed to the danger of mass  deportation or mass murder.    [Taheri] Is that likely to happen?    [Ter-Petrosyan] I hope not. But we have behind us a stormy  and harsh history and we must always be on our guard.    [Taheri] Did you expect the current state of war and the  terrible suffering inflicted on all parties when you set up the  "Nagorno-Karabakh Committee" some six years ago?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Looking back from today's position often  sheds a different light on historic events. However, let me  tell you that we did not invent the Nagorno-Karabakh problem.  It has existed since Stalin decided to offer it as a gift to  Azerbaijan in 1921. The situation was going to explode there  whether or not Armenia made a move.    [Taheri] It seems that you want a special role for Russia  in the region. Does that mean the effective return of "big  brother" to the field?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Yes. I must say that I understand that.  There are Russian forces in all the former Soviet republics  except Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia will return  because it can see that other players are trying to control its  zones of influence.    [Taheri) What do you mean by "other players?"    [Ter-Petrosyan] NATO forces, and regionally Turkey and Iran.    [Taheri] How would you assess these players' role?    [Ter-Petrosyan] The United States accepts Russia playing a  peacekeeping role -- which is important. But Turkey and Iran  have not achieved what they had hoped to achieve years ago, for  example.    [Taheri] What about your relationship with Iran and Turkey?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Iran is a friendly state and a close  partner. I am confident that that our relationship will deepen  further. Iran has been neutral in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue,  even though its public opinion naturally sympathizes with their  Shiite Muslims in Azerbaijan. The West sees Iran as a state  exporting fundamentalism. But it is in our region. Although it  is an Islamic republic, it does not side with the Azerbaijani  Shiites, whereas Turkey --- the secular government -- is 100  percent behind Azerbaijan. We want normal relations with  Turkey, because it is our neighbor. But Turkish leaders -- so  it seems -- cannot act against the feelings aroused against us  by the media services and other pressure groups there.  Nevertheless, we will not give up hope. We wish to establish  normal relations, regardless of the harsh past.    [Taheri] You dealt with several Azerbaijani presidents,  including Ayaz Mutalibov, Geydar Aliyev, and Abdulfaz Elchibey.  What is your opinion of these men?    [Ter-Petrosyan] We had positive dealings with Mutalibov, but  he was overthrown. Elchibey was the best one for us, because he  angered both Iran and Russia, thus imposing isolation on  himself. He naively played the Turkish nationalism card. Aliyev  is the more intelligent and experienced. And he is trying to  repair relations between Iran and Russia.    [Taheri] What is the role of oil in this conflict?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Azerbaijan has oil, and we get nothing from  it. The West and Russia are interested in Azerbaijan's oil --  which is understood. But utilizing oil sources requires  securing peaceful conditions first. Which is why everyone is  seeking to end the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.    [Taheri] You are subject to an Azerbaijani blockade. Where  do you obtain vital supplies from?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Through Iran and Georgia by land and air.  Of course, what we get is not sufficient, and our economy is  suffering as a result of this situation. The blockade has  prevented us from rebuilding what the earthquakes destroyed in  cities and villages and putting the wheel of industry on the  right track again. Our people are suffering a great deal. This  reality is being exploited by former communists and other  enemies of democracy.    [Taheri] I sense from your statements that you are  pessimistic. Are we to understand that economic difficulties  are compelling you to take a reconciliatory position on  Nagorno-Karabakh?    [Ter-Petrosyan] We have economic difficulties, but I am not  broke. As for the reconciliatory position, we agreed on the  framework set by the peace agreement in Minsk, and we insist on  its speedy implementation. Our region needs peace more than  anything else today. Everyone in our region wants peace.    [Taheri] A personal question: You and Kyrgyzstan President  Askar Akayev are the only presidents in the former Soviet  republics who have never been affiliated to the Comminist Party.  Do you feel lonely and isolated at present?    [Ter-Petrosyan] Even Akayev was a member of the Communist  Party, but he was not among the high cadre. So I am really  lonely. But all the people of Armenia support me.</p>

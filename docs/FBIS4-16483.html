			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [N. Prokofyeva video report from Chita; from the "Utro" </F> program]    [Text] [Prokofyeva] We have become wiser now and we know  that if a number is attached to the name of a city it means it  is a closed facility of military significance. We are in  Chita-46, the home of missile forces. It was here that some of  the missiles were destroyed in the presence of U.S. observers.  How many remain? Naturally we do not have an answer to this  question, but of course the most modern ones, the latest  generation remain. Here in the forest one of the missiles was  stored in a special silo. We also do not know where the  remaining ones are stored today.    Strange incompatible things seem to coexist in our lives  today. Right here in the forest you can also find the hothouses  where the military and their families grow vegetables and  potatoes to survive. If previously, towns of this sort had a  special status and received special supplies, now this is no  longer true, and wages are being delayed here just like  everywhere else. One can probably get used to anything, even to  the fact that your neighbors are missiles with nuclear warheads.  Nevertheless, people want guarantees of their safety and of  their children. This is understandable.    [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] What safety guarantees are  there?    [V.A. Kornauk, head of the town's administration] Safety  guarantees lie in the reliability of our weapons, the work of  high-class specialists, and the fact that work is carried out in  strict accordance with instructions and by people who know their  job. Any danger to the surrounding population, as I know and  understand it, is excluded. [end recording]    [Prokofyeva] However physicians have their own opinion on  this score. Facilities of this sort were always under the  control of the Third Main Administration of the Ministry of  Health which dealt with professionals. Neither medical services  nor rural, rayon, or city physicians had access to their  information. This was the reason for numerous tragedies around  such places as Semipalatinsk, Chelyabinsk, Novaya Zemlya, and  other similar places, and there are more of them in Russia than  we know.    [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] Aleksey Yakovlevich, so you  feel the radiation situation is a real problem?    [A. Ya. Miloserdov, chief state medical physician of Chita  Oblast] The first domestic uranium was mined in our oblast and  an underground nuclear explosion was carried out in our oblast  in the past. Two military districts operate in our oblast with  all the subsequent consequences, and according to our data about  220 natural radioactive anomalies have been established in our  oblast. Scientists of the Siberian branch of the Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences worked here recently and they found  that the people of Baley city, for example, have considerable  depressed health reserves. In particular abnormalities are  common as well as problems with cancer and immune deficiencies.  If you compare immunology charts of people who live in the  Semipalatinsk test range region with those here, the local ones  are much worse. This is why together with the Committee for  Ecology and the oblast administration we have formed a program  of urgent measures to normalize the radiation situation. This  program has passed its first expert examination in the Ministry  of Ecology and it has been mostly approved. We are now  completing it and will present it to the expert commission for  adoption. This should give us the necessary funds. I think  questions of rehabilitation of ill people in these regions will  also be addressed. In particular, we must very seriously and  comprehensively work out a plan for the rehabilitation of  children from these places. [end recording]</p>

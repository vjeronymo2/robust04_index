			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rapid growth for Mayflower Mayflower, the specialist automotive engineering group, increased its pre-tax profits by 48 per cent from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 3.51m in the first half. Group turnover rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 48.2m). Mayflower has grown rapidly since 1991 following the acquisition of Motor Panels and last year of International Automotive Design (IAD). It is raising its interim dividend to 0.5p per share from 0.45p a year ago. Its share price fell yesterday by 1p to close at 62p per share. Sales volumes increased in most of the group's product lines and will be helped by the launch earlier this year of the Rover 400 Tourer estate car and the High Cube Ford Transit van for which Mayflower provides body parts from its Motor Panels operations in Coventry and Wigan respectively. Sales in the second half will also be supported by the start of production of the Aston Martin DB7 luxury sports car for which Mayflower is supplying the welded bodies. Motor Panels sales in the US in the first six months rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 24.4m from Pounds 18.5m in the same period a year ago helped by the strong growth in the US heavy truck market. Motor Panels at Coventry increased sales in the first half by 38 per cent to Pounds 20.1m. The IAD businesses achieved a turnover of Pounds 16m in the first half with an underlying growth of more than 20 per cent. Mayflower has invested Pounds 16m to date in a 'major engineering programme'.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Phone call links the networks FOR many small or medium-sized companies the expense and complexity of setting up a wide area network to link personal computers which are on different sites is off-putting. The answer, according to Technology Concepts, of Cwmbran, could be a box which enables the two machines to communicate over the ordinary phone line exactly as if they were connected together using the company's own network. The Welsh company has developed the PCC/MX unit to connect to the PC in the head office. From there it can communicate over the phone line with a variety of different terminal types - factory data collection units, cash machines, banking terminals or even machine tools. The processing unit takes up 4 Kbytes of the PC's memory. Technology Concepts: UK, 0633 872611.</p>

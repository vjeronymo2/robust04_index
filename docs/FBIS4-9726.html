			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential </F> candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, and  his wife by an unidentified reporter at the Zedillo home in  Mexico City; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Zedillo] Well, we are a normal family, nothing  special. We are a very united family as I am certain all  Mexican families are. We love each other very much. We have  been married for many years; we got married very young. We have  been married for almost 20 years; our 20th anniversary will be  in May. My wife has always been at my side, giving me her  support in everything. I would like to tell you that we met  when we were students; she was also an economics student. She  was my student. In the first class I taught at the Higher  Economics School, she was my student. I must confess, however,  that before she was my student she was my girlfriend, we had met  before. Fortunately, she was in the first group I was assigned  at the school.    She has done everything with me. When we went to study in  the  United States, she gave me a great deal of support. These were  times of hard work, of big challenges. She has always been at  my side encouraging me to make a big effort. She has supported  me during my whole career. She has not only been a wife; she  has been my friend, and many times she has been my adviser, this  is very comforting. Above all, she made a decision many years  ago. She was a very good student but she put set aside her  profession to do this. The family you see here, these five  children who we love very much are the reason for our existence.  She left behind her profession to build something that for both  of us represents a great deal of happiness, that is, these  children.    We are a normal family, we are not anything special and this  is what makes us a family like any other. We participate  together in many activities, within many time constraints. You  mentioned sports. Well, this is known because my sons Ernesto,  Emiliano, Carlos, and I are members of a mountain bicycle club.  We practice or we attempt to practice this with some  regularity. This is why we are seen riding around on bicycles.    Something that characterizes Mexicans is that the family  concept is not limited to the immediate family, parents and  children. We have what is called an extended family. Three  years ago we went to Colima -- my wife is from Colima -- where a  family reunion was held as practically all her family resides  there. The number of people assembled was impressive; the number  of cousins and uncles. This really appeared to be a political  meeting; which in fact we did turn it into as we had invited the  then candidate for Colima governor. He was impressed to see so  many people from one family.    [Reporter] So you have many votes in the family?    [Zedillo] Well, yes; I hope they will vote for me. I have to  make sure, I will have to conduct an effective campaign among  the family members, right? I hope all of them will help me in  that respect.    [Mrs. Zedillo] Ernesto said something that I appreciate. He  said I was a good student. The truth is that I enjoyed economics  very much. There are some subjects that I like very much. I  believe that by being at home, I have had the opportunity to  read. Now, I like literature, history. I think a housewife does  not have to separate herself from such things as learning. When  I had my children, I had to quit working, but I like it. Staying  at home is also a profession. It takes some effort, it entails  much devotion, and one must be determined to do it. I like it,  that is why I did it.    I come from the provinces, and early in the century,  families  were very large in the provinces. My father comes from a family  of 11 brothers and sisters, and so does my mother, and there are  all of their cousins. It is a large family. Ernesto also comes  from a large family. Of course, they will help us.</p>

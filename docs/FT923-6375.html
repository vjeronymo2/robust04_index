			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Base tax on public results Sir, The most effective way to minimise the creative accounting described by Terry Smith in his book, Accounting for Growth, is to charge corporation tax based on a company's published accounts, as in Germany. This point was explored by David Waller ('Germans draw line at two sets of accounts', March 19). The Anglo-American world now has one set of accounts for investors and another for the tax man. There would need to be an adjustment period of about five years to change to a single set of accounts. But a bonus would be more management attention to real organic growth than to financial engineering. George Copeman, Moonraker, Batts Lane, Marehill, Pulborough, West Sussex RH20 2ED</p>

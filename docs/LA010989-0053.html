			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFC CHAMPIONSHIP: 49ERS 28, BEARS 3;  </P> <P> BENGALS, 49ERS BOLT INTO SUPER BOWL;  </P> <P> DESPITE COLD, MONTANA AND RICE COOK UP AN NFC TITLE  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers, those Nanooks of the north (California), cut through  frost-biting winds and teeth-chattering reputations to put an end to a few  myths and the Chicago Bears on Sunday, winning the National Football Conference  title with a chilling, if not thrilling, 28-3 win at Soldier Field.  </P> <P> The team that won the title here did it in the face of 29-m.p.h. winds and  temperatures that dipped to a wind-chill factor of minus-26 degrees, freezing  the sweat on players' faces.  </P> <P> "After the first quarter, my feet were frozen," 49er defensive end Larry  Roberts said. "I couldn't feel my feet."  </P> <P> And it figured.  </P> <P> The 49ers came east with images as wine tasters of football, admirers of fine  food and finesse offense. They lugged some 1,500 pounds of cold-weather  equipment to Chicago -- rubber-soled shoes, anti-cold creams, bun warmers.  </P> <P> They came east with history's deck stacked against them. The 49ers hadn't won a  road playoff game in 18 years. No NFC team had won a title on the road since  the 1979 season.  </P> <P> But figuring perhaps they were the better team, the 49ers came anyway, and  warmed themselves by hurdling through the Chicago defense, trouncing the Bears  on their field, in what was supposed to be Bear weather.  </P> <P> "If they're so tough," 49er cornerback Tim McKyer was saying afterward, "why  did all that happen?"  </P> <P> What happens next is the 49ers, in a rematch of the 1982 Super Bowl, will face  the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl Jan. 22 at Miami.  </P> <P> The Miami climate will be welcome.  </P> <P> But even though the 49ers' feet were most certainly cold Sunday, it didn't mean  they jumped into the game with cold feet.  </P> <P> Ignoring thermometers and numbing limbs, the 49ers stuck to their game plan,  the first 25 plays of which were scripted the night before, as always.  </P> <P> Instead of running on a frozen field, which is the conventional wisdom, San  Francisco came at the Bears with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. It was wisdom of  another kind.  </P> <P> The strategy took the Bears by surprise, and even a few 49ers.  </P> <P> "It shocked me," Roberts said. "I didn't expect us to move the ball on offense.  I thought it would be a 7-6 game, or 10-9 like last time. But we moved the  ball."  </P> <P> Move it they did, scoring with 3:18 left in the first quarter when Montana  fired in the right flat for Rice, who broke free as Bear corner Mike Richardson  collided with safety Todd Krumm. Rice raced 61 yards untouched for the  touchdown.  </P> <P> "Joe told me the ball might not be right where I wanted it to be, and I would  have to make a play on it," Rice said. "And I did."  </P> <P> If Montana was having trouble with the wind, it wasn't apparent. He teamed with  Rice again in the second quarter, reading a Chicago blitz and dumping the ball  to Rice over the middle.  </P> <P> Montana called this a "hot read," meaning he was to read the blitz and look for  the tight end, John Frank. Frank wasn't open, but Rice had broken free of  cornerback Vestee Jackson, made the catch in open field and then cruised for  the touchdown, a 27-yard play. It helped put the 49ers up, 14-0, with 7:25 left  in the half, a lead that seemed commanding given the circumstances.  </P> <P> Working in almost unbearable conditions, Montana seemed undaunted by the winds  or Bear defense.  </P> <P> Unlike Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon, who wore gloves but lacked any touch,  Montana threw with a bare hand and uncanny accuracy.  </P> <P> "It might have been his greatest game, under the conditions," 49er Coach Bill  Walsh said.  </P> <P> Afterward, Montana almost shrugged off the conditions and claimed he actually  had a "good feel of the ball."  </P> <P> By the half, he had completed 9 of 15 passes for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns.  McMahon struggled. Through the first 30 minutes, he threw for 94 yards, and his  one interception, by 49er safety Jeff Fuller, set up San Francisco's second  touchdown.  </P> <P> Montana is a man of few words and little emotion, but the victory obviously was  one of the biggest of his storied career. It was a crowning finish to a season  in which Montana had outlasted a quarterback controversy with Steve Young and  lingering questions about whether he was fit. Walsh had even sent Montana to  the bench on occasion this year, citing injuries and fatigue.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel I was ever hurt," Montana said. "Bill felt I was, and he has the  right to make that decision."  </P> <P> All that seemed so far away from Soldier Field and Sunday's victory, but it  seemed important to remember there was a time this season when the 49ers were  6-5 and Montana's career was in trouble.  </P> <P> "We all had something to prove," Montana said, not wishing to make this a  personal vindication. "I never gave up. My wife kept me in line and kept my  spirits up."  </P> <P> Montana's performance -- 17-of-27 passing for 288 yards and 3 touchdowns --  will be remembered far longer than the one turned in by his offensive line,  which kept Montana frost-free most of the day.  </P> <P> The vaunted Bears' pass rush disappeared into the cone of silence formed around  Montana, who was provided enough time to pick the Bears apart.  </P> <P> When the Bears blitzed -- and they did often -- the 49ers' line picked up the  rusher, exposing Chicago's cornerbacks to one-on-one coverage against Rice.  </P> <P> It was a defensive strategy unappreciated by the Bears' Jackson, who claimed he  didn't have the footing to stay with Rice. Does anyone ever?  </P> <P> The Bears' defense was left reeling. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Mike  Singletary, the Bears' menace of the midway, was seemingly lost in the cold  backdrop.  </P> <P> "There was no one around the guy," Singletary complained about the pass rush.  "It makes it very tough. We're supposed to play like professionals on every  down, and it doesn't make any difference how good of game someone else has, our  game should be just as good. . . . If I sound frustrated, I am frustrated. If I  sound mad, I am mad."  </P> <P> San Francisco pushed and picked and pestered the Bears' defense to no end,  taking over after the third-quarter kickoff and marching 78 yards on 13 plays  for a touchdown that put the game away.  </P> <P> Rice, who finished with 5 catches for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns, set up the  score with a 12-yard reception down to the Bear 5-yard line.  </P> <P> On first down, Montana went for the jugular, floating a lob pass for Rice in  the end zone's right corner. Rice made an outstretched stab at the ball, but it  was ruled he didn't have control when he and the ball hit the ground  simultaneously.  </P> <P> After a brief instant-replay stink, Montana calmly set up again and hit Frank  for the touchdown, putting the 49ers up, 21-3.  </P> <P> San Francisco used up 5:27 on the drive, though it seemed an eternity for  McMahon and the Bears.  </P> <P> Those 49ers who had chased McMahon before claimed he wasn't the same  quarterback Sunday, lacking the mobility to get him out of trouble. McMahon  made an appearance in last week's victory over Philadelphia, but had  essentially been out since Oct. 30 with a knee injury.  </P> <P> "They tend to stare at their receivers," 49er safety Fuller said. "It's worked  for them in the past, partially because he was a better runner then and could  get out of the pocket."  </P> <P> Nose tackle Michael Carter noticed the same thing.  </P> <P> "I know he was uncomfortable out there," he said of McMahon. "He always had  someone chasing him and he could never set up to pass."  </P> <P> Mike Tomczak, who completed 6 of 12 passes for 55 yards, replaced McMahon in  the fourth quarter, the game having long been decided.  </P> <P> The 49ers got their fourth touchdown when Tom Rathman rushed in from 4 yards  out with 6:53 left in the game.  </P> <P> All the Bears had to show for the day was a Kevin Butler field goal and some  frozen memories.  </P> <P> Rathman, who tried to make light of the weather afterward, claiming he had been  well-prepared at Nebraska, soon confessed to the Big Lie.  </P> <P> "It was freezing out there, to tell you the truth," Rathman said.  </P> <P> Of course, frostbite never hurts as much when you win.  </P> <P> NFC Notes  </P> <P> San Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. said afterward he wasn't sure whether  his coach, Bill Walsh, would retire after the season. "I don't know," DeBartolo  said. "He might. It's up to him." He added that even if Walsh retired, he would  remain with the organization in some capacity. "Bill's got a year on his  contract and I'd like him to fulfill it," DeBartolo said. "But he can coach as  long as he likes."  </P></p>

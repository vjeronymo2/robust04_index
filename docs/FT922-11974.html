			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: ITT tumbles 29% to Dollars 163m ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 29 per cent drop in first-quarter net income as lower figures from its industrial and hotels businesses more than outweighed an improved performance from its financial operations. The group had net income of Dollars 163m, or Dollars 1.20 a share fully diluted, compared with Dollars 229m, or Dollars 1.70 a share, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 5.1bn, compared with Dollars 5bn. The figures were roughly in line with market forecasts. ITT Hartford, the group's large insurance business, saw an improvement in earnings, from Dollars 165m to Dollars 181m, thanks to higher investment income and a Dollars 10m pre-tax gain on the sale of a stake in securities firm Piper Jaffray Hopwood. This was partly offset by the establishment of reserves in domestic casualty operations and continued difficult market conditions in the UK. ITT Financial, which groups other financial service operations, also posted higher operating results - Dollars 33m against Dollars 19m. ITT Hartford and Financial together enjoyed portfolio gains of Dollars 84m, or 63 cents a share, compared with Dollars 35m a year ago. The group's Sheraton hotels business lost Dollars 16m, up from Dollars 3m a year ago, which ITT said was due to 'significantly lower occupancy levels in New York City, Miami and Toronto,' where Sheraton has recently completed major renovations. The automotive, fluid technology, forest products and defence businesses suffered lower profits, while components posted an operating loss. Equity in earnings from Alcatel, the European telephone equipment business, rose from Dollars 32m to Dollars 50m. ITT is in the process of selling its 30 per cent stake in this business to joint venture partner Alcatel Alsthom.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / People: New Trustee at London design museum The fact that many of its inmates are not the greatest fans of the controversial Lloyd's building is obviously no hindrance to participating in the world of design philanthropy, since its architect, Sir Richard Rogers, 59, has just been appointed a trustee of London's design museum. The Richard Rogers partnership is currently working on the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport, outside London. He has also taken to the printed word recently, co-authoring a blueprint for changing Britain's capital city with Mark Fisher, the Labour party's shadow arts minister. Joining Rogers on the enlarged, 14-member trustee's board will be Alice Rawsthorn, 33, a journalist with the Financial Times' Paris office. Before taking up her Paris post last year, Rawsthorn wrote for the FT on advertising and design in London.  A case of poacher seduced into gamekeeping if evere there was one.</p>

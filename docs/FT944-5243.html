			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Republic's main pull for investors is low tax rate Ireland's main attraction as a foreign investment location is that it enjoys Europe's lowest rate of corporation tax. The republic is heavily dependent on foreign investment, which accounts for 75 per cent of Irish manufactured exports, 55 per cent of manufactured output and 45 per cent of employment in manufacturing. According to the Industrial Development Agency, the government body which co-ordinates policy, about 1,000 foreign companies now operate in Ireland, taking advantage of a young and educated labour force to target the European market. The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax compares with 33 per cent in the UK, the next most attractive regime. The terms run to 2010 for manufacturing and 2005 for financial services. Subsidies cover an average of 20 per cent to 30 per cent of capital costs, rising as high as 60 per cent in designated high unemployment areas. The agency targets potential investors in four main areas - electronics, healthcare, software and financial services. Banks, insurance companies and mutual funds account for half of all the companies coming to Ireland. It is the first choice of location overseas for US companies in the software and healthcare sectors. The US accounts for 75 per cent of all foreign investment companies. In electronics, only the UK attracts more US companies. As the republic has Europe's second highest unemployment rate, the main thrust of agency policy is to create jobs. For every 10 people working in manufacturing, four are engaged in agency projects. Foreign companies assisted by the agency created 11,900 new jobs in 1993, and recovered a further 3,800 jobs lost in previous years. Moreover, foreign companies now pay five times more in corporation tax than they receive in grants, with tax receipts increasing 23 per cent in 1993 to IPounds 348m.</p>

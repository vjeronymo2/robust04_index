			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURRAY RAPS POLL RANKING HIM AS WORST  </P> <P> Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) branded as "ludicrous" a  magazine poll published last week that rated him the state's worst assemblyman.  </P> <P> "The magazine failed to note . . . my supportive voting record on women's  issues, environmental concerns, child-care needs, among many other issues,"  Murray said in a three-page statement. "Nor did the magazine mention my superb  attendance and voting records," he said.  </P> <P> The California Journal, a Sacramento-based political magazine, takes the poll  annually, rating legislators from the best to the worst in terms of integrity,  intelligence, energy and effectiveness.  </P> <P> To come up with its ratings each year, the Journal surveys legislative staff  members, lobbyists and journalists, as well as legislators themselves.  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), who also represents several Southeast cities,  received the lowest rating for a state senator other than former Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya, who resigned last month rather than face possible expulsion as a  result of his conviction on political corruption charges. Montoya resigned  after the survey was taken but before it was published.  </P> <P> Murray, a former political consultant and aide to Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally  (D-Compton), is seeking his second term in the Legislature. The Journal, Murray  complained in his statement, based its ratings on a return rate of only 14% of  the 1,570 surveys it distributed. Also, he said, the Journal has never  highlighted the legislation he carried.  </P> <P> "These measures included methods to reduce crime, to sweep more criminals off  of the streets, to help veterans, and bills to help youth build a brighter  future for themselves," he said.  </P> <P> Murray complained, too, that the Journal staff did not go with him to his  district to visit drug-infested neighborhoods, churches and senior centers and  watch "me serve and interact with the homeless families." Journal staff, he  said, just spent time with him in the Capitol. In addition to Paramount,  Murray's 54th District takes in Compton, Lakewood, Paramount, Bellflower and  the northern edge of Long Beach.  </P></p>

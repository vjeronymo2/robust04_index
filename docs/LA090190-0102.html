			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : BRADLEY SEEKS EXTENSION OF RESERVISTS'  BENEFITS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley asked the Los Angeles City Council Friday to extend the  health and dental care benefits of city employees who are reservists called to  duty during the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "Many city employees who are currently reservists will likely be called upon to  assist our armed forces in the coming months," Bradley wrote in a letter to the  council.  </P> <P> "It is incumbent upon us to extend our commitment to providing health care to  the families of those employees who are called to serve."  </P> <P> Currently, city policy only provides benefits for 30 days from the last day the  reservist reports to work, but the proposed ordinance would extend them  indefinitely.  </P> <P> There are 996 reservists working for the city, 541 of them considered active.  About 15% to 20% of the active reserves are expected to be called into duty.  </P></p>

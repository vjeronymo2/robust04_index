			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Poland cuts key interest rate Poland's central bank, the NBP, has cut its basic refinancing interest rate by three points to 35 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. The move reflects optimism about an expected 2 per cent GDP growth in the economy this year and a lower inflation rate, projected at 32 per cent. Mrs Hanna Gronkiewicz Walc, NBP chairman, expects Polish banks to reduce their lending rates, which currently range between 40 per cent and 60 per cent. The refinancing rate is used by the NBP to lend money to government-funded investment projects and is regarded as the marker for the banking system.</p>

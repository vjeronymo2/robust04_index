			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Gatt chief warns of impasse on farm talks MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, damped hopes yesterday of any early solution to the critical dispute between the European Community and the US which threatens world trade reforms. He said an attempt by the EC at French insistence to amend the Blair House accord on agriculture, reached last November between the EC and the US, had created 'an impasse to which a clear solution is not apparent'. A crucial aspect of the accord envisages a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised EC food exports over the next six years. Mr Sutherland, speaking after addressing the IMF interim committee in Washington, warned the dispute was among issues that could wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks due to finish by December 15. He said he could not foresee the deadline being extended. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, are to discuss the dispute in Washington today. It arose after France called for further 'clarifications' to the accord. Mr Sutherland's remarks came as the World Bank disclosed findings of a study which concluded the partial trade liberalisation envisaged under the Uruguay Round could add Dollars 213bn (Pounds 138.3bn) a year to world income by 2002.

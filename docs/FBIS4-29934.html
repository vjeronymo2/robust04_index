			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of holding preliminary  contact for North-South top-level talks [choegowigup hoedam],  Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administration Council, today  sent a telephone message to South Korean Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok.    The content of the telephone message is as follows:    Bringing an end to North-South mistrust and confrontation  and  opening a new phase in independently and peacefully reunifying  the fatherland without depending on outside force through  top-level talks is a policy we have consistently adhered to for  a long time. The tense situation in the country today makes it  all the more urgent for the North and South to hold top-level  talks.    I think it fortunate that at such a time your side has  expressed the position of holding top-level talks this time and,  under authorization, notify your side that we welcome your  side's proposal for holding a preliminary contact for  North-South top-level talks and agree to it.    Holding the top-level talks of the two sides will be a  historic event that will give our 70 million fellow countrymen  the joy of national reconciliation and unity and a new hope for  peace in the country and its independent, peaceful reunification.    To successfully hold North-South top-level talks, on which  attention from home and abroad has been focused, our side will  send a three-member delegation led by a vice premier-level  official and four accompanying officials to your side's area in  Panmunjom at 1000 on 28 June, Tuesday.</p>

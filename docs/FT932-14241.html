			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / First cut is the easiest: France has limited room for manoeuvre in monetary policy The French financial authorities were yesterday being modest about their success in cutting interest rates while still keeping the franc firm, because they know it is only a modest success. The Bank of France, unusually, made no comment when it cut the intervention rate at which it rations loans to commercial banks from 9.10 to 8.75 per cent, the lowest level since 1989, and further reduced its five-to-10-day repurchase lending rate from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. For his part, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was busier warning about forthcoming 'unpopular' tax increases to stem the public spending deficit than crowing about the first fruits of his three-week old government's success on the monetary front. The French authorities are playing it cool for two reasons. One is a question of style. The Balladur government is very keen to show foreign exchange dealers it is just reacting to recent falls in domestic money market rates by lowering official rates, and that it is in no way trying to force official rates down further or faster than the fundamentals of the French economy justify. The other reason for caution relates to precisely these fundamentals. For the moment, the franc's link to the D-mark seems solid. The Bank of France has recovered the reserves it lost in defending the currency since last autumn, enough, according to Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, to be making an early repayment of the debt to the Bundesbank incurred in support of the French intervention. Today, Mr Alphandery will present to Mr Balladur his draft statute to give the French central bank the same independence in monetary policy as the Bundesbank enjoys. Therefore, when the French premier visits Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Thursday, he will be able to claim to the German leader that France is on the road to 'institutionalising' its present policy of a strong currency and a low inflation rate, which, at around 2.3 per cent ,is nearly half Germany's. This in turn strengthens Mr Balladur's hand in making his pitch for even-closer monetary co-operation between France and Germany, sufficient to ride out possible storms arising out of Danish and British decisions on the Maastricht treaty. But the battle for the franc will not finally be won until health is restored to the French economy and to its state finances. Even the record low point for inflation has its downside, because it increases the 'real' cost of interest for companies and individuals on their borrowings. 'Today's interest rate cuts are not enough to relaunch growth,' says Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, chief economist of the Banque Nationale de Paris. 'Although we are clearly on the right path, with the three-month interbank rate also down to 8.75 per cent today, this rate has to come down to 7 per cent,' he stresses. Other economists see the need for even bigger cuts to kick the stalled French economy into life again. Mr Balladur's sober start has so far gone down well in the public opinion ratings which have given him the highest marks of any Fifth Republic prime minister. But this honeymoon may soon be cut short, because his room for economic manoeuvre is so small. The only reflation measure he has announced, a saving of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.41bn) - yet to be identified - out of a budget deficit of over FFr330m this year, is to be used to give property investors and developers tax breaks to revive the depressed real estate sector. Other larger-scale measures have been mooted. But they will either punch an even bigger hole in the state's finances (up to FFr100bn, if the government decides to help companies' cashflow by implementing a speedier refund of value added tax), or are too gradual to have any immediate effect on growth and employment (such as the proposal to transfer progressively the FFr150bn a year social charges from company payrolls to the state budget over 10 years). France's sad experience in recent years is that it generates fewer jobs for a given amount of growth than its neighbours, and there is no one in the country, from Mr Balladur down, who believes that with the economy forecast to expand by less than 1 per cent this year the number of unemployed will fall below its current level of 3m before 1994. The structural roots of unemployment lie in 'productivity rates, rigidities of labour market practices, the cost of labour', says Mr Charpin. Tackling this will take a long time. This is why Mr Balladur has set himself a five-year economic programme. But with presidential elections due by 1995 he may in reality have only two years to play with. In contrast to last year when France recorded a large trade surplus, the European horizon looks equally sombre from Paris. Despite the continuation yesterday of EC discussions about a European growth initiative, French exporters are saddled with the handicap that the franc has appreciated by about 8 per cent since mid-1992 against other European currencies. This fact, together with depressed domestic demand, hardly creates the right climate for French companies to start reversing the investment spending cuts they have been making since 1990. Even if it were, French industry would take its time about sinking money into new plant, when their existing factories are so under-utilised. In such circumstances, Cartesian logic might indicate that France's best hope would be for a liberalisation of world trade - as could be provided for by an early settlement to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. But the Balladur government seems just as hostile as its Socialist predecessor to a rapid Gatt agreement on terms acceptable to the US, and indeed to many of its EC partners. Among the latter, the most important is Germany, and Mr Balladur will be trying this week to convince Mr Kohl of the need for a tougher European trade policy. But however forcefully he puts his Gatt case to Mr Kohl, Mr Balladur cannot ignore that he needs Germany's co-operation on monetary matters even more. It is only with the full political and financial backing of Germany's government and central bank that the franc has beaten off the speculators. Certainly, the foreign exchange markets have taken to Mr Balladur's conservative style and policies. The franc closed yesterday at a rate of FFr3.378 to the D-mark, up more than three centimes since March 21, the date of the first round of the French legislative elections, which signalled a landslide victory for the centre-right. Yesterday's official interest rate cuts were relatively easy, because they merely consolidated the movement that had already taken place in the market. Further cuts in official French rates will have to depend on what the Bundesbank does next.</p>

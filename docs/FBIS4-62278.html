			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius 12 May TASS -- "In spite of the  difficulties, current situation in the Russo-Lithuanian  relations may be described as good. (The relations) are  developing in accordance with the guidelines mapped out in the  (bilateral) agreement of 25 July 1991 and the joint declaration  signed by the Russian and Lithuanian presidents on 30 August  1993," said President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania in an  interview with the "MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN" ("INTERNATIONAL  ARENA") journal that comes out in Russia.    The whole text of the interview will be published in the  next  issue of the journal, but the official "ECHO OF LITHUANIA" daily  published several excerpts from it on Thursday [12 May].    "The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was  of great importance. (The two parties) signed during his visit a  package of agreements on 18 November 1993.    ``One of the most important agreements -- the one on  exchanging the most favoured nation status in trade and economic  relations -- has not been put into effect as yet, unfortunately.  Lithuania has fulfilled its treaty commitments - now it is  Russia's turn,'' said Brazauskas.    According to him, there is no mention of Lithuania in the  long list of 130 countries, which trade with Moscow in "free  trade" and "most favoured nation in trade" format, although the  relevant agreement has been signed. This is "disadvantageous  and detrimental to both parties," he said.    "In our opinion, such economic statement has no future," the  Lithuanian president emphasized in this connection.    Commenting on a recent exchange of messages with Russian  President Yeltsin and telephone conversation with Chernomyrdin,  Brazauskas said that, in his opinion, it was possible "to  eliminate existing difficulties in our relations, which surfaced  recently."</p>

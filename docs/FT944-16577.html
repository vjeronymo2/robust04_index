			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / GEC may make cash offer for VSEL to foil BAe bid GEC is considering making a cash offer for VSEL, the submarine maker, to counter an agreed all-share bid launched yesterday by British Aerospace. GEC has asked Morgan Grenfell, VSEL's adviser, for information which has been made available to BAe in the course of negotiations. GEC is entitled to do this under takeover panel rules if it is seriously considering a counterbid. The company refused to comment on whether or not it had asked Morgan Grenfell for the information. BAe unveiled its Pounds 478.5m agreed bid for the Barrow-based submarine maker yesterday morning, valuing each VSEL share at approximately Pounds 12.60. BAe has offered 2.747 of its own shares for each VSEL share, with an alternative offer of Pounds 11.40 per share in cash. VSEL's directors have recommended BAe's offer. Lord Chalfont, the chairman, said, 'This deal will allow the company to look forward to orders it might not otherwise have secured.' BAe is interested in VSEL because it wishes to extend its interests in shipbuilding, applying the project management skills it has developed in aircraft to other military businesses. GEC owns the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde which makes most frigates for the Royal Navy. It wants to buy VSEL to increase the amount of business it does as a project manager, rather than acting as an electronics subcontractor to BAe. Both companies have their eye on the Pounds 2.5bn contract to build the next generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines, and the Pounds 500m contract for marine landing ships which would be built at VSEL in Barrow. They are the largest naval contracts likely to be placed until the Pounds 6bn new generation frigate comes on stream in 2002. Both BAe and GEC are involved in the frigate programme. GEC would face competition difficulties from the Ministry of Defence if it bid for VSEL because it would then own the two large warship yards left in the UK. The Royal Navy is thought to be particularly unhappy with one company owning both yards. BAe's bid has received provisional clearance from the MoD. Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe's defence subsidiary, said companies bidding for naval work needed a manufacturing yard to be credible with buyers. Buying VSEL has strong financial attractions for BAe. VSEL's large cash pile would cut BAe's gearing to 10 per cent and increase BAe's assets from Pounds 1.056bn to Pounds 1.329bn. Tax advantages mean that VSEL's profits would also increase BAe's earnings substantially. GEC, however, can offer cash. Including money in joint ventures, it has almost Pounds 3bn in cash.

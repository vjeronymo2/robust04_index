			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIXTH COUNTRY FREEZES NORIEGA'S ESTIMATED $20 MILLION IN ASSETS  </P> <P> Authorities in six nations have frozen $20 million in "liquid assets"  associated with deposed Panamanian Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the Justice  Department said today.  </P> <P> Austria became the sixth country to freeze bank accounts associated with  Noriega, said David Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general.  </P> <P> The action was taken at the request of the United States, he said.  </P> <P> Runkel also doubled his previous estimate -- from $10 million to $20 million --  of money in the various bank accounts that the U.S. government believes is  associated with illegal drug activity by Noriega.  </P> <P> The five other countries where bank accounts associated with Noriega have been  frozen are France, Switzerland, West Germany, Luxembourg and the United  Kingdom, Runkel said.  </P> <P> "These are liquid assets -- mostly bank accounts," Runkel told reporters.  </P> <P> The American invasion of Panama produced a number of documents that have aided  in the investigation of Noriega's assets.  </P></p>

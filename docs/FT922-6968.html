			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance in closer ties with top Swiss insurer SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's largest insurance company, will today sign an agreement with Helvetia, one of Switzerland's top five insurers, to jointly develop international commercial lines business. The deal, which the managing director designate of Sun Alliance International, Mr Peter Foreman, expects to sign in St Gallen, Switzerland, today, formalises a co-operation agreement which has been in existence for ten years. It should boost the profile of both companies in the highly competitive market for providing multinational companies with worldwide insurance programmes. Increasingly companies with strong international networks - such as American International Group, Zurich, Union des Assurances de Paris and Allianz - have been able to dominate the market. British companies, which lack comparable international networks and do not have the available available to make acquisitions, have been increasingly forced to join forces with international rivals. Sun Alliance itself has forged links with Taisho of Japan and Lucky Insurance Company of South Korea, while both Royal Insurance and Commercial Union have also formed long-term links with Japanese companies. Sun Alliance also has less formalised accords with Vesta Group in Norway and Atlantica in Sweden. More recently Royal agreed to merge its European operations outside the UK with Aachener and Munchener of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy. According to Mr Paul Cusition, manager international insurances at Sun Alliance International, says that by acting more closely together the companies have already been able to win the custom of one Swiss multinational. Mr Cusition says that the arrangement is seen as long-term and strategic. Contracts signed by the two companies allow for a six month notice period if either party opts to terminate the deal. Mr Cusition says it will strengthen Sun Alliance's ability to service multinational clients in both Switzerland and Germany, where the Swiss company is well represented.</p>

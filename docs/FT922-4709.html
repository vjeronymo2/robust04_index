			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Interest income helps VSEL rise 18% A TREBLING of interest income on a fast growing pile of cash helped VSEL Consortium, the nuclear submarine builder, to increase pre-tax profit by 18 per cent in the year to March 31. Reassuring news on the fourth Trident submarine, the next class of submarine, and on Ministry of Defence acceptance for a howitzer design helped push the shares up 36p to 454p. The pre-tax profit advance from Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 47.9m came on flat turnover of Pounds 520m (Pounds 523m) and in spite of a near Pounds 6m drop in profit from the non-submarine business. Trading profit inched ahead to Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 37.5m), while net interest income soared to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 3.2m). A cash inflow of Pounds 50.5m brought the total amount held to Pounds 201.8m. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive, said net cash stood at just over Pounds 100m. The inflow had been achieved by successful management of the Trident submarine contract. He said the placing of the order for the fourth Trident was expected within the next few weeks. This would bring the order book to Pounds 4bn. Its Pounds 6m study contract for the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class submarine would put it in a good position to be prime contractor later in the decade. The submarine division made Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 40.2m) profit on sales of Pounds 390m (Pounds 421m). A small amount of conventional submarine work is still taking place at the Cammell Laird yard on Merseyside. The group provided for the yard's closure and losses in last year's Pounds 125m extraordinary charge. This was also to cover a near halving of the workforce at the Barrow-in-Furness submarine yard from 14,000 two years ago to between 7,000 and 8,000 by 1995. Other activities, including the self-propelled howitzer and work for the off-shore industry, made only Pounds 600,000, down from Pounds 6.5m, on sales of Pounds 130m (Pounds 101m). Earnings per share rose to 82.4p (74.1p) and a proposed final dividend of 17p (15.5p) makes a total of 25p (22.5p). COMMENT VSEL's low p/e rating - less than 5 prospectively - and high yield is testimony to the fright investors have taken at the defence industry. Its millstones have been its 90 per cent dependence on the shrinking UK defence budget and its nuclear submarine niche, which caused a panic in the days when Labour was expected to win the election. It is worth remembering that the proposed 6 per cent reduction in defence spending over three years still leaves annual procurement at the best part of Pounds 9bn. Meanwhile, its monopoly of nuclear submarines is a plus, it has a chance of getting back into ship-building and the howitzer project and off-shore start-ups are nearer to making profits. That said, the group remains rather hamstrung by Barrow. It seems to feel it cannot acquire elsewhere while it is cuting jobs there and the chances of its political plea for government aid to bring in new employers must be marred by the barriers to building roads and railways in the Lake District. Pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to about Pounds 53m, the prospective yield is more than 8 per cent and it has more cash than its market value. For those not frightened by defence it remains reasonable value.</p>

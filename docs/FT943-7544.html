			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Adoring press turns blind eye to Deng's birthday China's official media went into overdrive yesterday in praise of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader who turned 90; but nowhere in thousands of characters published about the ailing and reclusive Mr Deng was any mention made of his birthday. People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, led a chorus of praise in a front-page editorial which described Mr Deng as 'the general designer of our country's socialist reforms, opening and construction of a modern society. 'We should read comrade Deng Xiaoping's works carefully, attentively and repeatedly,' the paper said. China's media gave more weight and prominence to Mr Deng's contribution to the country's reform effort this year than in previous years. Western officials attributed this to a recognition that Mr Deng may not have much longer to live, and to his reaching the 'round figure' of 90. Mr Deng's remarkable life, which began in a remote county in China's south-west Sichuan province, spanned an era of great turbulence in Chinese history. As a leader of the communist revolution, he was at the centre of stirring events for more than half a century. No mention was made in the Chinese press yesterday of Mr Deng's whereabouts on his birthday: it is assumed he is in Beijing since he is now too feeble to enjoy his favourite summer pastime of swimming in the sea at a beach resort east of the capital. The blanket media coverage of Mr Deng's achievements, with its emphasis on his historical contribution, appeared to be preparing the ground for 'canonisation' on his death as one of the giants of modern Chinese history. 'Our party's flag, having been inscribed with 'Marxism and Leninism' and 'Mao Zedong Thought', is now enhanced by 'Deng Xiaoping's theory of Building Socialism with Chinese characteristics',' People's Daily commented. 'The 19th century was the one during which the Chinese nation declined, the 20th century was one when the Chinese nation fought and strove and the 21st century will be the one when the Chinese nation will be revitalised fully,' the paper added. Apart from newspaper commentaries, Mr Deng's birthday was also marked by photographic exhibitions and examples of his calligraphy. China's senior leader may have been out of sight on his birthday, but the Chinese propaganda machine has not allowed him to be out of mind. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

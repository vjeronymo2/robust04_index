			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome upset Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price fall 7 to 623p on turnover of 4.2m, with securities house UBS active in two-way business. UBS is a buyer of the shares, arguing that they are the cheapest in the pharmaceuticals sector. However, dealers said it also took some sizeable sell orders. There was little fundamental impetus in the market to sell the shares, but some analysts pointed to an article in the trade press on a rival to Wellcome's anti-Aids treatment Retrovir. News of the decision to launch an inquiry into the Net Book Agreement hit J. Menzies hard, sending the shares down 13 to 559p. WH Smith 'A' recovered from an initial fall, closing just 2 down at 457p. Pentos slipped 3 to 36p. Dixons, ahead 3 1/2 at 270p, and MFI, up 3 at 140p, were said to be the main rate cut beneficiaries. Results from Allied-Lyons came in line with expectations and the shares drifted away slightly to close 3 down at 568p. Brewing was again shown to be tough, with the various participants locked in a struggle for market share. Pressure on Allied may prove beneficial to Bass, up 2 at 471p, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, 3 easier at 469p. Leisure analysts said the main beneficiary of the base rate cut appeared to be First Leisure, the nightclub and tenpin bowling company. The stock climbed 11 to 245p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterating its buy recommendation. A sell note from Robert Fleming Securities, focusing on worries about BT's ability to grow the dividend, saw the company's shares sharply underperform the FT-SE 100 Index, closing 5 down at 457 1/2 p after above average turnover of 8.1m. The partly-paid settled the same amount off at 205 1/2 p on turnover of 6.9m. Dealers said the market had absorbed bouts of selling pressure late on Monday thought to have been triggered by suggestions of a bearish broker note. Most of the selling in the market occurred early yesterday, they added, as institutions took on board Fleming's views that BT's dividend growth looks set to slow over the next three years and that from 1996/97 onwards the probability is that BT's dividend growth will be in low single digits, around 2.5 per cent, with unchanged dividends in poor years. Mr Laurence Heyworth, Fleming telecoms analyst, pointed out that the recent dividend warning from Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, had caused a slight reduction in market expectations for BT's dividend growth but warned clients that 'we take it more seriously'. Interim figures from Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular telecoms group, were by no means in excess of general market expectations but were accompanied by a half-point reduction in UK interest rates, a move which transformed the rest of the UK equity market. Vodafone shares fell back from on overnight 520p to touch 516p at the outset of trading, before embarking on a strong upwards move after the rate cut and the profits and dividend news. They ended 7 ahead at 527p. Profits of Pounds 74.5m were at the high end of market expectations, while the interim dividend of 4.12p, a rise of 20 per cent, was at the very top of the range and was given a warm reception across the board. The oil and gas sector was in much better shape yesterday as the market responded to the cut in UK interest rates, which drove the market higher, and hopes that the Opec meeting in Vienna, that commenced yesterday, will see member states agree on a 0.5m barrels a day reduction in overall output to the 24m b/d level. An agreement on such a reduction is by no means clear cut, but has to be done to stabilise oil prices, said one UK-based oil specialist, who added that the cuts would be achieved 'in bits and pieces across the board'. Shell Transport attracted keen support, closing 5 up at 686p, ahead of the important presentation to UK oil analysts today. The company addressed US oil analysts last Friday and will face a meeting of Dutch-based specialists on December 2. British Petroleum rose 4 1/2 more to 343 1/2 p as fears of the imminent sale of the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.9 per cent stake continued to subside. Enterprise added 6 at 454p. International conglomerate Hanson failed to benefit from yesterday's interest rate cut, although the stock is often bought for its yield attractions. The shares held at 277p. Textiles conglomerate Bodycote International fell 23 to 256p, with dealers saying that Smith New Court had cut its forecasts. Smith was unavailable for comment but Kleinwort Benson Securities said it was also preparing to reduce its earnings estimates. Exhibitions organiser Blenheim dropped 19 to 323p on critical comment after the group announced a management reshuffle on Monday.</p>

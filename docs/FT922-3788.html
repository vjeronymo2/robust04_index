			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / RTZ to sell its stake in Canadian mining unit RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, is selling its 51.5 per cent stake in Rio Algom, a large Canadian mining and metals distribution subsidiary. RTZ will earn Pounds 118m from the sale, after expenses and Canadian capital gains tax. The book value of the stake is Pounds 148m, leading to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 30m. Rio Algom has gradually declined in its importance to the group. The disposal allows RTZ to concentrate on its remaining North American businesses, which were mainly acquired in 1989 from BP. An RTZ spokesman said the sale would prevent possible conflicts of interest between Rio Algom and RTZ's other North American businesses such as Kennecott, its most profitable subsidiary. Analysts welcomed the sale, saying Rio Algom had failed to match the group's earnings growth in recent years. 'Its cash-cow uranium earnings have fallen rapidly and will cease altogether in 1996,' according to Mr Alan Richards at BZW. The 22.51m shares are being placed with mainly Canadian institutions and underwritten by Gordon Capital Corp, RBC Dominion Securities and Wood Gundy. The placement price of CDollars 16.10 compared with Friday's closing price of CDollars 16.25. Payment is due in three instalments over the next two years. RTZ approached at least two companies in recent months about selling the stake as a block. But no purchaser would match the stock market value. The apparently hasty disposal of the stake, which has fallen in value by CDollars 129m (Pounds 59.10m) in the past year, prompted speculation RTZ is preparing another move in Canada. 'Perhaps Kennecott will do something soon which could conflict with Rio Algom,' said Mr Euan Worthington at SG Warburg. The sale is unlikely to alter RTZ's earnings for this year. In 1991 Rio Algom contributed only Pounds 11m of RTZ's net attributable profits of Pounds 308m. But RTZ's cashflow will be about Pounds 128m stronger, representing the sale price and about Pounds 10m in notional deferred interest on the instalment payments. A Toronto-based analyst said Rio Algom had been limited by RTZ's investment in Kennecott. The sale gives the Canadian company 'a better chance of operating independently', he said. Rio Algom is also expected to try again to sell its metals distribution business, with a price close to book value of CDollars 200m.</p>

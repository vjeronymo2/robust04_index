			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pakistan Agrees to Allow U.S. Build </F> Three Military Bases"]    [Text] Islamabad (API)--Pakistan has made an agreement with  the United States of America to allow it to establish three  military bases in Siachen, Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir,  in exchange for resolving the Kashmir issue. General Joseph P.  Hoover, during his recent visit to Pakistan, has also made a  list of the possible locations for building these bases, and  gave that list to Pakistan. The United States and Pakistan will  sign this pact in March. This information was revealed by PULSE,  a weekly English newspaper published in Islamabad, through  information collected from intelligence agencies and diplomatic  sources. The newspaper reported that the United States, after  this agreement on building military bases, changed its policy on  Kashmir, accepting it as a disputed region. The United States  has included Gilgit, Balistan, Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir,  and Jammu-Kashmir, as well as the Aksai Chin, now under China's  control, as part of the disputed region. The United States has  decided to resolve the disputes of this entire region. The  newspaper further reported that the intent of the United States  in signing this pact with Pakistan was to end China's supremacy  and control Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan's  Islamic movements. Great Britain will also be used for this  purpose. The Kashmir Press International, referring to the  newspaper, said that the U. S. Central Command's  commander-in-chief, General Joseph P. Hoover [as published], had  visited Pakistan during caretaker Prime Minister Moin Qureshi's  time. After Hoover's visit, high Pakistani government officials  visited the United States and obtained more details about this  plan. The decision on specific sites for these military bases,  however, was made by General Hoover during his recent visit,  when Benazir became prime minister. Hoover also gave a list of  sites where the bases can be built. PULSE also revealed that a  few days ago, a U.S. spy plane was hangered in the Islamabad  airport for a few days. During that time, the plane made several  flights and inspected the proposed sights. Both countries will  sign an agreement on this plan at the end of March, and in the  beginning of April, the United States will begin cooperating  with Pakistan at the international level to resolve the Kashmir  issue. According to the newspaper, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto's recent reaction to the Kashmir issue was part of this  plan, and she did this at America's bidding.  *</p>

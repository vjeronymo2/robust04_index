			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Leading Article: The road from Marrakesh With the signature of the Uruguay Round accord in Marrakesh this month, world trade policy has crossed a threshold - possibly a watershed. The deal breaks new ground by extending Gatt disciplines to important areas, including services, agriculture and textiles; by reinforcing the Gatt system through the planned World Trade Organisation; and by enshrining a far stronger commitment to multilateral rules by developing countries, notably in Asia and Latin America. The task now is to entrench and build on these achievements. The immediate priority is speedy legislative ratification of the round, so that it and the WTO begin operating at the start of next year. Delays - particularly in the US, the European Union or Japan - could slow, or even reverse, the momentum of liberalisation. Only when that risk is removed can policymakers tackle in earnest the bigger challenges ahead. The first such challenge is to continue eliminating obstacles to trade. Though the round covers in principle most categories of trade, concrete arrangements for opening many services markets remain to be negotiated. In sectors such as agriculture and textiles, governments have to show that they will implement agreed liberalisation timetables. Given political sensitivities, that is far from a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, liberalisation is an unending process. In future, it will increasingly be focused on obstacles created by countries' domestic policies. That thrust reflects in part the Gatt's past successes in lowering barriers to visible trade at frontiers. It is also dictated by the expansion of international trade in services and the growing importance of cross-border capital flows as an engine of economic integration. However, devising multilateral rules which promote free competition, while respecting genuine national diversity, will require much skill. Orderly mechanisms It will also test the WTO's ambitions to supersede trade rounds by acting as a permanent negotiating forum. That would reduce the protracted negotiations, brinkmanship and risk of irretrievable breakdown which have bedevilled past rounds. But it is still unclear whether the WTO's more orderly mechanisms will produce the decisive agreements which have so far required the complex international trade-offs and political dynamics generated by a full-scale round. Consensus will not be made easier by pressures to load the WTO's agenda with contentious new issues, such as environment policy and workers' rights. The industrialised powers' demands for action on these questions have already created severe frictions with developing countries, which fear they are simply a pretext for trade protection. Rigorous analysis The links between trade and areas such as environment are still poorly understood. What constructive policy measures are necessary or possible is even less certain. Much rigorous analysis and debate is needed to define the issues more clearly and to prevent the agenda from being hijacked by powerful lobbies with a tenuous commitment to free trade. The biggest challenge of all is to guard against a relapse into bilateral policies and protectionism, particularly before the WTO is in place. Bilateralism can most effectively be checked by an international effort to help the US out of the hole it has dug in its dealings with Japan. Tokyo needs to play its part by pressing ahead with domestic liberalisation. But the US must also want to be helped. Washington has often argued that its bilateral trade initiatives were necessitated by the deficiencies of the Gatt disputes procedures. These will be much strengthened once the WTO is operating. However, Washington's recent row with Ottawa over grain imports - in which the former has baulked at the findings of a disputes panel it helped set up  - suggests a disturbing reluctance to accept independent rulings which disagree with US interests. International economic recovery should make an outbreak of protection less likely. However, that risk remains while unemployment stays high, notably in Europe. It makes still more essential the pursuit of sound macro-economic policies and vigorous structural reforms. In the last analysis, effective domestic policies are the best guarantee of free world trade.</p>

Japanese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Akira Matsui  signed the agreement with Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Tuleutai  Skakovich Suleymenov, in Almaty, the ministry said.    The agreement was the last to be signed between Japan and  the  four former Soviet republics. Tokyo signed similar pacts with  Russia last October, Belarus last November and Ukraine earlier  this month.    The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year  at  a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that  it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the  promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet  Union.    The committee will include representatives of the  Governments  of Japan and Kazakhstan, it said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shengyang, May 30 (XINHUA) -- A loan from the World  Bank has enabled nearly 6,000 tuberculosis patients in 14 cities  in northeast China's Liaoning Province to have free medical  treatment.    The free services include chest fluoroscopy, check-ups for  tuberculosis bacillae in phlegm and medical treatment.    An official said that about 95 percent of those who  contracted the disease for the first time have recovered. And  for patients suffering relapses, the curative rate has also  reached 75 percent.    The World Bank has provided interest-free loans for the  program since 1992. Up to now, the province has received  medicine worth 3.29 million U.S. dollars.    According to the provincial public health department, the  local government has poured at least 22 million yuan into the  program.    There are an estimated more than 165,000 tuberculosis  patients in Liaoning Province.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>   [Excerpts] It has been clear for a long time that the  region of the former Yugoslavia is a testing ground for the  balance of powers on the new geopolitical map of the world.  After the disappearance of the Soviet Union, that is, after the  severely impaired might of the second superpower, this balance  also disappeared. Unfortunately, the setting of the new balance  of powers is being tested on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. This is where many values and principles of an  epoch have been failing. This is where the principles from  Helsinki and the principles of the CSCE have failed. This is  where international law has failed. The United Nations could  also be buried on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, this  institution that -- despite many problems -- has had the  greatest authority in the world for half a century.    Since the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, there has been  evidence that the United Nations does not have the inner  strength to be up to the task. Instead of its own authority,  this organization that used to be respected -- and, pathos  aside, looked up to with hope by a large part of humankind --  has become only a shield and an instrument of the most powerful  countries in the West, primarily the United States.    The latest decision of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to  allow Turkish troops into Bosnia within the UN peacekeepers is  the most obvious indication that the United Nations is no longer  capable of abiding by its own principles. The attitude that the  neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia, and countries  that historically represented occupying forces here, cannot come  as peacekeepers has been ignored. The reactions of Bulgaria and  Greece best show what a danger that is to peace not only in  former Yugoslavia, but in the entire Balkans. Bulgaria and  Greece this time reacted in their own interests. The Security  Council is setting a new time bomb, is the reaction in Bulgaria.  Greek Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis says that one cannot  at the same time be a participant in a clash and the keeper of  peace in that clash. This is completely unreasonable,  illogical, and dangerous, the Greek defense minister stresses.    A question arises here: Do the most powerful in the  international community care about peace in the former  Yugoslavia? We have in fact been all along witnesses to a double  game, the apparent search for peace and the search for ways to  avoid peace. Every time it seemed that peace was at hand, there  was parallel action aimed at having the war continue. Therefore  the stories that the key to peace lies in Serbia, Yugoslavia, or  the Serbian side are stories for the hostile or the politically  illiterate and uninformed.    In the shadow of the sensational decision to allow Turkish  troops into Bosnia, Germany is creeping back into the Balkans,  true, only politically so far. What does the administration of  Mostar by the Germans mean? Just the above. Is it not the  future of the former Yugoslav republics gradually to fall under  the administration of foreign powers under the excuse of  bringing peace, which is an age-old political excuse? Because  of that hypocrisy -- the parallel search for peace and the  instigation of war -- and to hide that hypocrisy from the their  public and voters, those who conduct such a policy need  political lies in the world media. But how to explain that to  the world public, when the rich managers and brainwashers of  that same public manipulate that very public with their media?  [passage omitted]    The world has finally understood that Serbia is not an  aggressor, but that apart from the others, Serbs, too, live in  the former Croatia and the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite  that, the world is gradually learning that the departure of the  Serbs from the countries imposed on them by force is not the  creation of greater Serbia but a constitution of a smaller  Yugoslavia, in continuation of the country that existed for 70  years. [sentence as heard] After all, that is the right that has  been given to others, the right that was given to all the  nations by United Nations itself. One more time: Is the United  Nations to meet the fate of the League of Nations, its  predecessor from between the two world wars, which was destroyed  by the power struggle between the great powers?</p>

In order that talks on a general cease-fire between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Serb aggressor side can start it  is vital that the Serb aggressor side immediately stop all  offensive actions against the towns of Gorazde and Bihac, which  have been proclaimed protected areas by the UN Security Council.    2. The Serb aggressor formations should return to their  starting positions, which they held on 3 March this year when  they launched an offensive against Gorazde.    3. In order that talks with representatives of the Serb  aggressor side can begin it is necessary to have clearly defined  political prerequisites which guarantee the continued political  process of resolving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem as a whole.    4.

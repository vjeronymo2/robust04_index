			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Agent at Lloyd's warns on reforms A LEADING agent at the Lloyd's insurance market has attacked possible plans to reduce the role of members' agents. Such agents handle the affairs of underwriting members or Names, and allocate them to syndicates. Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents, said any attempt by Lloyd's to handle the administrative functions of members' agents centrally 'would cause a riot' among the agency's more than 1,500 Names - individuals whose wealth backs the market. Changes in the role of members' agents are being considered by the Lloyd's Market Board as part of a business plan to be unveiled in April. Last month Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, told a group of Names: 'It would be better to centralise everything other than investment advice and recruitment.' Members' agents' responsibilities for administering the reserves and deposits of Names, for distributing profits, collecting losses and assessing the solvency of Names could be carried out centrally. He said that Lloyd's had given responsibility for administering Names' deposits to agents following criticism from Names about the quality of service offered by the corporation, the body which regulates and administers the market. A role change would be part of a package of measures designed to increase efficiency at the market following heavy losses in recent years. Lloyd's may consider placing business from underwriting syndicates that no longer write new insurance into a central pool and reinsuring all outstanding claims, Mr Middleton told a group of leading figures in the insurance market. It may also create a central run-off agency to deal with claims from previous years.</p>

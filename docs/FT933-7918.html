			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Freeze on Gucci stake is lifted A NEW YORK judge has lifted the temporary freeze on the stake of one of the two partners in Gucci, the Italian luxury goods group, writes Haig Simonian. The judge removed the block on the 50 per cent stake owned by Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the group's founder, requested last month by Investcorp, the Bahrain-based merchant bank which owns the remaining shares. Investcorp had sought the freeze pending the resolution of an arbitration case it had brought against Mr Gucci.</p>

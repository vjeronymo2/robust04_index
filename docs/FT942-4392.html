			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Poland expects 5% growth The Polish government expects the country's economy to grow an average of 5 per cent a year until 1997 and inflation, now 30 per cent annually, to fall to single figures by then, according to a plan presented to parliament yesterday. The plan foresees unemployment falling from 16 per cent to 14 per cent in the period. But Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy premier in charge of the economy, warned that Poland still faced major inflationary dangers as industrial unrest affected several major enterprises. Yesterday over 20,000 workers at the giant Huta Katowice steelworks continued a nine-day-long strike in support of wage demands while the Italian-owned Huta Lucchini Warszawa steelworks in Warsaw saw its 2,000 employees occupy the plant to back a 30 per cent wage rise demand. Meanwhile Over 15,000 workers at the Fiat-owned car plant in Bielsko Biala are threatening strike action next week.</p>

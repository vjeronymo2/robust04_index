			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Technology: Consultant's critique For many people, change is like bereavement - the loss is forever. Coutts is being dragged up to date by its parent, NatWest, which now demands a financial return. In this case, the technology will only be constrained by a culture steeped in tradition. Employees wield power to resist change; such 'negative power' may take the form of ignoring information or downplaying its importance. Coutts depends upon gaining competitive advantage by differentiation. Many customers enjoy, and will pay for, the special cachet of banking there. But success lies in reducing costs on those items which do not matter to customers while not stinting on those that do. Coutts is just beginning to identify which clients or classes of business produce profit. The Product and Customer Profitability Information (PCPI) system now has a year's data on which to base strategic decisions. I was very concerned, though, that some senior managers were allegedly consigning reports to the bin. While IT people often see this as resistance to change, it may indicate that the users' needs are not being met. There seemed to be little interchange between the development team and the managers that PCPI was designed to serve. Without complete commitment from the top downwards and rapid response to feedback, the system is doomed. Nick Willmer seems to be driving the system forward on his own, which can feel like swimming against the tide. I felt that Coutts might be making concessions to the 20th century but its heart is still entrenched in the values associated with its antique boardroom wallpaper. Any drive towards profitability will be resisted if it conflicts with tradition. To be truly successful, Coutts will have to instil a climate of change. This need not mean abandoning its culture but adapting and enhancing traditions that help the business as a whole.

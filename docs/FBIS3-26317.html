Speaking yesterday, premier Lien Chan stated that Taipei's  mainland policy was based on the situation that "there is one  China, but that it is divided" and that the "Republic of China"  holds the power of rule over the "Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu and  Kinmen area". He said: "There is no deep seated hatred between  the peoples on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Today's task  is to create for the next generation a free, stable and  prosperous future," the premier said.    Relations between Taipei and Beijing "should not be based on  ideas of life or death (you die, I live) or on the big consuming  the small or suffocating the other side," he added. "This would  be not unification but annexation," Mr. Lien declared.    Mr. Lien said he doubted whether simply elevating the level  of current talks between Beijing and Taipei would lead to  realization of the five-point accord signed in Singapore last  April between unofficial representatives from Beijing and Taipei.    While denying that Taipei was engaging in "money diplomacy,"  Mr. Lien acknowledged that "our biggest bargaining chip in  foreign relations is our economic strength".    A key focus of Taipei's international thrust would be the  so-  called "Southern Policy" which aims to encourage Taiwan  businessmen to invest in Southeast Asia. He said the policy  came about because we "did not want to place all of its economic  development on one place", referring to the growing trade and  investment with mainland China.    The premier's trip to Malaysia and Singapore to promote the  policy would be followed by a similar "vacation visit" by  President Lee Teng-hui to Bali, Indonesia and Thailand next  week, Taiwan diplomatic sources said.</p>

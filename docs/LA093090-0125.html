			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A BURGEONING COUNTY BUDGET?  </P> <P> James L. Doti of Chapman College presented a simplistic and misleading analysis  of the county's budget in the Aug. 26 commentary "Taxpayers will Eventually  Balk at Burgeoning County Budget."  </P> <P> The erroneous conclusion of the analysis is that the county budget has been  mismanaged because expenditures have grown at a rate greater than population  increases and inflation.  </P> <P> By simply looking at the county expenditures from 1975 to 1990, one might be  led to such a false conclusion. However, Doti's analysis lacks a much-needed  recognition of the increasing complexity of the county structure and service  system that has evolved over the past 15 years. This understanding is needed to  truly grasp the expenditure picture.  </P> <P> A primary reason the county's budget has grown over the past 15 years is that  the state and federal governments have required the county to assume the  financial and sometimes functional responsibilities for a host of services.  Examples include mandated social services programs and construction and  financing of new highways in the county.  </P> <P> Additionally, Orange County has evolved into a metropolitan region.  Consequently the county is a much more complex society today and it requires a  different and a more substantial mix of services to meet demands.  </P> <P> Had Doti taken the time to compare the services Orange County is providing and  funding this fiscal year to those 15 years ago, he would have reached a  conclusion that the county is now responsible for many more services, with more  than 50% of the county's General Fund budget financed by federal and state  government reimbursements.  </P> <P> Doti's review needs some comparative analysis to truly understand county  expenditures. A simple comparison of the per-capita expenditures among  California counties would have revealed that Orange County has the lowest among  all of the major metropolitan counties in the state. This speaks to fiscal  responsibility rather than the fiscal irresponsibility imputed by the  professor.  </P> <P> ERNIE SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> County administrative officer  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / France's PM urges faster move to Emu MR Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, yesterday called for faster progress to European monetary union. This was essential to ensure that the maximum number of European countries could subscribe to the union, though he recognised that accelerating the process was probably not possible for the time being. Mr Beregovoy's remarks - at a conference on Europe: the Way Forward, held by the Financial Times and the French newspaper Les Echos - were contrasted with the cautious step-by-step approach to monetary union advocated by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, who recommended that the timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty should be strictly followed. Mr Tietmeyer warned that any attempts to speed up European monetary union would be 'dangerous'. It would be safer to wait until a first assessment of the impact of the single European market and until the economic convergence criteria detailed in the Maastricht treaty had been durably achieved, Mr Tietmeyer said. The timetable in the treaty - in three stages up to January 1999 at the latest - was right, he said. The currency turmoil last autumn had underlined the risk of following 'an illusory policy'. The convergence criteria must be 'observed very closely' while the European Community must make a political effort to head off the burdens created by the end of governmental freedom to adjust individual exchange rates. Mr Tietmeyer said the present exchange rate parities in the EMS were sustainable and no upsets were expected this year. Imbalances in currency patterns accumulated over years had been sorted out in the realignments started with the currency crisis last September, so that the 'EMS has survived and will survive on the basis of current exchange rate parities', he said. The Bundesbank vice-president paid tribute to the consensus among French political leaders on the need to defend the franc and said he could only encourage them to continue. 'The fundamental facts of the French economy are OK and, compared to my own country, are better. The franc had saved itself, not just thanks to the Bundesbank's support.' His remarks are likely to comfort those in French political circles who expect that the French and German central banks will have to beat off a renewed assault on the franc about the time of French parliamentary elections next month. Mr Tietmeyer saw no point in forming a separate fixed-rate inner core of two or three strong currencies, the subject of recent speculation in Paris and Brussels. That 'would not be in line with the treaty', the spirit of which is that a basis for monetary union must be laid for all EC members. 'Of course, it is likely that, in the beginning, only some countries would be able to go,' he added. Mr Beregovoy also warned that the importance of social policies must not be forgotten in the creation of the European single market. 'Europe should not be only about competition and technocracy, it should also be about solidarity,' he said, recalling Hoover's recent decision to close a vaccuum cleaner plant near Dijon and shift to lower-cost production in Scotland. The Hoover affair, which has been drawn into the French election campaign, was also seized on by Mr Francois Perigot, president of the Patronat, the French employers' organisation, who pointed out that French social charges were so high that the US group could hardly be blamed for its move. He warned that attempts to interfere with foreign investors' freedom to act could harm France's chances of attracting more foreign investment. France should continue its hard franc policy - 'a floating franc would be catastrophic,' said Mr Perigot. The EC had yet to reach the right balance between a firm application of competition policy and the need to support important industries, said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French minister for industry and foreign trade. No major economy could maintain its position without a strong industrial base, the minister said.</p>

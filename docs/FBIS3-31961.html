Defending the validity of the government decision adopted on  28 January, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said today the  increase was "absolutely inevitable." He explained that this  decision is aimed at covering the budget deficit caused by the  fall in international petroleum prices. In statements made on a  radio and television network, Robalino noted that the plan  initially proposed to cover the fiscal gap -- estimated by the  government at $1 million per day -- did not include fuel hikes,  but only tax reforms. "However, Congress rejected the plan and  left us no other alternative," he continued.    The adjustment, which would result in $250 million in  additional revenue for the state in 1994, sparked a wave of  protests and street disturbances even before the official  announcement was made. On 28 January three policemen were  seriously injured in clashes with demonstrators, who closed the  major roadways in Ecuadoran cities again today.    The United Workers Front [FUT] today called for an  indefinite  general strike for an unspecified date, while the Transportation  Workers Union threatened to paralyze transportation if the  government insisted on its announcement to freeze fares.    All parties, except the two progovernment parties, voiced  their opposition to the measures prior to the government  announcement and reported their intentions to fight it in  Congress "like we did with the package to increase taxes," said  Heinz Moeller, legislative wing leader of the Social Christian  Party, the largest in the Chamber.    The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen is  experiencing a severe popularity crisis, confirmed by polls  taken even before the adjustment, with an approval rating of  below 10 percent. Additionally, political experts believe that  "the government is too weak, alone, and without prestige to try  to implement such a harsh and badly presented package."    However, the government said that "its economic successes,  in  particular lowering inflation to less than half in one year,  gives it the moral strength necessary to implement an adjustment  which, no matter what, is absolutely unavoidable."    Different parties and organizations have called for street  mobilizations on Monday, but the government anticipated today  that "no interference with peace will be tolerated."</p>

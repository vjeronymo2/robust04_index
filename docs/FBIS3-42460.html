			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text] Having studied the properties of water, S. Benson  and E.  Siebert (University of Southern California at Los Angeles) have  arrived at the conclusion that the molecules of this liquid do  not jostle randomly, but form short-lived networks in the shape  of cubes of eight molecules and rings of four molecules. The  cubes and rings are then formed into chains and networks.    Experimental data obtained for the hard and gas phases were  used to construct a theoretical model of water in the liquid  phase. The chemists claim that the microstructures they  discovered help explain some of the unusual properties of water,  such as its ability to absorb large amounts of heat and its  ability to expand on freezing.    Most liquids fall into one of two categories: they are  either  regular or structured. The molecules in regular liquids form  relatively weak bonds in pairs under the impact of van der Waals  forces. Because these forces do not have a particular direction,  the molecules are free to adopt any orientation relative to one  another to fill free space. The organic solvent  tetrachloromethane is an example of such a liquid. Such liquids,  the molecules of which are held together by stronger, oriented  forces, are among the regular liquids. Usually, these are  hydrogen bonds, which form between a slightly positive hydrogen  atom in one molecule and an oxygen atom with a weak negative  charge in a neighboring molecule.    Structured liquids cannot be described by the simple  empirical formulas that are used to describe the physical  properties of regular liquids. For example, each molecule in a  regular liquid with closely packed molecules can be surrounded  by 10-11 others. In a structured liquid, there can be as few as  4-5 of these molecules and therefore sufficient free space  remains between molecules.    The American scientists think that water is possibly the  most  extreme representative of a structured liquid. It has maximum  density at a temperature of 4C and an unexpectedly high  heat capacity. After many years of debates, scientists arrived  at the conclusion that hydrogen bonds are the cause of the  anomalous properties of water, however, there is still no  adequate theory that precisely predicts water's heat capacity  and fluidity or explains such a property of water as its low  density in solid state.    Benson and Siebert claim that with their new  octamer-tetramer  model of intermolecular hydrogen bonds permits them to predict  the physical characteristics of water in the entire range of  temperatures of the existence of the liquid phase (from 0 to  100C) with an accuracy of up to 2% with regard to  experimental data.    The scientists do not claim that water consists exclusively  of cubic and ring bonds of molecules, but they think that these  are the simplest and most widespread types of bonds. Instruments  do not yet exist that permit us to record such formations  because the hydrogen bonds between water molecules form and  break with a frequency of 500 Ghz.    Benson and Siebert say that water might also contain other  structures--such as cyclic pentamers (five molecules in a ring)  or decameric sandwich dimers. But they also admit that there is  no evidence of the existence of these microstructures, except  for calculations of thermal and volumetric properties which  match experimental data.    The proposed microstructural theory also explains water's  anomalous behavior when other substances are added. Although the  presence of simple hydrogen bonds predicts that a polar  substance such as ammonia gives off heat when it dissolves in  water, it cannot explain why this occurs even when nonpolar  tetrachloromethane dissolves.

BESSY-II is primarily designed for basic research and will  have a ring with a diameter three times as large as BESSY-I's,  which will permit the production of a magnetic field with  approximately 1,000-10,000 times greater voltage.    Construction of the new synchrotron will cost 190 million  Deutsche marks (&pound;68.5 million). The money will be allocated  by the German Federal Government and the Berlin authorities.

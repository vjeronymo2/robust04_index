			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FILES $150-MILLION SUIT OVER DEFUNCT INSURANCE FIRM  </P> <P> California Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie filed a $150-million lawsuit  Friday against five former directors of the defunct TMIC Insurance Co.,  alleging their negligence contributed to the company's demise.  </P> <P> Named in the Superior Court suit were Raymond Rodeno, TMIC's chairman and chief  executive officer; Gary Bradford, president and chief operating officer; John  Hoof Jr., director of sales and marketing; Robert Cohen, treasurer and chief  financial officer, and Thomas Kennedy, senior vice president for risk  management.  </P> <P> Gillespie was appointed liquidator of TMIC in April, 1988. At the time, the  state estimated that TMIC's assets totaled $169 million less than its  liabilities.  </P> <P> The defunct company's major creditors include scores of thrifts, as well as the  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., and the Federal National Mortgage Assn.  </P> <P> TMIC's troubles stemmed from policies it issued on mortgages held by investors  in a Virginia-based real estate tax shelter known as Equity Programs Investment  Corp.  </P> <P> In August, 1985, EPIC defaulted on $1.4 billion in mortgage loans for 20,000  homes, mostly in the Southwest. Between 1976 and 1985, TMIC had issued  insurance on more than 9,000 EPIC loans and was the largest single insurer of  mortgage guaranty insurance covering mortgage loans made to EPIC, the suit  says.  </P></p>

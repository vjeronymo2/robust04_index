			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 2.98m at Welpac Welpac, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.98m on turnover of Pounds 17.1m in the year to January 31. That compared with a loss of Pounds 694,000 from sales of Pounds 9.72m for 1992, restated to comply with FRS 3. Mr Gerald Lavender, chairman, said the 76 per cent increase in turnover reflected the acquisition of Anderson &amp; Firmin and TJ Harwood. The profits fall was the result of one-off exceptional costs and weak demand. Losses per share increased to 11.2p (4.1p). There is no dividend (last year a single final dividend of 0.2p was paid).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Green Left Congress Making List </F> `Greener'"]    [Text] Arnhem -- Last Saturday [5 February], the Green Left  electoral congress made three changes to the list of candidates  for the House of Representatives. Party Chairman M. Vos, who  was initially on the 17th position, ended up in 5th position.  This "safe" position is the result of the widely spread  dissatisfaction among the party members, who felt that the list  of candidates "was too much leftwing, and not green enough." As  a biologist, Vos can act as an environmental expert within the  party group.    Former student leader S. van Geest moved from the 15th to  the  11th position. This position might gain her a seat, if the  party gets the 12 seats presently forecast by the polls. Former  PvdA (Labor Party) Representative P. de Visser moved from the  30th to the 13th position. He left the PvdA because of his  criticism on that party's WAO policy (Law on Labor Disability).    A conflict between Green Left' various "blood groups" (CPN  [Netherlands Communist Party], PPR [Radical Political Party] and  PSP [Pacifist Social Party]), as feared by resigning party group  Chairman P. Lankhorst and candidate committee Chairman A. van  Es, was avoided. None of the three new candidates have been  members of the old parties.    As expected, the congress elected the tandem I. Brouwer and  M. Rabbae at the head of the list of candidates. Rabbae's  position within the party had been contested, after he had  stated in an interview with this newspaper, that, as far as he  was concerned, the book "Satanic Verses" by Salman Rushdie could  be banned by the judge. He managed to convince his audience in  Arnhem, that he had changed his mind since the novel had been  released. "With hindsight, I must acknowledge that I expressed  myself too vaguely in the interview with NRC," Rabbae said. "To  be perfectly clear", the former manager of the Dutch Center for  Foreigners stated that he regards Khomeyni's death sentence as a  "horrible crime."    The tandem P. Rosenmller and L. Sipkes, which lost the  battle  for list leadership last year, is on the third and fourth  positions of the list of candidates. An attempt by some party  members, including Senator W. de Boer, to relegate Sipkes to the  ninth position, failed.    The reason for this action, was the fact that Sipkes had  approved the defense budget in the House of Representatives,  against the congress' will.</p>

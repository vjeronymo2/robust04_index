			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / F W draws dark picture of S Africa referendum defeat 'YES] Ja] South Africa': President F W de Klerk, who set off yesterday on a two week whistle-stop tour of the white South Africa has clearly decided to keep his message simple in campaigning for the country's referendum. He has little choice. For President de Klerk has precious little good news to sell to white voters, who will decide two weeks from today whether to abandon the privileges of centuries in favour of multiracial democracy, or revive the fantasy of apartheid by voting no to political reform. His manner is polished and professional; with an easy smile and a twinkle in his eye, he charmed the Afrikaner youth of Stellenbosch yesterday, as he strolled through the university campus and lunched at the canteen. But charm is not enough to make his message palatable - even in Stellenbosch, the seat of Afrikaner learning and home of verligte (enlightened) Afrikanerdom. Repeatedly, Mr de Klerk promised voters on his day-long tour of the western Cape that his government would guarantee justice, stability, security and economic development - and crucially, that he would prevent blacks from dominating whites in a mirror image of apartheid. Many want to believe him; but most - at least in this region - will vote yes whether they believe him or not. The alternative is simply too frightening. For the strength of Mr de Klerk's campaign lies in conjuring up apocalyptic visions of a no vote in the referendum: this would bring the pro-apartheid Conservative Party to power, plunge South Africa into international isolation, probably provoke race war and destroy the already-weak economy. Weekend newspaper adverts said it bluntly: Vote no and turn South Africa into Lebanon. Mr de Klerk adopts a high moral tone in his public meeting; at Stellenbosch town hall, he spoke of justice for all South Africans, of a civilised society where citizens of all races can live as one nation. He appealed to the voters of Stellenbosch not to reject the 26m South Africans who are not white. He sketched a vision of a country enriched by its ethnic and racial diversity. But he spent at least half his address answering the main thrust of the Conservative party campaign to date: red-baiting. He denied that his party has entered into a de facto alliance with the African National Congress, which is itself closely allied to the South African Communist party. That message went down relatively well in Stellenbosch, which one adviser described as 'tame country for F W'. But it could well prove otherwise when Mr de Klerk takes his roadshow to more dangerous turf: the working-class suburbs of Johannesburg, the ultra-conservative Orange Free State; the northern Transvaal, home of Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader, as the campaign finale. For South Africans certainly want to end their international isolation - South Africa's participation in the current cricket world cup has proved wildly popular at home, even if the national team has lost its last two matches. They want sanctions to end and international lending to resume. But it is a moot point whether they really want the 'one nation, one South Africa' which F W de Klerk promises. Whatever his assurances to the contrary, many fear domination by blacks and the loss of economic privileges built up under apartheid. Two weeks is a very short time to persuade them otherwise.</p>

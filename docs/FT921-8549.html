			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (6): Widening horizons - Software developers exploit growing market MODERN portable computers are now powerful enough to be used for software applications that were once confined to desktop machines. Faster processor 'chips' and more advanced display screen technologies allow portable computers to be used for far more than simple note-taking and 'personal organiser' tasks. Software developers have recognised an opportunity to exploit a new and growing market. Later this spring, personal computer software giant Microsoft will introduce a new version of its popular Windows environment - version 3.1 - which incorporates features aimed specifically at the portable computer market. Microsoft hopes to extend its dominance of desktop computing - with the Windows/MS/DOS standard - to the portable computer market. Other software developers are keen to exploit the mobility and power of portable computers. Some build on existing applications and others bring innovative new applications to the market. There are signs, however, that there will be differences between the mature market for desktop software and the new market for portables. Mr Stephen Arnold, chairman and managing director of the UK portable applications specialist Softa, points out that there are different types of portable computer user and different demands for applications software - 'some people want a portable desktop - similar in function to the one in their office. Other portable users want something more job-specific.' Mr Arnold notes that job-specific, 'field-force' software applications - such as those used by service engineers and sales staff - require specially-built software and there is less need for standardisation - 'although historically people were bitten by the lack of standardization on the desktop - it is not so necessary on portables - especially if you have to develop special applications software.' 'Many players in the portable computing market are offering high-quality proprietary software. In the end, it is the context of the application that dictates what software you use - so you don't need to blindly assume that it must be standard MS/DOS,' he says. There are other signs that MS/DOS might not achieve dominance of the portable market. Toshiba, the Japanese manufacturer which dominates the portable computer market, announced in January that it would no longer 'bundle' MS/DOS with its computers - allowing purchasers to make their own choice. And companies like Psion, which produces a range of hand-held computers, have equipped them with their own proprietary operating software. Despite this, it seems likely that MS/DOS - and, when the new version arrives, Windows - will be the basis for much of the software for portable computers. 'The power of portables has improved so much that we can offer a full Windows environment now,' says Mr Mark Edwards, Windows product manager at Microsoft in the UK. 'We are introducing three specific features which will be important for portables: advanced power management; mouse 'trails' and optimised backgrounds for LCD screens.' The power-management features will be particularly welcome. Battery life on portables has improved - but it still needs to get better. The new Windows environment will be able to detect when the screen and disk drive are not being used and turn them off to conserve power. The mouse 'trails' make it easier to keep track of the cursor on the screen by leaving a trail of cursor marks. And the special backgrounds will make screens more readable. Established software developers are happy that MS/DOS and Windows will make the transition to portables and are building applications in key areas. Nextbase, a UK software specialist, has created Autoroute Express, a route-planning application, which sits well on a portable computer - even the hand-held Poqet computer. 'Our software is widely used on portable computers.' says Ian Mercer, managing director of Nextbase. Autoroute is, essentially, a simple application which lets you work out the quickest or shortest route from one town to another. The product covers all of Europe and the US - with more detailed versions for the UK and France. Directions and maps can be viewed on the screen or printed out. 'We recognised the potential for the product on a portable and built the software to work well in a low-performance computer,' says Mr Mercer. Looking to the future, Mr Mercer says that the company plans to bring out a version for Microsoft Windows - 'in my opinion, MS/DOS and Windows are so universal that they will be much more popular than proprietary systems. People don't want to have to learn new ways of working.' Nextbase also intends to exploit the advantages of portability by using the emerging Global Positioning System (GPS), which uses satellites to transmit longitude and latitude co-ordinates. 'The price is still high - but it won't be long before it tumbles down to below a Dollars 1,000. We have done some work into putting GPS into the Autoroute software. Then you will be able to see where you are on an on-screen map,' says Mr Mercer. Other software companies are working on the communications potential of portable computers. Kerridge Network Systems, a UK communications specialist, claims a world 'first' with a British-designed high specification modem for portable computers which comes with a wide range of software options. 'We have worked closely with Toshiba to develop communications software for the corporate environment both for remote and loc al connections,' says Mr Nigel Hawley, general manager of Kerridge Network Systems. Kerridge's products allow a portable computer to work like an old-fashioned terminal to a large mainframe system or as a participant in a local area network - 'we've used special hardware which allows us to change the function of the modem using clever software. You can connect simultaneously to a remote mainframe and, say, a viewdata system,' explains Mr Hawley. The Kerridge range brings portable computing full circle - giving it the potential to form an integral part of traditional data processing applications. This will certainly help to put portable computers alongside desktop computers as 'windows' moves into the corporate network and beyond. It might even mean the eventual disappearance of the desktop computer altogether. Software suppliers are introducing innovative products for portables</p>

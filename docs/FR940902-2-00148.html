			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, even though Amendment No. 1 does not specifically define ``pattern of weakness'' for purposes of Rule 509(b)(4), the Commission does not believe that this lack of specificity will create undo confusion as the application of the rule. Any specialist that is cited for substandard performance for this reason will still be entitled to a meeting with the Subcommittee to discuss the reasons for the finding and if an adverse decision is sustained after that meeting, the specialist will be entitled to appeal that determination. Additionally, a specialist can reapply and have the Enhanced Parity Split reinstated once the condition which led to the suspension is found to no longer exist. As a result, the Commission believes that the lack of specificity does not raise any significant regulatory concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Amendment No. 2 merely codifies that intent stated in the original proposal <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  that specialists will only become eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split described herein once they are no longer eligible to receive the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialists pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the foregoing reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Phlx's proposal on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change.

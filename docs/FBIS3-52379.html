			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mutual Ties, Better Than Expectations"] </F>   [Text] The Iranian First Vice-President, Dr. Habibi  returned home on Wednesday [22 December] after a two-day visit  to Turkey.    At the Ankara airport the Turkish prime minister and Dr.  Habibi enumerated the results of the bilateral talks, and  described the prospects for the future of the cooperation  between the two countries quite hopeful.    After the death of the late Turkish president, Turgut Ozal,  in April 1993 many political analysts had expressed the opinion  that the period of friendly relations between Iran and Turkey  had passed away along with the deceased Turkish president.    This group of analysts focussed on a series of parameters  which reflected the personal preferences of president Ozal, and  arrived at the conclusion that mutual ties between Iran and  Turkey were founded on personal factors and decisions.    In practice, however, it has been proven that the above  conclusion is erroneous, and the reason is quite obvious.  Common interests between the two countries are of such depth  and range that no political leader in Turkey can escape the  conclusion that maintaining and even expanding cordial relations  with the Islamic Republic of Iran is a necessity in view of the  national interests of Turkey.    It cannot be denied of course that there are many  influential  groups in Turkey that would like to function as the agent of the  Western pressures of Iran. These influential groups are mainly  scattered in the Turkish press and army.    The influence of the Zionists among the Turkish press is  quite obvious and even the Turkish statesmen do not try to deny  it in their negotiations. But the prevalent conditions in the  world and in the region does not allow them to appear as final  determining forces on the political arena.    The geographical region formed by Turkey-Iran provides the  Europeans with the natural access to Asia. In fact political  leaders in the two countries could arrive at early solutions for  minor differences such as the presence of opposition forces in  both countries, as soon as the leaders are able to view  bilateral ties between Iran and Turkey within the context of a  global perspective of political issues.    The propaganda campaign launched by the Western media last  year on the supposed rivalry between Iran and Turkey in the  Central Asian countries also proved to be a misconception in  practice. Once again the realities of political life have shown  that no fierce competition is practicable or even advisable.  The Central Asian countries are so poor and so much in need of  assistance, that there will always be scope for activity no  matter how much is done in that region. Furthermore, both Iran  and Turkey are facing so many economic problems that they can  invest in the Central Asian republics only on a limited scale.</p>

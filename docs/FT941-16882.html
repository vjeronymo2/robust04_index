			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Making safe glass for outer space Out in space, debris is accumulating, writes Andrew Fisher. High velocity particles of 'space junk' - from obsolete satellites and rocket stages, for example - orbit the earth and menace manned missions. In Freiburg, Germany, the Fraunhofer Institute is testing special samples of glass, as used in observation windows in the Russian MIR space station, in a joint venture with Deutsche Aerospace. Using high-speed cameras, researchers analyse the effects of impacts at high velocity for use in the future design of spacecraft components.

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Jakarta 'clean-up' criticised Indonesian authorities are cracking down on government critics, labour activists and alleged criminals to 'clean up' the capital Jakarta before next week's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, according to Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organisation. It said yesterday the crackdown began with an anti-crime campaign in April but had been broadened to include 'arbitrary arrest of political detainees, some of whom had been tortured and ill-treated, the unfair trial and arbitrary imprisonment of labour activists and the dramatic escalation in the number of unlawful killings of alleged criminals.'

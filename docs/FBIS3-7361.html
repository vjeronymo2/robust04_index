			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Traitor's Ugly, Traitorous </F> Junket"]    [Text] According to reports, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a  junket to Japan during the period from March 24 to 26 despite  strong protests of the South Korean and Japanese peoples. As a  pro-Japanese stooge, his every move made during the junket was  consistent with begging, asking, and traitorous acts from first  to last.    What cannot go unnoticed before anything else is the fact  that traitor Kim Yong-sam, in the meeting with Japanese Premier  Hosokawa, plotted joint countermeasures and asked Japan to join  in possible UN sanctions pn us by finding fault with our  fictitious nuclear issue. This vividly shows that his junket to  Japan was a total antinational junket aimed at harming his  fellow countrymen in collaboration with the outside forces.    As everyone knows, our nuclear issue is a by-product of  schemes and conspiracies hatched by the imperialist  reactionaries who aim at crushing [apsal] our republic. The  U.S. imperialists totally overturned the agreement of the  DPRK-U.S. New York contact and massively deployed its aggression  troops on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding region, thus  driving the situation to the brink of war. This is also aimed  at realizing such a goal.    If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula as intended by  the United States and its stooge South Korea, the entire land  will suffer the nuclear holocaust. If the Kim Yong-sam clique  had the slightest national conscience and wants peace and  reunification, it should have rebuffed the imperialist  reactionaries' maneuvers instead of banding together with them  who try to harm the fellow countrymen. However, instead, he led  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war with  the outside forces and did not stop there. He even begged the  Japanese reactionaries to take part in joint countermeasures and  sanctions, and thus attempted to do something against us. What  a vicious traitor the rascal [nom] is!    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his junket, raved about  economic  cooperation by enumerating on the rectification of the trade  imbalance, the settlement of the industrial gap, and so forth.  This, too, cannot be go unnoticed. The South Korean economy is  a colonial subordinate economy and is a fragile economy which  cannot be sustained even for a minute without U.S. and Japanese  equipments, facilities, capital, and technologies.    The puppets have been babbling all along that they will  reduce their trade deficit with Japan. However, because of  their weak economy, rather than reducing the trade deficit, it  has been increasing every year.    The Kim Yong-sam ring agreed to expand investment, open up  the construction market, and allow Japan's small and  medium-sized businesses to advance into South Korea. This will  only result in further intensifying Japan's political and  economic domination and subordination against South Korea.    Moreover, what cannot be tolerated is that as a single  remark  of reflecting on the past, Japan's emperor and prime minister  tried to speak ambiguously of the crimes of the Japanese  imperialists' aggression on Korea and barbarous colonial rule  which lasted for almost half a century, and in this connection,  Kim Yong-sam said that the past must no longer restrain the  future and babbled about establishing a new South Korea-Japan  relation.    During the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule which lasted  for some 40 years, the calamities and sufferings which the  Japanese imperialists inflicted upon the Korean people are truly  innumerably tremendous. This criminal history cannot by any  means be erased with the single remark of making a reflection.    When viewing the issue of comfort women, the Japanese  imperialists committed a sin against God and man by forcibly  dragging in some 200,000 Korean women to carry out all kinds of  atrocities and even took their lives. Its truth must be  thoroughly explained and this issue can be resolved only when  appropriate compensation is made.    Therefore, the South Korean people waged demonstrations  right  before the puppet traitor's junket to Japan and urged that Kim  Yong-sam wholly reveal Japan's crimes and strongly demand  compensation from Japan. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam did not  even open his mouth on this matter. Nevertheless, because of  the single remark on making a reflection, he said that he highly  assesses this, that the past must not restrain the future, and  so on. Thus, he made the crimes committed by the past Japanese  imperialists' into white paper. How is this different from the  Ulsa-5 Treaty?    As a result, traitor Kim Yong-sam's junket to Japan was a  nation-selling junket to tarnish the nation's dignity and sell  the nation's interest. Therefore, the rascal once again  revealed his true nature as an ugly flunkeyist nation-seller  currying favor with outside forces without knowing shame or  honor if it is for his personal idleness and to maintain power.    The criminal conspiracy between the South Korean puppets and  Japanese reactionaries runs counter to the cause of peace and  will only result in all the more aggravating tension on the  Korean peninsula. All the Korean people will absolutely not  forgive traitor Kim Yong-sam who is all the more running toward  confrontation and division by visiting outside forces.</p>

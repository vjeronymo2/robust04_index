This  year was extremely difficult for the Haitian people who hope for  a different kind of year for 1994. On the occasion of this end  of the year, politicians and legislators invade the radios and  the press to address the nations. In various messages, those  political and parliamentary personalities are calling for a  solution to the crisis.    First of all, the Senate president calls on Haitians to  overcome narrow concepts and to keep what is essential. In his  message, Firmin Jean-Louis asks the various protagonists of the  crisis not to consider themselves the unique holders of truth.  The president of the National Assembly believes that national  reconciliation is still possible in 1994. Here is a summary of  this speech, made on 30 December by the Senate president, with  Edner Jean:    [Begin recording] [Jean] Of 1993, Firmin Jean-Louis will  carry a souvenir of the year loaded with anguish, broken dreams,  a country that has reached rock bottom. However, he recalls that  1993 also carried with it the most ambitious dreams -- the dream  of seeing the resolution of the crisis on the one hand, and on  the other, a new start including democracy, a state of law,  economic and social progress. It is the opposite, however, that  the Senate president observed this 30 December. He noticed among  other things the pauperization of the middle class, the  annihilition of the country's deprived classes, a phenomenon  caused by the worsening of the economic situation.    On the political plane, it is generalized institutional  crisis: The state runs on the sly; the Cassation Court lodged an  appeal against a decree pensioning off its president; the  supreme audit court and its administrative litigation are  floundering in an unending internal crisis; the government is  basically headless; the parliament is working administratively,  but without political efficiency, notes the president of the  National Assembly, before adding that from this absence of a  state follows the emergence of nonconventional forces which  exercise enormous pressures on the entire society -- pressures,  threats, and even violent and deadly actions. He takes as proof  the latest events in Cite Soleil.    [Jean-Louis] The systematic violations of human rights did  not stop multiplying. The most recent and horrible episode would  perhaps be the one in Cite Soleil about 72 hours ago. Assured of  impunity, individuals, in broad daylight, put the burning torch  to more than 200 small houses, leaving fathers and mothers in  despair, mourning, and in fear of counting their dead ones.    [In Creole] About three days ago, we know what happened in  Cite Soleil, where people set fire to more than 200 family  houses. They killed people, and people are so afraid they dread  counting the dead bodies.    [Jean] However, he refuses to speak of definitive failure,  nor that he sees futility in the painful sight of a nation  seeking its way. President Firmin Jean-Louis, and with him the  entire Senate, are rather of a constructive, productive  optimism, expressing a desire to see Haitians triumph in the  concepts of great and small concord, in order to keep what is  essential: the reconciliation of the nation with itself.    [Jean-Louis in French] To President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  to Prime Minister Robert Malval and the government's members, to  the general command and members of Haiti's Armed Forces, to the  leaders and members of the various churches working in the  territory, to the political leaders, to the labor unions, the  socioprofessional associations, to the students, members of the  media, to the representatives of the international community, to  the 18 January elected legislators who voluntarily agreed to  refrain themselves until the seating of the arbitration  committee that we impatiently await, to all of you, Haitian  brothers and sisters from here and everywhere in the world, we  fervently wish you courage, health, and happiness.    May each of us stop considering himself the unique holder of  the historical weight of our founding ancestors. May we be able,  Haitians and foreigners, to show restraint in the face of  another's opinion. Then and only then will there be a start in  Haiti, an era of a state of law and, we hope to see one day  [word indistinct] of new times, awaited by all.    [Jean] Through this message at the end of the year, Firmin  Jean-Louis showed that he still enjoyed the trust of the other  members of the Senate Bureau who all supported his statements,  but silently, as if to say that a compromise is still possible  between the Alliance and the constitutionalists.

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD 'BIG GREEN' WOE: A WATER FINE OF $209,000  </P> <P> Stanford University will pay a steep price for keeping its football field and  campus green after mandatory water rationing was imposed during the summer.  </P> <P> The university has been fined $209,000 by the San Francisco Water Department,  its largest supplier of water, since August.  </P> <P> Its bill for October alone ran an extra $127,237 because Stanford used 25.9  million gallons beyond its limit, about a third more than its allotment.  </P> <P> The state's water crisis, brought on by four consecutive years of below-average  rainfall, has forced most water customers in the area to endure short showers  and brown lawns.  </P> <P> Overall, 80% of customers have managed to stay within their allotments,  according to Cheryl Davis, manager of the water department's customer service  division.  </P> <P> But Stanford utilities manager David Kaye said the school had to water the  campus extensively in October because it was such a dry month.  </P> <P> Since August the university has used 54 million gallons of excess water.  </P> <P> Until this week, Stanford had been watering its football field, lawns and golf  course with water from supplies at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir near Yosemite.  </P> <P> "Some of the athletic fields are also classrooms, if you want to stretch the  meaning of classrooms," Kaye said.  </P> <P> But a long-term water conservation plan is needed, university officials  concede.  </P> <P> Stanford has installed meters on buildings that didn't have them, including 800  faculty homes, and it turned off its seven decorative fountains and stopped  washing university cars.  </P> <P> The 25.9 million extra gallons Stanford used in October was enough to supply  more than 14,000 people for a month, based on figures from the water  department.  </P></p>

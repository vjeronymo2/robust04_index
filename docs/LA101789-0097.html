			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: COMPANY WILL CLOSE REFINERY IN SANTA CLARITA  </P> <P> Newhall Refining Co., which operates an oil refinery in Santa Clarita, said it  plans to suspend operations by year's end, resulting in the layoff of about 70  people.  </P> <P> Newhall Refining, a unit of Pauley Petroleum of Los Angeles, said about 15 of  its 86 employees will be offered jobs at Pauley's other refining unit, Fletcher  Oil &amp; Refining Co. in Carson. The rest will be laid off, it said.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita refinery has suffered losses in recent years, and future  demand for the refinery's products -- mostly liquid asphalt, fuel oil and jet  fuel -- appear "unlikely to reach sufficient levels to justify a resumption of  operations in the near future," Newhall Refining said.  </P></p>

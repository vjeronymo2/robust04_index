			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Revival reawakens old demons: Barry Riley examines the extent to which the end of the UK recession may mark the beginning of higher inflation A rise in the annual headline inflation rate from 1.8 to 1.9 per cent last month might not seem very significant, but it was enough to set off a minor attack of the jitters in the financial markets yesterday. The background is an apparent revival of the British economy. Once again the forecasters appear to have got it wrong, this time by being too cautious, and manufacturing output in February was 1.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile a frisson of expectation spread through the housing market over Easter, and the press positively glowed at the indications of a recovery in house prices. But will the downside to the economic recovery be a revival in inflation? This week's wholesale price indices for March appeared to show that industry is still absorbing much of the inflationary year-on-year 8.3 per cent rise in input costs of materials and fuel which has resulted from last year's devaluation. Output price inflation has remained stable at about 3.7 per cent for several months. But if demand picks up substantially industry could decide to take advantage of the opportunity to rebuild its battered profit margins. Mortgage interest rate cuts in the past few months have allowed the headline rate of retail price inflation to fall below 2 per cent, the lowest level for 26 years, but the underlying rate excluding mortgage interest has stayed obstinately at around 3 1/2 per cent. This is the version of the inflation rate that the government is targeting within a 1 to 4 per cent range. Both the Treasury (which has forecast a 3 3/4 per cent rate for the final quarter of 1993) and the Bank of England appear to believe it is touch-and-go whether the 4 per cent ceiling will be exceeded later this year which may explain why the government has been so pleased to see sterling strengthening in recent weeks. Indeed the sterling index has bounced up by more than 5 per cent since its February low point, and although exporters may not be pleased at losing competitiveness, nevertheless there will be benefits for inflation, for instance from this week's cuts in petrol prices. But these are very short-term effects. Does anybody really believe that over the longer run Britain's bad inflationary habits have been cured? Certainly the long end of the government securities market weakened on this week's evidence of economic recovery. Long gilt yields of about 8.3 per cent strike an awkward compromise between the 4 and 6 per cent returns in Japan and Germany, regarded as low inflation countries, and the double-figure yields of, for example, Italy and Spain. There are two schools of thought. One argues that almost regardless of what the British government does the country has entered a period of strong deflationary tendencies. It could be quite misleading, and indeed dangerous, to look back to the 1970s and 1980s and follow over-restrictive policies. But many other people are scarred by their inflationary experiences of the past 25 years, during which average annual inflation has been 9 per cent. Professional investors in the City of London are deeply cynical about the ability and integrity of the government. They fear that the huge scale of prospective public borrowing will eventually force the government down an inflationary path. To begin with, however, the optimists. The first point is that the decline in inflation is common to most developed countries, even to those like Italy which have the worst financial problems. Average inflation in the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations has dropped from 4.7 per cent in 1990 to maybe 2.5 per cent this year. Besides the short-term cyclical effects from the current recession, there has been a long-term downtrend in commodity prices. Moreover the emergence of big new industrial powers, notably China, has depressed the price level of traded goods, which in turn has caused industrial recession and a shakeout in the labour markets, especially in Europe. Pay pressures have collapsed: yesterday's UK rail strike was about job security rather than incomes, while pay inflation is now below 5 per cent and hitting new lows. Moreover many of the English-speaking countries (together with Scandinavia and Japan) are in the grip of so-called debt deflation, as they seek to throw off the after-effects of bank lending binges and property market bubbles. The UK is a prime member of this group. Through the 1980s the broad measure of the money supply, M4, grew at an average annual rate of 16 per cent, fuelling eventual inflation. But now M4 growth has collapsed to little more than 3 per cent, which according to monetarist economists makes a revival of inflation quite impossible in the near future. Finally, the social balance in Britain has changed substantially over the past 25 inflationary years. The trade unions, primarily representing aggressive younger workers, have dwindled in importance; pensioners and other older age groups who fear inflation have grown in relative numbers. The inflation of the 1970s, it can be argued, was triggered by a combination of trade union power and commodity price shocks. By the 1980s inflation had been brought right down (to 2.4 per cent in the summer of 1986) but a new burst was set off by irresponsible financial deregulation leading to excessive monetary growth. Now, however, monetary growth is, if anything, too low. There is no need to worry about inflation any more. Investors, on this argument, may be making a dangerous mistake - the reverse of the error made in the postwar period when fixed interest securities were bought without proper regard to the danger of future inflation. This time investors are staying in equities or in short-term deposits instead of buying long-dated gilts on yields of 8 per cent-plus. When those yields tumble to 5 or 6 per cent as fears of inflation dwindle, big profits will be made. Investors clinging to the equity market or building society accounts could be left more or less stranded. But experienced British investors who have spent a lifetime combating the menace of inflation cannot change their mind set quite so easily. Above all they are concerned about the vagueness of government policy. If a fiercely independent central bank like the Bundesbank were in charge it would be very different. But the British government bungled its participation in the European exchange rate mechanism and is now wallowing in apparent confusion. For instance, until recently it was targeting the narrow version of the money supply M0, which was supposed to rise no faster than 4 per cent year-on-year. Recently, however, M0 growth has accelerated - to 4.9 per cent for March. The government's response has been purest Sir Humphrey: it has changed the target band to a 'monitoring range' which it says requires no action. Similarly, but in reverse, when M4 growth sank below the 4 per cent lower limit of its previous monitoring range the Treasury simply widened the range to 3 to 9 per cent. If the government's approach to monetary control is as wishy-washy as this, how seriously can we take the target for underlying inflation? This is for a range of 1 to 4 per cent in the near term, falling to the bottom half of the range - that is, 1 to 2 1/2 per cent - by the time of the next election in, say, 1996. This kind of target in itself may be ill-advised. It has, for instance, ruled out early rises in indirect taxes. It also fails to differentiate between imported inflation, which may be a good thing if it encourages a revival of production of traded goods in the UK, and domestic inflation deriving from the public sector or the services sector, which should unquestionably be avoided. Inflation sceptics point to the desperate need of the government to get the British economy moving ahead, which may cause it to bend its monetary policies further. But the biggest problem arises from government borrowing, forecast to reach Pounds 50bn in the current financial year, or 8 per cent of gross domestic product, a level of excess spending not seen since the inflationary 1970s. Borrowing on a similar scale could easily persist for several years. On March 31 the Bank of England auctioned Pounds 3bn of a 20-year gilt at a yield of 8.53 per cent. Such issues are now coming monthly, and if inflation is really to tumble to 2 per cent or so they will prove cripplingly expensive for the taxpayer to service. You can look at this problem two ways. On the one hand, faced with wary and suspicious capital markets the government will find it difficult to pursue inflationary policies, or interest rates will move up further. On the other hand, the high interest rates will eventually make the debt burden intolerable. At some point - which might be several years off - the government would end its long-term funding programme and would resort to financing itself through the banking system. This would set off a new spiral of rapid inflation, and the holders of the vast volumes of government debt now being issued would be the victims, effectively, of progressive de facto default. So you can imagine two profiles for the UK inflation rate. In one case there will be short-term pressures as price rises suppressed during the ERM period emerge through the pipeline, but deflationary forces will dominate as we move into the mid-1990s. On the alternative model, however, inflation will become re-established as the economic recovery proceeds, and the difficulties of funding the public sector deficit will become acute. In practice, the key to the riddle may lie in how the government reacts to economic shocks. But for the rosy scenario to unfold, surely at the very least public borrowing must be reduced well below current medium-term projections, and the authorities must develop a coherent and consistent framework for monetary policy. The government must resist delights such as a renewed house price boom, and must initiate large-scale cuts in public spending. If you believe it will, you may believe in its inflation targets.</p>

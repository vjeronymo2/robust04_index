			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / BA cabin staff to decide on action THOUSANDS of passengers could face further disruption on British Airways domestic and European flights as a result of the dispute with cabin crew members of the TGWU general union. The crews will today consider another one-day strike over new terms and conditions. BA has made what it describes as a final offer and warned that if cabin crew staff take action they could be suspended. The dispute is over compensation for new terms and conditions under which about 1,000 staff face pay cuts of Pounds 2,000, on salaries of Pounds 14,000 a year. Next year crews will receive pay rises only if inflation is above 4 per cent. BA says its improved compensation package is worth almost Pounds 1,500.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Gardening: Spring pests are on the march - . . . but Robin Lane Fox is already marshalling his killer forces against them AMONG THE marvellous haze of blossom on the first prunus trees, it would be easy to sit back during this weekend, head for the suburbs and enjoy the sudden beauty of Britain's streets. Even in the garden there is continuing confusion: hellebores are flowering with forsythias, primroses have been out for ages, and pulmonarias are behaving as if the Budget did not threaten. Before setting out my plan of action, I must put in a word for a deep blue pulmonaria called Highdown Blue. Special forms of pulmonaria seem to multiply yearly, but this one has a vigour and depth of colour which outclasses the many others I have tried. Highdown Blue flowers madly at a height of about nine inches, but the colour is so deep that it stands out at a distance in small groups, dotted at intervals in the front of a border which is otherwise out of season. The flowers wilt as soon as you pick them, but revive smartly if put in hot water. This plant seems quite indestructible, even after somebody squashed it by parking a car on top of it out of season. Highdown Blue is my plant of the week, but it is certainly not my weekend problem. Here, the answer is brutally simple: get a move on. Every year, most of us attack our weeds and diseases too late. My armoury is already on red alert, a task force with four props until somebody tells me of a fifth which is even better. In mid-March, you are most unlikely to be thinking about leaves on your roses, let alone about black spot, the disease which strips them in so many gardens from July onwards. Black spot was awful last year but, if you want to control it this year, you must act at once. Indeed, in another 10 days or so, you will be too late. The weaponry here is a systemic fungicide which works through stems and leaves and acts as a prevention rather than a cure. It needs to be in place before the disease takes hold. The best chemical to buy is Nimrod T, sold by ICI at about Pounds 5 for enough of a dose to cope with a large rose border throughout the season. The instructions suggest that you spray in May and never go away afterwards, but experts prefer to begin much sooner and be more relaxed later in the year. Already, young shoots on roses are wonderfully far ahead and so you can strike the first defensive blow, making a serious impression. Nimrod T is sprayed all over the plant. You will need to follow up at least once a month but, insofar as anything combats this hideous disease, this compound is the best answer. While you are out, you also spray the hollyhocks, as Nimrod T is effective against the rust which acts like black spot on a rose and strips off their leaves in August. Among moulds, not spots, the mild and wet winter has been very welcome. I am finding that there has been considerable carnage through the lower levels of my planting, especially among pinks and anything with silvery tendencies. Wet seasons are wonders for mildew and, once again, it pays to start very early. On anything prone to mildew - violas and most forms of clematis - I prefer to use Benlate. After spraying clematis with this brand name, you have also protected against the dreaded wilt. You can then start to feed, a process which enthusiasts began on clematis as early as February. As an easy food with a relatively high value, I still stand by Phostrogen, which is diluted and sprayed on to the leaves. Weapon number three is a familiar visitor to this column but familiarity does not breed weeds, especially if you spray them with Roundup. Conditions this week have been ideal for its use: calm, dry days have encouraged early growth on grass and broad-leaved weeds, which are now sufficiently voracious to take up a dose of their own death. For several days, we have been spraying Roundup on to unwanted grass, dandelions, daisies, broad-leaved weeds and that infernal little white-flowered bitter cress which is such a space-invader during March and April. The key element in Roundup is glyphosate and, previously, gardeners were supposed to buy it under the name of Tumbleweed (which I always found to be weaker and more erratic). Professionals, meanwhile, would go to a farm chemical supplier, sign the poison book and use Roundup in bulk on large areas. Since last year, garden centres have been selling Roundup GC for gardeners' approved use, a stronger weapon than the Tumbleweed of their past. Roundup takes up to three weeks to show its effects, but it is harmless to gardens because it kills only by contact with a leaf, not by lingering in the soil. On my floral calendar, this month (as usual) is lined with mildly dotty 'Green Garden Tips.' In March, they suggest that we should all cover our flowerbeds with polythene in order to encourage weeds to germinate so that we can then spend April hoeing them off in bulk. I suggest that we all join the 20th century and spray the really difficult weeds, which are not just annual seeds and which 'Green Tips' somehow fails to discuss. Roundup GC will knock out big patches of weeds and coarse grass if used now during a dry, still period of the day. As yet, it will not knock out the ever-sliming slug. Slugs have had a dream winter during all the rain, and have already made an hors d'oeuvres out of my dicentras and sandwiches out of the emergent hostas. Fortunately, they are also very responsive to Growing Success, a newish granular killer with aluminium sulphate. The granules can be scattered or diluted, and I prefer to scatter them like mouse-killer between plants. It is billed as a molluscicide, and I think that the slippery beasts deserve it. It is not a bait but claims to kill by 'contact action,' and to be 'used by people who care about pets, birds, hedgehogs and livestock.' If you like pets, except slugs, you will love Growing Success. It is spreading now through garden centres but, if you cannot track it, its makers are at South Newton, Salisbury, Wiltshire; which is part of the Wessex Peat Group. I now use it against slimers before anything else: the granules can even be diluted and sprayed carefully among young seedlings, including salad plants. So far, this final prong in my armoury seems to mount an effective defence for several months at a time. If you cannot face spraying, do try scattering, but also please take your lesson from this early season. The flowers are early, the Highdown Blues and all the primulas, but so are the pests, not to mention this summer's diseases.</p>

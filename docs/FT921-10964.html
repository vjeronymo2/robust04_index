			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / More cuts in US defence spending sought LEADERS of the Democrats yesterday took aim at the Bush administration's Dollars 267.6bn (Pounds 147.8bn) defence budget proposal, unveiled last week, complaining that the Pentagon was too reluctant to cut its armed forces after the end of the Cold War. Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, led the onslaught, complaining that the administration's budget proposal would trim only 4 per cent a year from spending, compared with reductions that were already set at 3 per cent a year before the break-up of the Soviet Union. 'It would seem to many unbiased observers that the reward for peace is modest indeed,' Mr Sasser said. Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, the chairman of the National Governors' Association, urged President George Bush in a White House meeting to double the Dollars 50bn savings he has planned on defence spending over the next five years. Speaking at a budget committee meeting with Mr Richard Cheney, the defence secretary, and General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr Sasser said the Pentagon's plans for reducing its force structure from 18 to 12 active army divisions and from 10 to six reserve divisions had been devised at a time when the Soviet Union was fielding 190 ground divisions. The 'base force' plan for 12 rather than 14 navy carrier battle groups was laid out at a time when the Soviet navy had 240 surface warships operating daily in international waters, he went on. 'Today, that entire Soviet fleet, which I frankly thought was greatly overestimated, save for the submarine force, is in port and is dry-docked. There's no fuel. There's no morale,' Mr Sasser said. But Mr Cheney counter-attacked, demanding that Congress give him greater freedom to make the defence cuts he wanted instead of compelling him to buy equipment he did not want, such as the experimental V-22 Osprey aircraft or the F-14 and F-16 fighters. Mr Cheney and General Powell have argued that the base force structure they propose is the minimum necessary to ensure that the US retains a strong national defence, rather than a hollow force that will leave the country unprepared for the next threat.</p>

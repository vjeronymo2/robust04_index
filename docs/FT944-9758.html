			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up SOUTH AFRICA The Johannesburg stock exchange last week reversed its long-standing opposition to dual capacity trading and screen trading, and also said that it would permit brokerages to be 100 per cent foreign owned within a year of amendments to the stock exchange act being passed, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. This follows intensive discussions over a special report on the restructuring of the South African market which was released in August. That document had proposed only that an initial 30 per cent of local brokers could be bought by foreigners and said that the introduction of dual capacity trading, whereby brokers can act as both agents and principals, would have to be preceded by the abolition of domestic exchange controls. However, after vociferous complaints by domestic and international banking groups, who had threatened to form a rival exchange if more radical reforms were not pursued, the JSE committee announced the modifications. It also said that 'informal but constructive' discussions between domestic banks and the JSE on the question of admitting banks as members of the exchange had taken place and that formal negotiations would begin shortly. But the committee warned that the granting of permission to JSE members to participate in dual capacity trading would be contingent on the development of proper surveillance systems and changes to the exchange's official rules to provide for the full transparency of such transactions, as well as amended capital requirements for brokers. The acceptance in principle of having domestic broking companies wholly owned by foreigners is merely an acknowledgment of the inevitable. Most of South Africa's main broking houses have already announced alliances with international partners and have declared their intention to formalise these as soon as the necessary legislative amendments have been accepted. GREECE The Athens stock exchange was hit hard by the government's decision to postpone floating 25 per cent of OTE, the telecoms monopoly, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Mr Yannis Tegopoulos of Midland Pantelakis Securities said: 'The mood was gloomy already, so there was some heavy selling on the news. People are worried that the postponement may be indefinite.' The flotation, set for early December, was called off on Tuesday when the government was informed by CS First Boston, advising on the sale, that the asking price was too high. The government had hoped to raise about Dr320bn (Dollars 1.4bn), with 18 per cent of the company being placed with institutions abroad through a book-building procedure. The other 7 per cent was to be offered to domestic investors. However, first soundings indicated a share price 15 per cent lower than the government projection. The flotation is now provisionally set for February. Potential investors were concerned over the government's insistence that OTE would remain under state management. Uncertainties over OTE's business plan, the size of its licence fee and the absence of audits to western European standards, also had an impact, analysts said. Nonetheless, DEP, the state-owned oil refining and petroleum products group, which was due to follow OTE to the market next year, said its plans for a partial flotation would not be affected by the postponement.

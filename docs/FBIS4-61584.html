			<p>BFN     [Text] The first 113 Russian nationals evacuated from Yemen  have returned home. A transport aircraft from the Russian  Ministry of Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters,  which flew them out of the neighboring state of Djibuti  alongside two Slovak nationals [as heard], landed today at 0440  at Ramenskoye airport outside Moscow. All of the new arrivals  are feeling good. They were welcomed by representatives of the  Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry, and other organizations,  and were all driven to their homes.    The second aircraft with the next group of evacuees is  expected to fly to Russia later today.</p>

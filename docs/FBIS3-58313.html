Investigations indicate that his conviction could be the reason  for the series of letter bomb attacks [carried out last  December].    The unidentified blackmailers threatened to poison several  people if their demands were not met. They demanded that a  helicopter be placed ready and waiting at a field at  Hennersdorf, south of Vienna, at 1:00 PM on Sunday [9 January].  Kuessel should be brought there direct from prison and taken  away in the helicopter. His destination was not to be released  by the blackmailers until immediately afterwards.    Police met most of the blackmailers' demands. They provided  a helicopter and they also brought someone resembling Kuessel  along to the helicopter, which took off at 1:30 PM. Yet, there  was no sign of the blackmailers, whereupon police broke off  their mission.</p>

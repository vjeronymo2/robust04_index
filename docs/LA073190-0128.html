			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ASYLUM: New federal guidelines for immigrants seeking political asylum (A1) are  expected to affect many of Orange County's estimated 75,000 Central Americans.  . . . Immigrant activist Evelyn Colon-Becktell says many of those people do not  qualify for amnesty and are living here illegally. . . . Despite recent changes  in Central America that have reduced the violence that drove many of them to  Southern California, "I really don't think there is a rush to go back,"  Colon-Becktell says.

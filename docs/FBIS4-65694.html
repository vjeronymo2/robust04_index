			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Agnelli on Government Program, </F> Confidence Vote"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Fiat chairman and  Senator-for-Life Gianni Agnelli today voiced a favorable opinion  of the government's economic program and expressed his hope that  the executive of Premier Silvio Berlusconi wins Wednesday's [18  May] confidence vote in the Senate.    Speaking to the press following a luncheon of life senators,  offered by Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, the Fiat chairman  explained how the government economic program aimed at  stimulating economic growth while, at the same time, limiting  risks. The positive aspects of the program, outlined by  Berlusconi to the Senate yesterday, included, Agnelli said: the  commitment to curb public spending; boosting the economy through  investments and greater flexibility on labor costs.    Turning his attention to tomorrow's confidence vote in the  Senate, Agnelli said "I hope the government makes it" in reply  to those who asked how he would vote.    Asked to comment on the positions of the other life  Senators,  the Fiat chairman said "I believe that each senator maintains  his own opinion. On the other hand, life senators are  individuals and each decides for himself".    The other life senators attending the luncheon were  ex-president Francesco Cossiga, former Senate Speaker Giovanni  Spadolini, Giulio Andreotti, Francesco De Martino and Paolo  Emilio Taviani.</p>

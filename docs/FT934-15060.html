			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (9): Virtue of patience / A look at the approach taken by the export sales manager of Railweight, a maker of high-tech weighing equipment - Company profile of Gabriel Villalon Born in Chile and a graduate of Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia, Gabriel Villalon has worked as a specialist in risk management in international markets and spent several years in the aluminium industry. He has also worked in Spain. He was headhunted by Chronos Richardson last year with a brief to improve its export performance. Home markets had declined and the company had become part of Staveley Industries - which also owns the well-known Salter scales brand name - in 1990. The company is in the high technology end of the weighing business. It sells a system developed by Coventry University - the former Lanchester Polytechnic - to weigh railway wagons while they are moving at speeds of up to 70 kph. This year it has started trading as Railweight to define its image better in its highly specialised marketplace. In the past rail wagons had to be weighed individually while at a standstill. This meant that trains had to be uncoupled which involved sometimes complicated shunting operations and a great deal of time and manpower. Over the past quarter century, the industry worldwide has moved to devices to save uncoupling, although most still require wagons to be at rest, thus requiring a time and energy-consuming series of stops and starts. Mr Villalon sells devices which measure the sheer stress produced by each wheel of a wagon as it passes over them. A series of transducers, linked to computers, are part of integrated system which calculates the weight of each wagon to within acceptable ranges of accuracy for the value of the load carried. The main customers are railway operators and any industry shifting bulk materials - coal, cement, steel, petro-chemicals, port operations, ores, minerals - by train. This means export markets have become increasingly important as the British coal industry - a principal customer and mainstay of Railweight's domestic markets - has declined. This pressure has also encouraged lateral thinking about other applications: the systems involved can be used equally successfully to exactly weigh - and quickly - the precursors and raw materials that go into chemicals manufacture or blending operations. Moreover, by putting a transponder in every railway wagon to identify it electronically, every location and use of each wagon can be monitored and managed more effectively, enabling assets to be driven harder. Maintenance is also more easily controlled - the system can detect when the amplitude of a signal from a railway wheel changes as it wears, so it can be replaced before it causes the train to stop. This is an improvement on former systems, when railway workers with a good ear went round sidings and marshalling yards tapping wheels to find faulty ones through the note they sounded. Railweight now turns over Pounds 2m, 60 per cent of which is exported. Margins are comfortable because the business operates with only 20 people in Stockport, near Manchester Airport, outsourcing most of the materials and components from which each individual weighing system is assembled. 'No sale is straightforward,' Mr Villalon says, 'We don't just turn up with a box of tricks. We offer to solve problems, reduce costs and improve efficiency.' Mr Villalon says his market is a global one, involving any company or nationalised industry which moves goods by rail. His general approach to exporting is to start by identifying exactly whom he should sell to. 'I work in close contact with embassies, consulates and the Department of Trade and Industry to get the information we need on potential customers, agents and so on. The next thing is to go and visit,' he says. Mr Villalon favours chamber of commerce missions for the initial reconnaissance. These are subsidised by the government and this helps keeps costs down. Obligations are not onerous: a few official functions and a compulsory debriefing so the DTI can account for its spending, but most of the time Mr Villalon is available for visits. Mr Villalon also finds it useful to use the British Embassy for presentations to groups, who can see videos and displays that would be difficult to travel with. 'When I know who I want to see, I then go back to see them individually in their place of work.' This usually means a follow-up trip to the country concerned. 'This is a business where results are hard to come by. I am going to Spain soon, hopefully to clinch a deal it has taken 11 months to do. I am pursuing another sale in Poland with a liquid petroleum gas company that we started work on in July last year. You have to be patient and keep at it,' Mr Villalon says. It also helps to speak to customers in their own language. Mr Villalon says many people do not pay enough attention to this. His origins in South America give him a decided advantage: he is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, English, French and Italian and says he can 'get by' in German. A former marriage to a Swede also gave him Swedish.</p>

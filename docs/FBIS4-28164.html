			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by ROK </F> correspondents in New York on 7 June]    [Text] "China's role, too, is important in applying  pressure on and persuading North Korea to accept the issue of  nuclear transparency. China's cooperation is essential also in  achieving a concerted action at the UN Security Council and in  persuading North Korea."    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu gave New York-based ROK  correspondents the background of his sudden visit to China by  saying this before boarding an airplane bound for Beijing on 7  June. After accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a visit to  Russia, he flew to New York to have individual meetings with the  ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security  Council.    [Reporter] What is China's present position?    [Han] China does not readily agree to the allegation  stressing the need to have the UN Security Council take strong  countermeasures. But, it also is in a position not to offer  active opposition, either. This is because China, too, cannot  deny the fact that efforts to have dialogue with North Korea  have reached a limit. If other permanent members of the UN  Security Council come to a conclusion that sanctions against  North Korea are inevitable, China will not presumably be able to  offer opposition.    [Reporter] It is learned that China and Russia are objecting  to adopting a resolution for the imposition of sanctions.    [Han] You can understand this by noting that a process of  working out a resolution--not a debate of pros and cons--is now  underway.    [Reporter] Russia is calling for holding eight-way talks  before sanctions are imposed.    [Han] Well, Russia is not advocating such talks as a  precondition to the UN Security Council's imposition of  sanctions. It is certain that Russia is positive about the  working out of measures for the imposition of sanctions.    [Reporter] If a resolution is adopted at the UN Security  Council, when do you expect it will be?    [Han] It seems that it is difficult to see one adopted  within  this week.    [Reporter] In case the UN Security Council adopts a  resolution, there seem to be two options, such as the adoption  of a resolution of warning or the immediate imposition of  sanctions. What is the official stance to this?    [Han] As one resolution has already been adopted and two  Security Council presidential statements have been issued up  until now, I think that now is not the opportune time to go out  of the way to go through the process of adopting a resolution of  warning.    [Reporter] North Korea is threatening that the present  regime  in South Korea will face an end if economic sanctions are  imposed.    [Han] It is true that there is a risk in the imposition of  sanctions. But, we cannot afford not to do what we should do  because of North Korea's threatening remarks.</p>

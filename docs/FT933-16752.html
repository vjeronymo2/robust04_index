			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Patten gets tough on democracy MR Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, warned China yesterday that he would go ahead with his scheme for greater democracy in the colony if the two sides did not make progress in their negotiations within the next few weeks. Speaking after securing the full endorsement of Mr John Major and the British government, Mr Patten refused to set a timetable. 'I am reluctant to circle dates in the calendar,' he said, but later added: 'We cannot go on forever. We would like to make more progress in the next few weeks in order to get a satisfactory outcome.' Mr Patten's proposals for a fairer, more open way of electing members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, have been bitterly attacked by China which said they violated the agreement signed with Britain for the return of the colony in four years time. However Chinese hostility has subsequently softened slightly. Some of the economic development plans that it was blocking in retaliation have been allowed to proceed, and the resumption of talks in Beijing offered some prospect of progress on the elections issue. During the sixth round last week China for the first time laid out its specific objections to the election proposals which had been first unveiled last October. Mr Patten said yesterday that he would go ahead and present the legislation for his proposals if no progress was made in the seventh round of talks that begin next week. 'The bill will be introduced in the Legislative Council after we have concluded a satisfactory agreement with China, or if we do not get a satisfactory agreement with China we will have to go ahead and legislate on our own,' Mr Patten added. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, confirmed that Mr Major and his cabinet colleagues fully supported the governor. 'We have decided that the approach we have been taking, strategically and tactically, in these talks is the right one,' said Mr Patten who returns to Hong Kong today.</p>

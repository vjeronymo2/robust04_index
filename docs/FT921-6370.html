			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Be flexible, know your allowances - Joint investments BERNARD SHAW once described the popularity of marriage in terms of maximum opportunities. He did not have joint investments in mind, but having a spouse does give you greater flexibility in organising your financial affairs to the benefit of your wealth. This flexibility was aided by the introduction of independent taxation for married couples last year. Both husband and wife now keep separate tax-free allowances, at present Pounds 3,295 each, and receive a married couple's allowance of Pounds 1,720 as well. If you were 64 before the beginning of the tax year, you qualify for a higher personal allowance of up to Pounds 4,020 for the 1991-2 tax year, depending on your total income. The married couple's allowance also increases if either partner was 64 before the start of the tax year. The trick is to use these allowances to the maximum, and to minimise the payment of higher rate tax by availing yourselves of both basic rate tax bands. If your investments or savings are in joint names, the rule is that you will be taxed equally on any income, because it will be assumed that the income is split evenly between you. However, you can elect to hold the assets in unequal proportions, and the income will be taxed accordingly. You will have to let the Inland Revenue know about this by making a joint written declaration (Form 17 from tax offices) laying out the proportions in which the investments and the subsequent income have been divided. However, in many cases, it will be more tax-efficient to keep your investments in separate names rather than holding them jointly. Deposits. If one partner is not working, their personal allowance is being wasted. Savings should be transferred to the non-working partner, who will receive interest, for example on a building society account, at gross rates. The same is true for shares or unit trusts, where interest on dividends can be reclaimed. If one of the two is a higher-rate taxpayer and the other a basic-rate taxpayer, deposits should be made in the name of the lower tax payer so that interest is taxed at the basic rate. There is one clear advantage to holding a joint bank account, highlighted by the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Under the UK's deposit protection scheme, sterling depositors can claim 75 per cent of their money up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. This applies to individuals not the number of accounts. In the case of a joint account, each individual would be eligible for compensation. Mortgages. When one partner is a taxpayer and the other is not, it is possible to apportion interest between the couple, so that the former assumes the interest payments and gets the maximum tax relief. If you really want an endowment mortgage, Fiona Price, managing director of Fiona Price and partners, the independent financial advisers, suggests taking out two single endowment policies for half the loan each, topped up with term assurance to cover 100 per cent of the liability in each case. This will protect each individual from the trauma of what to do with the joint policy if they separate. National Savings certificates. Individuals are limited to Pounds 10,000 worth of certificates, but a husband can hold a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for his wife and vice versa, making a total of Pounds 40,000 worth of certificates between the two. The same is true for the Yearly Plan. (You should take legal advice on this - see also letter N). Insurance. Life policies are often taken out in the name of the husband, but if you have children it might be better to take out two separate term-assurance policies - even though this will mean paying out more - in order to give greater protection for the family should a death or permanent disability occur. Single-premium or guaranteed income bonds. Income-paying bonds should be assigned to the non- or low-earning spouse for maximum tax relief. There is, however, one clear advantage to holding insurance bonds in joint names, according to James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, the fee-based advisers. If a bond is owned by husband or wife but is in the name of the other spouse as well, the bond does not need to be encashed should the holder die. Any income can be drawn tax-free by the surviving spouse, in the tax year following the death, because the Inland Revenue will seek to tax the owner of the bond and not the person receiving the money. Pensions. This is something that women tend to ignore; but if the marriage ends in divorce, the wife loses all entitlement to her husband's pension if he is in a private or company pension scheme. Many women forget, too, that time taken out of work to have children will result in a lower pension being paid. Capital gains and inheritance tax. Each spouse has an annual capital gains tax exemption of Pounds 5,500, which should be used to the full. This can be done by holding assets in joint names. For example, if you sell a second property held in joint names, the full Pounds 11,000 of CGT allowance becomes available. Once you die, inheritance tax comes into play (see W for Wills). There is no IHT to pay on money left to one's spouse. Most married couples own the family home under a joint-tenancy arrangement, so that the death of one spouse means that the other inherits the property automatically. The surviving spouse does not then have to pay IHT. But once both spouses have died, their children will have to pay it, and the first parent's nil rate band of Pounds 140,000 will not have been used. So it is more tax-efficient to leave Pounds 140,000 to the children and the balance to the spouse by the tenants-in-common arrangement under which a husband and wife own a half share of the home absolutely. When one partner dies, half the property is inherited by the children, who can use the deceased parent's nil rate band. But only do this if you trust your children not to force the surviving parent to sell.</p>

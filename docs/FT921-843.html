			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / US presence at Earth summit vital - Collor: Brazil eager for Bush to attend environment talks BRAZILIAN president Fernando Collor warned yesterday that the presence of US president George Bush at the World Environment Conference would be the 'decisive' factor for its success. Mr Collor told foreign journalists he had called Mr Bush on Wednesday to lobby for his presence at the conference in Rio de Janeiro in June. 'I asked him to strongly consider attending,' said Mr Collor. 'His presence is decisive because it would send a strong signal to the world of the importance of a global approach to environmental problems.' Mr Collor added that he had urged Mr Bush to help end the current impasse over CO2 emissions. 'A decision by the US government to reduce emissions would have extraordinary dimensions,' he said. Mr Collor said he had dismissed his environment minister, Mr Jose Lutzenberger, last weekend to ensure that Brazil's own position was coherent. 'Unfortunately differences had developed between Lutzenberger's declaration and the position elaborated by the government. If we'd had more time we could have talked it out but I didn't think we could arrive at the Earth Summit with different positions.' Mr Collor said he was confident his economic reform programme was taking hold. 'Today you can talk to anyone in Brazil and they will be more optimistic, believing that we're on the right road. It is a very different mood to that last October, when everyone was warning of hyper-inflation and imminent collapse.' He added that the image abroad of Latin America's largest economy was also improving. 'This is reflected in the level of private investment, which last year reached almost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7bn) and by our foreign exchange reserves, which now stand at Dollars 13bn-Dollars 14bn  - levels not reached for 20 years.' He dismissed doubts that Brazil would fail to meet fiscal targets set down in its accord with the International Monetary Fund in January. 'We are only assuming promises that we can meet. . . that is the big change in our international negotiations,' he said. But he admitted that the IMF had expressed concern over last month's sharp drop in tax revenues and 48 per cent real increase in domestic debt. 'You cannot analyse Brazil's behaviour based on just one bad month,' he said, adding that from April the government would have increased tax resources after a reform recently passed by Congress. Mr Collor was pleased with the progress of negotiations under way with creditor banks over Brazil's Dollars 52bn commercial debt, though he refused to predict a settlement date. 'Obviously it would be great if we could close an accord today or before the Inter-American Development Bank meeting on April 6, but what I'm most pre-occupied with is that the agreement meets the interests of all those concerned.'</p>

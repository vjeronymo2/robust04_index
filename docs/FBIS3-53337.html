			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Syria First Beneficiary"] </F>   [Text] The importance of the statement issued at the end of  the meetings of the foreign ministers of the eight signatory  states of the Damascus Declaration is that it represents a  preliminary step to define a comprehensive Arab policy vis-a-vis  what is happening in the region. This step comes in the absence  of the Arab League and in the shadow of the mutual aversions the  Middle East is witnessing at more than one level.    Maybe the most important point in the statement -- apart  from  the support it provides for President Hafiz al-Asad a few days  before the awaited meeting between him and President Clinton --  is that it avoids thorny issues which can be discussed at a  later stage, like the Arab boycott of Israel. In this  connection it seems striking that the eight states sought to  come out with a position that is far removed from rhetorical  oneupmanship and as close as possible to realism. In return for  the statement's support for Syria, Damascus had to continue its  "neutral" position on the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.  Although describing the agreement as "a first step which should  be complemented by steps on the other tracks" is a statement  which needs to be explained and could have more than one  meaning, Syria's agreement to it again means that a minimum of  understanding has been reached between it and Egypt, which is  sparing no efforts to make the Palestinian-Israeli agreement a  success.    It is clear that Syria was the first beneficiary of the  meetings of the foreign ministers of the eight states in  Damascus. What seems to be useful in this connection is that  the statement issued by the eight ministers, which supports the  United Arab Emirates' position toward Iran in their dispute over  the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa],  has shown that the Damascus Declaration has not died and that  what has actually died is a certain understanding of the  declaration -- the understanding whereby it is made to shoulder  more than it can bear. Once the signatories are convinced of  this, it will be easy to hold meetings, adopt positions, and  seek an understanding on the broad outlines of Arab policies.    The statement can in itself represent a serious attempt to  determine what can and what cannot be done. With the passage of  time it has become clear that words have become meaningful even  in the Arab world. And that it is no longer acceptable to talk  about the region in the manner that existed in the past. And  that every single word means something now, especially when it  comes to Gulf security and the role of every party in  safeguarding it. This is because all the developments that have  taken place since the second Gulf war, which was the result of  the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, fall within one framework,  namely redefining the roles in the region, taking into account  the role played by the international coalition in defeating  Iraq, in addition to the role of the states surrounding Iraq and  the Arab world. If this process of redefining the roles had not  taken place, the Madrid conference would not have been convened  or led to what it has led to.</p>

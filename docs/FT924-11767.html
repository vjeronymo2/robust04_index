			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cominco back in the black COMINCO, the Canadian base metals and fertiliser producer, returned to the black in the third quarter, thanks to higher zinc and copper prices and improved costs at its smelter at Trail, British Columbia. Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 10.1m (USDollars 8.1m), or 12 cents a share, before extraordinary items, compared with a loss of CDollars 23.2m, or 30 cents, a year earlier. The figures exclude an after-tax investment gain of CDollars 41.7m, mainly from the sale of a stake in Aberfoyle, the Australian group.</p>

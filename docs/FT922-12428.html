			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Picking people to pick your shares / A look at the choice of advisers and brokers that faces anyone planning to build a portfolio BUYING shares seems to be the thing to do in the fourth Conservative term. From election night onwards, when brokers allowed trading through the night  -so that you could sell water shares with every 'Lab Gain' - equities have enjoyed a bonanza. Those who want to get involved might ask the following questions. Where can you go for advice? Plenty of people offer advice. Ultimately, your best chance of receiving impartial guidance comes if you pay a fee for it, as your adviser then has no financial interest in whether you go through with the investment. Pay by commission, and they will have an incentive to force you into a deal. If you have a substantial portfolio, you should be able to find a manager who will look after it, in return for a percentage fee based on the amount you invest. Broadly speaking, stockbrokers divide into three. Some provide a 'discretionary' service, in which you allow the brokers to decide what to buy and sell; others give an advisory service, where you will normally pay them commission for each deal; and the cheapest are 'execution only' dealers, where brokers give no guidance whatever. What is the bid-offer spread? The marketmakers who buy and sell shares do not normally receive either a fee or a commission for the service. They make their profit from the 'spread' between the price at which they buy, and the price at which they sell. When you buy a share, you will pay the 'offer' price. This is higher than the price at which you could sell them to the marketmaker, which is known as the 'bid' price. Share prices are usually quoted at the middle-point between offer and bid, so remember that you will pay more, or receive slightly less, than this price. How much will it cost? Brokers, like marketmakers, cost money. Those who offer broader discretionary services will charge you more. However they claim that you get what you pay for. If you want a truly deluxe service, such as that from James Capel, which provides copious and highly respected research, and detailed advice on capital gains tax, then as a discretionary client you will pay an annual fee of 0.6 per cent of the value of the portfolio up to the first Pounds 500,000. It reduces thereafter. On individual deals you will pay 1.1 per cent up to the first Pounds 10,000. Capel's advisory clients pay a Pounds 250 annual fee, plus 1.85 per cent dealing commission on the first Pounds 10,000 of each deal. It decreases for higher amounts. What about discount brokers? This is the option for those who trust themselves to make the right decisions. Execution only services will invariably be cheaper, although they may not necessarily offer better value for money. The Fidelity Share Service charges a minimum Pounds 25 for deals up to Pounds 1,400. Up to Pounds 3,900, you pay Pounds 11 plus 1 per cent of the value of the deal. Above this, up to Pounds 50,000, you pay a flat Pounds 50. What about the banks? Privatisations have inspired the banks to offer a competitive service. Some, like Barclays and Abbey National, are keen on further expansion. Others, including Midland, Lloyds and TSB, are happy with their current service. These services tend to be used most for selling privatisation stocks, but they are definitely cheap. For example, postal sales at Abbey National cost Pounds 17.50 on deals up to Pounds 2,333, and decline for higher amounts. A telephone transaction costs a minimum of Pounds 24.50. Can Personal Equity Plans help? Yes, particularly for beginners. They allow you to hold up to Pounds 6,000 in a mixture of shares, plus an additional Pounds 3,000 in one single company. Tax is the advantage - a Pep is a tax-free pocket, where your shares can gain in value and pay out dividends without incurring any income or capital gains tax. However, if shares held in a Pep drop in price, this loss cannot be offset against gains elsewhere in your portfolio. Peps' big drawback is the cost of administration. 'Self-select' Peps, where you deal as you want and have total discretion, are more attractive if you are prepared to make your own decisions. How many shares are needed for a portfolio? Some would claim you might as well ask how long is a piece of string. Unless you have money you can afford to lose, it must make sense to diversify, and buy a number of different stocks. There is a slight opportunity cost here - it will tend to adulterate the gains of a stock market favourite - but you can now withstand disastrous collapses by one share. Adequate diversification, at a level which justifies the charges involved in buying the shares can be achieved with a portfolio of less than Pounds 25,000, according to Brian Tora of stockbrokers Greig Middleton. Assuming minimum dealing charges of Pounds 25 (good value), the effective minimum economic holding is Pounds 500. You reduce risk with every additional company you buy, but this falls off quite quickly. According to Tora, an adequate spread of risk can be achieved with eight companies. That makes a minimum feasible portfolio of Pounds 4,000. If you cannot spare this much, direct investment in equities is not for you. What about investment trusts? Investment trusts solve the problem of finding a balanced portfolio, which is helpful if you are nervous about picking stocks. An investment trust company is incorporated and quoted just like any other public company, but its sole business is to invest in other companies. This provides the broad spread. Theoretically, the trust's fund managers will out-perform the market for you. You can buy investment trusts in the same way you buy any other share, using a broker. Some trusts also have a 'savings scheme' option, so you can dispense with the broker. What about unit trusts? Unit trusts, like investment trusts, invest in shares, lowering risk by diversifying. But they also remove the risk that market sentiment will cause the price of the shares to fall, even if the underlying portfolio of shares rises. Unit trusts are not quoted shares - they are just mutually held funds of shares. The value of your investment fluctuates automatically in accord with the value of the shares, but you will normally have to pay a front-end charge for administration of 5 per cent or more. One group (Murray Johnstone) has cut this to 1 per cent, but this is against the industry norm. What if things go wrong? There are several avenues for complaint. The Securities and Futures Authority has a Complaints Bureau. Ultimate compensation should come from the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which aims to return the first Pounds 30,000 of your investment, plus 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. Obtaining this is often a tortuous process. This only guards you against malpractice by the broker. If a share crashes without trace, then tough. You bear this risk, and no intermediary can be held accountable for it.</p>

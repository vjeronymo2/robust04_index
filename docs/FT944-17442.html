			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Australia acts to deregulate utilities AUSTRALIA plans new rules on competition next year which will allow for deregulation of utilities and pave the way for the eventual creation of a national power grid, its treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis said in London yesterday. The changes, first proposed in the Hilmer report on national competition policy, involve the application of competition rules to previously exempted sectors, including businesses controlled by the governments of individual states. Mr Willis said the proposals, which would also introduce competition rules to the professions and statutory bodies for marketing commodities, were 'the most significant element' of the government's programme for structural reform. The new rules would give the federal government legal powers to restructure the power industry so that separate entities could be responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution as is now the case in Britain. This would remove state governments' effective monopoly on local electricity supply by forcing open the distribution network to all generators, a particular breakthrough given Australia's federal constitution which hinders national de-regulation of utilities. 'We think it appropriate that we have a national grid so that we can remove excess capacity and generate competitive presures on pricing,' Mr Willis said. The new rules might also pave the way for privatisation of state electric utilities, but 'the principal thing is to have competition,' he said. Mr Willis said the federal government planned to finalise the necessary legislative package by February next year and set in train the necessary institutional arrangements by mid-1995. Eventually a similar approach could be applied to gas supply. National efforts were also under way to improve rail communications, Mr Willis said.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Smaller motor dealers squeezed Changes are under way in franchised car dealership networks in the UK with large groups expanding at the expense of individually owned dealerships. The main groups such as Lex Service and Inchcape now own more than a third of the 7,000-plus franchised dealerships compared with just a quarter in 1990, according to Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group. Some are also beating down manufacturer resistance to selling more than one make from a single site and leading the expansion of UK car retailing methods by buying dealerships in other EU countries. Sewells attributes the decline in individually owned dealerships mainly to the recession. At the same time, would-be individual dealers are discouraged by the cost of setting up - often more than Pounds 1m. Who Owns Who in the Retail Motor Industry: Franchised Networks 1994.

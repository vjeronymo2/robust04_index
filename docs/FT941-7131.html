			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / US dismisses Tokyo target to cut surplus Japan plans to set a target for cutting its record current account surplus, in what appears an inadequate attempt to defuse its trade row with the US. The cabinet yesterday agreed to produce a market-opening plan by the end of March, including a goal proposed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, to reduce the surplus to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product, or Dollars 125bn (Pounds 84bn), this year, from the estimated 3.1 per cent of GDP for the year to the end of March. The current account surplus was Dollars 131.35bn in the last calendar year. This goal - not a binding pledge - is already in the government's economic target for the coming year, published two weeks ago. It received an instant dismissal from Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan: 'That's their current estimate. That wouldn't be anything. What we need is to bring about a highly substantial reduction of the current account surplus over the next four years.' The scheme is likely to be on the agenda of a private meeting, in Frankfurt this morning, of Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japanese finance minister, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, before a session of the Group of Seven finance ministers. Japan will also be seeking co-operation from its G7 partners to avoid another steep rise in the yen's value. The plan to set a firm goal for a reduction in the surplus also ran into criticism from Mrs Manae Kubota, director-general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, which draws up the government's economic targets. It has managed to stick to few of its own current account targets since the agency started compiling them in 1955, she pointed out. Mr Hata agreed that the government could not make a firm pledge on the surplus because of the volatility of exchange and interest rates. But, as long as Japan ran a heavy trade surplus with the US (Dollars 59bn last year), 'we cannot have understanding from the international community,' the foreign minister said. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, had hoped to have a market-opening package ready in time for the G7 meeting today, but officials argued they needed more time if they were to prepare plans of real substance. The main headings include more deregulation (such as streamlined import procedures), more open governmental procurement, tougher anti-trust rules, and measures to promote imports and foreign investment. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration had no immediate response to Japan's latest efforts to formulate a trade peace plan. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, issued a statement of support for a tough new trade bill, introduced on Thursday by Congressman Dick Gephardt, Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives, and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. The bill would require the US Commerce Department unilaterally to set targets for foreign import penetration in Japan. Mr Kantor said Mr Gephardt and the senator had 'spent years thinking about the US-Japan relationship and working for a change in Japan. We welcome this expression of Congressional support for a policy that finally achieves real market opening in key sectors in Japan.'</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIC CARE SOUGHT FOR SUSPECT  </P> <P> A hearing for Cordell L. Robb, the Loara High School student accused of  shooting a boy in the face and holding a drama class hostage, was postponed  Monday to allow time for his attorney to get more information on psychiatric  care available in the California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> Gary L. Proctor, a private attorney appointed by the court to represent Robb,  said he is looking for reassurances that his client can receive adequate  psychiatric care.  </P> <P> "It's been our position all along that this boy needs psychiatric help,"  Proctor said. "Before we make any agreements with the district attorney, we  need to have an evaluation of the type of care available for Cory or else  there's no reason for sending him there."  </P> <P> Robb, 15, reportedly beset with family problems, is accused of attempted  murder, assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of false imprisonment and  bringing a firearm onto school grounds. If convicted, he could be imprisoned in  the California Youth Authority until he turns 25.  </P> <P> "There are very serious concerns that he's a schizophrenic," Proctor said.  "What's the point of agreeing to some prison time when they won't be able to  help him?"  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Nedza said the prosecution was ready for trial Monday.  But Nedza said he "understood the court's reasoning for the delay."  </P> <P> Juvenile Court Judge Robert B. Hutson set a pretrial hearing for March 8, and  tentatively scheduled Robb's trial for March 21.  </P> <P> He remains in Orange County Juvenile Hall.DAVID REYES  </P></p>

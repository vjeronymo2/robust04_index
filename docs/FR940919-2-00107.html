			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ability of decisionmakers to conduct thorough interviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and evidence evaluation, and timely and accurate claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudication is predicated on the implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functionality provided by the IWS/LAN hardware and software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components, and the decision support features of the Modernized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability System. Expert system software will be included in SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim processing systems to assist disability decisionmakers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analysis and evaluation of complex eligibility factors, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that the correct procedures for disability evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are followed. While conducting interviews, disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmakers will rely on decision support features that ask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment-specific questions. The decision support system will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the accumulated data of the electronic record to assist in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of the predecision notice, the statement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim, and decisions rendered on appeal. Where disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision team members cannot be physically co-located, they can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in communication by using two-way TV and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> videoconferencing technologies. Disability policy will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed and stored in a format that can be integrated into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer systems as the source of context-sensitive help screens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and decision-support messages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quality assurance features fully supported by the Modernized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability System will be integrated throughout the new process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the national end-of-line quality review sample will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be electronically selected and automatically routed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate staff. In-line programmatic quality assurance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced by the use of decision support systems, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programmed into the computer applications and will help to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify errors of both oversight and substance, and also support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-line technical review will occur each time information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the electronic record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quality assurance and productivity measures will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in a new, total-process management information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Meaningful, timely management information for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability process is dependent on a seamless data processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system used by all components which affords a common case control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and a common data base. SSA's claim processing systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated on an Agency-wide IWS/LAN platform will provide this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seamless environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost and Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA's strategy of coming to closure on an ideal, high-level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability process design before undertaking detailed operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and implementation planning has been consistent from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the reengineering project. Although this project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management approach served SSA well, it has made the very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary task of cost/benefit projections unusually challenging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following cost/benefit forecasts will need to evolve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation details are developed. The administrative cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers presented here cannot be applied to SSA's administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budget without further analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will move forward on all aspects of the process redesign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan; however, because of the extensive research and development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for implementation of the simplified disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination methodology, we have not considered the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this redesign feature in our cost/benefit planning. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the ability of a single employee to master the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim manager position is dependent on full adoption of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplified disability determination methodology, the impact from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that process redesign feature has also been separated out from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our cost/benefit planning at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Service Improvements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Service to the public, as defined by average processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, would improve dramatically_from around 150 days to pay an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial disability claim today to 60 days after implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new process. Hearing processing time would also improve from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 550 days to 225 days. These figures were derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> running a computer simulation model of the new process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Program Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the supposition that SSA's current initial claim and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeal process leads to correct disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations within the proper universe of people today, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because SSA is not proposing any changes in the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of disability, the redesigned process in and of itself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have no long-term effect on program outlays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Costs and Savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project life period for implementing disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reengineering is from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the full benefits from the redesigned process will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be realized until September 30, 2001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cumulative administrative costs during the life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project are estimated at $148 million. The largest percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these costs will be directed to special workforce training on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new process_a critical enabler if the redesign plan is to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The redesign will not require additional investments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information technology spending over current SSA plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cumulative administrative savings through FY 2001 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated at $852 million. The bulk of these savings will come  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from more efficient use of Federal and State workyears to process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the anticipated disability initial claim and appeal workloads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the project life period. This savings estimate does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor in Agency resource needs for working existing backlogged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtracting cumulative administrative costs of $148 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from cumulative savings of $852 million will result in a pay back  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the government of $704 million through FY 2001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ongoing administrative cost savings will be over $305  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million annually, beginning in FY 2001. This figure includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spending increases for enhanced employee education, better office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security, and expanded claimant services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative cost savings associated with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project_$704 million during the implementation period, and $305  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million annually, thereafter_will allow the Agency to reallocate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing resources to give more attention to other important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workloads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA's workforce profile, with respect to disability process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workloads, would include at least the same number of professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions currently employed at the federal and state level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the overall design, if fully implemented with all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process enablers_especially enhanced automation_would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer clerical and support positions to handle projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workloads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA is committed to implementing a new disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination process that will deliver significantly improved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service to the public, remain neutral with respect to program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar outlays, and will be more efficient to administer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative cost savings from the process will allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency to reallocate resources to give increased attention to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other important workloads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the redesigned process cannot be implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the full funding, development, and installation of a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case processing computer system. In addition, unless SSA invests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially more funds for research and development of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplified disability determination methodology, the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of the redesigned process_including better public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service and the potential for even greater long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative efficiencies_will not be possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation Strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

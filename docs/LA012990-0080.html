			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: USGA, MANUFACTURER SETTLE CLUBS' DISPUTE  </P> <P> The United States Golf Assn. has agreed in an out-of-court settlement to  recognize the Ping Eye-2 square-grooved clubs, and the manufacturer has agreed  to stop making them.  </P> <P> Karsten Manufacturing Corp. had sued the USGA for $100 million after the USGA  refused to recognize the clubs, which have U-shaped grooves on the clubfaces as  opposed to traditional V-shaped grooves.  </P> <P> The settlement affects USGA events such as the U.S. Open but not the PGA Tour.  The company, which has sold about two million sets of the clubs, obtained a  federal court injunction allowing the clubs to be used in PGA Tour events. The  PGA Tour has appealed to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> A similar suit against the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in  Scotland, which sets worldwide rules for golf, was dropped by Karsten earlier  this month.  </P> <P> Karsten Solheim, president and founder of the company, said the USGA agreed to  pay his company $5 million as part of the settlement. But John Solheim, vice  president and general manager of the company and the son of the president, said  "no money changed hands."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bronislaw Geremek, parliamentary caucus </F> leader of the Democratic Union, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the  Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program  -- live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is  Professor Bronislaw Geremek, a leader of the Democratic Union  [UD]. Good morning to you.    [Geremek] Good morning.    [Woyciechowski] Why does NATO not want us?    [Geremek] First of all, we would have to ask why we want to  be in NATO.    [Woyciechowski] So why do we want to be in NATO?    [Geremek] I think the answer is not very obvious at all. In  essence, NATO is currently experiencing a crisis -- it is a  creature of the Cold War and it was supposed to be a  countermeasure against the Soviet Union's imperialism, it was  supposed to be Europe's and the West's defense. Now the Soviet  Union is no longer here and the Cold War is over, and what will  happen to NATO now? Well, it is simply the only European  security organization which functions in practice and which has  means at its disposal which enable it to respond to any kind of  danger in Europe. I think NATO is currently going through a  transformation. NATO must stop being a defensive,  military-political organization and it must become an  organization serving European stability; it is not yet ready to  perform that role. After all, NATO is not prepared to try to  overcome ethnic and border conflicts which are everyday  occurrences in Europe currently. So it follows that NATO will  transform itself. Poland needs to join a security organization  so as to have a feeling of peace, and not because there should  be a vacuum or because we should be orphans of the Warsaw Pact.  I think Polish society has had historical experiences and  historical perspective, and it remembers how alone Poland used  to be. But society also has a feeling of a lack of social and  economic security, at least in this one area -- in the area of  politics, society would like to have a feeling of peace and some  minimum guarantees. That is precisely what NATO membership  would mean to Poland.    [Woyciechowski] Was NATO not established to send their  troops, tanks and aircraft in case -- knock on wood that it  never happens -- somebody attacks Poland? Is that not what NATO  is for?    [Geremek] There are two articles in the treaty -- I mean the  Washington Treaty which established NATO -- there is Article 5  which is the one we are after. It provides that in the advent  one of the member states is attacked, all the other members make  a decision -- rather automatically -- to defend the member which  was attacked. There is also Article 4 which speaks about the  NATO Council holding a meeting in specific cases to decide  whether or not to intervene for the defense of a country which  does not necessarily have to be a member.    [Woyciechowski] So NATO can intervene in such cases, but it  does not have to?    [Geremek] Exactly. It has to under Article 5 though.    [Woyciechowski] But it can intervene also in cases of  nonmembers being attacked?    [Geremek] Yes. The whole argument now is indeed about  Article 5, since such a provision gives the citizens of a  country a sense of security and at the same time it is a  deterrent factor. But if one considers what the current  political situation is about, I think the issue of our  membership in NATO -- I am expressing my personal view here, but  in my opinion I have reasons to think that -- is not so  dramatically important at all. That is because it is  inconceivable to imagine Poland being attacked by a country....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about Yugoslavia?  Could Croats or Bosnians have pictured somebody attacking them?    [Geremek, hesitating] I think what you are saying represents  the type of thinking used by Americans, but it is false. Poland  is in the center of Europe and Europe's fate is inextricably  linked with Poland's fate. If an aggression occurred against  Poland -- who could make such an aggression? Let us say it is  one of the neighbors....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Such an aggression would come  either from the left or the right.    [Geremek] Historically speaking, they used to come from  the left or the right -- that is the way it happened to us  throughout history. So in case an aggression like this occurs,  all of Europe would immediately be involved. The French did not  want to die for Gdansk in 1939 and then they died for their own  cities -- they lost the war. The necessary political  imagination, so to speak, should make us realize that Poland is  not in the Balkans and that one cannot make Poland marginal.  There cannot be a situation where if there is a conflict  occurring right here in Europe's center, NATO would regard it as  a marginal conflict because NATO's border is on the Oder and  Neisse rivers. That would be impossible. Moreover, if one were  to assume that there could be politicians who would think that,  then they would be acting to their own detriment. And it is not  just a theoretical supposition that such politicians could exist  -- they do in fact exist. I have read an interview with a  politician from the Western European Union who replied to  precisely this kind of question by saying: Well, we will not  intervene, but there is no such danger to begin with. Now....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, to recap all this  -- in your view, NATO's fear of accepting Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Hungary is more linked to the destabilization in  the Balkans, to those little, local wars, and to the fact that  looking from Washington, one confuses Poland with Yugoslavia --  and it is less linked to Poland's internal situation and also to  the Zhirinovskiy factor?    [Geremek] The first part is precisely that -- namely that  one looks through the perspective of a completely separate  conflict and thinks that one can make the issue marginal. A  second part that you mentioned is the issue of the priority  occupied by Russian issues. The West has very often in the past  been bewitched by Russia and it gave Russia absolute priority.  By the way, it is my view that we, Poles, should keep in mind  that Russia continues to be a huge country and a superpower. It  is afflicted with a disease but the disease is only temporary.  But the thing is that American politics are now being guided by  people who observe the Russian situation, and for whom the most  important thing is to have some kind of agreement with the  disordered East Europe. I think that even being familiar with  the political geography of this part of Europe requires a  certain effort, and it is a very easy thing to say to oneself:  Here is a partner and now the thing is that the partner should  -- as the Clinton administration has the habit of saying now --  be a partner in cooperation. I would say in that regard we can  find traces of an old slogan which said that there must be  order, and that the world will be peaceful if there is order in  Warsaw. Well, that type of thinking is false and one will have  to pay a price for that in the future precisely because Russia's  main problem right now is the emergence of Zhirinovskiy. It is  not a personnel problem or one associated with the person, but  the problem is that imperial policy in which there are  territorial claims and a desire to destabilize Europe and the  world -- the problem is that this kind of policy gained the  support of one quarter of this huge country's electorate.    [Woyciechowski] Who is Zhirinovskiy? How should he be  described? Is he a fascist? Is it fascism or is it something  else?    [Geremek] It is dangerous. It is a danger and really -- the  plague, cholera, or typhoid fever seem minor by comparison,  since it is a deadly [word indistinct].    [Woyciechowski] And how did it come about in Russia? How  does someone like Zhirinovskiy emerge there?    [Geremek] I think that one should consider two phenomena  here: The first one is that transformations and leaving  communism behind are painful processes -- and we know something  about that, too -- so there is impatience in society,  frustration, and unhappiness with the reforms. There is also  another factor -- that is something which concerns the Russians'  national pride. Russian dignity has been trampled on during  these years, and that happened not only because their leaders  banged their shoes against the seats at the United Nations --  Russians were ashamed of that. But what is worse is that all of  a sudden Russia has no influence over anything, it is regarded  as an object with which anybody is free to play. The world's  fate is not dependent on Russia even by a bit, but there is  still an army there, there is a political class, and there is  also a kind of popular feeling: We used to be a great country,  and now what? Now, Zhirinovskiy was capable of telling  everybody what they wanted to hear: He told laborers that they  will earn more and that the workplaces will not be closed, he  told peasants that some way or another will be found -- either  food production will be subsidized, or assistance will be given,  if not to kolkhozs, then to private farms, and that his men know  how to handle all this. And he told all Russians, including the  military, KGB members, and everybody else, that Russia must be  great, that it has a right to greatness, that it can have an  imperial policy since it is in fact an empire and has such  traditions dating back to before Stalin and the communist  revolution. Now, he had the ability to use these sentiments for  his own goals. One can say, if that is the case, to understand  that the phenomenon means to immediately diminish its  significance, as it were. I am very strongly opposed to many  observers of the Russian scene -- including some of my friends  -- who in my view tend to minimize the problem of Zhirinovskiy  and they are very unwise in doing that. It is the problem of  the future of democracy in Russia. If Russia is supposed to be  a partner -- which it can be -- in world politics and as a  democratic country, and one whose economy is improving -- the  phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy has a fundamental significance for  both these issues.    [Woyciechowski] What is the difference between  Zhirinovskiy and [Party X leader and former presidential  candidate Stanyslaw] Tyminski? Why is the first one dangerous  but the other one not?    [Geremek] Zhirinovskiy scored a success whereas Mr. Tyminski  did not. I think an important difference is that Zhirinovskiy  has within his clientele not only the capital of social  frustrations but also huge structures. There is the problem of  the Army. Others say there is also the problem of the KGB. But  even if you consider the problem of the Army alone -- I think it  has between 2 and 2.5 million people, or more than that, in  recent years all of a sudden it became a political factor and  the Army is full of bitterness: A soldier who is told to storm  the parliament building -- no matter what cause he is supposed  to be advancing -- still has a lot of unanswered questions and  besides, the soldier is being involved in politics. Well, now a  type of politician has emerged whom soldiers and generals can  trust, and they invest some of their hopes in him, so to speak,  in the sense of saying to themselves that it is worthwhile to  serve the country, make some changes and.... [pauses]  Zhirinovskiy can say -- and the demographics of his electorate  is proof of that -- that he gained the support of the Army.  That is extremely important and that is the reason -- among  others -- for which we cannot diminish Zhirinovskiy and his  measures.    [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the beginning  of our conversation and the issue of NATO. Now, several minutes  into the conversation, I will try to recap what I understood you  to say: Joining NATO is not the most important thing for Poland  since NATO is no longer what it used to be. It is NATO that  must change, and then the time will come to deliberate what  position Poland should take in this new European security  system. Did I understand you correctly?    [Geremek] Well, I have been trying to go against the  wind....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, is it very  important or not very important, I mean this [words indistinct].  Is it really the most important thing?    [Geremek] It is really important but not the most important  thing. I am going against the wind of the situation which was  recently created among the public. I think it is a shame that  it happened that the issue of joining NATO was used in political  campaigns -- it should not have been. It is a classic issue  which diplomacy should have prepared and, once the possibility  of joining NATO came up, then it could have become political  fact. There are no possibilities right now of immediately  joining NATO. If we were to join NATO right now, the state  budget would not be able to carry the burden which modernizing  the Army requires, as well as adaptation to NATO's standards.  But there is a dangerous thing -- and I openly admit that it  bothers me not only as a politician but also as a citizen --  that there could occur a refusal on NATO's part to allow Poland,  the Czech or Slovak Republics, or Hungary to become NATO members.    [Woyciechowski] That simply affirms the fact that the iron  curtain -- even though in a symbolic way it no longer exists --  remains at the Oder and Neisse, whereas we would like it to  stand at least at the Bug river.    [Geremek] I do not even think that there is a postulate made  on our part to move the iron curtain to the Bug river. What we  want is for the curtain to disappear altogether. Right now....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But in actual terms, the  border is really Europe's border?    [Geremek] Yes, but it should be an open border. I think --  and I often stress this and I have been saying this for a long  time -- that it is very important that Russians have a feeling  of being free of any iron curtain which somebody could be  erecting so as to separate them. Why is that? Even if one  takes a skeptical view on chances in the face of Russian  democracy, it is still important that the chances not disappear.  Now, such a chance exists only when the West is open. The  division in 19th century Russia between Slavophils and  Zapadnikis [not further specified] existed because there was a  chance. If we were now to close the door on Russia's chances of  joining Europe and the West, we would weaken Russian democracy  through that. That is why I think there is no closed border, so  to speak. But there is a problem if NATO refuses to allow  Poland and other countries which are our neighbors -- the  question arises: For what reason? NATO countries are  democratic countries and so is Poland, no matter how the  political configuration may change. Should these countries be  based on market economy? Poland has built a market economy, and  Poland wants to be part of the peace process and of European  stabilization. Why [words indistinct]...?    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But I am sure you have asked  that question of Western politicians. How do they respond?    [Geremek] They do not respond at all because they have a  reasoning hidden here which we must not approve of and to which  they have no right, namely: Here is the big country of Russia  which should not be subjected to frustrations, and it is  important that its right to a sphere of influence, so to speak,  be recognized, and....    Is that kind of statement inelegant in politics? Should  one avoid such statements in politics? Is it unacceptable?    [Geremek, laughing] Elegance I think is not very important  in politics, but history is. When statements like this appeared  in the past, Poland was losing its independence. And in the  memory of....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And not just in 1939?    [Geremek] Correct. That is precisely our national history.  When we are told that two big countries will provide guarantees  to us so we should not be concerned, our answer to that is: We  have already seen that, and then there were the partitions of  Poland. See, so national memory is an element of shaping  politics. That is precisely why I think one should regard it  [the Zhirinovskiy issue] as a serious and important issue. I  think it is a very good thing that all of a sudden issues of  foreign policy have become the focus of attention of the people  -- that is an achievement.    [Woyciechowski] For the first time in the last four years,  most of the talk is not just about money or unemployment but  also about foreign policy.    [Geremek] Yes, this is the first time. And that is a very  important thing since there is a need for this kind of  sensitivity to the country's defense system, the country's  future, and to protecting Poland's sovereignty.    [Woyciechowski] But let us talk now for a while -- to end  this conversation -- about money and the budget. Will UD vote  in favor of the budget? I mean once the budget returns.    [Geremek] I will answer diplomatically since we are leaving  diplomatic issues now: We will see what the second version of  the budget will be like [words indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you hope the budget  will be altered in the Sejm commissions?    [Geremek] I am somewhat afraid it will be -- I think it will  deteriorate. Budgets are instruments of conducting policy and  we do not approve of the policy [by Pawlak's cabinet]. Voting  is always about showing some trust. How can we trust a team  which first of all did not keep commitments it made to its own  voters? They promised everything to everybody.    [Woyciechowski] [Words indistinct] promised and you did not  believe.    [Geremek] Yes, but now they are coming to me and it is I who  is supposed to show trust. They disappointed the voters so they  are bound to disappoint me as well. That is the first issue.  Another one is that the budget demonstrates enormous  centralization trends which are dangerous because one can say  that after the forty-something years there is a natural,  internal pressure, so to speak, within the entire functioning of  the state apparatus, I mean a pressure in the direction of  centralized distribution of money. And money is power. Unless  you counteract that trend with a wise and tough policy, the  trend will prevail. There is no such wise and tough  decentralization policy -- on the contrary, there is a spirit of  taking power, and I mean taking power by officials in Warsaw.  It is from Warsaw that voivodes [local government officials]  are appointed -- what the coalition wants to achieve is for  Warsaw officials to have the money and then to give it to the  appropriate people so they can be in power. Well, we cannot  accept such a concept.    [Woyciechowski] Whose concept is it -- [Prime Minister]  Pawlak's or [Democratic Left Alliance leader] Kwasniewski's?  Which one of them acts like that?    [Geremek] Well, if you allow me to, I would like to....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You would like to avoid  answering that?    [Geremek] No, I have a grievance against journalists that  this is the way they approach issues like this. What I mean is  that it is not a question of whether Pawlak is nicer than  Kwasniewski or vice versa, but what kind of policy each of them  conducts. It is precisely Chairman Kwasniewski -- to my  surprise, I was stunned -- who said [words indistinct]: Replace  voivodes, take power into your hands, we have to show we are in  power in all the areas where we won. Well, that is a philosophy  of power which is explained first and then implemented. On the  issue of the budget, its composition and its implementation also  -- there are no differences. So the first issue is where Pawlak  and Kwasniewski act together and in the same manner, and  secondly there is the issue of possible differences -- so far  these differences are of minor importance.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation.  Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Bronislaw Geremek.  Thank you very much.    [Geremek] Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Energy Technology: Debate Gathers </F> Steam on Future of Thermie Programme"; as released by Brussels  Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] What is to be done about the European Community's  Thermie [European Technologies for Energy Management] programme  for the promotion of state-of-the-art energy technologies still  awaits clarification, it emerged at a news conference marking  the opening in Brussels on October 11 of the first Thermie  Exhibition. EC Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes said that as the  Maastricht Treaty would encourage closer ties between R&amp;D and  the market, the Commission had proposed including the greater  part of the Thermie programme within the proposed fourth  Framework Programme on Research and Technical Development  [CERT]. It remains unclear, however, which of Thermie's more  industrially-oriented aspects will remain outside the Framework  Programme. As far as figures are concerned, 570 million Ecus has  provisionally been set aside for Thermie activities within the  Framework Programme. Funding for the rest remains uncertain.    Claude Desama, the Chairman of the European Parliament's  Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, expressed  misgivings about Thermie's inclusion in the Framework Programme.  On the one hand, the constraints of the Framework Programme's  overall budget would limit Thermie's scope of action. On the  other, there were Thermie projects which did not strictly fall  into the category of R&amp;D and should not be included in the  Framework Programme, he said. The European Parliament is also  recommending that any Thermie II programme should not fall into  the trap of trying to cover the whole of the energy spectrum,  thus spreading itself too thinly and at the same time stepping  on the toes of other R&amp;D programmes. When the CERT comes to  study the Commission's proposals for Thermie II it is expected  to recommend greater concentration on, and investment in, three  priority areas: promotion of clean coal and transport  technologies and the production of energy from waste.    As far as the Belgian Presidency of the EC Council of  Ministers is concerned, continuation of Thermie is guaranteed in  principle but questions still remain as to the wisdom of forcing  it into the Framework Programme mould. Melchior Wathelet, the  Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, stressed the importance of  Thermie's strong links with industry (as compared to the  complementary Joule programme on non-nuclear energy technology,  which is heavily R&amp;D-oriented). Mr Wathelet wondered whether  mixing it with too much R&amp;D would not dilute Thermie's direct  industrial link. The Council of Ministers should begin to study  the issue as of now, well ahead of Thermie's expiry in 1994, he  said. According to the Minister, the Council was convinced of  the need to strengthen all its CO2 reduction/energy saving  instruments (Thermie, Joule [Joint Opportunities for  Unconvention or Long-Term Energy Supply], SAVE [Special Action  Program for Vigorous Energy Efficiency], ALTENER [Alternative  Energy Development Program]) and impose a CO2/energy tax.    The CO2/energy tax option is not one dear to the heart of  the  Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederation of Europe  [UNICE]. UNICE President Carlos Ferrer seized the opportunity of  the Thermie exhibition opening to reiterate the lobby's  opposition to the CO2 tax proposals. Praising the Thermie  programme as one of the best examples of non-fiscal measures for  controlling CO2 emissions, Mr Ferrer then went on to attack the  fiscal option. A CO2/energy tax would push up fuel prices and  undermine the competitiveness of European industry (the  improvement of which is one of Thermie's main aims) and its  ability to invest in energy efficiency.</p>

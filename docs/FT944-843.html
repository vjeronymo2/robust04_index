			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Bibalo's 'Macbeth' - Opera in Bern You will find the Macbeths in every political establishment - the insecure husband, the scheming wife, both playing classic roles in the destructive drama of power. That is the premise behind Antonio Bibalo's operatic version of Macbeth, which has just received a successful German-language premiere in the Swiss capital, Bern. Bibalo chose his subject well. Outwardly successful and fascinating in their fateful loneliness, the Macbeths look credible in whatever clothes you give them, always coming out with their hands covered in someone else's blood. Like Verdi, Bibalo has based his libretto on the Shakespeare play, but he skilfully avoids comparison by creating a dramatic world of his own. Bibalo (b1922) grew up in Trieste, studied the 12-note technique with Elisabeth Lutyens in London and settled in Norway in 1956. His music, modern but undemanding, combines Mediterranean colour with Nordic stillness and melancholy. He has written three previous operas, based on texts by Henry Miller, Strindberg and Ibsen. Macbeth was first performed in English at Oslo in 1990. The plot unfolds in 16 scenes over just 90 minutes. Unlike Verdi Bibalo gives Duncan something to sing, includes Shakespeare's porter, but omits the scene in England. The rest is cut to the barest bones. Everything is concentrated on the Macbeths' psychological development. The soliloquies are brief, but the key lines register clearly. The music tries to conjure the inner world of thought and motivation - not so much in the solo vocal parts, which consist of lyrical declamation and unaccompanied Sprechgesang, as in the instrumental and choral writing. Wordless female voices, enveloping the stage in a web of mysterious sound, are Bibalo's most atmospheric device. The orchestra's contribution is limited to gestural flourishes, impressionist strokes and mini-crescendi. The overall result is concise but one-dimensional. I found myself longing for a sense of developing line, of musical argument and contrast. Bern's municipal theatre deserves credit not just for presenting a new work, but for importing a German production team of proven experience. Kurt Horres' staging, designed by Gottfried Pilz, matched the composer's vision. The bare box-set was white, the costumes predominantly black, making the blood-stained hands and cloaks all the more striking. The sleep-walking scene was particularly effective: Lady Macbeth was confined to a roped-off area centre-stage, observed by psychiatric staff. The three witches moved like invisible sirens of the mind. Macbeth is a character tenor, his wife a mezzo. With his shaven head and great-coat, Uwe Schonbeck made a very German-looking Macbeth, but gave the part a universal quality, thanks to his intelligent vocal acting and command of the visual language of guilt. Renee Morloc's Lady was young and bewitching. The Bern Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hans Drewanz, sounded comfortable in Bibalo's fastidious musical idiom.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Equatorial and Luksic in Chilean copper venture Chile, which already produces more than 25 per cent of the western world's copper, looks likely to get another big mining project. Equatorial Mining, an Australian company, and the Luksic group, one of Chile's biggest industrial organisations, are considering the joint development of their neighbouring copper deposits in the El Tesoro area, 150kms from Antofagasta. Combining Equatorial's Leonor deposit with Luksic's Sorpresa that virtually surrounds it, would make it possible to develop a mine to produce at least 80,000 tonnes of copper cathode annually for a minimum of 12 years, Mr Peter McAleer, Equatorial's chief executive, said yesterday. Talks were taking place with several major copper producers about the the possibility of bringing another group into the joint development. The deposits lie on the same geographical fault line as the world's two biggest copper mines, Chuquicamata and Escondida, and is midway between them. Nearly every mining company operating in Chile has staked some land in the area because the Leonor-Sorpresa copper is 'exotic' - washed there from what must be a huge, high-grade deposit elsewhere, but probably close by. The big drawback is that the exotic copper is very difficult to release from the ore. The Luksic group, founded by Mr Andronico Luksic, is heavily involved in Chile's copper business through its London-quoted Antofagasta Holdings, which produced about 77,000 tonnes of copper in that country last year. The Sorpresa project is held separately from Antofagasta. Luksic already has found 100m tonnes of very high-grade - 2 per cent - copper, enough for a big mine. Equatorial, having previously failed to convince the Luksic group to join forces, has been pressing on with its own plans for a mine to produce about 30,000 tonnes of copper a year for 10 years. AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial services group, owns 19.9 per cent of Equatorial, the maximum permitted level before a bid is triggered. Chile's copper output exceeded 2m tonnes for the first time last year and the total is expected to keep rising to more than 3m tonnes by 2000. Escondida, jointly owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ of the UK, and a Japanese consortium, is rapidly being expanded into the world's biggest copper mine and this year's new mines include Cerro Colorado, in which Rio Algom of Canada is the main shareholder, and La Candelaria, a joint venture between Phelps Dodge of the US and Sumitomo of Japan.</p>

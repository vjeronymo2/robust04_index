			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Fresh clashes erupt in Sarajevo: European Community struggles to get peace talks started in Lisbon FIGHTING last night broke out in nearly every quarter of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, between the republic's mainly Moslem defence forces and Serb irregulars. The clashes - the most serious in the city since last Thursday - were reported by Sarajevo television and came just hours after Serbian TV announced that Moslem forces in Bosnia had effectively declared war against the Serbian-dominated federal army. Bosnian officials claimed no such order had been given and accused the Serbs of a trick to make it look as if they wanted war. Fighting also erupted last night in the republic's southern city of Mostar. The reports on Serbia's Belgrade TV were based on a despatch by Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency which reflects Serbian views. This said the Territorial Defence organisation had called for 'the stepping-up of all battle activities' on Bosnian territory and a mass blockade of all federal army installations in Bosnia. Tanjug appears to have based its own despatch on a statement made earlier yesterday by Colonel Vehbija Karic, a leader of the Bosnian forces, in which he called on the republic's inhabitants and all Territorial Defence units to stop unauthorised removal of army equipment and the movement of army troops not escorted by the Territorial Defence. European Community observers stationed in three towns in Bosnia were recalled to their headquarters for consultations yesterday but also because their security could no longer be guaranteed. In Lisbon, meanwhile, leaders of the republic's three national communities gathered for EC-sponsored peace talks. Leaders of Bosnia's Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats appear to agree only that the urgent despatch of United Nations troops could curb the violence; beyond that, the warring factions remain far apart. Preliminary bilateral talks continued into the evening, with the opening of full discussions being continually delayed. Officials hoped the arrival of Mr Aliza Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, would be the beginning of substantive talks, but prospects were dimmed when he said he could only be there for a day. 'I have come here to explain the situation . . . to the European Community,' he said. Funding the UN peace-keeping force in Croatia created serious problems for the secretariat in New York and the international community has indicated its considerable reluctance to become involved still further. Meanwhile, the EC and the US appear to have backed down from warnings to Serbia of political and economic isolation for its role in destabilising Bosnia. Instead, they appear to have given President Slobodan Milosevic leeway to try to stop the fighting by bringing paramilitary units to heel. Diplomatic pressure on Mr Milosevic eased somewhat when the US revised its position and placed part of the blame for the violence on Croatia, which it suspects of aiming to divide Bosnia with Serbia. Economic sanctions, it is argued in Belgrade, risk strengthening support for Mr Milosevic by bolstering popular resentment of 'western interference'. Many fear further detoriation of the economy would give rise to an ultra nationalist administration. Sanctions would also hurt the already hard-hit economies of Bosnia and the independence-seeking Macedonia. Hunger already threatens Bosnia's 4.35m inhabitants. Serb road blocks have all but stopped the transport of foodstuffs and relief supplies. Serbia has banned most exports of food to Bosnia. Factories, not yet damaged by war, have had to cut production for lack of raw materials. A PORTUGUESE spokesman said yesterday that European Community recognition of the new Yugoslav republic would depend on its fulfilling three basic conditions, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. It would have to withdraw its troops from all neighbouring states, accept the terms of the peace conference aiming to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, and show willing to negotiate with all the other states of the former Yugoslav republic on the division of its assets and liabilities.</p>

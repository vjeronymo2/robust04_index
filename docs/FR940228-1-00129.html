For purposes of this section, the calculation of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio must exclude uncollateralized loans receivable from owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and related parties. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be classified as a restricted asset, those cash reserves may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in current assets in calculating the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ratio;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Has not had operating losses over both of its two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latest fiscal years that causes an operating loss exceeding 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the institution's previous year's tangible net worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for its latest fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating loss will be calculated by subtracting from total net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinued operations; prior period adjustments; and, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting entity. The calculation of tangible net worth must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally accepted accounting principles; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net worth. For purposes of this section, a positive tangible net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worth occurs if the institution's tangible assets exceed its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth must exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted accounting principles. In applying this standard, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary may consider the effect of extraordinary gains or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and may take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into consideration the cumulative effect of changes in accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent that such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change results in a more accurate representation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial position in accordance with generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted accounting principles;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) For a nonprofit institution_(i) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or provides the required information as footnotes to the audit;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1:1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Has not had, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease in total net assets of such significance that, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued, would result in a ratio of current assets to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities of less than 1:1. The Secretary may consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and infrequent events, and may take into consideration the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more accurate representation of the institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position in accordance with generally accepted accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles. For purposes of this analysis, the Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported as changes in unrestricted net assets; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) For a public institution, has its liabilities backed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the full faith and credit of a State, or by an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental entity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Finns in Russian deal Ivo International, the Finnish power company, has signed an agreement to participate in the rehabilitation of 16 power plants and associated heating systems in Russia, mainly around St Petersburg, Michael Smith writes. The value of the projects, together with the development and commissioning of new environmental protection technologies, will be about FM1bn (Pounds 122m). Russia will cover the costs of the projects by currency earned with sales of fuel and electricity to Finland. Most of this power will be the result of savings from modernisations and improvements in efficiency at the plants.</p>

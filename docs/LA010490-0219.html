			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SPILLANES BEGIN REBUILDING  </P> <P> Work has begun on a new house for Mickey Spillane to replace the one destroyed  by Hurricane Hugo.  </P> <P> The mystery writer has joked that his former home "looked like Godzilla took a  walk all through that place."  </P> <P> Spillane and his wife, Jane, watched the start of work Wednesday while stakes  were planted and the areas of the rooms were roped off.  </P> <P> "We're going way up on stilts. It's going to be a bigger house but with more of  a country flavor and facing the water," Jane Spillane said.  </P> <P> The author has said he waited 19 years to write his latest book, "The Killing  Man," because "I was doing OK and didn't really need the money."  </P> <P> "After (Hurricane Hugo) I needed the money very badly," he said.  </P></p>

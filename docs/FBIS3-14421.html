			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says he has been  informed that the government intends to exploit the massacre in  Hebron to uproot the Hebron Jewish settlement. Speaking to our  correspondent this morning, Netanyahu warned that such an act  would cause a terrible rift. He reiterated his call on the  prime minister to consult with leaders of the opposition and  with the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza settlement leaders on ways to  safeguard the security of Hebron settlers. Uprooting is not the  answer to the problem of their security, Netanyahu said.    He further stated that Hebron is the heart of Eretz  Yisra'el,  and that we have never acknowledged its being an occupied  territory. He said he is against the uprooting of Jews from  anywhere, including Hebron.</p>

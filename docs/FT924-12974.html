			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Gardening: Moving in the best circle - Arthur Hellyer suggests trees suitable for celebrating Europe's single market THE SINGLE European market is due to start from January 1 and, as part of the celebrations, it is being suggested that tree circles should be planted in all 12 countries of the European Community. The idea goes far beyond planting just one or two circles in each country. What is envisaged is that local communities, groups and individuals, such as industrialists, schools, golf clubs - even private householders - should plant circles of appropriate size and character in villages, playing fields and open spaces everywhere. If small trees are used, a circle need not take up a lot of space and could be very decorative. Each circle should, of course, consist of just 12 trees, one for each of the EC countries. Clearly, it is open to debate as to whether circles should have only one kind of tree, but problems multiply if the trees chosen do not grow at approximately the same rate and finish up at about the same size. Notcutts Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk, has produced a useful leaflet suggesting trees for circles of three different sizes: eight metres (approximately 20 ft) in diameter, 14 metres (46 ft) and 25 metres (82 ft). The smallest circle certainly should fit into many gardens and two tree varieties are suggested for it (although of it is not made entirely clear if they can be mixed together): the popular, erect-growing Japanese cherry, Ama-no-gawa; and Malus Maypole one of the new Ballerina apple trees. These carry a gene which regulates production of side branches, keeping them all very short so that the trees are virtually self-pruning, single-stemmed cordons. Four of these varieties already are available widely; Maypole is the one grown primarily for ornament and also as a pollinator for other apple varieties since its fruits are small and decorative, suitable for jelly-making but not eating. The plentiful blossom is carmine. A circle of this kind would certainly be very attractive but I wonder if gardeners might not prefer to use all the four available Ballerina apples: Polka, with light and green fruits; Bolero, which has good-sized green and golden fruits; Waltz, red and green, all three dessert varieties; plus Maypole. More varieties are in the pipeline and I particularly like the look of Telamon, which is an all-red dessert apple that seems to be a heavy cropper. For the medium-size circle, Notcutts has four suggestions, two of them for native trees which would appeal to conservationists. One of these is the field maple, Acer campestre, which grows especially well on chalk and limestone and has an extended leaf-colouring period in the autumn. The other is the rowan (or mountain ash), Sorbus aucuparia asplenifolia being the one selected because it is particularly decorative. The exotic trees chosen are Malus tschonoskii and Pyrus calleriana Chanticleer. The first is an erect-growing apple species which has white flowers and yellowish-green fruits tinged with purple, but neither flowers nor fruits are produced very freely. The real glory of this tree is its autumn leaf colour when it turns crimson, purple, orange and yellow. It is naturally like a pyramid in shape. So, too, is Pyrus Chanticleer, and this also is grown primamrily for its rich autumn colour. It would be easy to think of a score of others including good, golden-leaved trees such as Robinia Frisia or Gleditsia Sunburst; or the sweet gum, Liquidambar styraciflua, which has rich autumn colour. For the large circle, Notcutts suggests ash, lime, Norway maple and the wild cherry, Prunus avium. Again, the selection could be widened to take in many other fine trees including oak, beech and hornbeam, all of which have erect forms which take up much less lateral space than the normal types. The narrow, or fastigiate, form of beech called Dawyck also has purple-leaved and golden-leaved varieties. These are all particularly narrow trees when young but, after 15 years or so, they start to widen a little although the branches still grow upright. The erect hornbeam has a fairly narrow, cone-shaped head of branches and is popular for street planting. The cypress oak is called Quercus robur fastigiata, and is as narrow as the Dawyck beech when young. It is always upright but widens with age; my 30-year-old specimen has a spread of about 24 ft at 10 ft above ground level. So, 12 trees of this would require quite a big circle, although nothing like as much as for an ordinary oak tree. An altogether different, more formal effect could be obtained by planting fastigiate conifers such as the Irish juniper (Juniperus communis hibernica); the even narrower J. Virginica Skyrocket; or Irish yew in green or golden-leaved forms or both intermingled. These would probably be too dramatic for countryside planting, but could look very effective in some garden and park settings and would not take up a great deal of room.</p>

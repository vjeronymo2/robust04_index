			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Party [NP] has intervened in the  dispute between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in  KwaZulu/Natal, calling on the IFP to show commitment to  democratic decision-making. The ANC and IFP have clashed on the  question of a capital for the province, with the IFP favoring  Ulundi, while the ANC and the NP favor Pietermaritzburg. The  ANC has gone so far as to urge members of the Executive Council  to boycott meetings held in Ulundi.    The leader of the NP in the province, Mr. Danie Schutte, has  accused the IFP of adopting a one-sided attitude towards  decision-making and said the IFP and the ANC have not yet proved  that they can work together in a provincial government of  national unity. Mr. Schutte also attacked the call by IFP  Transvaal leader Themba Khoza for the immediate lifting of the  state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal and described it as  arrogant. Citing the deaths of 45 people last week and more  killings at the weekend, he said a decision to lift the state of  emergency could not be taken lightly.</p>

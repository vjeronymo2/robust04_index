			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background and Summary of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 18, 1992, the OTS issued notice of a proposal to amend the agency's regulations governing mergers and other combinations to permit mergers, consolidations and transfer of asset and assumption of liability transactions among savings associations and other FDIC-insured depository institutions in accordance with sections 501 and 502 of the FDICIA. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the OTS proposed changes to its regulations to allow Federal savings associations to convert directly to state and national banks (while retaining Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) deposit insurance) in a so-called ``Sasser conversion,'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and to permit any FDIC-insured depository institution that qualifies for Federal Home Loan Bank membership to convert to a Federal savings association charter. The proposal also specified the types of transactions that would require either prior notice or application to the OTS, and the time frames governing review of these filings. The proposal did not include amendments to the merger regulations involving mutual savings associations. However, specific comments were requested as to whether mutual savings associations should be permitted to merge directly with banks without first undergoing a mutual-to stock conversion and what safeguards would be necessary for such transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR 37112&hyph;37118 (August 18, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5(d)(2)(G) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(2)(G).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the OTS proposed to streamline and consolidate its regulations by, among other things, eliminating unnecessary portions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement and incorporating the remainder in a better organized fashion into the revised section 563.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS solicited public comments on all aspects of the proposal for a 30-day period. Upon consideration of all the comments received during the comment period, the OTS is adopting the proposal with some modifications, discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS received 10 comment letters in response to the proposal, including four from savings banks, two from savings and loan holding companies, two from trade associations representing financial institutions, one from a law firm representing financial institutions and one from the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The OTS has carefully considered all of the comments received during the comment period. In addition, the OTS has reviewed the rulemakings of other Federal banking agencies on related subjects, and has sought, to the maximum extent possible, to adopt consistent provisions. The following is a discussion of the issues raised by the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Mandatory Federal Home Loan Bank Membership for Converting Savings Associations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the proposal, section 5(f) of the HOLA requires Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) membership for all Federal savings associations, and FHLBank membership was consistently required of state-chartered savings associations by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation as a condition of deposit insurance. In addition, after enactment of the FIRREA, the OTS required resulting banks in thrift-to-bank charter conversions and Oakar transactions <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  in which no savings association survived the transaction to continue to hold the former savings association's FHLBank stock in accordance with the requirements of the FHFB. Each commenter that addressed this issue objected to any regulation that would continue this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used herein, an ``Oakar'' transaction refers to a combination between a savings association and a bank that is excepted from the moratorium on deposit insurance fund conversion set forth at section 5(d)(2)(A)(ii) of the FDIA by virtue of section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA. See 12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(2)(A)(ii) and 1815(d)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since publication of the proposal, the FHFB advised the OTS that it will not require a savings association that has converted to a bank charter to retain membership in the FHLBank system, nor will the FHFB require a non-FHLBank system member that has acquired some or all of the assets of a savings association to become a member of the FHLBank system. In light of the FHFB's views on this issue, the OTS advised the FHFB on November 20, 1992 that the OTS was discontinuing its practice of imposing the condition that such institutions retain FHLBank stock. In addition, the OTS advised the FHFB that in prior cases where the FHLBank stock condition was imposed, the OTS would not object if a bank seeks to redeem its FHLBank stock and terminate its FHLBank membership. In March 1993, the OTS reiterated these positions in promulgating a final regulation that will remove, in 1995, the regulatory requirement that state-chartered savings associations have and maintain FHLBank membership. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the final rule does not require FHLBank membership of resulting institutions in the context of thrift-to-bank mergers and charter conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 14510, 14513 (March 18, 1993).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 563.49.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Issues Regarding Mutual Savings Associations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current OTS regulations generally provide that merger transactions involving Federal mutual savings associations must result in a mutual form of savings association, unless the mutual institution converts to a stock savings association as part of the transaction. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The proposal did not set forth any amendments to these regulations, but did solicit comment as to whether mutual savings associations should be permitted to merge with banks or other institutions other than in conjunction with a mutual-to-stock conversion, and if permitted, what safeguards should be established with respect to these transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR 552.13(c)(1)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments addressing this issue unanimously opposed any regulation that would permit Federal mutual savings associations to be acquired by commercial banks or other stock-form institutions without a prior or simultaneous mutual-to-stock conversion by the mutual savings association. These commenters expressed the view that OTS regulations adequately protect the interests of mutual accountholders <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  and direct acquisition resulting in a stock institution may jeopardize those protections. They also noted that the FDICIA does not evidence any intent to change the current treatment of combinations involving mutual associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS has recently issued an interim final regulation, with a request for comment, revising certain key provisions in its mutual to stock conversion regulations. The amendments generally prohibit merger conversions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , where a mutual savings association converts to stock form and simultaneously merges into another stock form depository institution) except in certain supervisory situations. In addition, OTS has proposed to add a ``convenience and needs'' test to its standards for approving mutual to stock conversions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 22725 (May 3, 1994) and 59 FR 22764 (May 3, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

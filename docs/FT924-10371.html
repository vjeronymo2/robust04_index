			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: M and S sticks to its formula - The Bottom Line WHEN THE late, great Sam Walton was asked how he built Wal-Mart from one store in Bentonville, Arkansas, into the biggest retailer in the world he often replied by recounting how he sold satin ladies' panties in the 1950s. 'I found that by pricing the item at Dollars 1 I could sell three times more of it than by pricing it at Dollars 1.20. I might make only half the profit per item, but because I was selling three times as many, the overall profit was much greater,' he recalled in his autobiography. That simple maxim was one of the prime reasons that Wal-Mart's sales grew in five decades from next-to-nothing to Dollars 44bn (greater than the gross domestic product of New Zealand). But it is a retailing truth practised - if less spectacularly - by many other companies around the world. This week, Marks and Spencer, the most notable exponent of the art in the UK, proved that the formula still works even in the depths of a severe recession which has left almost every other retailer reeling. Interim pre-tax profits were a sparkling 20 per cent higher at Pounds 257.1m. Even when the effects of the previous year's exceptional charge were stripped out, the company still showed an 11 per cent gain. Because of the vast volume of goods that M and S buys across a relatively narrow range, the company is able to operate on a very low gross margin of about 34 per cent ensuring that its clothes are competitively priced. But, because of exceptionally low operating costs, which stem from its Pounds 2bn freehold property base and its efficiency, it is also able to retain a high proportion of that profit at the net level. So, for example, if M and S sold a pair of pants for Pounds 1 it would take 34p in gross profit and, after paying all staff and occupancy costs, would keep almost 12p to reinvest in the business and distribute to shareholders. When you multiply that sum by a factor of several million it is easy to see why M and S single-handedly accounts for about 25 per cent of all the earnings generated by the 34 biggest publicly-quoted stores companies in the UK (excluding food retailers), and why its shares account for 30 per cent of that group's total market capitalisation. M and S clearly benefits from its colossal size relative to its competitors in the clothing industry. Its 18 per cent market share is almost twice that of its nearest rival, Burton Group. A similar profit equation also holds true - although to a lesser extent - on the foods side of M and S's business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales. Although it is a small player compared with J. Sainsbury and Tesco, M and S sells very high volumes of very few lines. But, although sheer size gives M and S tremendous economies of scale, it also creates several strategic challenges: the most obvious being how does it keep the growth momentum going? Although M and S's latest results were undeniably impressive, its City critics gathered ammunition from the fact that its UK food and clothes sales were virtually flat while group sales - depressed by retrenchment in Canada  -fell by 0.3 per cent to Pounds 2.64bn. The recession is clearly the central factor, but the bears argue that in the UK, M and S is close to saturation point. Its diversification into North America has proved a bitter and costly disappointment. And while its organic expansion into mainland Europe is progressing well it will still be several years before it contributes a significant share of group profits. Such concerns fuelled a 6 per cent fall in M and S's share price this week to 322p as it began to lose some of its lofty premium to the market. When the long-awaited consumer resurgence eventually arrives, the company's shares may again suffer as investors move out of classic defensive stocks into more cyclical retailing plays. But M and S has confounded such doubters in the past and Sir Richard Greenbury, the company's pugnacious chairman, delights in the challenge of doing so again. Many people have regretted betting against the mighty M and S.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Transfer files 'must be kept' Financial services groups are being told by their regulators not to destroy any files relating to personal pension plans sold to people transferring from or opting out of occupational pension schemes. A meeting last month of a group organised by the Securities and Investments Board agreed that all self-regulatory organisations should write to their members warning them not to dispose such files. There is a risk, however, that substantial numbers of files may already have disappeared because the minimum period set by some regulators for keeping records is three years. Pension transfers have been available from July 1988. Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, wrote to its members earlier this month, saying that in spite of the normal three-year period for record-keeping, members would find that disposing of or losing pension transfer papers was 'unlikely to be compatible' with observing regulatory principles of organising their business in a proper way. Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the fund management industry, similarly wrote to its members a couple of days later. The council of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, is expected to agree a letter at its meeting tomorrow. There is less urgency in this case, because Fimbra's normal limit for record-keeping is six years rather than three, and so its members should still have all their files. SIB itself is notifying those organisations, such as banks and building societies, which it regulates directly.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil revenue tax change agreed THE COMMONS finance committee yesterday passed the government's amendment to the North Sea tax changes included in the Budget. The amendment will help to cushion companies worst affected by the proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax, although opposition MPs argued that it does not go far enough towards providing short term aid. The amendment will make it easier for companies to claim the Pounds 200m transitional relief earmarked in the government's Budget proposals. Companies will be able to claim financial help with exploration and appraisal work up to a cap of Pounds 10m per company until the end of next year. The changes to PRT included in the Finance Bill reduce the rate paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish tax relief for exploration work. Opposition MPs on the committee argued that the changes should be phased in over at least 3 years.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Boat-builder looks to show for health of economy: Business reports sluggish Continental sales THE LEVEL of inquiries this weekend at the Southampton International Boat Show should provide Fairline, one of the UK's leading boat manufacturers, with some idea of whether the economy is looking up. The week-long show attracts some foreign buyers but is mainly for UK enthusiasts. It is the German shows - starting with Friedrichshafen in three weeks - which the company will watch with most interest. In 1989 Fairline exported 40 per cent of its output. Now, said Mrs Briony Newington, the marketing director, the figure was more than 80 per cent. The company, based near Peterborough, makes about 300 powerboats a year, compared with 500 in the late 1980s. But the boats it makes now tend to be larger and more expensive, selling for about Pounds 750,000. After recording a loss of Pounds 507,000 last year the company expects to be profitable this year. When the UK started to go into recession Fairline looked to the Continent for salvation. Germany has held up well, in spite of its economic downturn. The company has increased its market share in Spain, although selling pleasure boats there has become more difficult. France is experiencing more difficult conditions. Sales to Germany have climbed from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of turnover in the past few years. Fairline's sales received a boost from last year's sterling devaluation and the German downturn does not appear to have affected orders. 'When they talk recession in Germany it's not the same as when they talk recession in the UK,' said Mrs Newington. But France, she said, appeared to be experiencing a UK-style downturn. 'They seem to be in the position we were in a year ago.' Mrs Newington said, however, that she has found Fairline's Continental distributors reasonably optimistic. She hoped this week's interest-rate cuts in continental Europe would keep orders buoyant. UK boat-builders were in a strong position to turn their attention to exports, she said. They were larger than their Continental rivals and could manufacture more efficiently. Mrs Newington said that UK boats had always been admired for their mechanical excellence. The big improvement recently was their design. With Europe in difficulties, the company is looking to the Far East, where new marinas should boost demand.</p>

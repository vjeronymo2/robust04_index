			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov for </F> TASS]    [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- "The state must pay its  debts," Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Russia's Central Bank,  said on Friday, addressing the lower house of the Russian  parliament on an item entitled "an hour of the government."    Gerashchenko declared that the outstanding debts of the  state  to some sectors of the economy, and farmers, in particular,  would be paid, although not simultaneously. Gerashchenko said  that the total debt amounts to almost eight trillions roubles.  Chairman of Russia's Central Bank pointed out that the question  of outstanding debts was discussed at a session of the Russian  Government on Thursday, adding that the matter would be  finalized during next week and afterwards, positively resolved.    Russian lawmakers found it a paradox to hear Gerashchenko  say  that currently, the system of mutual payments has been working  better than before, including with former Soviet republics.  Gerashchenko pointed out that there is an active balance of  payments between Russia and CIS countries. "We are pursuing a  policy of restricting credits issued to CIS countries from the  state budget," Gerashchenko said.    Asked where Russia will find money to grant a credit to  Georgia, Gerashchenko replied that "our leaders can prove to the  State Duma that such a credit is necessary."    Commenting on the current financial situation in Russia,  Gerashchenko said that "we have been going up the spiral of  inflation all the time." He admitted that the Central Bank  spent over a million dollars in January alone to stabilise the  rouble exchange rate.    Gerashchenko pointed out that according to estimates made by  the Central Bank, last year, the budget deficit was within 10.5  per cent of the gross national product. But in his opinion, "no  tragedy has occurred."    Gerashchenko declared that currently, "we have been  constantly experimenting which might trigger inflation to a  certain degree and perhaps, we shall not attain the reduction of  the budget deficit by 5 per cent of the size of the gross  national product as we would like to do."</p>

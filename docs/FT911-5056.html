			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Truancy crackdown MR MICHAEL Fallon, junior education minister, announced a crackdown on truancy in schools yesterday. The government proposes to tighten regulations to distinguish between authorised and unauthorised attendance and to require schools to publish rates of unauthorised absence. Parents would then be able to compare truancy rates when choosing a school. He also proposed a rise in fines for non-attendance from Pounds 400 to Pounds 1000.</p>

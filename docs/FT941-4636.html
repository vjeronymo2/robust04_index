			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / BAT denies planning bid for Groupe Victoire: Insurance businesses offset decline in tobacco side BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, yesterday denied market rumours that it was to bid for Groupe Victoire, the French insurance company. BAT also reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.81bn, with its insurance businesses offsetting a fall in tobacco profits. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said BAT had 'no present intention' of buying Victoire or having a rights issue. 'We're not going to preclude what might happen next year or the year after, but the statement means what it says,' he said. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said: 'It is well known that we are interested in expanding our financial services business, and we make no secret of the fact that we are looking at continental Europe. We have no wish to comment on any specific transactions.' Speculation about a bid for Victoire, worth approximately Pounds 1bn, has arisen since the group's parent, Compagnie de Suez put it up for sale. BAT's insurance business, consisting of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in the UK and Farmers in the US, raised full-year profits by 53 per cent from Pounds 598m to Pounds 913m. Tobacco profits, however, were hit by a price war in the US, and excluding profits from the disposal of brands the underlying fall there was 18 per cent. Mr Broughton said there were early signs of recovery in US tobacco. 'But given what happened to US margins last year, it would be a very brave or foolish man who would forecast margins in 1994.' Cigarette sales and profits were lower in continental Europe. Tobacco profits in Australia, Hong Kong and south and central America also fell. Sir Patrick said the group performance 'demonstrated the resilience of our strategy, with a year of exceptional difficulty for tobacco offset by firm recovery in financial services'. The improvement in insurance was achieved despite heavier than expected provisions for mortgage indemnity business. Provisions for discontinued operations amounted to Pounds 143m, against Pounds 145m in 1992. Losses from Eagle Star's domestic mortgage indemnity business of Pounds 99m rose from Pounds 69m, but overall general insurance underwriting losses - on so-called continuing operations - fell to Pounds 142m from Pounds 280m. BAT's shares rose 16p to 485p. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 25</p>

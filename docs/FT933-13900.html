			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Income of Sweden's OM soars OM, the Swedish securities and derivatives exchange operator and clearer, said net profit after financial items in the first six months of 1993 jumped to SKr100.1m (Dollars 12.7m) from SKr44.1m in the same 1992 period, Reuter reports from Stockholm. The company said higher volumes, specifically in share options exchange trade and clearing of interest rate futures, had boosted income while costs fell. Outside Sweden, OM also runs OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange. Operating income rose 34 per cent to SKr190.7m and operating costs fell 8 per cent to SKr129.9m, resulting in operating profit rising steeply to SKr60.7m from SKr1.1m. Turnover in interest rate futures, of which OM has seven different Swedish contract types, rose in the period to an average of 44,763 per day from 26,668 in the first half of 1992. However, the average rate has slowed from a 48,585 per-day mean during the first quarter of 1993. 'We had larger volatility of interest rate contracts earlier this year than we had during the second quarter, but still we have a level of turnover that is substantially higher than last year,' said Mr Michael Kongstad, head of information. A trigger for the increased use of interest rate futures was the Swedish krona's flotation from its Ecu peg last November.</p>

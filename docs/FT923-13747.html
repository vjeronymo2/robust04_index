			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Travel: On horseback in Africa - Nicholas Woodsworth visits Swaziland, where an older way of life exists IT WAS mid-morning and time for decisions. Submerged up to my belly button, I sat on an underwater stool at the bar pool, leaned back, and sucked thoughtfully at a pink lemonade. In the middle of an African heat-wave, one must consider one's options carefully. Out on a raised tee not far from the pool, sunburned men in spiked shoes were belting great drives down the first fairway of the Royal Swazi Sun Hotel's hillside golf course. These were not the feeble and erratic efforts of weekend duffers like me; when they swung a club over their shoulders the competitors in the Swazi Sun Pro-Am Classic actually knew what they were about to do. I, on the other hand, knew what I was about not to do - trot around after them looking for clues to improve my form. On airless greens baking in 42```C (115`F) heat, enthusiastic spectators were going down like ninepins. There was another way, though, in which I could trot around in something like comfort. On the far side of the golf course I had spotted the hotel riding stable. My riding seat may be no better than my golf stance, but I could see few more pleasant means of getting to know this corner of Africa. Trudge about on foot in this noon-day sun and you undoubtedly deserve the company of mad dogs. Drive around in a car and you miss much of the best the tiny country of Swaziland has to offer - spectacular hill country and a traditional rural way of life that has yet to catch up with the modern age. Half-an-hour later I had swung up on to the back of a tall chestnut mare named Vitesse and with guide Peter Emmett was setting out through the emerald fields of the fertile Ezulwini valley. It may be the special quality of light one finds on the high plateau all over southern Africa, or it may be that factory smokestacks are few and far between in Swaziland. Either way, everything seemed bright and highly coloured on this cross-country hack through village, field and bush. The sky above was a fierce hard blue, the hills that rose all around a lush green, the dirt road along which Vitesse walked an unabashed red. In this world the vivid yellow butterflies that flitted along seemed only normal. The Ezulwini valley lies only a 20-minute drive from the Swazi capital, Mbabane, in the most developed part of the country. Nonetheless it lives in a simpler, less complex age than our own. Leave the confines of the luxury hotels scattered along its length and suddenly, surprisingly, life itself, like the colours here, is reduced to its basic elements. As very few African countries are these days, Swaziland remains overwhelmingly agricultural and its people rural. Fording the muddy brown water of a stream, we passed women washing piles of laundry. Upstream, small naked boys splashed through the water like shiny brown seals. We overtook barefooted girls padding home with old kerosene tins full of water balanced on their heads. Beside tin-roofed houses that had neither running water nor electricity we saw mothers weeding their maize fields, newborn babies tied to their backs with shawls. Old men wrapped in the traditional garb of red cloth sat under shady trees by the road drinking beer. And in the wide rolling pastureland where we let the horses canter, cowherds with slingshots stood guard while snowy white tick birds rode the backs of their grazing charges. Not surprisingly, Peter Emmett has fallen in love with this country. Nor is he alone - more than 10,000 white residents enjoy the pace of life here. Like him, many are South African escapees from a life of stress and racial tension. Some years ago, inducted into a crack military counter-insurgency unit, Peter found himself using dogs and horses to chase guerrilla fighters through the bush of pre-independence Namibia. Today he is much happier in his capacity as stable owner, competition rider and captain of the Swaziland polocross team. While half Swaziland's expatriates are British, its economy is wholly dominated by the modern, high-tech neighbour that borders it on three sides; from where we were riding we could see the sugar cane fields and timber stands in which South African expertise and investment plays such a role. All the more surprising, then, is Swaziland's striking retention of tribal customs and a traditional, African way of life. Even witchcraft continues to play an important role. Following, for example, a media Aids campaign in which they were admonished to 'wear condoms at all times,' many Swazis took to hanging unrolled condoms from their belts in the belief they had magic power to ward off infection. But the greatest power in the land is vested in one man. Riding up the sides of the valley to a rocky crest, we climbed high enough to overlook the Royal Kraal, or enclosure, of King Mswati III. In the kingdom of Swaziland this, rather than any boardroom or government ministry, is the real seat of rule. Mswati is very young and inexperienced, but here, advised by tribal elders, he rules by royal decree. His great wealth is judged not by his bank account but rather by the fact he is the largest cattle owner in the country - in Swaziland cattle are so valued as marks of status that few owners are willing to part with them and the country cannot fill its lucrative EC export quota. Mswati may be British-educated, but does not keep British habits. Already he has seven wives, a niggling number compared to the five dozen his father had. How traditional does the king remain on a continent that is rapidly changing? When he recently convened national leaders and foreign diplomats to announce gradual changes towards more democratic rule, he had them sit before him on the grass in the Royal Cattle Byre. On our ride I had seen plenty of cattle, goats, dogs and other domestic animals, but later that day I made a dramatic switch to their wild cousins. In the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary, a reserve just minutes up the valley, I exchanged Vitesse for a dun-coloured gelding named Skukuza, and put myself in the capable hands of Innocent and High Noon, Innocent being a park guide and High Noon his horse. Few experiences can match riding along at close quarters beside a thundering herd of wildebeest or high-bounding impala. In the softer, kinder sun of late afternoon, Innocent and I trotted off across rolling plains knee-high in feathery grass, along deep creeks thick with tropical vegetation, and through fragrant pine forests where leopards find refuge. There were animals everywhere, giraffe feeding on the trees, wart hog rooting through the underbrush, hippo wallowing in muddy ponds, impala dozing in the shade. For some reason, wild animals pay little attention to cars; with horses, though, there is a direct and gratifying interaction. The herds sniff the air, twitch their ears, stamp the ground nervously, and then begin to run. By sunset I felt I had all of Africa to myself. Hills and mountains glowed mauve. The plain before me was dotted with grazing zebra, the air filled with the smell of horse sweat and the cooler scents of coming night. Not far away at a poolside bar, exhausted men in peaked caps were settling down to an evening of tall tales. Soon I would be joining them. But talk of mighty blows and escape from deadly sand traps would no longer bring out the embarrased duffer in me. Let them set out through the African heat in deranged pursuit of that little white ball. I had my own, more pleasant pursuits, on four legs rather than two.

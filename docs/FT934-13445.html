			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sappi turns in 63% fall at halfway WEAK international and domestic markets caused net income at Sappi, the South African-based forest products group, to fall by 63 per cent to R64.3m (Dollars 19.2m) in the six months to August from R175.1m a year ago. Describing the results as 'very disappointing', Mr Eugene van As, chairman, said nevertheless that they were 'in line with those of better performing international forest product companies'. Citing poor trading conditions and lack of promise in the short-term outlook, the group decided to pass its interim dividend (80 cents a share in 1992). Earnings per share fell by 67 per cent to 43 cents from 130 cents. Turnover rose by 36 per cent to R2.7bn as a result of the consolidation for the first time of German subsidiary Hannover Papier, acquired in July 1992. Turnover from existing businesses was flat, reflecting low selling prices and difficult trading conditions. Operating income fell by 54 per cent to R101m. Sappi Europe reached 'approximately a break-even result'.</p>

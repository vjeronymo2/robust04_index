			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the main faction in the Liberian  National Transitional Government [LNTG], the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Gankay Taylor, has  clarified that the State Council has no hurry of dismissing  power. Mr. Taylor was addressing a news conference in Gbarnga  yesterday in the wake of the nomination by the chairman of the  State Council of certain individuals [word indistinct] as  coordinators of the disputed ministries, particularly the  Foreign Ministry, Mr. Taylor said he had introduced a coalition  government of compromise involving the factions. Mr. Taylor  said any faction's attempt to seat the LNTG, will not be  welcomed as anything done half way is not done at all. He said  it would be a mistake on the part of the NPFL to form a part of  any such seating of the LNTG.    The NPFL leader said that officials of the IGNU [Interim  Government of National Unity] faction in the transitional  government have all taken their seats in the government,  including public operations and deputy ministerial positions.  Mr. Taylor said if the NPFL allows the IGNU faction to keep a  deputy minister acting in a foreign minister capacity, then  individuals will go on holding onto the Foreign Ministry for the  rest of the transitional period.    He stressed that the NPFL is not prepared to tolerate any  such conditions. The NPFL leader said it would appear that a  consultation or allocation of cabinet posts has developed into a  personality clash where some people do not distrust cited  individuals. Mr. Taylor said he cannot understand why anyone  would have reservations about a qualified Liberian like  Counselor Momolu Sirleaf becoming foreign minister of Liberia.  The NPFL leader said there was an instance where he would have  preferred swapped-in portofolio between Counselor Sirleaf going  to the Justice Ministry, while Counselor Laveli Supuwood could  have taken over the Foreign Ministry. He said this could be  somewhat only a concession. [Words indistinct] Counselor Sirleaf  as an individual who has been considered as an obstacle to peace  in Liberia.    The NPFL leader said he does not know where these  reservations are coming from, but he said that Counselor Sirleaf  is a qualified Liberian who can ably command the Foreign  Ministry.</p>

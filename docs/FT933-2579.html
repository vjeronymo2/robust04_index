			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Snia BPD increases sales by 7.6% at halfway stage SNIA BPD, the quoted chemicals, fibres and industrial company controlled by Italy's Fiat group, raised consolidated sales by 7.6 per cent to L1,146bn (Dollars 746m) in the first half of this year. Group earnings before tax and minority interests recovered strongly to L12bn, against a L14bn loss in the corresponding period last year. The improvement was prompted partly by a sharp fall in group debts, which were reduced to L380bn from L767bn at the end of last year. The cut in borrowings came largely from the sale of Snia BPD's space and rocket technology business, which raised L260bn, and the disposal of some bio-engineering businesses for more than L137bn. The company warned that earnings would remain overshadowed by the recession, but said the restructuring and sale of some businesses left it better placed to benefit from any signs of recovery. Italmobiliare, the holding company which controls Italcementi, one of the world's biggest cement groups, is planning capital increases which should raise about L260bn. The highly complex deal involves a rights issue of new ordinary and savings shares combined with warrants to buy new equity, and a bond issue convertible into new non-voting savings stock.</p>

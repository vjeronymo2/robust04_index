			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going Shopping / In the third part of our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers look at how the people of five major cities dress to go shopping Down some alley off Frankfurt's main Zeil shopping drag - precise whereabouts unknown - there must be a workshop devoted to building Claudia Schiffer lookalikes. They dot the Zeil every Saturday: skinny young girls with freshly-ironed hair and silly pouts. Recognisable by their uniform black flannel shorts, woolly grey tights and tight black tops, on colder days they trail flimsy black duster coats. But they never, ever, carry shopping bags. Their purpose, it seems, is purely decorative. Which is just as well. Others among the weekend hordes are purposeful to the point of obsession. Their aim is to go about their business before the shutters go up at lunchtime in honour of Germany's daft laws governing shopping hours. Ladies flit from store to store in crisp red blazers and black pants. Young men wander aimlessly in dense felty jackets and the obligatory jeans before wandering off to lunch. Saturday is the best time of all to see Frankfurters clad in their infinite variety. A quarter of the permanent population is foreign, and the weekend mix is enriched by passers-through, buskers and beggars from eastern Europe and beyond. What does the Russian song and dance troupe, immaculate in traditional boots and flounces, make of all those locals in rustling shell suits and over-sized trainers, videoing their act with such solemnity? What do the odd German couples in knee-breeches, loden greens and tufty little hats make of the Andean pan-pipers tootling to audiences of enchanted children dressed as up-market rag dolls? It is all too brief. Nothing more than a snapshot. By three, the shoppers have retreated. The boulevard is once again left to its regular population: a clutch of drunks tottering around the fountain, and black-clad young men waiting for the dark and the more sinister retailing business which characterises the Zeil by night.</p>

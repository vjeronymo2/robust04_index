			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index breaks through 2,900 LONDON equities paused only for a moment yesterday to swallow their disappointment at the Bundesbank's failure to deliver the expected cut in its discount rate, and then turned strongly ahead as foreign exchange markets signalled mounting pressures on the ERM currencies. The FT-SE 100 Index broke decisively through the 2,900 barrier as traders scented a possible repetition of sterling's experience last September, with currency stresses perhaps leading this time to interest rate cuts in leading countries in the ERM network and then in Britain. Some speculators even suggested that UK base rates might be lowered today. The FT-SE 100 jumped by 33.4 points to 2,917.6, its highest closing level for more than four months and only 1.3 per cent below the all-time closing peak of 2,957.3 achieved on March 8. The late upturn was even more marked in the second line stocks and left the FT-SE Mid 250 Index 28.2 higher at a new peak of 3,273. The stock market, although firm throughout the session, hung fire for a while after the announcement that the Bundesbank was cutting the Lombard rate by half a point but leaving the key discount rate unchanged. The drive forward came late in the afternoon when sterling, UK government bonds, the US dollar and Wall Street provided impetus. Stock index futures opened the way ahead, with the September contract on the FT-SE 100 racing to a 20-point premium against cash, stimulating heavy arbitrage business represented by selling of futures and buying of the underlying blue chip shares. The lower interest rate scenario brought share gains across a range of issues. The UK banking sector rebounded strongly from early weakness to close firmly ahead of the opening of the dividend and reporting season. Lower rates in the UK would ease the burden of bad debts on the banks, and yesterday's developments helped to offset warnings from several UK sources that bank shares are overpriced. Store and retail issues also improved, but in fairly restrained fashion. Equity trading volume was good but not sensational, with Seaq volume of 691.8m shares comparing with 690m in the previous session. Non-Footsie business slipped back to only around 58 per cent of total turn over. On Wednesday, retail, or customer, business remained high at a worth of Pounds 1.45bn. In the first half of the session, when equities were temporarily discouraged by the somewhat muted action from the Bundesbank, the Footsie slipped back after touching 2,897.4 and it seemed that the 2,900 barrier was still solid. Pharmaceutical shares looked uncertain, with Wellcome unresponsive to an apparently bullish report on Aids treatments. Trading results from ICI were well received. However, strategic concepts were largely pushed aside when currency turmoil increased, and analysts were in no doubt that the foreign exchange markets will call the tune in equities today. Trading screens will be manned early as dealers assess overnight currency trading. Mr Nick Knight, the bullish commentator at Nomura, last night reiterated his forecast of a Footsie at 3,500 by the year-end. Some dealers warned that the close of the equity account today could spark profit-taking.</p>

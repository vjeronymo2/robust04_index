			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul high court on  Friday handed down two years in jail with a three-year stay of  execution to Shinohara Masato, the Seoul correspondent of  Japan's Fuji Television convicted of violating the military  secret protection law.    Shinohara, 41, was sentenced earlier to a two-year prison  term in a lower court and appealed his case to the high court.    In his decision, Judge Min Su-myong said, "the defendant  rightly deserves the punishment as he violated this country's  military secret protection law when he spied to obtain military  secrets for three years and gave them to military attaches at  the Japanese Embassy in Seoul."    The court believes, however, that he was interested in  military secrets more as a journalist and analyst for his  articles than as a spy, the judge said.    Moreover, this incident does not appear to have had a  decisive adverse effect on the country's security, the judge  said. Besides, he noted that Shinohara confessed before  authorities began questioning him.    Considering all the extenuating circumstances, the judge  said  he decided to give Shinohara a lenient sentence.    Shinohara was indicted last July on charges of receiving 27  military secrets from former Major Ko Yong-chol, who was working  in the intelligence headquarters of the Defense Ministry,  turning them over to Japanese military attaches on a regular  basis between 1989 and 1990.</p>

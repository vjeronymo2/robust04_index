			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Brussels lowers its sights over EU employment rules - David Goodhart, Labour Editor, chronicles a marked retreat by the Commission When Mr Padraig Flynn, the European Union's pragmatic social affairs commissioner, unveils new plans for Europe-wide employment legislation early next year, the UK government will almost certainly lay about them with relish. But the predictably noisy response will not disguise a marked retreat by Brussels from rule-making in employment. The scheme Mr Flynn is working on will be a mere echo of the aggressive 'social action programme' published by the European Commission in 1989. Already, the new emphasis on job creation of last December's white paper on employment by the outgoing Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, and Mr Flynn's own, more recent, one on European social policy has led to a more cautious attitude towards further Europe-wide legislation. Insiders now talk about turning DG5 - the Commission's social and employment affairs directorate-general - into Europe's employment 'think-tank', spreading the latest ideas about job creation, rather than Europe's 'labour ministry' imposing new regulations. This would suit Mr Flynn. Ireland's only commissioner, he held on to the social affairs job last weekend when Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming Commission president, redistributed portfolios. He does not have strong convictions on most employment issues. He is happy to move with the less regulatory times in Europe, but he is also aware that the European parliament and Europe's trade unions have to be kept sweet. He will thus certainly make some proposals for further legislation when he unveils his own social action programme in March. These are likely to include measures requiring employers to train, and further measures on sex equality and working time. But that will constitute a tame list compared with the one drawn up in 1989 by Ms Vasso Papandreou, the more activist Greek social affairs commissioner. It was that long list - including directives on controlling working time, European works councils, and young workers - which led to constant battles between Britain and Brussels, and then to Britain's right to 'opt-out' from some employment legislation agreed in the Maastricht treaty in 1991. Over the next few months Mr Flynn still needs to clear up the loose ends of that 1989 programme, in particular the 'posted workers' directive and a directive on part-time work. Both of these, which are still in draft form until voted into EU law by ministers, have aroused controversy in several member states (which is why they have not been tackled earlier) but they also have strong support, especially from France and Germany. Under the posted workers directive, companies sending employees to work in other EU states would have to observe the terms and conditions operating in those states. Countries such as Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Britain, which have large numbers of their citizens working abroad, have resisted the directive. There is also disagreement between member states about whether it should be subject to majority or unanimous voting when it is discussed by employment ministers on December 6. However, France is backing the draft directive strongly partly because it has just passed domestic legislation requiring foreign employers to pay French wage rates and wants to avoid legal proceedings against it on competition grounds. The Bonn government, which currently holds the EU presidency, also backs the directive, although it is ready to restrict it to the construction sector which is where Germany has been most affected because of its unification-driven construction boom. On the part-timers draft directive, which requires part-timer workers to receive the same hourly pay and conditions as full-timers, Bonn is keen to press the issue because it fits with its domestic agenda of promoting part-time work. The British government has the power to block this particular directive because it is subject to unanimous voting, and barring a big surprise it will use that power. That means the issue is likely to become the second issue to trigger the British 'opt-out'. It will probably be passed in all other member states next year. The part-timers directive will be only the second directive to exclude Britain - following the directive on European works councils earlier this year - and will thus cement a 'multi-speed Europe' at least in the employment field. Although Brussels is in theory opposed to this approach in the employment field, and wants to draw Britain back into the fold, it may become a model for other parts of the EU as it expands.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 29, IRNA -- A second Saudi Arabian  diplomat working in the United States is considering to apply  for political asylum, according to a faxed statement from his  lawyer in London.    Ahmad al-Zahrani was said to be seeking refuge in the  British  capital after defecting from his post as second secretary at the  Saudi Consulate in Houston.    His solicitor, Amjad Salfiti, said the 34-year old diplomat  did not want to confuse his case with the former first secretary  to the United Nations, Mohammad al-Khilewi, who applied for  asylum in the U.S. earlier this month.    He suggested that his client's application would present a  challenge to the British authorities to show an "even hand when  dealing with matters involving serious breaches of human rights  in a friendly country such as Saudi Arabia."    In his statement, al-Zahrani said that he was joining his  voice to the "increasing number of moderate academics" from  Saudi Arabia, who no longer are able to tolerate the breaches of  basic human rights by the present regime in Riyadh.    His personal experience was supported by documentary  evidence  to prove "beyond any doubt the hypocrisy and double standards  which are adopted by the Saudi regime," he said.    Al-Zahrani is noted for as a research writer of a book about  Saudi politics, which he says has been prevented from being  published even though he had obtained all the necessary licences.    There was no immediate indication if the diplomat would be  joining the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in  Saudi Arabia (CDLR), which moved its office to London in April  this year after having many of its members arrested inside the  country.    The committee, which is becoming the main focal point for  academics and intellectuals opposed to the Saudi Government, was  approached by al-Khilewi, when he defected at the beginning of  June and suggested other diplomats would follow.</p>

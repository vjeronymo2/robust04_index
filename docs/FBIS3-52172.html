			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yehuda Tzur] </F>   [Text] A large majority of the Israeli public supports the  promotion of talks with the Palestinians, and only a minority is  in favor of stopping or freezing the talks at once. These are  the findings of an public opinion poll commissioned by Labor for  private consumption. According to the poll, 60 percent of the  public supports the promotion of the talks and, in part, demands  that it be advanced rapidly while making compromises. Only 17  percent favor terminating the talks and 13 percent say they  should be frozen. These are the findings of a poll conducted  over a representative sample of the Jewish population during the  last week of 1993.    The poll also shows that the public mainly demands that the  government see to it that terror stops, but does not oppose  making compromises. The option of a peace agreement and the  establishment of a Palestinian state with agreed-on borders won  a majority of 47 percent of those surveyed, while 27 percent  strongly oppose it, and 13 percent are still hesitant about it.  Only 33 percent oppose the abandoning of Judaea and Samaria  settlements in return for peace with the Palestinians, while  nearly 40 percent are willing to support this.    According to the poll, conducted between 27 and 30 December,  a majority of the public supports the Oslo and Washington  agreements with the PLO, viewing them as correct steps toward  peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is the view of  53 percent of those polled, while 28 percent believe the steps  to be wrong.    Nearly 70 percent of the public will regard a peace  agreement  with a Palestinian autonomy an achievement, while 22 percent  will not.    The continuation of terrorism is an issue seriously  troubling  the public. A large majority, some 70 percent, said that if  terror continues, they will view it as a failure of the  government policy. The public will also regard it a failure if  the PLO fails to impose order in the Gaza Strip and terror from  there continue. Some 52 percent of those polled stated they  will regard this a failure.</p>

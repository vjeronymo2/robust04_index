			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali conferred  with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz who is in Amman  attending the annual meeting of the UN Economic and Social  Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA. Dr. al-Majali and Mr.  Buwayz discussed ways of bolstering relations between the two  countries, particularly in the fields of economy and trade.  They also reviewed latest developments in the Middle East peace  process. The Lebanese minister said later that Middle East  peace should be given a chance even if nearly three years of  Arab-Israeli talks have failed to achieve much for his country.  He said the Israeli side had to prove it is still committed to  the principles of peace and to implementing international  resolutions, including the principle of land for peace.    Buwayz told the News at Ten that Jordanian-Lebanese ties  were  good and commended Jordan's position toward the peace process as  highly credible.    [Begin recording] [Buwayz] If we have to describe our  relations, I will say that we have some very good relations,  which need to be maybe better organized at the technical, at the  commercial, at the economical level. And, I hope, we talked  about the possibility of naming a high commission, which will  study all the problems concerning this field.    [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] With respect to the peace  process, how do you view coordination with Jordan, and where is  Lebanon now?    [Buwayz] I think that Jordan, the Jordanian Government,  proved a high level of credibility in the unified Arab position  till now. We think that this peace can be only a global peace,  real peace, and this ask from ourselves unified position  concerning the whole problems of the area. We think that any  party, which will try to go very fast, will have to wait for the  others because at the end this peace cannot be between Israel  and only one party. And nobody in the Arab world can by itself  only cover this peace decision. [end recording]</p>

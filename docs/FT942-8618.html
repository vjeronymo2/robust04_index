			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: First-term loss at Woolworth grows to Dollars 38m Woolworth, the troubled US retailer that last month restated last year's figures to show a net loss of Dollars 24m for the first quarter, yesterday said losses deepened to Dollars 38m in the three months to April. Group turnover fell 18 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn, but excluding discontinued operations - notably the loss-making Woolco chain in Canada, sold to WalMart last year - turnover rose by 4.5 per cent. Excluding discontinued operations, specialty store revenues rose 10 per cent and general merchandise sales fell 3.5 per cent. At the operating level, specialty stores made an operating loss of Dollars 11m compared with operating profit of Dollars 1m last time. General merchandise made an operating loss of Dollars 13m compared with a loss of Dollars 14m last time. The disposal of Woolco was offset by lower profitability at Woolworth in Germany. Losses per share rose to 38 cents from 24 cents, but the dividend was maintained at 29 cents a share. Woolworth is investigating alleged accounting regularities that led to last month's restatement of all the quarterly figures for last year.</p>

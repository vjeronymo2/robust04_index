			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewing deal seen Speculation intensified that the long-running saga over the sale by Grand Metropolitan of its Chef &amp; Brewer chain will soon be resolved, with Whitbread emerging as the main contender. Drinks analysts said sources close to the negotiations indicated that the two sides were near to an agreement which would involve Whitbread buying around 1,050 pubs and restaurants for about Pounds 700m. The remaining 550 outlets are likely to be bought by management. The speculation received further credence yesterday from an article in the trade press quoting Chef and Brewer sources that such a deal was being finalised. Whitbread said it never commented on market rumours. GrandMet shares gained 6 to 427p and Whitbread A's 4 to 544p, with turnover in both stocks above average. The speculation drew attention to how Whitbread might fund such a deal. Mr Eric Frankis at Hoare Govett believes the group would opt for the sale of its 50 per cent share in the Whitbread Investment Company, which has a substantial holding in the high voting B shares. Any such move would necessitate freeing the structure of the group's low-voting 'A' shares. In buying over 1,000 pubs, Whitbread would have to sell or untie a similar amount to comply with the Beer Orders. It would also be locked into a substantial beer supply contract with its rival Courage for which it would have to pay compensation to exit. However, Mr Frankis believes the deal would make good sense. 'This would be a very logical acquisition for Whitbread and a good strategic long-term move,' he said. Advising a hold, he added: 'But investor enthusiasm for the enfranchisement of the shares is reflected in the current share price.' Hotel group Forte fell sharply, although old talk of a rights issue was dismissed by leisure analysts, who put most of the speculation down to nervousness ahead of the results in a few weeks. The company is expected to reveal that it plans to float off its airport catering business next year. Forte shares closed 7 off at 230p in turnover of 4.8m. Institutional presentations by Granada were said to be carrying a bullish message on current trading. The shares gained 8 to 453p. The surprise dividend announcement by Glaxo that gave such a boost to the share price a week ago was helping again. Glaxo goes ex at a higher than expected 22p dividend on Monday and buying for that payout lifted the shares 8 to 644p on turnover of 11m shares. The rest of the sector was held back ahead of the publication of the Clinton healthcare reforms next Wednesday. Speculation that President Clinton will only adjust excise taxes marginally when he reveals his healthcare reforms next week helped spirit stocks. Guinness jumped 7 1/2 to 465p. Strong two-way business in conglomerate BTR pushed turnover to 11m as the shares hardened 2 to 375p. Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson were reported to be positive on BICC following a presentation and the shares firmed 3 to 412p. Morgan Crucible were bought ahead of figures on Monday and the shares rose 4 to 301p. Profit-taking in Kwik-Fit following well-received interims earlier in the week sent the shares down 2 1/2 to 170p. MB Caradon firmed 7 to 330p after an egm approved its acquisition of most of the Pillar business from mining group RTZ. RTZ hardened 2 to 688p. Among the oil exploration and production groups, Lasmo held up against a downgrade by the US house Kidder Peabody. The brokerage said that once all non-recurring items were stripped out, Lasmo's first half profits were very disappointing. Kidder is now forecasting a full-year earnings per share loss off 5p against a previous estimate of a 5.8p gain. Lasmo shares closed a penny stronger at 135p. Hazlewood Foods advanced following Thursday's positive agm statement. The shares closed 7 ahead at 180p.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / King Hussein urges reforms in Iraq KING HUSSEIN of Jordan has distanced himself from the regime of President Saddam Hussein in unprecedented terms, saying there must be change in Iraq. He also spoke for the first time last night about his cancer condition. In a television address to his people, the 56-year-old king made pointed reference to fears he might be dying, saying 'a vibrant nation cannot be measured by the life of an individual'. King Hussein - who has been on the throne for 40 years - returned home in September after cancer surgery in the US. Last night he said he would need more tests to confirm he had been cured. 'One recognises that every living soul will meet its destined end,' he said. 'When the time comes no hour could be postponed or brought forward.' One diplomat in Amman observed: 'After his personal doctor had said that the problem had cleared up, the fact that he has to have further tests is not good news . . . it will stir up much talk.' In an interview in Amman with the Financial Times, the king insisted his opposition to the US-led war to oust Iraq from Kuwait - a stance that won him popular acclaim at home - was 'well justified'. However, he said he was now worried that Iraq faced the threat of fragmentation and 'has moved towards becoming almost a pre-industrial state'. 'In that context, I would like to be absolutely clear that I am not, nor was I ever, ready to link Jordan, or myself . . . to the possibility of an association with a group in power that might eventually go down in history as partially responsible, if not totally responsible, for the destruction of Iraq, or its fragmentation, and the real disaster that would follow in terms of this region.' During his television broadcast the king, in an apparent reference to Mr Saddam, cautioned against 'tyranny' and 'ambitious renegades', but otherwise made no direct mention of Iraq. His remarks echoed the frustration felt by senior Jordanians that Baghdad has given scant credit to Jordan for the international isolation it suffered during the Gulf crisis and has ignored Amman's appeals for changes in policy. 'There has to be a realisation of what is at stake. There has to be change. I don't think anyone can bring that about but the Iraqi people themselves and hopefully they will be helped to attain that,' the king said. Respect for human rights, pluralism and democracy were required as a 'guarantee against the shocks taking place'.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pensions review expected soon PLANS for the promised review of pension law and regulation would be announced very soon after the Commons reassembles from the spring recess early next month, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday. Both Mr Major and Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, came under pressure from Tory and Labour MPs for an early statement or debate on the plight of the Maxwell pensioners. Mr Major said he thought everyone would sympathise with the Maxwell pensioners, 'but until it is a little clearer what precisely went wrong, we cannot sensibly say what should be done to put it right'. The prospect of a pensioners' lobby of MPs on June 8 led MPs to urge that the government should make clear its position a few days in advance. However Mr Newton said merely that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, would want to respond as soon as possible to the report from the social security committee and announce the terms of reference for the review. The cross-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners is planning to meet in the week before the pensioners' lobby. But consensus about the need to help the pensioners broke down when Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, claimed that Labour had not wanted a debate on the Maxwell affair before the election. Mr John Cunningham, the shadow leader of the Commons, rebuked Mr Shaw for making 'typically inaccurate, indeed reckless, comments'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Fedorov "New Homes for Health-Care </F> Workers"]    [Text] Two new health-care facilities have opened. A modern  seven-story building was constructed for Municipal Polyclinic  129, which serves residents of the former Bauman district. It is  equipped with the latest in medical technology, including  ultrasound diagnostic and hydrotherapy equipment and a wonderful  stomatological and dental clinic. Since the old building still  houses a trauma center, a "steering" committee, and a number of  other amenities, Polyclinic 129 can be characterized as a modern  medical facility.    Muscovites received another gift in the form of a modern  Family Planning Center that has individual natal rooms as well  as suites where happy mothers can stay with their newborns. It  also boasts a natal unit with the latest word in intensive-care  equipment. No other natal center in Moscow has one.    The Family Planning Center was built in just a year by the  Turkish company Enka, which donated its services.</p>

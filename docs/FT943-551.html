			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sales recovery helps put Marzotto back in black Marzotto, Italy's largest textile and clothing group, yesterday forecast a 'considerable increase' in full-year profits, after a return to profitability in the first half of 1994. The company, which is seeking to increase its exports, has begun to reap the benefits of a weak lira and gradual economic recovery. It reported group consolidated net profit of L9.8bn (Dollars 6.3m) for the first six months of this year, against a loss of L5.2bn in the equivalent period last year. Operating profits rose 50 per cent to L76.4bn. Marzotto's thread, yarn and textiles divisions were the main contributors to the recovery, but the clothing division also lifted profits. In 1993, Marzotto relied on a strong contribution from Hugo Boss, the German menswear company it controls, to offset disappointing results from the Italian market. However, in the first six months of this year, the company said the Italian clothing activities had also shown a 'slight improvement', as the decline in domestic consumer demand bottomed out. Group sales for the first six months of 1994 rose to L986bn, against L959bn last time.</p>

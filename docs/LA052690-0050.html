			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> CARLSON KEEPS HIS COOL IN HIGH JUMP VICTORY  </P> <P> At 6-foot-4 and just under 130 pounds, Kevin Carlson of Katella High School has  a physical stature of a human knitting needle. An intimidating presence, he is  not.  </P> <P> But Friday night at the Southern Section Masters meet at Cerritos College,  Carlson kept cool when the others couldn't, winning the high jump with a leap  of 6 feet 9 3/4 inches.  </P> <P> Although it was not a personal best -- Carlson leads the state at 6-11 3/4, a  leap made in a dual meet against Esperanza -- it was a significant improvement  over last year. In 1989, Carlson did not even make it to the Masters meet and  finished the season with a best of 6-5 1/2.  </P> <P> Five jumpers, including Carlson, had cleared 6-8 Friday when the bar was raised  to 6-10. While no one else came close, Carlson cleared the height on his second  attempt. The bar was later measured at 6-9 3/4.  </P> <P> Carlson then attempted 7-0, but couldn't clear it.  </P> <P> "I got close (on the second attempt), but it's pretty hard to tell. It's pretty  high up there," Carlson said. "I'm going to go for it in the state meet."  </P> <P> Carlson was one of five Orange County athletes to win a field event. And 30  Orange County athletes and one relay team qualified for the state  championships, scheduled for June 1 and 2 at Cerritos College, by placing in  the top five of their events.  </P> <P> Esperanza junior Mark Parlin won the boys' shotput with a mark of 60-3 1/2  after qualifying in the discus with a fourth-place throw of 175-4. Parlin, who  leads the Southern Section shotput list at 61-4, will now get the chance to  meet high school star Brent Noon of Fallbrook at the state meet. Noon has put  the shot 76-2 this season, the second best effort on the all-time high school  list.  </P> <P> "I just want a good series next week, like I had last week (in the divisional  finals)," said Parlin, who Friday night had only one toss more than 60 feet. "I  really wasn't into the throwing mode yet."  </P> <P> Dana Hills' Andy Marrone knew the feeling. Marrone, who set a 4-A discus record  (192-1) last week, won that event on his first throw, 184-1.  </P> <P> And Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith, the national leader in the triple jump at  51-0 3/4, won that event on his first attempt (49-8 1/2). Then, as has often  been his habit this season, Singbandith passed on the rest of his jumps --  keeping a close watch on the competition all the while -- to avoid risk of  injury.  </P> <P> Villa Park's Beth Byron won the girls' high jump at 5-6, then passed at 5-7  before missing all three jumps at 5-8.  </P> <P> In the running events, Edison sophomore Shelley Taylor finished second in the  1,600 -- an event she won here last year -- with a time of 4 minutes 55.50  seconds. Taylor ran shoulder to shoulder with favorite Karen Hecox of South  Hills for most of the race, staying 20-30 yards behind Deena Drossin of Agoura.  Drossin set a fast pace from the gun, and looked strong until the final 100  meters where Taylor and Hecox began to reel her in. But Drossin held them off,  winning in 4:54.71. Hecox was third in 4:55.82.  </P> <P> University's Tanja Brix and Katella's Martha Pinto had career-best times in the  girls' 3,200. Brix, who was in sixth with 200 meters to go, passed three  runners around the final turn to finish third in 10:50.10 -- erasing four  seconds from her previous record. Pinto, in fifth with a lap to go, dropped to  sixth but then powered past Lucinda Reyes of Lakewood to regain fifth in  10:51.29.  </P> <P> In the 100, San Clemente's Tim Martin was third (10.70) and Los Alamitos' Erik  Mitchell was fourth (10.71).  </P> <P> But in the 200, Mitchell's better event, Mitchell was second (21.34) to  Martin's sixth (21.80).  </P> <P> In the hurdles, Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer ran a lifetime best 42.98 to place  third in the 300 hurdles. La Quinta freshman Elinor Tolson qualified for the  state meet by taking fourth in the 100 hurdles (14.56), and Dave Fair of El  Toro was fourth in the 300 hurdles (38.46).  </P> <P> Esperanza's girls 1,600-meter relay team finished n fourth in 3:52.93, a county  best this year, on the strength of Nikki Jackson's third leg and Lynn Murray's  anchor leg.  </P> <P> Other state meet qualifiers included: Kendall Welsey of Katella (fourth in the  400 at 48.78), El Modena's Mike Terry (third in 800, 1:54.29), Esperanza's  Clayton Tharrington (second in triple jump, 48-0 1/4), Valencia's Josiah  Williams (fourth in long jump, 22-7 3/4), and Mark Kinney (third in shotput,  55-6 3/4, Dana Hills' Matt Jordan (55-5 1/2 in the shotput), Loara's Albert  Avila (fifth in discus, 175-4); Estancia's Debbie Hargrove (third in discus,  143-10) and Marie Midland (fifth at 133-10), Mater Dei's Melissa McDonald  (third in long jump, 17-9), Mission Viejo's Lisa Fager (second in triple jump,  38-5 3/4) and Tammy Graham (fifth, 37-8), Santa Ana Valley's Joanna Alo (third  in shot put, 41-7 3/4), Esperanza's Nikki Jackson (fourth in 300 hurdles,  44.37) and Mission Viejo's Kristin Dunn (fifth in shotput, 40-9).  </P></p>

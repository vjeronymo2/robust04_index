			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marino de Medici: "Gorazde: Massacre Away From </F> Television Cameras"]    [Text] Washington -- The American television big shots,  protected by their bulletproof vests, and the television cameras  focusing with frightening clarity on the destruction and  suffering caused by the Serbs' weapons were nowhere to be seen  in Gorazde.    Gorazde fell in the worst possible way, with a tragic  admission of importance [as published] by the United Nations and  the United States, and a victory for the Serbs which is not only  strategic but also psychological. The American public saw no  roads spattered with blood, did not hear the heart-rending cries  of maimed children, and felt no compassion for the civilians  prey to despair, as in Sarajevo. The White House was spared the  embarrassment of having to respond in some way to yet another  wave of denouncements and an angry appeal to "do something." A  group of Americans has accused Clinton of having declared  "neutrality in the presence of another massacre." For their  part, television news programs reported the fall of Gorazde and  the conclusions being drawn from the Serbs' display of military  and political might -- first and foremost, the fact that the  United Nations cannot do anything in Bosnia without the Serbs'  cooperation.    In the absence of another cry of pain from the vast mass of  Americans, the Clinton administration can now devote itself to  salvaging what little there is still to salvage in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indeed, the choice between capitulation and  a more intensive bombardment campaign now seems to have  disappeared. Beset, as he is, by domestic problems and by the  Whitewater affair, the Democratic President cannot take the risk  of a strategy of further limited and therefore ineffective  interventions, which would open up a new front of broad  disagreement within the United States. Indeed, Clinton and his  advisers are particularly worried about a strong current of  rebellion on the part of those who cannot accept Butrus-Ghali's  acting on behalf of the United States. In fact it was the  administration itself that gave this impression when it defended  the attacks on the Serb positions as a measure designed to  protect UN personnel. In fact the objective of the bombardments  was to halt the offensive of the Serbs, who are determined to  achieve their ends by means of brute force and ethnic cleansing.  But Clinton did not have the courage to say so openly.    If America's strategy had ever contemplated the possibility  of intervention, Washington should have prepared some time ago  to send a contingent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a move now  would condemn the Clinton administration. For his part,  Butrus-Ghali reached the conclusion some time ago that without a  leading U.S. role, the UN operations in the former Yugoslavia  will be very inconclusive.</p>

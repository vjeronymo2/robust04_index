			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara -- Interior Minister Nahit Mentese  announced that Russia was prepared to help Turkey put an end to  the terrorist activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    The two-day talks, chaired by Mentese and Russian Interior  Minister Victor F. Yerin, were concluded on Thursday, the  Anatolia news agency reported.    Turkey and Russia agreed on the measures to be taken against  terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, according to  Mentese. "Both sides aim at enhancing their present cooperation  in matters of security, and we decided to hold a joint  commission meeting as soon as possible," Mentese disclosed.    Meanwhile, Yerin announced that Turkey and Russia had agreed  to struggle against crime in all its forms.    In response to a question about the link between the PKK and  Armenia, Yerin announced that Russia and Armenia had been trying  to reach an agreement on the issue of anti-terrorism. "Russia  respects Armenia's sovereignty.    Turkey and Armenia have had contacts recently, and,  furthermore, Turkey was among the countries sending humanitarian  aid to Armenia. The improvement of relations between Turkey and  Armenia would not harm Russia's interests. Russia and Armenia  are currently enjoying friendly relations," Yerin stated.    "Moreover, the Kurdish conference in Moscow will not effect  Russian-Turkish relations," Yerin said in response to another  question. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: US telecoms group close to European deal AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Unisource, a consortium of European telecoms operators, are thought to be close to announcing a joint venture aimed at Europe's telecommunications market, writes Alan Cane. The telecoms industry has been expecting the move since AT&amp;T and Unisource became partners in the US company's Worldsource venture earlier this year. Worldsource involves no equity exchange, but is an attempt by AT&amp;T to marshall leading operators to help provide its international business services. Worldsource is strong in the Asia-Pacific region where its partners include Singapore Telecom and Telstra, the Australian operator, but weak in Europe.</p>

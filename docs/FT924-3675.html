			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / (CORRECTED) How To Spend It: Games for grown-ups - A look at what's available for computer buffs Correction (published 12th December 1992) appended to this article. THE recreational possibilities of the personal computer continue to develop in many directions. The kids have their Nintendo and their Sega video and computer games galore - see the latter's Sonic the Hedgehog, a smash-hit worldwide - but what about mum, who is a bridge addict, and dad, who fancies himself as a wiz at backgammon? Adult card and board game players now have a wide choice of programs that provide entertaining, formidable opposition. One way of adding games to your computer's repertory is to apply to a Shareware mail order outlet - advertised widely in computer magazines - and to request a few games programs, of which a great many are offered. These will be sent on a trial basis for as little as Pounds 1-2 each. Then, if you find a program useful and want to stay with it, you pay a fee to the author. Another way is to buy one of the many entertainments packages on offer from software manufacturers. Not only bridge but other traditional card games - cribbage, gin rummy, poker, solo, and several varieties of patience - are available as are most casino gambling games: blackjack, baccarat, roulette, boule and keno. Programs for individual games or collections, in the form of one or more diskettes with a user's manual, cost between Pounds 30-50. Microsoft has just released its Entertainment Pack for Windows Volume 4 at Pounds 34.95. This contains a nice assortment of pastimes old and new: chess, Tic-Tac-Drop and Dr Black Jack alongside new games called JessBall, Maxwell's Maniac (]) and Go Figure - a race to solve mathematical equations. Solitaire (patience) players will appreciate another American program, Games Master for Windows (Centron Software, Pounds 34.95): this contains two favourite patience games, Pyramid and Yukon. It also has a series of puzzles involving domino tiles, and the sliding and manipulation of shapes. In one, the player has to re-assemble a picture by Picasso. This is a good package for those who do not want anything over-complicated. By contrast, Electronic Arts (90 Heron Drive, Langley, Berkshire SL3 8XP) has a range that extends from outdoor sport - like the Team USA Basketball program that has just come out - to popular fiction. You can go sleuthing in an elaborate contest with The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes (Pounds 39.99), or you can become Tolkien's Frodo and explore Middle Earth in Interplay's Lord of the Rings, Volume I and II (Pounds 29.99 and Pounds 34.99). Great efforts are made by games programmers to simulate the authentic ambience through colour graphics and sound bytes. The latest bridge program from Oxford Software, Omar Sharif's Bridge (Pounds 39.99), includes - for those with the requisite hardware - the voice of Omar himself to talk you through the rubber in an on-disc tutorial. There are also, as in more mundane bridge programs, a number of playing options including the use of Acol and the Five Card Majors bidding conventions. Oxford Software (198 The Hill, Burford, OX18 4HX) specialises in traditional adult games. It also has Backgammon Royale (Pounds 24.99) and an all-in-one package that includes five classical games under the overall title Intelligent Strategy (Pounds 34.99). Unlike the Omar Sharif, these programs are non-Windows; all are compatible with IBM PC, Atari ST(E) and Amiga. Chess programs are still leaders in the board games' field and they continue to develop playing skills at higher and higher levels, out-performing many strong club players. The latest program, the Chess Machine, available from the London Chess Centre - at a cool Pounds 549.95] - is the brain-child of a Dutch programmer called Ed Schroeder and is making quite a stir in the professional chess world. It is a halfway house between a pure software program and a dedicated chess computer. I sat in while an international master, Malcolm Pein, played three five-minute blitz games against it. The final score was one win each and a draw. For the chess computer buff with limited funds - most of us, in fact - there is the M-Chess program at Pounds 77 and also the versatile German Fritz program at the bargain price of Pounds 34.95, the original version which remains extremely good value. A new version, Fritz 2, has just been released at Pounds 76.95 (or Pounds 44.95 for an up-grade). I find the most convenient way to play chess on screen is with a diagram-style board; but the 3-D option with Staunton or other solid-looking chessmen graphics is also on offer in many programs - as it is for backgammon, reversi and draughts. The most ornate graphic display for chess is Interplay's Battlechess (Pounds 29.00) in which each piece is represented by a different military figure. When moved, the piece walks to its new position and, when taken, engages in an elaborate duel with the opposing piece. It is a fine spectacle even if it does not have all that much to do with the game of chess. When games programmers turn their attention from indoor to outdoor sports, they really exert themselves in an attempt to reconstruct the playing environment with maximum verisimilitude. Nowhere is this more so than in the game of golf. Microsoft's Golf for Windows has just come out at Pounds 49. Its graphics waft you to the Torrey Pines course in San Diego, California, in full colour through your VGA. You can add more courses later. The PGA Golf Tour program for Windows (Pounds 34.99, from Electronic Arts) gives you an initial choice of four different championship courses in the US and - for those with sound facilities - the bird-song and other wildlife noises likely to be encountered while playing on them. You start in the pro shop where you sign on for the round with your playing partners. These may be your friends or golf professionals whose strokes will be played by the computer. You also choose the composition of your bag of clubs. Strokes in both versions are made by three pressings in quick succession on the mouse button. The first controls your backswing, measured on a scale from zero to 100 percent. The second pressing reverses the direction of the swing, and the third represents the moment of contact with the ball. Your ball is then shown hurtling through the air and landing. A message flashes on screen giving the length of shot, the lie of the ball and its relation to the flag. Then your invisible caddy will recommend you a club for your next shot. When you reach the green, the putting surface is shown in a 3-D model that can be revolved so that the ball may be studied from different angles. Both programs are wonderfully ingenious but, after a while when the novelty has worn off, non-golfers may find them a shade repetitious. A much simpler games program without any gimmickry - like a good backgammon - is, I find, more addictive in the long run. For those ambitious people who want to have a go at writing their own programs or developing existing ones, Microsoft's Visual Basic for Windows has a DIY book: Visual Basic - Game Programming for Windows by Michael J. Young (from Grey Matter 0364-53449, and other Microsoft stockists). Its 500 pages contains histories of the games and hints on playing strategy, as well as all the technical information about programming. The printed matter comes with a disc that includes a dozen games that are ready to run: puzzles, board games and gambling games. Ludo is one. It represents an advanced animation technique that, in the words of the author, 'lets you move a full-color, non-rectangular object over any type of background without disturbing this background.' Good luck with your games. The Software Circus, 282 High Holborn, tel: 071-404-4492 (and branches at other locations in central London), has a good selection of entertainment software discs, arranged under systems with which they are compatible. The London Chess Centre, 169 Euston Road, tel: 071-388-2404, will give demonstrations by appointment of its chess programs and stocks other games programs from Oxford Softworks. WindowLine (123 Westmead Road, Sutton, SM1 4JH tel: 081-642-227), has a mail order service for Windows' games software and publishes a regular catalogue and newsletter. The headquarters of Centron Software, strong on games for Macintosh computers, is at 1500 NW 3rd Street, Number 101, Deerfield Beach, Florida 33442, United States. CORRECTION The Chess Centre, which Anthony Curtis mentioned in his piece on computer games last week and which stocks many games, including a series of chess programs from Oxford Softworks, is at 369 Euston Road, London and not 169 as printed last week.

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg plans SKr1.2bn rights issue TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday became the fifth large Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the past two weeks when it unveiled plans to raise SKr1.2bn (Dollars 149m) from shareholders to cut debts. It also aims to sell its Munksjo paper and packaging unit, or float it on the stock exchange, in a move which could raise several billion kronor. The group also wants to sell its remaining shares in Svedala, the mineral processing and transport unit. The plans were announced as the group sank deeply into the red with a first-half loss after financial items of SKr796m, against a SKr117m profit in the same 1992 period. Depressed metal prices led to a fall in turnover, to SKr10.97m from SKr11.55bn, while there was an operating loss of SKr131m, against a SKr29m profit. Trelleborg said in July it planned to cut debts by SKr3bn over the next 12 months. The issue will be on a one-for-two basis at SKr30 per share.</p>

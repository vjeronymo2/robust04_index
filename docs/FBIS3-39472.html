			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nimr Hammad, PLO representative in Italy, by </F> Barbara Stefanelli on 14 February; place not given: "`Italy:  PLO Must Not Close Down'"]    [Text] "Peace has passed through Italy many times. It is  here that we have met and here that we learned to talk to each  other. It is 20 years, you know, 20 years of work on this shore  of the Mediterranean. Did you know that from 1974 through the  great changes of 1993 many of the Arab and Israeli protagonists  first met in your country? It is for the sake of all this that  we are now saying: The Palestinian Embassy in Rome must not  close."    Nimr Hammad, the PLO representative in Italy, would really  rather not do so ("we have our pride"), but is being forced to  request help. When he returned to his office yesterday morning  at the end of the weekend, there was a letter from ENEL  [National Electric Power Board] waiting for him on his desk:  The line will be cut off within a matter of hours unless  several months of debts are paid off "immediately."    [Stefanelli] Does your headquarters in Tunis not help you?  Or has it issued an order for you to close?    [Hammad] We can no longer pay the rent, expense, and staff  wages. Our 12 staff have not been paid since last summer. The  point is that it is not our problem alone: The economic crisis  is affecting the whole PLO. I have just spoken by telephone  with Chairman 'Arafat, and he expressed to me his personal  regret and sadness. But there are no funds either for Rome or  for the other embassies around the world.    [Stefanelli] Rome is closing down, with the offices in  Africa  and Scandinavia. Paris, London, and Brussels are remaining  open. Would you say, perhaps, that Italy has become a less  important crossroads for international diplomacy?    [Hammad] Oh, no, definitely not. Paris and London were in  danger of closing, too. But at the last moment some benefactors  -- Palestinians or Arabs -- intervened and paid their bills.  Unfortunately our community in Italy is not so wealthy. As for  Brussels, it was the European Parliament that salvaged us.    Here in Rome many people have promised to help us, but  ultimately we received something only from the trade unions --  the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and the CISL  [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions]. It is thanks to their  support that we have managed to keep going since May, when the  crisis occurred. What can we do now? We can hope that your  government will allow us not to pay the rent and telephone bills  for a transitional period. Or we could use a special loan, which  the PLO would pledge to repay when the Palestinian state is  formed, when we have our own taxes, regular revenue.    [Stefanelli] How long will it take before this regular  revenue starts coming in?    [Hammad] I would say six or seven months. Four months from  when the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho really begins,  then another three months in which to organize ourselves. It  must not be thought that the moment 'Arafat sets foot in  Palestine everything will work perfectly and at once. We must  expect a period of instability. But then we will settle our  debts. Funds envisaged by the World Bank and other financial  institutions must also be released. This is a temporary lack of  money.    [Stefanelli] But did Saudi Arabia not resume its funding  after 'Arafat's recent visit to Riyadh?    [Hammad] There has been a rapprochement, but no money.    [Stefanelli] What did the chairman advise you to do when you  spoke on the telephone?    [Hammad] Unless a miracle occurs in the next few days, at  the  end of February I will have to close the office and transfer the  PLO headquarters to my own home. I will try to work from there.  This certainly is a cruel joke: This is all happening at a  time when we Palestinians are preparing to become a state. And  a real state -- no longer in exile -- must strengthen its  embassies.    [Stefanelli] Would a visit by 'Arafat to Italy not help the  "cause" of the Rome office?    [Hammad] It would certainly strengthen us. We are organizing  one, and contacts have already been made with the government in  Tunis. I cannot give you a date, but it is not far away.  [Hammad ends]    With or without 'Arafat, the race against time has begun.  The PLO, at the very time when it is marching toward peace, has  two weeks in which to avoid closing the doors of its Italian  home.</p>

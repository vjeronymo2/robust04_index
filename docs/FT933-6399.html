			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: VW unlikely to break even this year - Results from European carmakers reflect the turmoil in the industry VOLKSWAGEN is unlikely to meet its goal of break-even in the current year without the help of extraordinary income, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chairman of the group's managing board, has told a German newspaper. In the interview in today's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Ferdinand Piech added that there is a possibility that the group will omit a dividend on its ordinary shares in 1993. Last year's dividend was DM2 per share, cut from DM11 in 1991. The Volkswagen senior management has for several months confidently forecast the group would be back in the black by the year end. The group lost DM1.6bn (Dollars 940m) in the first six months of 1993, a DM2bn reversal from the profit of DM445m made in the first half of last year. Turnover for the half-year was DM38.4bn against DM43.75bn in the comparable period. Volkswagen said the result represented a considerable reduction in losses in the second quarter. In the first quarter of the year the group lost DM1.25bn: losses for April to June were by comparison a modest DM350m. The board said it was working hard to achieve the 'turning point' in profitability in the second half. The group made a small profit in July and Volkswagen said it would strive to achieve further monthly profits, but it stopped short of saying that the group would break even for the the year as a whole. A letter to shareholders praised Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's purchasing chief who joined the German group from arch rival General Motors earlier this year, for his role in helping to reduce losses despite the disastrous economic environment. Volkswagen said that worldwide production dropped 19 per cent to 1.5m vehicles in the six month period, whilst deliveries to customers dropped 13 per cent to 1.61m units. For the Volkswagen marque, deliveries to customers fell 11.1 per cent; deliveries of the luxury Audi marque dropped 27.3 per cent and SEAT by 22.7 per cent. The only marque to increase sales was the Czech-based Skoda division where unit sales rose by 23.1 per cent. VW predicted that it would sell 3.2m vehicles for the year as a whole. Capital investments in the group for the six months fell by 38 per cent to DM2.68bn. The loss for the Volkswagen parent company in the first half was DM946m.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: GEOWORKS GETS A LOT MORE FROM LESS POWER  </P> <P> GeoWorks, a 50-person software company based in Berkeley, is about to release  GeoWorks Ensemble, a set of programs and an exciting new graphical user  interface for IBM PCs and compatibles. The product, which will be unveiled this  evening in Boston, should be available in November.  </P> <P> Because of its modest hardware requirements, GeoWorks will be of particular  interest to people with older machines as well as budget-minded computer  shoppers who are looking for an easy-to-use environment that runs on low-cost  equipment. The product is aimed at the home and small-business market. But even  users of more powerful machines will appreciate GeoWorks' simplicity, speed and  excellent graphics.  </P> <P> In general, GeoWorks is similar to what is already available on the Apple  Macintosh or on IBM compatibles running Microsoft Windows. You start programs  by using a mouse to click on their icons, or pictures. Commands are issued via  pull-down menus. You use the mouse to select text or graphics to be copied,  deleted or moved. And data can be easily moved from one program to another.  What's more, it's possible to run more than one program at a time, each in its  own window and switch from program to program with a click of the mouse.  GeoWorks will have a suggested retail price of $195.  </P> <P> Unlike Windows, GeoWorks works on virtually any IBM PC as long as it has a hard  disk, a graphic display and at least 512 kilobytes of memory. Windows requires  a PC with at least 1 megabyte of memory and an Intel 286, 386 or 486 central  processing unit. As a result, most machines in use today are not able to run  Windows.  </P> <P> My only complaint about GeoWorks is that it doesn't allow you to create macros,  which allow you to assign your own series of keystrokes to commands. GeoWorks  plans to add a macro feature to a future version.  </P> <P> GeoWorks starts off with a "Welcome" screen with three icons. A click on the  Appliances icon takes you to an area where you can use any of four basic and  easy-to-use programs: a calculator, an address book, a personal  calendar/planner and a note pad. The Professional icon takes you to the  GeoManager, with icons for eight additional programs: word processing,  computer-to-computer communications, drawing, personal calendar, address book,  note pad, calculator and a program to connect with America Online, an  easy-to-use on-line information service. It's also where you perform routine  file maintenance such as copying, deleting and moving files or creating  directories.  </P> <P> The final icon on the Welcome screen takes you to an area where you can start  regular MS-DOS programs that do not use the GeoWorks interface.  </P> <P> GeoWorks' word processing program, called GeoWrite, is both easy to use and  sophisticated. It compares favorably to stand-alone word-processing programs  that sell for more than twice the cost of the entire GeoWorks package. As with  all GeoWorks programs, its typefaces can be displayed or printed at any size.  </P> <P> The "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) environment displays your margins,  headers, footers and page breaks. GeoWrite supports color and multiple columns  on screen. You can create and store paragraph styles and ruler settings for use  on subsequent documents.  </P> <P> Text editing is similar to what you'll find on Macintosh and Windows  word-processing programs. To modify text, you select it with the mouse and  perform an operation such as copying it to the clipboard, deleting it or  changing its appearance.  </P> <P> The drawing program, called GeoDraw, is also reasonably sophisticated. You can  use it to draw lines, circles, rectangles and other shapes in black and white  or color. Any graphic created in GeoDraw can be pasted into GeoWrite or any  other GeoWorks application. Drawing programs, unlike painting programs, allow  you to create and manipulate objects so that any portion can be resized,  deleted or moved without affecting other parts.  </P> <P> The communications program, called GeoComm, is pretty basic but it's good  enough for most users who want to sign on to an on-line service such as  CompuServe, GEnie or MCI Mail. Another GeoWorks program is designed to sign on  to America Online, which provides news, information, electronic mail and other  services. America Online costs $5.95 a month plus a minimum of $5 per hour.  </P> <P> GeoPlanner, the personal calendar program, and GeoDex, which stores phone  numbers and addresses, are very basic and easy to use. The two programs can  work together to both look up a person's number and dial the telephone if your  PC is equipped with a modem.  </P> <P> The company, according to its president, Brian Dougherty, is encouraging other  software companies to develop additional GeoWorks programs, including a  spreadsheet and database management system.  </P> <P> GeoWorks is located at 2125 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, Calif. 94704. Phone: (415)  644-0883.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the authors cannot  respond individually to letters. Write to P.O. Box 620477, Woodside, Calif.  94062, or contact the L. Magid account on the MCI electronic mail system.  </P></p>

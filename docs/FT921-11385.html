			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Haughey to stand down as Irish PM: Reynolds and Ahern move to the front in Fianna Fail leadership race A POTENTIALLY divisive race for the Irish premiership was set in train yesterday following the resignation of Mr Charles Haughey as prime minister and Fianna Fail party leader over a 1982 telephone-tapping scandal. He announced his decision at a parliamentary meeting of his Fianna Fail party, saying: 'I have decided that to end the present political uncertainty, the time has come for me to hand over to a new leader who will have the opportunity to further advance the best interests of the country and the people and to build on the achievements of recent years.' Mr Haughey was presented with an ultimatum last week by his junior coalition partner, the Progressive Democrat party, either to resign or face a general election. He will formally hand over the party leadership at a parliamentary group meeting next Thursday, at which a new leader will be elected. Mr Haughey will remain prime minister until the following sitting of parliament on February 11. The Progressive Democrats are expected to support Fianna Fail's choice of new leader. Mr Albert Reynolds, a 56-year-old former finance minister who was sacked by Mr Haughey for heading a leadership challenge last November, is the leading candidate in the succession stakes and has strong backbench support. But hopes that his candidacy would go unchallenged were dashed yesterday when it became clear that Mr Bertie Ahern, the new finance minister, would also stand. A number of Fianna Fail backbenchers said Mr Ahern's candidacy could lead to an acrimonious struggle for leadership of the party. On Wednesday Mr Ahern presented a Budget of sweeping tax reforms, which were widely welcomed by business and trade unions alike. Mr Ahern, 40, has not formally declared his decision to stand, but last night Mr Brian Lenihan, a former presidential candidate and close friend of Mr Haughey, said: 'Mr Ahern will be standing. I am confirming this to you now.' The two potential rivals are close friends and hold similar views on economic policy. They met last night to discuss the leadership race. There are two further contenders: Mrs Mary O'Rourke, health minister, and Mr Michael Woods, agriculture minister. Mrs O'Rourke is Mr Lenihan's sister and a supporter of reforms to Ireland's social legislation on issues such as divorce and women's rights. Luck finally runs out for the great survivor, Page 2</p>

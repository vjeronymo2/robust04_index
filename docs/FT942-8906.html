			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Anglo Irish Bank improves by 39% A return to profitability from its London-based operations helped Anglo Irish Bank Corporation raise profits by 39 per cent from IPounds 4.44m to IPounds 6.15m (Pounds 5.99m) pre-tax for the six months to March 31. Mr Gerry Murphy, chairman, said the performance reflected 'the focused strategic approach of the bank'. Prospects for the next six months were encouraging. Mr Murphy said the bank would continue to focus on medium sized corporate and professional business, with a wide sectoral spread. He expected full year profits to be above last year's IPounds 9.25m. After-tax profits for the half year rose 40 per cent, from IPounds 3.29m to IPounds 4.61m. Earnings per share were 2.6p (2.39p) and an unchanged interim dividend of 1.36p is declared. In the UK, quality loan demand rose significantly and the acquisition of the Chemical Bank UK loan book last autumn contributed to profitability. Overall lending rose by 4 per cent, reflecting slack demand in Ireland. The chairman commented, however: 'The lending division performed very well. Margins were maintained and bad debts contained.' Deposits were up to IPounds 1.04bn, an 8.5 per cent rise on the year end figure and 22 per cent higher than at March 31 1993. Capital resources rose to more than IPounds 174m in the period, with the combined impact of the recent IPounds 58m rights issue and the addition of IPounds 23m in tier two capital via the issue of subordinated loan stock.</p>

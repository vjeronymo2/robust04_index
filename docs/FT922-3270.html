			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Chip trade war THE US is supposed to be in favour of the market economy and hostile to 'Japan Incorporated'. Judged, however, by the US-Japanese agreement on trade in semi-conductors, the US is, in fact, against the market economy, but in support of Japan Incorporated. Naturally, that is not how the US-Japanese agreement to raise the share of foreign companies in the Japanese chip market to 20 per cent is explained. But how, other than as a violation of market principles, should pressure on Japanese companies to respond to a political fiat be described? And how might such an agreement be implemented, other than via a purchasing cartel amongst Japanese semi-conductor users? The US seems to want the Japanese economy to become the kind of centralised, cartelised economy that many Americans complain it already is. But it is not. The long term relationships characteristic of the Japanese economy are not the exploitative cartels US industrialists complain they are. They are often a sensible market response in an uncertain world. The US-Japanese semi-conductor agreement, by contrast, does demand cartelisation, if not outright economic planning. Nor is this merely a crafty ploy to undermine Japanese economic strength. It is rather a way for US industry to offset its own weaknesses. The inevitable failure of an agreement whose fulfilment cannot be guaranteed within a competitive economy increases complaints about Japanese bad faith, thereby augmenting the tensions it is supposed to lower. The lesson of US frustration with this accord is not that it should be implemented with greater vigour; it is that the agreement should never have been made in the first place.</p>

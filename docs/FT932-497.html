			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Gloom surrounds Italian wage talks MR GINO GIUGNI, Italy's labour minister, warned that crucial talks between employers and trade unions on a new wage bargaining system had got off to a difficult final week yesterday, with employers determined to get a favourable agreement. The talks, which the government wants to conclude by Monday, have faltered on difficulties in bridging differences over simplifying the bargaining system and increasing labour flexibility. Mr Giugni said: 'The chances of reaching an agreement. . . have gone down.' He said yesterday's meeting between ministers and the Confindustria employers' federation had 'gone badly'. The government would present a compromise document later this week.</p>

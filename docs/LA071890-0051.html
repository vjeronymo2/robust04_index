			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN SLAIN ON WAY TO VACATION WITH FAMILY  </P> <P> A West Covina man bound for a family vacation in Hawaii was fatally shot  Tuesday as he waited for an airport shuttle bus with his wife, their daughter  and two grandchildren, authorities said.  </P> <P> Raymond G. Shield, 61, was pronounced dead shortly after the 5 a.m. attack  outside a Holiday Inn, where he and his family were planning to catch a bus to  Los Angeles International Airport, West Covina police said.  </P> <P> His wife, 57, their daughter, 32, and the two grandchildren, both 8, were  unhurt.  </P> <P> Detectives were investigating the possibility that the shooting on East Garvey  Avenue was the result of a robbery attempt, Officer Steve Cook said.  </P> <P> Shield was unloading luggage from his car when two men pulled up behind him in  a pickup truck. They popped the truck's hood, giving the impression they were  having engine problems, and gestured for Shield to come over, Cook said.  </P> <P> "He went over there to see what he could do for them, and from that point on  we're not sure what happened," the officer said.  </P> <P> The three talked for a moment, but when Shield turned to walk away, one of the  men pulled a pistol and fired at him, Cook said. The bullet passed through  Shield's arm and lodged in his abdomen. He was taken to Inter-Community Medical  Center in Covina, where he died.  </P> <P> The two men, both thought to be in their early 20s, climbed back into the truck  and sped away.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the vehicle as a late-model Nissan pickup, black or navy  blue, with chrome wheels and a slightly lowered chassis. A horizontal stripe  was painted on the truck from the doors to the tailgate, police said. An  "Oakley" sunglasses sticker was on the rear window.  </P> <P> "It appeared to be one of those random things that just happen," Cook said.  </P></p>

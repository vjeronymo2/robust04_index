			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Paris slips up over Corsican autonomy THE FRENCH government slipped up on an embarrassing legal banana skin yesterday as a result of its latest attempt to give more autonomy to Corsica, the country's poorest and most violent region. France's Constitutional Council ruled that part of a recently passed law giving more power to Corsican regional government and reforming the island's unrepresentative electoral system, contravenes the French constitution. The new law, which will now have to be revised, wrongly describes Corsicans as a distinct people and a component of France, said the council. The constitution only recognises 'the French people, made up of all French citizens without distinction of origin, race or religion,' it decreed. The ruling comes in response to a complaint to the council by the three opposition parties - the RPR, UDF and UDC - backed by the senate. They turned to the council after the minority Socialist government last month won parliamentary adoption of its Corsican reform plan, thanks to the Communist party's decision to abstain from the vote. Loyalists, who hold the majority on the island, condemned the law for jeopardising their French nationality, while separatists argued that it offered only inadequate autonomy. Mainland French opposition parties resented what they saw as a concession to terrorists and warned that formal recognition of the Corsican people might prompt separatist demands from other disgruntled activists in Brittany, north-west France, and the Basque country, the Pyrenees.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The State of Kuwait and Algeria tonight stressed the  need for preparing the conditions that would restore security  and stability in all the countries of the Gulf region, including  an affirmation to honor the independence and sovereignty of the  State of Kuwait and guarantee its borders, which had been  confirmed by international legitimacy. This was stated in a  joint Kuwaiti-Algerian statement that also included an emphasis  on the need for adherence to the implementation of UN Security  Council resolutions pertaining to the settlement of the issue of  Kuwaiti and other POW's so that the collective conscience of the  Arab peoples would finally leave behind that tragedy.    The statement, issued on the occasion of a visit to Algeria  that ended today by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, in appreciation of Algeria's  clear and firm stance vis-a-vis the sovereignty and independence  of the State of Kuwait.    The statement said that the two sides exchanged views  regarding Arab and international issues of mutual concern. The  statement expressed Algeria and Kuwait's commitment to the Arab  League and UN charters; honoring the territorial integrity and  regional security of states; equality of sovereignty;  inadmissibility of gaining territory by force; settlement of  disputes by peaceful means, and adherence to the principles of  international legitimacy and the precepts of international law.    The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister left  Algeria tonight for Mauritania.    In another development, Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri expressed his amazement tonight at the  misunderstanding about his country's stance regarding the crisis  that resulted from the Iraqi invasion of the State of Kuwait.  He pointed out that the Algerian stance had been clear from the  outset; it demanded an immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from  Kuwait.    The Algerian minister of foreign affairs called for the  reestablishment of Arab solidarity on bases that would take into  consideration the national identity of all the peoples of the  Arab nation and honor the sovereignty of states and their  existing borders.</p>

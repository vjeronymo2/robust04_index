			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thai power company launches flotation roadshow Electricity Generating Co (Egco), which is poised to become Thailand's first privatised power company after months of delays, will launch a roadshow next week to publicise its flotation. Bangkok stockbrokers said yesterday that the company should complete its initial public offering in Nov-ember. Egco, a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat), has successfully arranged Bt14.75bn (Dollars 590m) of debt financing and plans to raise nearly Bt5bn more by selling its shares. Egco stock is expected to begin trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in December or January. The money raised is to fund the purchase of an Egat power station at Rayong, south-east of Bangkok. Egco also has the option of buying the Khanom power station being completed in Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south of the country. In line with the Thai practice of partial privatisation of state enterprises, only 50 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public, with Egat keeping 48 per cent and 2 per cent going to the Crown Property Bureau. Full details of the offering have yet to be released. Brokers say that demand for the shares is likely be strong. The Thai economy is growing at more than 8 per cent a year, and electricity use has been increasing even faster. Furthermore, the pricing formula agreed between Egat and Egco ensures Egco a predictable income because it is based on Egco's usable capacity and not on the amount of electricity actually produced and sent to the grid. Egco executives say they expect their company to take part in future projects by independent power producers (IPPs), although since Egco will still be controlled by Egat it would appear to enjoy an unfair advantage in bidding for concessions to be granted by Egat itself. The World Bank has therefore recommended that Egco be fully privatised. Egat has asked IPPs to propose by February next year power projects to produce 3,800MW in three tranches from 2000 to 2002. By then, Egat and the metropolitan and provincial distribution authorities are expected to have sold some of their equity to private investors. Egat believes that Thailand's demand for electricity, currently around 10,500MW, will rise by about 1,000MW annually over the next few years. The organisation wants the private sector to share the cost of expanding capacity, estimated at about Bt900bn in the next decade.</p>

For two years now, decisions have been adopted on  the need for closer integration within the CIS framework and the  creation of an economic union, which remain nothing more than  good intentions.    As a result of a series of bilateral agreements being signed  in August-October 1992, as well as the multilateral Agreement  "On a Unified Monetary System and Coordinated Monetary, Credit,  and Currency Policy of States Retaining the Ruble As Legal  Tender," the creation of a ruble zone incorporating nine states  was proclaimed. They were: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus,  Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The ruble was acknowledged to be  the only legal tender in states within the ruble zone.    In January 1993, heads of state adopted the decision to set  up the Interstate Ruble Zone Bank, of which all countries in the  ruble zone were founders. It was to carry out multilateral  transactions on a clearing basis. However, agreement was not  reached on two fundamental issues when drafting the bank's  statute: Which ruble would be the common currency -- the  Russian ruble or a supranational ruble -- and how decisions  would be made in the bank's council.    Another agreement -- on practical measures to set up a new  type of ruble zone -- was signed in September 1993 by six  states: In addition to Russia, the signatories were Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan.    In practice, however, Russia's commitment -- declared at  summit level interstate meetings -- to strengthening integration  processes within the CIS framework amounts to transferring  economic relations with the former Soviet republics to its  general system of foreign economic relations.    To a certain extent, these actions by the Russian  authorities  have objective foundation, as the newly independent states are  trying quite hard to obtain raw materials and energy on  preferential terms within the framework of closer economic  cooperation; they are also endeavoring to resolve the problem of  clearing the debt facing Russia in a way that is advantageous to  themselves.    This kind of simplified approach is a breeding ground for  negative attitudes to reintegration in a number of Russian  federal departments, which take an equally simplified view of  protecting Russia's interests, bringing the problem of  equivalent commodity exchange to the fore.    The majority of economists admit that, from the point of  view  of Russia's strategic state interests, in the long term the  policy of reintegration within the CIS framework is the only  right policy to follow, for a whole number of objective reasons.  The most important of these is the need to smooth over the  consequences of the breakup of the USSR in the economic sphere,  as they have considerably aggravated the crisis in all the  states concerned.    Russia has gradually taken an increasingly tough stand on  the question of the ruble zone. Its terms for those wishing to  remain in this zone have become increasingly unacceptable to  them, and this has in fact forced the states which originally  signed the agreements on setting up a new type of ruble zone to  introduce their own currencies.    The explanation for Russia's tough policy given by those who  support it is that it must protect its own economic interests,  as combining the monetary systems of Russia and the other five  states could cause a surge of inflation and an increase in  Russia's trade deficit with these countries; it would also make  it practically impossible for Russia to retrieve debts from  these countries.    There is no doubt that the newly independent states'  different levels of development, supply of natural resources,  and pace of transformations are an objective impediment to the  reintegration of their economies. However, this has never been  a secret to the Russian leadership. Nevertheless, it has not  prevented it from concluding treaties and agreements on economic  integration within the CIS framework....    A fairly recent session of the CIS Coordination and  Consultation Committee essentially announced that the idea of a  ruble zone has been abandoned and that the CIS countries now  recognize each other's national currency. The transition to  multicurrency conditions of operation in the CIS is being  broadly publicized: a free trade zone; a customs union; a  common market of goods, labor, and capital; and a currency and  economic union.    But in the absence of a real money and currency market, the  CIS countries' national currency exchange rates can be for  transfer purposes only and do not in themselves signify the  restoration of equivalent exchange.    Unfortunately, we are seeing a repetition of the old  practice  whereby agreements are signed -- and only then do the parties  involved begin to try to develop a mechanism to implement those  agreements. For example, it has been announced that a payments  union between Russia and Kazakhstan will be formed in the near  future, although no decision has been made regarding a key issue  in the formation of this union: Namely, the question of tying  quotations for Kazakhstan's currency to the dollar or some other  freely convertible currency. Despite the fact that it is  acquiring fundamental importance.    The introduction of national currencies to payment relations  cannot in itself solve the serious problem of balancing mutual  payments and nonpayments. We can hardly expect Russian  enterprises to be interested in obtaining their partners' som or  tenge, with which they certainly will not always be able to  acquire the goods they need in these or in other former Soviet  republics. Consequently, there is a visible prospect of  transactions remaining bilateral in nature and barter being  employed everywhere, which will still further reduce the  market's capacity and make enterprises' activity even more  difficult.    Failure to solve this problem could make mutual payments for  supplies of goods still more complicated and ultimately lead to  a further reduction in commodity exchange. This would mean that  Russia would not receive raw materials and components from the  former republics and at the same time experience difficulties  with the sale of its own products, which, in turn, would lead to  a further decline in Russia's output and, as a consequence of  this, an increase in unemployment and social tension. A policy  of "economic pressure" on Russia's partners in the former Soviet  republics, as some Russian leaders suggest, would hardly help in  this respect. We must also take into account that, if Russia  were to pursue a very tough economic policy in relation to its  partners, sooner or later its place would be taken by other  countries.    Moreover, in order to effectively protect Russia's economy  against negative influences from the former Soviet republics  (the transfer of large amounts of rubles, the reexport of  Russian goods, and so forth), we must urgently equip our borders  with every facility, which seems an unrealistic prospect at  present.    So, the new type of ruble zone has been left behind in the  past. However, the problems in relations between the newly  independent states still remain and are intensifying. The  course of setting up an economic union is now being pursued,  although implementation has been put off for quite some time.  One factor of considerable importance in this respect is that  our CIS partners' confidence in Russian policy has been  undermined as a result of its vagueness and inconsistency.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / January trade surplus rises four-fold to Dollars 3.84bn JAPAN'S trade surplus for January recorded a four-fold year-on-year increase to Dollars 3.84bn (Pounds 2.15bn), heightening government fears that world trade tensions will rise in tandem with the surging surplus. Customs-cleared figures released yesterday by the ministry of finance showed rises in the politically-sensitive surpluses with the US and European Community, and an overall 9.7 per cent rise to Dollars 23.94bn in exports and a 3.8 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 20.10bn. The seasonally-adjusted surplus for January was Dollars 8.37bn, up from Dollars 7.95bn in December, with exports for the month rising 6.9 per cent to Dollars 28.57bn, with imports 7.6 per cent higher at Dollars 20.20bn. Japanese officials were particularly concerned by a 33 per cent increase in the surplus with the EC, with exports to the region rising 12.4 per cent to Dollars 5.1bn and imports only 0.2 per cent higher at Dollars 2.9bn. Automobile exports to the EC rose 24 per cent on the same month last year, while purchases of EC luxury goods continued to plunge, with imports of art works down 84.6 per cent. Meanwhile, Japanese car exports to the US fell 12.3 per cent on a year earlier. Japan's total exports to the US rose 1 per cent to Dollars 6.7bn, while imports from the US were 0.3 per cent higher at Dollars 4.3bn. Imports of aircraft were sharply higher and imports of cars rose 15 per cent, providing some evidence for Tokyo that demand for US-made cars is on the rise. Ms Chiharu Shima, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the slowing of domestic demand has encouraged Japanese companies to increase their exports, and the threat of US criticism has prompted some companies to target the European market. 'Some of the large increase in January can be explained by currency fluctations and lower energy prices, but you shouldn't underestimate the longer-term effects of weak domestic demand,' Ms Sumita said. The largest increases in Japanese exports were seen in transport machinery (up 13.5 per cent), electric machines (up 10.2 per cent), and precision instruments (up 10.2 per cent). Japan's imports of textiles rose 16.6 per cent and of foodstuffs by 14 per cent. Trade with the newly-industrialised economies (NIEs) of Asia expanded modestly during the period after strong growth for much of last year. However, exports to China were 39.4 per cent higher than the same month last year, and imports from China rose 14.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tenants and tax: a new view In your issue of July 2/3, you published a letter headlined 'Tenants and the Revenue'. This dealt with the taxation position of a limited company formed by tenants to run their flat block. The tenants pointed out that the company did not generate a 'profit' and asked why the Inland Revenue produced assessments for tax. Your reply said, in part, that 'the expenditure actually incurred in each year is deducted from the rents and service charges due from the tenants in the year. and any balance is chargeable to corporation tax'. So also was any income from surplus funds put on deposit or invested. May I disagree with your reply? For nearly 40 years, I was in the Revenue - most of them in a senior technical post - and am now treasurer of a mutual flat-owners' management company. Our leases, which are probably typical of general usage, permit the company to demand from us only as much as it spends on maintenance, management and repair. Anything collected over and above is, strictly speaking, beyond its legal entitlement - although it is accepted by members in order to have a working fund because we cannot budget in advance for every penny. Rents under the leases are chargeable under Schedule A, but are negligible in relation to the total annual budget. Any further sums collected are indeed under the lease - but only to the extent strictly permitted by the lease as explained above. It should follow that (as the company is not trading) the only sums chargeable finally to corporation tax will be investment income such as bank interest, as no Schedule A surplus can arise. My official practice (at my personal discretion only) was to tell such companies not to bother me unless their interest exceeded Pounds 100 in the year. As treasurer, however, I have found that our auditors prefer for their protection to have the accounts submitted to the Revenue so that it can correctly certify a nil tax provision. The trouble is that, once you do this, the machinery of review will usually produce an estimated tax assessment before the normal due date for corporation tax payment. The reader whose question appeared (in edited form) on July 2 asked a specific question, which we answered. It related to an existing situation, so we did not deal with what arrangements might have been made instead. We referred the reader explicitly to the company's auditor because we hope there will be a shareholders' meeting with the auditor to discuss modifications of the existing arrangements. There are inherent limitations to a free advisory service, and we always try to get readers to take advantage of professional advisers who are already available to them. A brief suggestion of possible alternative arrangements, based upon limited data, can sometimes do more harm than good - particularly in a case like this one, where fellow tenants may have confliction ideas. Our replies are tailor-made for each reader's particular circumstances, so far as we can deduce them, and should not be taken to be of universal application. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

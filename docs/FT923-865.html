			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (4): VAT refunded MANY companies are unaware that they may be entitled to a refund of taxes paid when their employees travel in Europe for business purposes. If a company has one or two business trips a year, in all likelihood it is missing the opportunity to recover substantial amounts of money to which it is legally due. In the past two years, many European countries - specifically, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK - have adopted legislation allowing foreign corporations to obtain a refund of VAT paid on business-related services used by their employees travelling for business reasons. These services include hotel accommodation, meals, car rentals, conferences and trade shows. All these countries have also set up a retroactive claim period, allowing a company to go back six or 12 months (depending on the country) for refund purposes. To date, few companies have taken advantage of the opportunity to reclaim because of the complexity of the rules and the time-consuming tax refund application process. However, Meridian Reclaim Services claims it can make the process simple. It offers to handle all the necessary paperwork to process a VAT refund application, including assisting companies in organising past claims as well as setting up procedures to enable them to recapture future VAT expenditures. The service is cost-free to the company if Meridian fails to obtain a refund. All the work is done by Meridian, so the company has nothing - neither time nor money - to lose.

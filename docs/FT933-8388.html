			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK insurance The rising equity market has contributed more to the recapitalisation of the UK insurance industry than the stream of rights calls and preference share issues. Most composite insurers maintain equity portfolios at least equal to shareholders' funds. For Sun Alliance, the most geared to equities, the 25 per cent rise in the stock market since sterling's devaluation may have added Pounds 500m to its capital base. The exception is Royal, which holds equities equal only to around half shareholders' funds. So far Royal's shares have not been held back by its gilts and other fixed interest investments. It roundly outperformed the sector over the last 12 months as underwriting conditions have turned. With the UK underwriting recovery now fully in the price, though, differences of investment mix are more likely to tell. The question for shareholders and management alike is whether the likely outperformance of equities over the long term is worth the additional risk. Another bull equity market in the 1990s would most likely leave UK insurers overcapitalised. Very high solvency ratios are a hurdle to making a decent return on capital, however good the investment returns. Insurance companies riding a rising equity market also feel little pressure to make decent underwriting profits. That partly explains the extent of insurance losses during the last three years. Direct Line, the darling of the insurance industry, both makes an underwriting profit and holds its assets wholly in bonds and cash.</p>

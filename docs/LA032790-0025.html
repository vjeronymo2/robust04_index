			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> AVIANCA PILOT CALLED 'INATTENTIVE' TO FUEL  </P> <P> The pilot of Avianca Flight 52 was aware that he was low on fuel but appeared  "inattentive" to the problem and seemed to take "little action" in  communicating it to air controllers, a source told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> The flight's co-pilot and flight engineer also took no bold steps to alert the  captain or controllers to the fuel emergency, a source close to the  investigation said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity. The findings were  based on cockpit conversations recorded on the Colombian flight during the 30  minutes before it crashed on Long Island, N.Y., Jan. 25, killing 73 people.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Floating charge hits rough sea - A look at plans which may improve the company rescue provisions of Britain's insolvency laws PBR Solutions, a supplier of office electrical systems, went bust last year, its bankers calling in receivers after 16 years of successful trading. The story is a familiar one; with sales of Pounds 7m, PBR's bank had confirmed an overdraft of Pounds 800,000 in late 1991 only to cut it six months later. The owner-managers, Bill and Jane Pickering, refinanced the company with funds they had tucked away for their retirement. Six months later, one of PBRs' large contracts was cancelled, another postponed and the directors foresaw a sharp fall in sales that would last for two months. To avoid trading while insolvent, the Pickerings called the bank and asked for receivers to be appointed. Last October the Department of Trade and Industry decided this might not be the best way to deal with companies in difficulty. Inviting suggestions on changes to company voluntary arrangements and administration orders, the DTI made a number of proposals that could improve the company rescue provisions of the 1986 Insolvency Act. For the Pickerings, any changes to insolvency law will come too late. But if the changes are adopted, many other companies - and their unsecured creditors - may stand a better chance of rescuing their assets if they get into trouble. One of the DTI's proposals relates to company voluntary arrangements between companies and their creditors that have been used very little since they were introduced in the 1986 Act. One obstacle has been the lack of a moratorium on creditor's rights; the DTI suggests introducing a moratorium of 28 days, extendable to three months, that would bind all creditors. But the DTI's consultative document has raised the lid on a much bigger hornet's nest by questioning whether the long-established rights of floating chargeholders - normally banks - should be curtailed to give administration orders more chance of success. The floating charge is the unusual mechanism by which banks can take a charge over a company's changing assets, such as its inventory. It is only used in the UK, Australia and Canada of the industrialised countries. The trouble with administration is that directors of companies which seek its protection know their banks have the whip hand. As the law stands, a floating chargeholder can veto an administration order and appoint an administrative receiver. Under present rules, an administrative receiver is not obliged to take into account the interests of unsecured creditors or shareholders. The receivers are often accused of being concerned with minimising losses for the banks rather than looking at whether there is a viable future for the company. Taking an altogether more radical approach, the Small Business Bureau has called for the total abolition of the floating charge. In a reply to the DTI's consultative document, Barry Baldwin, head of the policy unit at the SBB, says abolition would change the emphasis of insolvency. 'The objective of any insolvency process should be to make the company as valuable as possible for the benefit of all creditors, secured or unsecured, and the shareholders,' he says. 'The UK urgently needs to find some form of cultural structure which would at least give financially distressed companies a fighting chance of survival. 'Elimination of the floating charge may well lead to a re-assessment of lending criteria, with less reliance on security, and increased emphasis on the ability of companies to achieve the cashflows necessary to sustain the costs of supporting debt.' Not surprising, the banks have vigorously rejected the DTI suggestions that floating chargeholders' rights might be diluted. If the value of bank security, and in particular the floating charge, was undermined, it would 'lead to increased costs to cover the added risk, and it could also discourage lending generally, especially to smaller businesses and for company start-ups', the British Banking Association says in a submission to the DTI. 'The proposals set out in the consultative document would change fundamentally the current legal environment by shifting the balance of power towards debtors (the borrower) at the expense of secured creditors,' the BBA says. The association says the DTI in any case is placing too much emphasis on rescuing corporate entities rather than the underlying businesses. And it says the biggest single contributory factor leading to insolvency is that companies lose their markets. Groups like the Association of British Chambers of Commerce are reluctant to tinker with the floating charge if banks consequently become more reluctant to lend. But one of the underlying weaknesses of smaller corporate Britain is its reliance on overdrafts. The floating charge may be partly to blame. By mortgaging everything that moves, companies have avoided operating from an adequate equity base and banks have frequently paid too little attention to the underlying strength of their clients' businesses. At least reducing the value of the floating charge might result in better quality lending to sounder businesses. The names of PBR Solutions and its directors have been changed as legal proceedings continue between directors and the receivers.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Brussels expected to oppose ICI swap deal with Du Pont EUROPEAN Commission merger authorities appear ready to oppose a swap of chemical assets between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont of the US. The deal is regarded by ICI as an important test case in the rationalisation of Europe's chemical industry. Announced in April, it involves ICI swapping its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. The Commission's merger task force is expected to recommend to Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, that the deal be blocked in its present form because it would give Du Pont a dominant position in nylon carpet fibre. The task force has found that Du Pont's EC market share would be 35 per cent by volume and 43 per cent by value. The task force's opposition to the deal, however, has split the EC advisory committee on merger cases, where its view is supported by only a narrow majority of governments. The Commission's industry directorate favours the deal. Brussels officials suggested yesterday that the unusually wide split on the committee could make it harder for Sir Leon to ask his 16 fellow commissioners to veto the transaction. A decision is expected by the end of this month. The official deadline is October 9. The carpet fibre business accounts for only 20 per cent of ICI's nylon assets. In theory, the task force's objections could be met by excluding carpet fibres from the deal. This might prove too expensive to contemplate, since nylon fibre is produced at all three of ICI's nylon plants in the UK and Germany. It is not thought that any undertakings short of divestment would satisfy the merger authorities. ICI argued that the relevant market against which the deal should be measured was that for artificial carpet fibres as a whole, including polypropylene fibres. It is claimed that polypropylene has increased its share of this market from 14 per cent to 35 per cent over the past 10 years. The argument has been rejected. Some of ICI's supporters in Brussels concede that the deal raises competition issues in nylon fibres. But they argue that these do not warrant thwarting an otherwise sensible rationalisation of assets. The deal has also to be passed by the US competition authorities, since it involves ICI becoming the world's largest supplier of acrylic and the second biggest producer in the US. This is expected to pose fewer problems than in the EC, since the market shares involved are smaller. A US ruling is not expected before the end of the year. Since the EC merger regulation took effect two years ago, the Commission has blocked only one of 120 mergers notified to it, the proposed takeover of De Havilland of Canada by French and Italian state aerospace companies.</p>

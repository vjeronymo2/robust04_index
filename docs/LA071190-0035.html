			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEGION NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> MAGEE TAKES VOWS AFTER TEAM BOWS  </P> <P> It was not an exchange of vows beneath crossed bats at home plate. But had the  game lasted any longer, Verdugo Hills Coach Kelly Magee would have needed a  justice of the peace, not an umpire.  </P> <P> Magee was married on June 30, a few hours after his American Legion District 20  team lost to Sun Valley, 3-2, on a run in the ninth inning. Although Magee  wasn't happy that Verdugo Hills lost, he certainly was glad the game didn't go  into extra innings.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get it started by 10, but we didn't get going until about 11:30,"  he said. "I was a little upset (about the delay)."  </P> <P> Why the hurry? Because Magee, 30, was cutting things closer than a bang-bang  play at the plate.  </P> <P> Since the game ran long, Magee didn't get home until 2:30 p.m., and he had a  wedding rehearsal scheduled at 3. The actual ceremony was held in La Canada at  5.  </P> <P> Magee said his bride-to-be raised no objections concerning the unusual  doubleheader, even though the game ended scant hours before the big event.  </P> <P> "She said she didn't mind," he said.  </P> <P> Always nice to meet someone who has her priorities straight.  </P> <P> Road warriors: Panorama City Coach Scott Smith figured it was a stroke of  genius. Play a couple of interdistrict games in Las Vegas on Friday and a  scheduled District 20 game at Lancaster the following day.  </P> <P> Shoot, Lancaster is right on the way home, too.  </P> <P> "We thought it was a great idea at the time," said Smith, who admits his  players weren't as high on remaining in the high desert.  </P> <P> "When we got to Lancaster, the kids were all saying, 'Coach, do we have to play  this today?' There's no way we'll do that again."  </P> <P> Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea. Panorama City (14-5) reached a season high in  runs with a 17-12, 16-hit win over Lancaster.  </P> <P> Great balls of ire: Pete Redfern had one of the best offensive performances of  his American Legion career at Chatsworth High when he was a player for Sylmar  in 1973.  </P> <P> He went five for five while starting in center field on the same diamond where  he now coaches the Legion entry from Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, however, Redfern was always a pitcher first -- the  right-hander was an All-American at USC and toiled for the Minnesota Twins --  which could be why his Legion team's pitching woes sometimes drive him nuts.  Chatsworth (9-10) is batting a solid .313, but the staff earned-run average is  6.22.  </P> <P> "I tell them and tell them, but I guess they don't listen," Redfern said.  "Strikes are the name of the game."  </P> <P> In 141 innings, Chatsworth pitchers have issued 120 walks and hit five batters.  The 10-run mercy rule has been invoked three times and Chatsworth has  surrendered 127 runs in 19 games.  </P> <P> Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, who was 6-2 in the spring for City Section 4-A  Division champion Chatsworth High and had an ERA of 2.58, has walked 36 batters  in 30 2/3 innings of Legion play. He walked 34 in 57 innings of high school  competition.  </P> <P> No relief: First-year North Hollywood Coach Mel Williams knows too well that  his team's record is 1-20, the worst in District 20. Obscured by an  unattractive win-loss percentage, he says, are several near-victories.  </P> <P> Against the district's best.  </P> <P> Eight times North Hollywood has taken a lead into the final inning and lost.  North Hollywood has thrown scares into some of the area's best teams --  including Van Nuys-Notre Dame, Panorama City, Reseda and Sun Valley -- before  faltering down the stretch.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem to make a difference who we bring in," Williams said. "The  starters usually do OK, and then we bring in another one of our starters and  they don't do well at all.  </P> <P> "But we're scrappy, we're young. I'm proud of them. We hung right in there with  some of the best teams around."  </P></p>

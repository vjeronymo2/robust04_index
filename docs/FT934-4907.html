			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / N Korea in new nuclear treaty threat North Korea threatened yesterday to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty unless the US conducts a new round of talks with Pyongyang. North Korea suspended its threat to pull out of the treaty in July after holding two rounds of negotiations with Washington on a possible improvement in relations. But the US has said a third session will not occur until Pyongyang agrees to accept routine international inspections of its nuclear facilities and agrees to resume inter-Korean talks. North Korea appears to want unilateral talks with the US, without involving South Korea, in an attempt to win diplomatic recognition and economic aid from Washington. South Korean officials accuse Pyongyang of trying to break co-operation between Washington and Seoul on the nuclear issue by holding separate talks with Washington. The statement by the North Korean foreign ministry appeared to be a response to the declaration issued by the presidents of the US and South Korea in Washington last week that Pyongyang first had to accept nuclear inspections and inter-Korean talks before contacts with the US would be resumed. 'We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. But if the US. . . ends the dialogue, there would be no reason for us to stop our decision to withdraw from the NPT from taking effect,' the North said. It also said it was prepared to withstand economic sanctions and other consequences if the current negotiations to resolve the nuclear issue collapsed. 'When we decided to withdraw from the NPT, we were prepared for all possible consequences that our decision entailed. We've compled all preparations to defend our independence in the face of the worst situation like a war.' Pyongyang urged Washington to accept a package deal in which the two sides would make simultaneous concessions to resolve the nuclear issue. South Korea persuaded the US to reject the package deal concept and instead focus on winning initial concessions from the North. However, South Korea's bargaining strategy was criticised this week by its foreign ministry's Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security. It implicitly endorsed a package solution, explaining that it would avoid the 'positional bargaining' that normally occurs in inter-Korean negotiations. 'There is the belief (between the two Koreas) that withdrawing from an original position or compromising means defeat or loss of face,' a factor that has bedevilled past inter-Korean negotiations, the institute said.</p>

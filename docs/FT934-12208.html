			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (12): Business has been kind - Profile: Zam Refai 'HOW would you like to buy a gem of an island?' giggles Mr Z A M Refai's right-hand man, pushing across the desk a picture of a coconut-palmed paradise, just off the coast of the tourist resort of Bentota, writes Richard Cowper. Minutes earlier, Mr Refai - or Zam, as he is known in the trade - was pocketing a Dollars 30,000 sapphire that had been cut and polished by one of his most skilled employees. Business has been kind to Mr Refai of ZAM Gems, the company named after his own initials. A Moslem from the coastal gem trading town of Beruwala, 35 miles south of the capital of Colombo, he started business 26 years ago with capital of Dollars 1,000 - a paltry sum in a trade where single gems can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Today, he is a multi-millionaire with five up-market jewellery shops, numerous jewellery-making workshops and a turnover which he conservatively puts at Dollars 2.5m a year. Unlike the country's sophisticated and fabulously rich top 500 gem merchants, who have conducted business for centuries from their mansions in the China Fort area of Beruwala, Mr Refai is a self-made man and he clearly revels in his new-found wealth. In addition to the magical Barberyn island with its old white British lighthouse, he owns an exquisite blue aquamarine so huge that it is the biggest such gem ever found in this island of gems. At 946 carats, the size of a goose egg, the stone is a museum piece whose value can only be guessed at. Mr Refai, a trader at heart, says that at the right price he might be willing to sell. 'What would that price be?' I asked. 'It's a huge draw at my most exclusive shop in the Hilton Hotel,' he says. 'But I might be prepared to accept Dollars 250,000.' Such information is rare in what is undoubtedly one of the world's most secretive trades. The easy transportability of gems worth huge sums has made them extremely attractive to smugglers, drug money launderers, tax evaders and those who wish to avoid currency controls - not to mention the nouveau riche and some members of the aristocracy. 'How much did you pay for it?' I hazard. 'It took my best man one week to cut and polish it, for which I paid him Dollars 2,500 and. . .' pointing to his brand new four-wheel-drive vehicle. . . 'it cost me less than I paid for this,' he says with a laugh. 'Fortune has treated me well. Mr Premadasa (the former president) gave me and all other gem and jewellery exporters an indefinite tax holiday. I don't pay any tax at all,' he says. Until 1985, his sole business was the export of polished and cut gems such as rubies, topaz, moonstones and the famous blue sapphire for which Sri Lanka has been renowned for nearly 2,500 years. But as tourism came into its own, he expanded into making fine jewellery, using gold and gems and copying western designs. He opened shops in several of Colombo's five-star hotels, opening up a niche in the market that has made him one of the country's top five jewellery exporters. With an uncanny ability to see the main chance, he has concentrated on the tourist market from Japan, a country which imports more gems and jewellery than any other in the world. Not all is plain sailing. He is now exposed to the vagaries of the Sri Lankan political climate. After President Premadasa was assassinated in May, Mr Rafai hardly sold a piece of jewellery in his Colombo shops for three months. But jewellery, although expanding fast, still accounts for just 20 per cent of his turnover and, should an emergency arise, he could always 'slip a handful of sapphires into my pocket and sell them abroad for a small fortune.' Political stability is the key to the future and he is looking forward to the day when tourism - now at 400,000 visitors a year - reaches the 1m mark. 'Then I shall be a truly rich man,' he says with a smile, giving the Dollars 30,000 pink padmaraga sapphire in his pocket another twist.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The government stressed  the need for labor-management cooperation at a high-level policy  meeting held Monday to review the five-year "new economy"  development plan, in the belief that labor may hold back an  economy which is recovering from recession at a relatively rapid  pace.    Specially invited to attend the meeting were the top  executive officers of 30 large business groups and their union  leaders, who viewed a film showing how Goldstar Co. has achieved  worker-management cooperation after experiencing harsh labor  disputes in the late 1980s.    Last year, the government had to stimulate the economy to  lift it from a drawn-out recession and encourage industrialists  to demonstrate an enterprising spirit as few signs of recovery  were evident. In 1994, however, the government has shifted its  policy focus to inflation and labor as the economy shows signs  of a relatively rapid recovery.    Earlier this year, the government was battling inflation  triggered by hikes in public utility fees. As a result,  inflation began slowing down in April and was brought under  control in May. Compared with the extreme labor actions at  Hyundai group companies and other large factories last year,  disputes by workers have been moderate so far this year. But  the government is worried about a recurrence of violent labor  strikes as the economy is moving upward.    As of the end of April, about 30 percent of large companies  had completed collective wage bargaining, up 8 percentage points  over a year earlier. Only 16.8 percent of the companies  affiliated with the 30 large business groups, however, had done  so.    Moreover, Hyundai group and shipbuilding industry unions are  moving to organize a separate industrial union from the  Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), while the unions of  some large companies have already announced their defection from  the FKTU.    There are thus indications that the FKTU-led labor community  is facing a drastic restructuring -- to the extent of charting a  new course for the labor movement. Under these circumstances,  the government hopes to turn labor-management relations from  conflict to cooperation this year. Toward that end, it has  decided to take steps to reduce industrial accidents, expand  vocational training programs and improve working conditions.    In implementing these measures the cooperation of employers,  especially the chairmen of the 30 large business groups, is  badly needed, and this is why the government invited the 30  corporate leaders to Monday's high-level policy meeting.    Noted in the meeting were the economy's upward movement at a  relatively fast pace and the need for early industrial  restructuring to prepare for the end of the era of the three  lows -- low oil prices, low interest rates and low exchange  value of the won. During the first three-lows era in the 1980s,  the economy failed at industrial restructuring, bringing about a  downturn in 1990. To keep the economy from suffering another  such downturn, the government plans to restructure industry  while it is still brisk on the strength of the three lows.    The economy is finally on the rise after emerging from a  long  tunnel lasting over three years. The government plans to start  restructuring industry during this upswing to prevent the  recurrence of a slump due to the failure of such restructuring  efforts in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's electric power  consumption in February increased 3.4 percent from a year  earlier to 68.9 billion kilowatt-hours, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry said Tuesday [5 April].    Power consumption for nonindustrial use rose 6.9 percent to  33.6 billion kilowatt-hours, while that for industrial use edged  up 0.2 percent to 35.3 billion kilowatt-hours, the ministry said  in a preliminary report.    Of the nonindustrial consumption, household use grew a  marked  7.2 percent thanks to lower temperatures from a year before  during the reporting month, while use at office buildings  climbed 7.5 percent.    Large-lot power consumption for industrial use decreased 0.9  percent for the eighth straight month of declines from a year  earlier. The slack demand reflected the long-stagnant business  activity in the materials sector and sluggish demand from the  machinery industry, MITI said.</p>

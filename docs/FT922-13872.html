			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election poised on knife-edge: Opinion polls indicate last-minute swing from Labour to Tories A LAST-MINUTE swing from Labour to the Conservatives left the outcome of today's general election balanced on a knife-edge last night with the last batch of opinion polls putting the two parties neck-and-neck. Three eve-of-poll surveys suggested that Mr Neil Kinnock had lost the two-point lead over Mr John Major which his party has held almost continuously throughout the four-week campaign. The polls, pointing to the most closely fought election since 1974, indicated the two parties were level at 38 per cent, with Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats at 20 per cent. A fourth survey gave Labour a three-point lead but did nothing to dispel the uncertainty over the outcome. If the surveys, which will trigger a desperate scramble for the votes of the remaining waverers throughout today, are replicated in the election, the result would be a hung parliament. Depending on which side emerged with the largest number of seats and on the terms they were ready to offer to smaller parties, that would leave open the possibility of a Conservative or Labour minority government. It could also force another general election within months. But as Mr Ashdown continued to insist that the price for his support would be a firm commitment to electoral reform, neither Mr Kinnock nor Mr Major would contemplate that possibility. Regional variations in voting patterns and the traditional statistical margin of error in opinion polls mean it is still possible that one party will emerge with an overall majority. As the party leaders launched a final push for votes, all sides were claiming that their own reports from the constituencies indicated that late surges in support for their respective parties would give them that majority. But the latest batch of polls offered more comfort to Mr Major than to Mr Kinnock. Labour's support has been steady at around 40 per cent for most of the campaign, falling below that level only during the past few days. Conservative strategists said Mr Major's warnings that a victory for Mr Kinnock would wreck the prospects of economic recovery had given his party momentum in the crucial phase of the campaign. The mood of optimism in the Conservative camp was reflected in the FT Election Share Index. It showed a slight move towards the Tories, after a campaign that has seen a steady trend the other way. Mr Kinnock said national polls had disguised his party's strength in the main general election battlegrounds of London, the Midlands and the north-west. His campaign team said regional and constituency surveys indicated the swing to Labour from the Conservatives in marginal seats was significantly above the 7 per cent shown in national polls. Mr Ashdown, buoyed by indications that the Liberal Democrats may make strong gains in its south-west heartlands, predicted that his party's actual vote would exceed the 23 per cent achieved by the Liberal/SDP Alliance in 1987. Anticipating a hung parliament, Mr Ashdown renewed his call for a coalition government based on an agreed four-year programme of legislation including the introduction of proportional representation. A Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph puts the Conservatives at 38.5 per cent, Labour at 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 20 per cent. Mori for The Times gives Labour a one-point lead with 39 per cent against the Conservatives' 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 20 per cent. ICM for The Guardian puts the two main parties at 38 per cent each, with the Liberal Democrats again on 20 per cent. NOP for The Independent and BBC Newsnight has Labour on 42 per cent, Conservatives on 39 per cent and Liberal Democrats 17 per cent. The FT's poll of polls points to a hung parliament with Labour having a slightly bigger share of the vote. Today's voting marks the end of a frequently bitter election campaign in which Mr Major has been dogged by the recession and the poll tax and Mr Kinnock by his party's tax and spending plans. Only Mr Ashdown has increased his party's support. Mr Major concluded with a confident assertion that he was 'stone cold certain' of an overall majority. Mr Kinnock made an eve-of-poll appeal to the electorate to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, run down and division' and to invest a Labour government with the task of building a Britain capable of a 'pacemaker in Europe'.

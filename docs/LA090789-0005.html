			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRANSPLANTING ROW HOUSES  </P> <P> San Diego has a tradition of borrowing architecture, regardless of how well it  fits this region. Pirated home designs have been especially popular, such as  the 19th-Century salt boxes and Victorians lifted from the eastern United  States.  </P> <P> Downtown, where there hadn't been new homes for decades before '80s, developers  and architects have built apartment buildings and single-room-occupancy hotels  that address the street on a pedestrian scale with interesting architecture.  But so far, there haven't been any truly urban homes for sale.  </P> <P> In the early '80s, the Park Row and Marina Park condominiums south of Broadway  gave San Diegans a chance to buy new homes in the heart of the city, but they  weren't tailored to the location.  </P> <P> Marina Park is a closed-in, low-rise apartment building, with all of its  luxuries contained within, an approach more suited to suburbia or cities in the  East, where it is too cold to utilize outdoor spaces. Park Row, with its  courtyards and airy Mediterranean look (white stucco and tile roofs) was  better, but also more suburban than urban in the way it turned inward instead  of out toward the life on the streets.  </P> <P> The 27-story Meridian became the first high-rise condo project downtown when it  opened in 1985, offering up to 3,300 square feet of living area. Here, at  least, was an urban experience, with many homes having spectacular views of the  downtown skyline, and with some of life's essentials available in nearby Horton  Plaza. Still, a high-rise doesn't give residents the same kind of life style  they can get, for example, in Eastern row houses, with their front stoops  meeting the sidewalk.  </P> <P> Now along comes Jonathan Segal, 27, a self-assured guy prone to wearing double  breasted designer suits, touting a new brand of downtown housing.  </P> <P> How self-assured is he? "My goal is to be the leading architect in San Diego,  then the leading architect in the country," he said matter-of-factly.  </P> <P> Segal has taken the row house and translated it to downtown San Diego, where  his 7 ON KETTNER townhouses are being built.  </P> <P> In his travels as a member of the downtown Resident Advisory Committee, which  advises the Centre City Development Corp. on downtown redevelopment, Segal met  a variety of movers and shakers. When he mentioned to Charles Tyson, developer  of a downtown high-rise, that his dream was to do a unique residential project  downtown, Tyson had an idea. His mother-in-law owned a small wedge of land on  Kettner Boulevard at F Street, next to the railroad tracks. Was Segal  interested?  </P> <P> He was, even though freight trains (and eventually the San Diego Trolley's  cars) will thunder past only a few feet from his building's back wall.  </P> <P> Segal solved the sound problem by hiring an acoustical engineer, who specified  double drywall and acoustical theater windows. But the real breakthroughs are  in the architecture and planning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Unique Plan'  </P> <P> "Jonathan came along with a unique plan," said Paul Desrochers, assistant vice  president of operations at the CCDC. "When he came in with it, we thought it  was an excellent way to redevelop that site. The project has an excellent  relationship to the street. We like the scale. We want to encourage  smaller-scale development."  </P> <P> The CCDC is contributing $100,000 for sidewalk and landscaping next to Segal's  project, repayable if the architect's profits top a certain amount.  </P> <P> Residents of Segal's building will have an intimate experience with the city.  Unlike Park Row just across Kettner, which addresses the street with a parking  garage, 7 ON KETTNER will utilize the row house entrance.  </P> <P> Segal, married with two children, wanted to offer new homes for young families  like his. 7 ON KETTNER's seven homes, scheduled to hit the market later this  year, will range in size from 1,275 square feet to 2,400, and in price from  $259,000 to more than $500,000. The architect and his family will occupy the  largest of the homes, and Segal will work in a basement office.  </P> <P> A self-described Modernist, Segal has designed a clean, functional stucco  building, with no extraneous architectural decoration.  </P> <P> Entries will have steel gates for security, but they won't be buried somewhere  within, as they are at Marina Park. Several of the homes will have second-story  balconies, giving their owners broad views of the downtown skyline.  </P> <P> Segal is clearly a sensitive manipulator of natural light. High clerestory  windows will channel morning and late afternoon light into the homes, washing  interior walls with changing colors. Rooftop skylights will let in additional  light.  </P> <P> The architect, in the manner common to today's planners and architects, likes  to talk about the "dialogue" his building will have with the street. A good  example is the "cat's paws" that will frame each entry, squarish stucco pieces  that will jut a couple feet onto the sidewalk as a gesture to passers-by.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Excellent Eye  </P> <P> Parking is one of downtown's biggest problems. Segal has tucked his  underground, squeezing in two slots for every home, although he hopes many of  the residents will walk to jobs downtown. Auto access is from the side of the  building, leaving the front dedicated to foot traffic.  </P> <P> Not only does Segal design with functional good sense, but, based on his model  for 7 ON KETTNER, he appears to have an excellent eye for form and proportion.  Subtle touches give the building sophistication, like the way the curved  balconies mirror the shapes of the entry landings below them, and the way the  building's massing and window placement form a well-balanced composition.  </P> <P> Already, he has secured two 10,000-square-foot lots at 2nd Avenue and Market  Street, where he plans to build his next generation of downtown housing.  </P> <P> Segal is an architect to watch. Even if he doesn't make the pages of GQ, his  architecture is bound to get attention. The emphasis on problem-solving, not  flash or gimmicks, is rare in a young architect.  </P></p>

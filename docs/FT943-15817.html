			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / US frontiers blurred after railway merger: Stock swap may lead to east meeting west A railway that makes a profit has become a rarity since road transport started to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative. But in the past few years, US railways have been doing very nicely. Now two of them, the Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe Pacific, plan to do even better by merging their large networks in a Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) stock swap, creating by far the biggest railway in the US: the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. Unlike railways in most other countries, US railway companies - all of them in the private sector - operate only freight trains. Passenger services are operated over the private railways' tracks by the state-owned Amtrak, which lost Dollars 730m last year. Just 20 years ago, it was not too fanciful to imagine that US railways might cease to exist. Federal government investment in the construction of an interstate road system had encouraged rapid growth in the road haulage industry, and the heavily regulated railways were unable to compete. With many railways staring at bankruptcy, the industry went through a wave of mergers in the late 1970s and early 1980s that cut the 17 big railway companies to seven. Around the same time, the railways also began to see the first glimmer of salvation with the passage of the Staggers Act in 1980, which in effect deregulated the industry. Once the merger mania was over, all the big railways started using their new commercial freedom to set more competitive freight rates, drop unprofitable traffic, dispose of loss-making lines and cut jobs. Gradually the red ink turned to black. While cost-cutting was the main theme of the 1980s, in the 1990s the railways have started to win more traffic. Economic growth is one reason for the increase; a shortage of drivers in the trucking industry has helped, too. But more importantly, lower costs have enabled the railways to show they are still capable of competing with road hauliers on price, at least on long-distance trips. One of their fastest-growing markets is for intermodal traffic - trailers and containers that switch from road to rail for the long-distance part of their journey. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe say this is why they want to get together. Although both railways lie to the west of the Mississippi, connecting the Midwest with the Pacific coast, most of Burlington's network lies to the north of Santa Fe's: so connecting the two would greatly increase the number of long-distance destinations on offer to both railways' customers. The merged railways would also get a substantial boost to competitiveness because of the efficiency savings flowing from higher traffic densities and reduced administrative costs. The big question, however, is: will they get away with it? The Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory agency, stood aside during the wave of railway mergers in the 1970s and early 1980s. But in 1987 it forcibly intervened in a deal between Santa Fe and another of the Big Seven railways, Southern Pacific, telling them to unbundle a merger that had been accomplished more than three years earlier. Santa Fe hopes this deal will be different. The Santa Fe and Southern networks, it says, were largely overlapping, and the Interstate Commerce Commission had feared that a merger would reduce competition. The Santa Fe and Burlington networks, by contrast, hardly overlap at all: it would be an 'end-to-end' merger, increasing the options available to customers and allowing the merged railways to compete more effectively with Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi. If the commission does allow the merger - and it could be the end of next year before it reaches a decision - the result could be to encourage more deals between US railways. But future mergers are likely to be different from any seen before. For years, the industry has speculated on the possibility that one of the four big railways to the west of the Mississippi might merge with one of the three big railways to the east - the Norfolk Southern, CSX and Conrail. This would create a transcontinental railway network providing customers with a seamless coast-to-coast freight transport service, without the costs and delays associated with interchanging traffic from one operator to another. Analysts had speculated that any one merger would start a game of musical chairs in which the other big railways would also scramble to form east-west partnerships. With four companies on one side of the Mississippi and three on the other, it always looked as though one company west of the Mississippi would be left in the cold. A successful merger between Burlington and Santa Fe would send a signal to the rest of the railway industry that end-to-end mergers were acceptable to the commission, and conveniently even up the number of potential partners to three on each side of the Mississippi. At that stage, the logic of a transcontinental merger wave might become irresistible.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- How the seven big US railways compare  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Railways                Route       Staff     Revenue*    Net Profit*                        (miles)                  1993          1993                                             (dollarsbn)   (dollarsm)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Western US  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Burlington Northern     22,316     18,162       4.7          331.8 Santa Fe Pacific         8,536                  2.4          183.5 Union Pacific           17,835                  4.9          594.3 Southern Pacific        11,920                  2.4         -114.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern US  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CSX                     18,779     29,216       4.4          308.2 Norfolk Southern        14,589     25,531       3.7          526.7 Conrail                 11,831     24,728       3.3          229.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Revenue and net profit figures exclude non-railroad activities and exceptional charges Source: Association of American Railroads  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that only a  political authority has the power to make a decision on the  chief of the general staff's term in office and added that it is  only natural that she should consider alternative arrangements  and discuss the issue with her close colleagues. Ciller also  stated that there have been no hints or requests from the chief  of the general staff regarding his term in office.    Ciller's statement on the issue is as follows:    During recent days, various interpretations and reports  concerning General Dogan Gures' term in office have appeared in  the media. The polemics concerning the issue continue in  certain circles. The power to make a decision on the chief of  the general staff's term in office falls under the jurisdiction  of the political authority. Nothing can be as natural as my  considering an alternative arrangement or discussing the issue  with my close colleagues. It is very wrong to interpret my  contacts regarding this issue and my request that the issue be  kept within a close circle as an intention to keep the issue  secret from the government and the public. The main aim of  these meetings was to conduct preliminary work to determine  whether the conditions for extending Mr. Gures' term in office  can be implemented. We did not find it necessary to inform Gen.  Gures or anybody else.    During these days, when we have accomplished so much in the  fight against terrorism, our government, determined to solve  this issue, is serving effectively and successfully with a  trustworthy cadre, together with other commanders. Of course,  eradicating terrorism takes time.    Meanwhile, political and military developments in the region  and the world exacerbate the current ambiguity and the risks  originating from it. Under these conditions, we may consider it  favorable and necessary for the country's interests to retain  the successful command team on duty in its present form.  However, the possibility of this arrangement having a negative  impact on the hierarchal structure of the Turkish Armed Forces  is an important consideration.    With this in mind, our government, while affirming its trust  in the top echelons within the traditional structure of the  Turkish Armed Forces, also fully trusts all levels of command,  including those commanders who will have to assume the  high-level positions when the time comes.    The term democratization package I refer to in my contacts  is  an expression always used during my exchange of views on  national security with Gen. Gures. Our great nation is fully  aware of the respect Gen. Gures and the Turkish Armed Forces  under his command have for democracy and its institutions.    I would like to stress that absolutely no requests or hints  have reached us from Gen. Gures regarding his term in office.  Furthermore, we are aware that he is not predisposed in this  regard; it is we who raised the issue.    Gen. Gures' statements to the press are in the spirit of the  Turkish Armed Forces' tradition of having no personal desires  for office. In view of all these realities, nobody will benefit  from statements and interpretations that give way to speculation  or polemics.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ansaldo lifts investment in Hungary ANSALDO, Italy's largest electrical engineering concern, is to establish two new facilities in Hungary to take its total planned investment in the country to Dollars 130m. The state-owned Italian group, a subsidiary of the IRI holding company, is forming a joint venture with Dunaferr, Hungary's leading steel producer, to make electrical motors at Dunaujvaros, south of Budapest. Ansaldo is providing equity of Ft1.08bn (Dollars 11.6m) to take a 76 per cent stake in the new entity, to be called Temm, while the Hungarian partner will contribute the site and control 24 per cent. The larger part of the new investment will involve Temm constructing a new plant for Ganz Ansaldo, the Italian group's Hungarian joint venture producing electric motors, generators, transformers and traction stations. 'An electromechanical group must have a base in one of the countries of eastern Europe,' said Dr Bruno Musso, Ansaldo chairman, whose rivals have invested heavily in Poland and the Czech Republic. Ganz Ansaldo's losses including interest payments reached Ft1.3bn (Dollars 14m) in 1992 and Ansaldo does not expect its Hungarian operations to break even until 1996.</p>

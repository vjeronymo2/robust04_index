			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska </F> republic, to a group of unidentified correspondents after talks  with Russian envoy Churkin in Belgrade on 14 March -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent]  Was there any talk about the division of Sarajevo? [words  indistinct]    [Koljevic] There was no specific discussion about the  division of Sarajevo. There were some ideas that everyone would  have authority in his own Sarajevo, and it does not need to be  called the Muslim Sarajevo or the Serbian Sarajevo. It is far  more important for us that people enjoy their political rights  on those territories that they control -- this refers to  Sarajevo -- than what kind of a name this will bear temporarily.    [Correspondent] Were there any demands for new territorial  concessions, as it is evident that the issue of demarcation...?    [Koljevic, interrupting] No, the demarcation issue will  naturally be very difficult; however, the style of these  mediators is different. They would not raise an issue that has  not arrived on the agenda yet. Above all, they want to create a  very solid basis in order to accomplish success and have the  most difficult talks about demarcation come last, when it would  no longer be possible to cross over into a different situation  without an agreement.    [Correspondent] How do you comment on the latest U.S.  proposals about the possibility of an independent state of  Serbian Republic?    [Koljevic] I think that these are very interesting  proposals, however, we must study their legal implications.    [Correspondent] Thanks!</p>

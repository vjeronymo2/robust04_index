			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jan (AFP) -- The armed rebellion  that broke out on 1 January in southern Mexico "will not affect"  the flow of foreign capital into Mexico, it was asserted by the  Secretariat of Commerce when announcing it would sponsor 500  foreign investment projects in 1994.    In a 26 January statement to the local media, Pedro Noyola,  deputy secretary of foreign commerce and investment at the  Secretariat of Commerce, said foreign investors are still  interested in this country despite the military conflict in  Chiapas.    "Investment projects are still strong," Noyola said to  refute  newspaper reports which claimed at least 100 programs were put  "on hold" in the Secretariat of Commerce because of the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion.    Pedro Noyola announced the government and business groups  were sponsoring nearly 500 foreign investment projects aimed at  strengthening the textile, agro-industrial, tourism, commercial,  and manufacture sectors starting this year. The plan foresees  the promotion of investments through a litany of projects, and  it includes the participation of the Secretariat of Commerce,  the Foreign Trade National Bank, and the Mexican Businessmen's  Council.    The political crisis in Chiapas, yet unresolved, has created  uneasiness among financial groups, tourism companies, and  powerful local businessmen who stated fears about Mexico's  economic future during the first week of the armed conflict.    Referring to Mexico's foreign trade, Noyola said this sector  experienced a growth rate of 325 percent over the past eight  years, surpassing the United States, Germany, Japan, and the  Pacific Rim countries. The growth rate achieved by the United  States during that period was 170 percent; Germany 125 percent;  Japan 130 percent; and "the Asian Tigers only achieved 270  percent," Noyola said.    Mexico has maintained an annual productivity growth rate of  between 6 and 7 percent since 1989 while the United States  barely achieved "between 2 and 4 percent," he added. In another  area, he said Mexico registered a participation in excess of 6  percent in the United States' total manufactured imports, as  compared to 3.2 percent registered in 1985.</p>

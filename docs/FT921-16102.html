			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Divided it fell, but united it should rise - As 1992 dawns, Colin Amery stresses the importance of rebuilding Berlin as a whole city again / Architecture Last week an editorial in the FT spoke of the differing political visions that are vying for supremacy in the construction of the new Europe. Naturally enough it was concerned about international perspectives for the new community and the prospects for political and economic progress. Architecture was not mentioned, but it does have an important role, both as visible evidence of material progress and as an outward sign of historical and cultural values. 1992 is the year for architects to take advantage of the opening up of the single market, and British architects would be well advised to look both at the enormous opportunities and the strength of the architectural competition. Two particular countries demonstrate these facets of the situation very clearly. One is the newly united Germany; the other is the recently democratised Spain. At a conference recently held at the Bauhaus called Berlin scenarios of development, one speaker summed up the opportunities for Berlin. 'Berlin is like a gigantic zip being pulled together again as quickly as possible . . . not only through streets and squares . . . transport links, telephone lines . . . but first and foremost in the stomach, the heart and the head.' The zip also has to reunite ancient centres with development that has happened since the last war in the pulsating western sector around the Kurfurstendamm. How long will it take to remove the scars of communism, to resolve the curious paradoxes and contrasts that exist particularly in what was East Berlin ? Take a walk down the Unter den Linden and pass, as you now can, through the Brandenberg Gate going east and you are faced with one of the most paradoxical views in Europe. Just before reunification the East German government refurbished Karl Friedrich Schinkel's bridge, the Neue Schlossbrucke, reinstating the massive statues and the beautiful ironwork. But the view from this masterly neo-classical monument is of the hideous Palace of the Republic  - a monument to communism which was built on the site of the gutted Royal palace. It is said that even Krushchev was astounded by the ugliness of this 1950s monster and deplored the demolition of the palace, which could have been restored. The decision to move the government of Germany from Bonn to Berlin guarantees big architectural opportunities. Will they be seized? How will any new plans embrace the ideologies of the past that linger so strongly? Last year the Deutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt invited 17 international practices to explore ideas for the architectural reunification of Berlin. The competition's mood was summed up by the brief: to find 'an architecture for a City of Tolerance.' Hitler tried to plan a Berlin, with his architect Albert Speer, that would rival the Rome of the emperors: axial routes were to focus on glorious state buildings, all of them large enough to defy any rational sense of proportion. Some of the internationally famous architects in last year's competition produced schemes of a scale and fatuousness that perhaps only Speer would have understood. Zaha Hadid simply developed the axial ideas into a motorised monster of a city designed as a focal 'star of routes.' Norman Foster, on the other hand, saw that what the city needed is a peaceful centre. He planned to make the site of the Berlin Wall into a park  - a green calm ribbon on the site of so much death and sacrifice. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown extended the Kursouthern boundary of the Tiergarten  - rather like a long New York style Fifth Avenue alongside a park. It was probably the German architect OM Ungers whose ideas were closest to the spirit of the city. He proposed islands of monuments and imposing buildings that could read as icons, or important markers, in a largely suburban city. Anyone who has visited Berlin when it was divided will have experienced that curious sense of being on a series of urban islands. When you reached Potsdam, or sat on a beach by the Wannsee, this sense of being remote but at the heart of something large and important is very palpable. Berlin is as much trees, water and gardens as it is monuments and good public housing. British architects and developers are gradually rising to the prospects of work in the city; let us hope that they first co-operate to create an efficient but humane infrastructure that ties up the city's wounds before imposing any rash of international hotels and uniformly mediocre commercial blocks. It is in Barcelona that the urge to give democratic Spain a modern international face is most visible. The Japanese architect Arata Isosaki's Olympic Stadium, now that it copes with the rain, promises to be a successful and stylish venue for the games. But it is architects in the Catalan region who have recently produced a whole range of subtle new buildings that combine the best of the Mediterranean and the modern. The most well known architect working in Spain, Rafael Moneo, is also one of the very best in Europe. His museum for Roman antiquities in Merida has that rare quality, architectural good manners. What are we to make of the gigantic conference centre at Salamanca designed by Juan Navarro Baldeweg? In some ways its great dome rising from a cube is reminiscent of the neo-classical design of the monument for Frederick the Great that Gilly produced and which so inspired Schinkel. Has the neo-classical wheel come full circle in Spain rather than in Berlin? Architecture is the built language of the times, which today are complex and contradictory. As the new Europe settles down to 1992, I shall be writing about how things progress in Berlin and Spain.</p>

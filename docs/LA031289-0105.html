			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME / SILVER LAKE: SILVER LAKE: WESTSIDE LIFE STYLE AT HALF PRICE;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE VALUES SOAR WITH ECLECTIC BUYERS DRAWN TO THE STEEP HILLS, SHORT  COMMUTE  </P> <P> Realtor Jeffrey Young, behind the wheel of his sporty Jaguar, handled the steep  hills of Silver Lake with familiar ease. The 27-year-old Young knows his way  around, perhaps even better than some of the community's old-timers.  </P> <P> "I grew up in this area," Young said of the Silver Lake district, located 2 1/2  miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, "My grandmother still lives here and  my dad runs a family plumbing business that's been around for 60 years."  </P> <P> Young drove to the crest of Micheltorena Street and parked by a turreted,  four-level house where Judy Garland had lived in the late 1940s.  </P> <P> "This is my favorite. All the rooms are round, but wait until you see the  teahouse and the gazebo," Young said, leading the way down a block-long public  stairway (one of about 100 known to remain throughout Los Angeles), for a back  yard view of the 4,000-square-foot house that sold recently as a fixer-upper  for $450,000.  </P> <P> Young bought his own home in Silver Lake a few months ago and said he was lucky  to get it for $350,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Prices Soared  </P> <P> Real estate values have been soaring in the area. A year ago, prices ranged  from $100,000 to $500,000; now they're more like $200,000 to $600,000, and  higher. And while the median price for homes in the city rose by 26% in 1988,  houses in Silver Lake increased by 33%.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Board of Realtors report for the past year listed Silver Lake as  the leader in home sales, with 398, followed by Pacific Palisades with 395.  </P> <P> Silver Lake was considered a "sleeper" until about 10 years ago and was largely  ignored by builders, who favored the San Fernando Valley and Westside areas,  said Alita Hanger, president of the Silver Lake Residents Assn.  </P> <P> "But with increasing development downtown, and prices still well below  comparable properties on the Westside of town . . . more people will be moving  into the neighborhood," she said.  </P> <P> Silver Lake -- the community's focal point and the city's oldest fresh-water  reservoir -- forms an amphitheater-like setting for its eastern and western  residential slopes. The reservoir was built in 1909 and named for Herman  Silver, a member of Los Angeles' first board of water commissioners. Adjoining  it is the smaller Ivanhoe reservoir.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Converge at The Hub  </P> <P> Silver Lake's main drag is an undistinguished stretch of Sunset Boulevard that  skirts the hills, east to west, from Echo Park to Hollywood, and separates them  from the Bellevue district to the south.  </P> <P> The community's other thoroughfares -- Hyperion and Rowena avenues and Glendale  and Silver Lake boulevards -- converge to form a delta of neighborhood activity  at the north end of Hyperion, known simply as The Hub.  </P> <P> The Hub is where much of the local gossip is exchanged, and where the Old Hub  Market has been upgraded to include take-out gourmet foods and wine, and where  Say Cheese, another popular stop, sells pates, dolmas and marinated mushrooms,  and deals with its customers on a first-name basis. Nearby, the Mayfair Market  occupies the site of Walt Disney's first studio.  </P> <P> The neighborhood's diverse ethnic, cultural and economic mix, which includes  long-established Asian and gay communities, is reflected in a number of eating  places serving Japanese, vegetarian Indian and other exotic cooking, and in the  small shops featuring antiques, clothing, handicrafts and the usual  neighborhood services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Struck by Friendliness  </P> <P> Michael Blum has only just discovered Silver Lake and it's where he wants to  live. "I moved from New York a few weeks ago, and I've never been in a  friendlier place," he said. " I mean, people actually say hello."  </P> <P> Another ex-New Yorker, art director David Sackeroff, has lived in Silver Lake  for 11 years and claims it's "one of the few real neighborhoods left in L.A.  where people actually meet and talk. It's a walking community and I guess  that's because so many of us own dogs."  </P> <P> Susan Brenneman and Gregory Swordes, newcomers from San Francisco, were looking  for a rental in the Silver Lake area last year and ended up buying an older,  1,300-square-foot house with a view for under $250,000.  </P> <P> "I didn't want a long commute to my downtown office and the views and steep  hills reminded us of San Francisco, except that Silver Lake is much more  suburban," Brenneman said. "We've been accustomed to living wall-to-wall with  our neighbors. At first I felt a bit isolated."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Neat Older Homes'  </P> <P> Norma and Ralph Blunt, owners of Antiques on Melrose, also are part of the new  wave of younger professionals with two incomes who have moved recently to the  area, attracted by the spectacular views and "neat older homes."  </P> <P> "We enjoy a Westside life style for half the price," Norma Blunt said. Their  1929 home, which features a living room stage for concerts, built by the first  owner, is part of the original subdivision of silent movie star Antonio  Moreno's estate. Its grand old mansion is still preserved by the Franciscan  Missionary Sisters.  </P> <P> New Silver Lake residents soon learn from their neighbors that they're  surrounded by the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, Rudolph Schindler,  Richard Neutra, Gregory Ain and John Lautner, who turned the area into a  showcase for their experimental designs.  </P> <P> They also eventually become aware of the area's rich movie history. The  old-time Keystone Studio in Silver Lake's Ellendale neighborhood is where Mack  Sennett's Keystone Cops and bathing beauties cavorted and where cowboy Tom  Mix's mounts chased up the hills. Later, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard kept a  romantic hideaway in those same hills before they were free to marry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Steep Street Attracts  </P> <P> Scenes from several movies in the '20s and '30s were filmed on Fargo Street  starring Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the Three Stooges.  Even today the steep street is a favorite of competing runners and cyclists and  the Fire Department on occasion will use the hill to test its equipment.  </P> <P> The influx of new residents has been growing steadily, according to Hanger,  president of a strong and vocal 500-member residents' association that has been  grappling for years with issues that threatened to destroy the beauty of the  reservoir and the character of the community.  </P> <P> The association's vice president, Sheriff's Capt. Bento Kienast, was born in  Silver Lake and still lives in the Swiss chalet that his architect father  designed.  </P> <P> "We are beginning to see quite a few changes in the community, but our worst  problem is the increased traffic density on our main streets," he said.  </P> <P> The association successfully opposed the extension of the Glendale Freeway  through Silver Lake and waged an 11-year battle to scale down the proposed  2,200 units planned for the historic Garbutt-Hathaway estate on the east side  of the reservoir to 96 detached homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Property Crimes Dropped  </P> <P> While residents are concerned about daytime burglaries, "Silver Lake has one of  the lowest crime rates . . . in our northeast area (including Atwater, Highland  Park, Eagle Rock, Elysian Valley, Dodger Stadium and Griffith Park)," said  Capt. Noel Cunningham, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Northeast Division.  </P> <P> In the first six weeks of 1989, property crimes in Silver Lake and in portions  of east Hollywood and Los Feliz showed an 18% decline compared to the same  period in 1988.  </P> <P> The Silver Lake schools are Ivanhoe and Micheltorena elementary schools, Thomas  Starr King Junior High School and John Marshall High School. It won the 1986-87  National Academic Decathlon.  </P></p>

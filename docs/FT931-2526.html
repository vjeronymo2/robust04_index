			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Hidden 'green' costs may add 4% to fuel bills HIDDEN costs of government energy-saving schemes could add nearly 4 per cent a year to domestic fuel and electricity bills, in addition to the value added tax levy announced in the Budget, it emerged yesterday. The new figures were released by government departments as the row over the impact of higher fuel bills on poor households grew. In Tuesday's Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said existing energy-efficiency schemes would play a larger part than previously announced in reaching environmental targets. The UK committed itself at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Government projections say reaching that target will need a cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) from projected levels of 170mtC. New figures show that the government expects the Budget measures to save 3mtC and existing measures to save 4mtC. They also reveal that the biggest part - 2.5mtC - will come from schemes organised by the Energy Saving Trust created last year to encourage household energy efficiency. If the trust is to meet this target it would have to spend between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year on household insulation schemes, says a previously published report by the Department of the Environment. The rise in average energy bills across the country might then be between 3 per cent and 4 per cent if costs are passed on to customers, the report suggests. However, households which participate in the schemes will be cushioned from some of the rise by using less energy. The electricity and gas utilities, which will make the investments identified by the trust, are keen that all costs should be passed on to customers. The trust, headed by former cabinet minister Lord Moore, was one of the main 'green' planks of the Conservative election manifesto last spring but has been criticised for a slow start. It has appointed a chief executive only recently. On Tuesday the chancellor said fuel taxes in the Budget 'together with measures that have already been announced . . . should take Britain two thirds of the way to meeting the Rio target'. Midlands Electricity yesterday announced a 4 per cent tariff cut for domestic customers, Michael Smith writes. The company said its efforts to reduce prices would largely offset the Budget imposition of VAT. The reduction, effective from April 1, is the largest announced for the coming year by any of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Midlands said its customers will save more than Pounds 12 a year on average. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, said he hoped it would be possible to make further cuts next year. These would offset the price rises resulting from the government's decision to introduce VAT on domestic fuel bills at 8 per cent. London Electricity said it is cutting prices by an average of 2 per cent from April 1, saving more than Pounds 6 a year for its average domestic customer. Other companies which have announced charges for next year include Seeboard, which froze its prices, and South Wales Electricity, which cut rates by 1 per cent. The reductions have been made possible by falling coal prices and heavy cost cutting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gilberto Chirinza, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] representative in Maputo, said on 25 January that the  Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] is hampering Renamo  political work in Maputo Province. He added that Matutuine  District Administrator Joao Namedinga has been making it  difficult for Renamo to coordinate its activities. After Renamo  holds a meeting with the people, [Frelimo] activisit groups  proceed to contradict Renamo's messages. Chirinza also said  that another problem is the absence of premises for Renamo to  have offices in various areas of Maputo Province.    That Renamo official noted that despite those difficulties,  his party continues to work to show its true image to the people  of Maputo Province.    [Begin recording] [Chirinza] Frelimo, (?like the government)  has been creating many difficulties. For instance, the [words  indistinct] that have been created in terms of the General Peace  Accord and which are not functioning yet because, quite simply,  they lack government permission.    [Unidentified correspondent] How do you view the work that  should be done in view of the upcoming elections?    [Chirinza] For its part, Renamo is doing very serious work  with the people because we have to clean up the picture painted  by Frelimo. We have to improve our image with the people, so  they become aware that Renamo is not what Frelimo made it out to  be for so many years.    [Correspondent] Have you experienced any difficulties in  your  political work in Maputo Province?    [Chirinza] (?Very much so) because the government is  creating  so many problems. There is a shortage of premises and  transportation. The government is aware that it is the UN  Operations in Mozambique that provides us with vehicles but at  this stage the vehicles have not been released without any  justification. [end recording]    When Radio Mozambique approached Marciano da Cruz,  provincial  director for support and control, and acting governor while  Governor Raimundo Bila is on leave, he said that there are legal  avenues for Renamo to express concerns, rather than through the  press. He added that the provincial government is ready to  cooperate with Renamo and do its best to solve that party's  problems in accordance with means available locally. He also  noted that he had no information about the behavior of Activist  Groups in Matutuine District, because the local administrator  has not reported any unusual incidents to the provincial  government.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYNAGOGUE  </P> <P> Readers taking a close look at the photographs (Religion, Nov. 25) of Sukwon  Kim examining his work on the Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church's  restoration project may have wondered why the characters on the Ten  Commandments in the top photo were in Hebrew, not Korean.  </P> <P> The reason is that the Korean congregation (at Fourth and New Hampshire),  worships in a former synagogue, the home of Sinai Temple from its dedication in  1926 (not 100 years ago, as indicated in the caption) to 1961, when Sinai moved  to its current location in Westwood.  </P> <P> The building, designed by architect S. Tilden Norton, is City of Los Angeles  Historic Cultural Monument No. 91. As the Western outpost of the Conservative  movement in Judaism, it housed the first classes of the University of Judaism  in 1947.  </P> <P> Incidentally, Sinai's first building, dedicated in 1909 at 12th and Valencia,  and the oldest extant synagogue structure in Los Angeles, has been the home of  the Welsh Presbyterian Church since 1925. It was also designed by Norton and is  Historic Cultural Monument No. 173. The Welsh congregation has lovingly  preserved the building through the years and is now engaged in a construction  project to comply with earthquake code requirements.  </P> <P> We are indebted to these congregations for keeping alive visual reminders of  our city's rich multicultural heritage.  </P> <P> STEPHEN J. SASS  </P> <P> President Jewish Historical Society of Southern California  </P></p>

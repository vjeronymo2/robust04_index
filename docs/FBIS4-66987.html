			<p>CSO     [Text] Coordinating Minister for Police and Security  Soesilo Soedarman said that the State Intelligence Coordinating  Board (BAKIN) must take a more serious view of the dangers posed  by narcotics because Indonesia is no longer just a transit point  for the international drug trade but it has become a target for  drug dealers.    For that reason BAKIN must reexamine the organization,  authority, tasks and procedures of the Executive Coordinating  Board (BAKOLAK) set up by Presidential Instruction Number 6 of  1971 concerning narcotics, controlled substances and alcoholic  beverages, he added.    "This is important because things are developing so rapidly  and some of its regulations are no longer relevant," Soesilo  said yesterday after delivering a report to president Suharto at  his residence on Cendana Street.    "Regulations which were a product of 1971 conditions can no  longer keep up with the present speed of changing conditions."    He said that PJPT II [Stage II Long-Term Development] plans  to pay close attention to the creation of Indonesians who are  reliable both physically and spiritually so that the country can  compete with more advanced nations.    "But we have been concerned recently because trafficking in  alcoholic beverages and controlled substances has upset our  efforts to build up dependable human resources, both physically  and spiritually, who are skilled, broad-minded and intelligent,"  he said.    Indications are that Indonesia has changed from a mere  transit point to a target country, said Soesilo, and there is a  lot of evidence that drugs are being introduced and are ready to  be marketed in Indonesia.    "Just look at the case of the 12 kg of heroin uncovered in  Medan; was it going to be distributed there or was it in  transit?," he asked.    In addition, there have been several similar cases of large  amounts of drugs smuggled into Indonesia as their final  destination. "Previously, Indonesia was only a transit point; we  didn't like that and we like it even less when Indonesia is the  target zone, so the only option is to work even harder."    Asked whether there was any political intent behind  targeting  young people, Soesilo said, "It's not that simple; the world is  undergoing large-scale changes in direction and this affects  everything, including the narcotics problem, and this is what  makes us nervous," he said.    The Coordinating Minister for Police and Security is not  willing to allow Indonesia to become a paradise for drug  trafficking because the sentences handed out are too lenient.  "When I was PANGKOWILHAN I [Commander of Defense Region Command  I] in Medan, I once carried out an operation. We worked so hard  to capture somebody and then the sentence was insufficient. We  have to straighten this problem out," he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY CONSERVATION BACK ON FRONT BURNER  </P> <P> With an urgency reminiscent of the 1970s oil crisis, California is being nudged  into an era of energy efficiency in which energy-guzzling light bulbs and  window glass will be upstaged by remarkable new conservation-oriented products.  </P> <P> Armed with compelling evidence that California utilities have led a return to  energy gluttony, a coalition of regulators, scientists, businesses,  conservationists -- and even the reluctant utilities themselves -- is preparing  a blueprint for changing the way energy is used.  </P> <P> The effort, spurred by an unusually outspoken California Public Utilities  Commission, could position California to catch up with energy-conscious Japan,  reduce fossil fuel pollutants from power plants, better respond to fears over  global warming and save Californians billions of dollars in needlessly high  energy bills.  </P> <P> "Just so the utilities know where we stand, conservation and (energy-efficient)  management are now back up on the front burner," said PUC President G. Mitchell  Wilk.  </P> <P> If the effort succeeds, Californians will be offered an array of proven -- but  thus far ignored -- 1980s technology, such as light bulbs that last for years  using a fraction of the normal energy and window glass that repels summertime  heat. Instead of seeking out new power sources, the utilities will hire firms  peddling "negawatts" -- ways to cut energy use.  </P> <P> The powerful PUC took up the issue July 20 after release of a report by the  Natural Resources Defense Council, the group that successfully fought the use  of the chemical Alar on apples, showing that the state's big utilities have cut  conservation programs by 56% since 1985. California, once the nation's  conservation leader, has backslid so badly that an estimated $1 billion in  energy is being wasted annually, the group said.  </P> <P> Stanley W. Hulett, a PUC member, asked for "a blueprint for energy efficiency"  by Christmas and chided the utilities, whose executives in the mid-1980s  decided that plentiful energy justified dismantling many efficiency programs.  Laudable past gains, Hulett said, "do not excuse what we have done in the last  three to four years."  </P> <P> Arthur Rosenfeld, a leading physicist and energy expert at Lawrence Berkeley  Laboratory, called the PUC's stand "historic."  </P> <P> "The commissioners were telling us they were embarrassed that they were asleep  at the wheel," he said. "And that means change is coming."  </P> <P> The breadth of the problem has also prompted the California Energy Commission  and South Coast Air Quality Management District to urge a turnaround.  </P> <P> With such a broad consensus, prominent scientists and industry executives said  firms selling energy-efficient equipment and techniques could become  California's hottest new growth industry.  </P> <P> "The savings achievable are so dramatic that many people simply don't believe  it," said Amory Lovins, a Colorado conservation expert whose state-of-the-art  home and office in the frigid Rocky Mountains generates only $5 in monthly  energy bills. The alterations paid for themselves in one year, he said.  </P> <P> Lovins said screw-in "compact fluorescent bulbs" have the life span of 10  incandescent bulbs, use one-quarter the energy and, despite their $11.50  wholesale price, will quickly pay for themselves in a typical home. Reflectors  that intensify lights without adding heat and fixtures that stop fluorescent  bulbs from flickering can cut office lighting bills 50%. And because the new  office lighting does not overheat rooms, air-conditioning bills are sliced in  half.  </P> <P> Rosenfeld said "low emissivity" glass, coated with transparent film that keeps  out heat, could save energy equal to all the oil pumped annually through the  Alaska pipeline if installed in homes and buildings nationwide. The glass is  slightly more costly than conventional windows.  </P> <P> "People don't buy (the new light bulbs and other items) because they are not in  Safeway," Rosenfeld said. "The natural market will take 30 years to absorb  (these products), but we don't have that sort of classical leeway left."  </P> <P> The PUC stressed that the hardware and ideas brought out in the blueprint  should include incentives to spur the utilities. Moreover, the programs should  pay for themselves in the form of lower bills and rebates without the  sacrifices equated with old-style conservation. Industry experts said the  programs, to be administered by the utilities, are likely to include:  </P> <P> * An end to the utilities' traditional practice of building or expanding power  plants whenever they need more megawatts. Where a moderately sized 50-megawatt  plant was once required, a "negawatt' contractor would be hired to find a way  to prevent 50 megawatts of energy from being wasted in a region.  </P> <P> * Prodding industries and businesses to install new products ranging from  cost-cutting machine gears and drive belts to the low emissivity windows and  polarized plastic ceiling tiles that cut computer screen glare and allow lights  to be dimmed.  </P> <P> * Incentives for constructing above-standard buildings. Developers still  install conventional lights, windows and heaters to reduce up-front costs,  creating energy-guzzling buildings. High energy costs accumulate for the life  of the structures, representing billions of dollars in losses. (In downtown Los  Angeles, few of the dozens of newer office towers are above standard. One  exception is the high-tech Ronald Reagan State Office Building now being  built.)  </P> <P> * Paybacks for residents who "super-weatherize" their homes by plugging unseen  leaks now easily detectable with air-suction devices. Programs might pay for  ceiling, wall and floor insulation, heat-repelling windows and whole-house fans  instead of air-conditioners.  </P> <P> * Educating municipal agencies. For instance, cities can surface streets with  light-colored materials, replacing heat-absorbing blacktop that, along with  other man-made structures, has helped turned Los Angeles into a "heat island,"  in which temperatures are rising one degree per decade.  </P> <P> While defending past conservation cutbacks, utility executives have agreed to  collaborate on ways to adapt these ideas for California.  </P> <P> "We don't have all the answers, but we're sure the one way to get them is to  work together," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, vice president of customer service  for Southern California Edison Co.  </P> <P> "We would not only accept but encourage proper incentives," said Virgil Rose,  vice president and general manager of distribution for Pacific Gas &amp;  Electric.  </P> <P> However, John Phillips, co-chairman of the Boston Edison Co. Collaborative, a  group helping the Boston utility company create energy-efficiency programs,  cautioned that California's utilities may not be joining the effort out of  conviction, but in response to public pressure.  </P> <P> On July 21, in the first of many informal meetings held to draw up the energy  blueprint for the PUC, utility officials rejected the Natural Resources Defense  Council's suggestion that Phillips use his Boston experience to help them come  up with a preliminary plan.  </P> <P> "I don't mind being rejected, especially in this business, but the idea was to  collaborate, and frankly I walked away feeling very, very uneasy about the  utilities," Phillips said. "Will they come up with anything creative, after  being left to themselves all these years and coming up with a 56% cut in  conservation?"  </P> <P> Another warning came from David Morse of the PUC's Division of Ratepayer  Advocates, who questioned whether the utilities should need incentives to  support efficiency. Given the PUC's unique system, in which utilities already  profit whether or not they sell more or less energy, Morse said, "they  shouldn't need financial incentives to do the right thing."  </P> <P> Many industry-watchers trace the utilities' resistance to the mid-1980s when  new executives rose at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison  and elsewhere who seemingly had little interest in the scientific strides being  made in energy efficiency.  </P> <P> According to Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council, top  people in the conservation departments were laid off as marketing departments  grew. Disillusioned conservation experts moved to out-of-state utilities,  "where the action was," he said, and soon after, conservation efforts in  California began spiraling downward.  </P> <P> While California hesitated, West Germany and Japan bolted ahead with dramatic  innovations.  </P> <P> Rosenfeld of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said Japan needs just one-half the  energy required by the United States to produce an equivalent one dollar of  gross national product -- a disparity that gives Japan a tremendous financial  advantage. Aside from the apparent reluctance by the utilities, there are other  challenges.  </P> <P> Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission, recently  told the PUC that by the year 2000 less than half of California's housing stock  will have been built according to efficiency standards adopted in 1978.  </P> <P> Millions of older, poorly insulated homes represent "an unsqueezed sponge" of  potentially vast energy savings, Imbrecht said.  </P> <P> But the building industry is so disparate, with many thousands of contractors,  engineers, architects and designers unaware of the new technology, that new  labeling and standards may be needed on lighting, fixtures, windows and other  building materials before much retrofitting occurs. Such retrofitting might  occur, for instance, when houses are remodeled or resold.  </P> <P> Lovins and other scientists say they also still face persistent "disbelief"  over new energy-saving devices that seem almost too good to be true.  </P> <P> "I was consulting for a company in El Segundo, and they told me: 'But we're  already energy efficient,' " Lovins said. "So I pointed out that if they had  (constructed) all their buildings with available technology, their worldwide  net profits would go up 56%."  </P> <P> Despite such hurdles, there is growing optimism that California is leaving the  age of energy waste behind.  </P> <P> Ray Hall, a contractor who tried for years to persuade the utilities to promote  super-weatherizing, recently super-weatherized an older house in La Verne for  $3,000, avoiding the need for a $4,100 central air conditioner and immediately  cutting the homeowner's energy bills by 50%.  </P> <P> "Suddenly I'm getting calls from state legislators asking about these programs,  and the other day two guys from the gas company took me out to lunch to pick my  brain," Hall said. "It's a whole new day."  </P> <P> ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGIES  </P> <P>  Chart shows how much energy could be saved in the United States if just two of  several energy-efficient technologies now available were adopted nationwide.  Savings are shown in net annual costs, as well as in the number of power plants  whose energy production would not be needed and oil platforms whose  construction could be avoided.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:3.54IN:3.54IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COMPACT FLUORESCENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> LOW-EMISSIVITY  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> LIGHTS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> WINDOW GLASS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Number/area installed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 800 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 15 billion square feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net annual savings  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $6 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $6 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Unburned coal  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 30 million tons*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 20 million tons*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Unneeded power plants  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 12 (1,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Not available  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> megawatts/plant)**  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Unneeded oil platforms  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 30 (10,000 barrels/day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * 50 million tons equals 10% of coal mined in United States annually  </P> <P> ** A 1,000-megawatt plant equals six Diablo Canyon nuclear power complexes  </P> <P> Source: Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory  </P></p>

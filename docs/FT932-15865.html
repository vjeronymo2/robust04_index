			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Alcatel surpasses earnings forecast ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent rise in net profits for last year, slightly higher than the 12 per cent rise it had forecast. Net earnings rose to FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) last year from FFr6.2bn in 1991 and should be stable this year, in spite of the difficult economic climate, said Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman. Turnover rose fractionally to FFr161.7bn from FFr160bn. He expected growth in the telecommunications market, the group's biggest business, accounting for nearly half of last year's sales. Europe would show slight progression, but much faster growth would come from Asia and Latin America, where the number of telephone lines should more than double over the next 10 years, said Mr Suard. Last year's net profits increase was achieved on a small decline in operating profits to FFr14.8bn from FFr14.9bn, he said. It came in spite of a rise in restructuring costs, to FFr3.2bn from FFr2.7bn, and an increase in financial charges. Net debt nearly doubled to FFr20.5bn from FFr10.8bn due to the costs of buying out ITT's 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the group's telecommunications division. Operating profits in telecommunications rose slightly to FFr9.5bn, while the GEC Alsthom energy and transport division, owned jointly with Britain's GEC, saw a rise in operating earnings to FFr3.6bn from FFr3.1bn. The joint venture, formed in 1988, was starting to show synergies, said Mr Suard. The cables division produced a slight rise in operating profits to FFr2.7bn as did Cegelec, in electrical engineering, where profits were FFr470m. Saft, the battery making division, produced a small operating rise to FFr120m. Alcatel Alsthom is proposing a FFr21.75 annual dividend, up from FFr20.25 last year. Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to FFr53.2 in 1992. Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest provider of software services, yesterday said it would pay no dividend for 1992, the first time it has missed a pay-out. The group revealed a FFr72m loss last year, its first annual deficit, though less than the FFr80m loss it had earlier estimated for 1992.</p>

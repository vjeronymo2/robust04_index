			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SEEMINGLY SOUND REAL ESTATE TRUST FILES CHAPTER 11;  </P> <P> TROUBLED FIRM: MORTGAGE &amp; REALTY TRUST IN BURBANK FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY  PROTECTION DESPITE BEING PROFITABLE AND SOLVENT.  </P> <P> Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust that has nearly  $600 million in assets, is profitable and solvent. It's also in bankruptcy  proceedings.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago the trust, which is based in Elkins Park, Pa., but has executive  offices in Burbank, went to federal court in Los Angeles and filed for  reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> How could this happen to a seemingly healthy company?  </P> <P> The trust, with $403 million in total debt, blamed the credit-rating agency  Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. for downgrading its credit, which caused it to miss  $105 million in debt payments that came due in March. S&amp;P blames the banks  and financial markets for overreacting to its action. And some of Mortgage  &amp; Realty's major creditors blame the trust for jumping into bankruptcy  court too quickly.  </P> <P> Regardless of who's right, it appears that Mortgage &amp; Realty operated on a  too-thin margin of cash. The trust makes loans for others to acquire or build  offices, apartments and other real estate, and makes those loans mainly with  cash it borrows from lenders and investors. It also invests in property. As a  REIT, Mortgage &amp; Realty's income is not taxed at the corporate level  because it distributes nearly all of its income to its stockholders.  </P> <P> REITs in general have often disappointed investors because of problems  associated with the ups and downs of the national real estate market. And even  though Mortgage &amp; Realty is considered to have relatively sound assets in  its portfolio, the trust's cash needs and the current sluggish real estate  market made for a toxic combination.  </P> <P> The trust already has begun changing since filing for Chapter 11 on April 12,  under which the trust will keep operating without fear of creditors' lawsuits  while it works out a plan to pay its debts. The trust has stopped making new  loans and probably will have to sell some assets to raise cash.  </P> <P> Meanwhile the trust's stock, which climbed to nearly $19 a share last year, had  been sinking for some time before its bankruptcy filing and closed Monday at  $5.25 share on the New York Stock Exchange. The trust also suspended its  dividend, the last of which was 45 cents a share paid in the quarter ended Dec.  31.  </P> <P> The trouble began two months ago as Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust was trying to  arrange a new bank line of credit so that it could, among other things, meet a  $13-million debt payment due March 13.  </P> <P> Nothing seemed to indicate Mortgage &amp; Realty would have trouble meeting the  debt payment. The trust earned $20 million in its fiscal year that ended last  Sept. 30 on gross income of $65.6 million.  </P> <P> The trust's total debt is about twice its net worth, which "is not  extraordinarily high" for its business, said William Acheson, a REIT analyst  with Value Line Investment Survey, a securities research firm in New York.  Mortgage &amp; Realty also was "renowned" for matching the amount of borrowing  it needed to finance its loans to others, he said.  </P> <P> But Mortgage &amp; Realty was not prepared for an unexpected jolt that hit the  trust one day before its $13-million debt payment was due.  </P> <P> S&amp;P, which rates companies' ability to pay back their debts, announced that  it had downgraded its opinion of Mortgage &amp; Realty's commercial paper, a  type of short-term unsecured debt that is sold to investors and that makes of  up about half of Mortgage &amp; Realty's debt.  </P> <P> Joseph Franzetti, vice president of S&amp;P's real estate finance group in New  York, said it was "an appropriate action" to lower Mortgage &amp; Realty's  commercial paper rating because S&amp;P perceived that with soft real estate  markets in much of the country, loan payments coming into Mortgage &amp; Realty  had slowed and the trust would not have as much liquidity, or ready cash at  hand.  </P> <P> S&amp;P's action had dire consequences, the trust claimed. The trust's talks  with its banks for a new credit line fell apart, and when Mortgage &amp; Realty  turned to sell more commercial paper, investors wanted no part of its  now-downgraded paper, the trust said.  </P> <P> The result was a domino effect. Mortgage &amp; Realty not only defaulted on the  $13-million loan payment, but it couldn't raise the cash to pay loans totaling  another $92 million that were due in March.  </P> <P> The trust tried again to get a new credit line, this one totaling $425 million,  but decided it could not live with its lenders' terms. So instead, it filed for  Chapter 11 protection. Its biggest creditors include divisions of such  financial powerhouses as Prudential Insurance (owed $128 million), Merrill  Lynch ($117 million) and First Chicago ($50 million).  </P> <P> Charles W. (C.W.) Strong Jr., the trust's president, pointed the blame at  S&amp;P during the creditors' meeting last week. Strong, who runs the trust's  day-to-day affairs from Burbank, charged that the credit change "was reckless"  and complained that S&amp;P did not advise the trust in advance that the  downgrade was coming.  </P> <P> S&amp;P's downgrade of the trust's commercial paper, to A-3 from A-2, is "an  indication that the credit quality has gotten weaker, but certainly A-3 is not  a rating that's signaling a disaster," Franzetti said. (S&amp;P's top grade for  commercial paper is A-1+.)  </P> <P> "I believe the market and the banks overreacted to that and declined to fund  the company," he added. "We only assess credit quality. We can't be responsible  for the actions of the market in reaction to our assessments."  </P> <P> Regardless, some of Mortgage &amp; Realty's creditors blame the company for  going to bankruptcy court too quickly. The creditors are all unsecured, meaning  that their loans are not backed by specific Mortgage &amp; Realty assets. The  trust, in fact, has no secured debt.  </P> <P> "The creditors are clearly frustrated because they don't feel that they've had  a satisfactory explanation as to why it was necessary that this company filed  for Chapter 11," said an executive of one major creditor, who spoke on the  condition that he not be identified.  </P> <P> "The general feeling is that the company took this step without fully  considering other options available to it," such as negotiating for additional  credit from its banks, he added.  </P> <P> During the creditors' hearing, Strong said he was struggling to even utter the  word "bankruptcy" because "we are not bankrupt. We are seeking reorganization  of the debt." He has declined to be interviewed since then.  </P> <P> Mortgage &amp; Realty was formed by the 1979 merger of two other REITS, PNB  Mortgage &amp; Realty Investment Trust, an affiliate of Philadelphia National  Bank; and Sutro Mortgage Investment Trust, an affiliate of Ralph C. Sutro Co.,  a Los Angeles mortgage banking firm that is now part of Metropolitan Life  Insurance. Today, about half of Mortgage &amp; Realty's loan portfolio covers  properties in California; the rest are mainly in the northeast United States.  </P> <P> The trust now must work with its creditors on a plan for repaying its debts,  and even some of the creditors -- citing the trust's otherwise strong financial  health -- said they think they will be repaid in full. The trust's lawyer,  Thomas H. Coleman, told the bankruptcy analyst that the trust hopes to propose  a reorganization plan within 120 days.  </P> <P> Strong indicated that the trust would sell some of its assets to raise  additional cash for paying the creditors. But Strong, citing the glut of  commercial real estate in many cities, had a warning for the creditors sitting  in front of him:  </P> <P> "We are not going to have a plan that says, 'Sell everything!' at the worst  time of the market," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MORTGAGE &amp; REALTY TRUST AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust that is  reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> KNICKS WILL SEE JUST HOW SMART MACLEOD IS  </P> <P> New York Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi respects John MacLeod because, among  other reasons, Bianchi says MacLeod is smart. He also likes him because he says  MacLeod is careful and reserved.  </P> <P> Those traits were in evidence the day after MacLeod became the favorite to  succeed Rick Pitino, who has left for the University of Kentucky, as coach of  the Knicks. MacLeod was not turning cartwheels because he might be offered the  Knicks job. He did not tell anyone that he thought the job had great potential  and that it would be an honor to coach in New York.  </P> <P> MacLeod was saying all the right things. He said he was flattered, but he had a  commitment in Dallas. He said, "I'm going to talk to Al because Al is a very  good friend of mine. But that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to New York to  take a coaching job."  </P> <P> For MacLeod, the situation was simple. He was employed by the Mavericks and he  had not been offered the Knicks job. As far as he was concerned, he had to  believe he was going to be in Dallas next season and he was not going to make  any dumb, outrageous statements.  </P> <P> If MacLeod is offered the Knicks job, we'll see how smart he really is. For  MacLeod, these are the facts:  </P> <P> 1. He never has been a favorite of Mavericks owner Donald Carter. Carter was a  close personal friend of former Mavericks coach Dick Motta and thought MacLeod  was not in Motta's league as a coach. Carter reluctantly accepted the advice of  other Mavericks executives when he hired MacLeod in 1987, but Carter later  admitted that even after he interviewed MacLeod, he was considering other  candidates.  </P> <P> 2. In February, when Roy Tarpley was in a drug rehabilitation clinic and Mark  Aguirre was pouting and defiantly loafing on the court, the Mavericks were not  winning often. Several close associates of Carter said he wanted to fire  MacLeod.  </P> <P> 3. In New York, MacLeod would work for Bianchi, who was his assistant coach for  12 years in Phoenix. MacLeod obviously would be supported by Bianchi in a way  he never will be supported in Dallas.  </P> <P> 4. The Knicks won 52 games last season. The Mavericks won 38. Tarpley, who is  as important to the Mavericks as Patrick Ewing is to the Knicks, has two  strikes in the anti-drug program. The Knicks have the potential to win a  championship before the Mavericks.  </P> <P> 5. MacLeod says he does not want to uproot his wife and his children, aged 14  and 11, for the second time in less than three years. But if the Mavericks  struggle at the beginning of next season, MacLeod probably will be fired and  will be forced to uproot his family anyway.  </P> <P> MacLeod is being careful not to offend anyone in Dallas or New York as he  decides whether he wants to listen to a job offer from Bianchi. But it is  obvious that the Knicks job is a better one than the Mavericks.  </P> <P> Because the Los Angeles Lakers are facing an inactive stretch of at least eight  days, while they wait to find out who they will play in the championship  series, Coach Pat Riley has decided to take them to Santa Barbara, Calif., for  a three-day minicamp through Saturday. Riley has said the Lakers might have  two-a-days, but he has said that before and not followed through.  </P> <P> But regardless of the number of practices, Riley said, "Our goal is to go there  and work hard. This is an opportunity if our players use it to prepare  properly. We can get honed and replenish."  </P> <P> The Miami Heat seems to be in great position in the college draft. The  Sacramento Kings apparently are leaning toward taking Danny Ferry with the No.  1 pick. The Los Angeles Clippers probably would follow by taking Sean Elliott,  and then the San Antonio Spurs probably would take Pervis Ellison with the  third pick.  </P> <P> The Heat then could take Glen Rice with the fourth pick, and Rice would be  perfect. Last season, the Heat averaged only 97.8 points, worst in the league.  The Heat also scored the fewest points in a quarter (nine), half (26) and game  (65). The team needs points, and Rice will score big in the NBA. He would get a  lot of shots with the Heat, enough maybe to finish in the top 10 next season.  </P> <P> Late in the Western Conference finals, reporters looking for new Laker angles  began writing about how well the bench was playing. Phoenix Suns Coach Cotton  Fitzsimmons acknowledged that Mychal Thompson, Michael Cooper and Orlando  Woolridge were playing well, but he said don't forget that the team revolves  around Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> "If Michael or Orlando had to carry a team," Fitzsimmons said, "you people  would be writing nasty things about them."  </P> <P> The bad timing award of the week unfortunately went to Alvin Robertson, who was  traded Sunday from the Spurs to the Milwaukee Bucks. The trade came three weeks  after Robertson's second child was born and only two days after Robertson  signed closing papers on an $800,000 house in San Antonio. Robertson said the  trade was "like a death in the family."  </P> <P> Greg "Cadillac" Anderson, who will go with Robertson to Milwaukee in exchange  for Terry Cummings, said he understood, then delivered a unique assessment.  Anderson said that for the Spurs, Robertson was "the shoelace to the tennis  shoe." Cadillac apparently has taken mega-doses of Dick Vitale.  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / High Court told of Lloyd's 'running sore' INADEQUACIES in the way the authorities at Lloyd's of London disclosed information to Names about disciplinary proceedings in the insurance market were highlighted yesterday at the High Court in the third day of a civil case brought against the Corporation of Lloyd's by 33 Names. The Names, or members, backed four syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agencies between 1980 and 1982. Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford QC, who is acting for 24 Names, said that the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates had been a 'running sore' for Lloyd's through 1981 and right up to the end of 1982. Lloyd's investigations uncovered inadequate financial management at Oakeley Vaughan. The Names were not told of these problems partly because of what he termed a 'lack of resolution' at the top of Lloyd's. Following an internal inquiry which had revealed evidence of writing more premium income than permitted by market rules and other irregularities, Lloyd's had suspended three directors of Oakeley Vaughan - Mr Barry Bowen, Mr Michael White-lock and Mr James St George  - for two years in September 1981. The three men had also been forbidden from holding any directorship or partnership in an agency doing business at Lloyd's for five years. Names, however, were told nothing of this. A letter from Oakeley Vaughan to Names, dated October 8 1981, said that Mr Bowen had simply resigned, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said. Subsequently the Lloyd's committee agreed that another director, Mr Charles St George, should be publicly reprimanded. However, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said that this was changed to a private reprimand, being confirmed in a letter sent to Mr Charles St George on December 4. Mr St George subsequently wrote to Lloyd's refusing to accept the reprimand. Mr Lyndon-Stanford suggested Lloyd's should have written to the Names giving them fuller information and that the Names were unable to make an informed decision on whether to continue to participate in the Oakeley Vaughan businesses. The case continues today. Letters, Page 19</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Observer: Dressing down Just when the fuss was dying over Karl Lagerfeld's Koran-inspired dress, the Oxford Union is stirring up more hornets. Among those due this Wednesday to debate the motion 'This House believes that Islam and Democracy are incompatible' are (proposing) Ray Honeyford, former Bradford headmaster, and (opposing) Kalim Siddiqui, self-proclaimed president of the Moslem Parliament of Great Britain. In the best traditions of pre-fight hype the union says the sponsors wish to remain anonymous, but adds that one of the planned speakers - Eric Pickles, Conservative MP and former head of Bradford Council - pulled out at the last moment. No such attack of nerves has troubled Yusuf Islam - the former pop singer, once known to millions as Cat Stevens - who joins the opposition team.</p>

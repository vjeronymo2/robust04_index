			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CONTINUING worries over the economy and on the corporate trading front caused a further retreat in stock index futures as the account drew to a close, writes Joel Kibazo. The sombre mood took hold early in the session as the first trade in the September contract was struck at 2,378, some 8 points below Thursday's close. A brief squeeze to 2,384 soon gave way to the sellers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon said to have been among them. September continued to drift lower into the afternoon session, reaching 2,353 by 2.30pm, which proved to be the low point of the day. However, a buyer closing positions helped the contract reverse the downward trend, as did a firm Wall Street, and September eventually closed at 2,360 down 25 on its previous close and around its fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at over 9,000 contracts was helped by buying just before the official close. Traded options were dull with turnover reaching only 20,569 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,653 lots. BP was the busiest stock option at 1,140 lots and the January 200 calls the most active series.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BIAS AGAINST LESBIANS  </P> <P> I was very proud to be a part of the lesbian and gay contingent marching in the  Martin Luther King Jr. parade last weekend. At the same time I was impressed by  the commitment of those at the parade toward civil rights.  </P> <P> I was again reminded how individuals who are lesbian and gay do not have the  same protection under the law as other minorities.  </P> <P> I found it ironic, at the parade to celebrate civil rights, a lesbian friend of  mine could not march with our contingent because her employer is harassing her  because she is a lesbian. Her lawyer advised her not to be at events that would  identify her as a lesbian.  </P> <P> When I talk to groups and individuals about the problems of discrimination  against the lesbian and gay community, I am frequently told, "It doesn't matter  what you do in the bedroom but why do you have to make such a big deal about it  and flaunt it."  </P> <P> Flaunting it frequently means walking with my arm around my significant other  or being blatant by daring to hold hands with someone of the same sex, or while  at work talking about my relationship in the same way heterosexuals refer to  their partners. That is flaunting my being a lesbian.  </P> <P> For some reason, it is perfectly OK for heterosexuals to engage in these  behaviors in public and is usually thought to be cute or nice. Hmm, somehow it  doesn't fit.  </P> <P> Discrimination still happens in our country. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream is  still not a reality.  </P> <P> Agreed, the discrimination is more subtle than what occurs in South Africa. But  it occurs against people of color, against people of different religions, and  of various ethnic backgrounds. It is still legal in this country to  discriminate against lesbians and gays. The armed forces sanction the  discrimination; in some states, homosexuals have no right to privacy; and in  San Diego there is no recourse against discrimination due to one's sexual  orientation in many employment situations.  </P> <P> I am outraged that as a citizen of the United States who happens to be a  lesbian, I do not have equal protection under the Constitution, not special,  just equal.  </P> <P> The proposed "Human Dignity Ordinance" in the city of San Diego is just one  step in working toward equal protection. Until all people of this country are  free, none of us will be.  </P> <P> KAREN MARSHALL  </P> <P> Administrative director  </P> <P> Lesbian and Gay Men's Community Center  </P></p>

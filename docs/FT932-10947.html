			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares jump on alliance agreement SHARES IN Micro Focus climbed sharply yesterday on news that the Berkshire-based computer software company has agreed a newstrategic alliance with Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software house. The shares rose 65p to close at Pounds 20.68, halting a slide which has seen Micro Focus stock lose a third of its value over the past few months. The shares had previously risen dramatically since the shares became available to US investors through ADRs. The slide was apparently caused by concern that Microsoft might seek some variation in its licensing arrangements with Micro Focus, through which it has access to the UK company's software technology. Micro Focus is the world leader in software development tools, which enable programmers to design and develop programs in Cobol, the world's most popular business computer language, on personal computers. Microsoft has in fact agreed to stop selling its own Cobol development system, which incorporated Micro Focus technology, and will instead market the Micro Focus product. Micro Focus becomes a partner in Microsoft's Solution Providers program, which will give the company direct access to Microsoft information, training, tools and products, as well as the opportunity to resell the Microsoft product line.</p>

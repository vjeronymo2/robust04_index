			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Procrastination"] </F>   [Text] The ministers of the Twelve and their Austrian,  Finnish, and Swedish counterparts, who last week were clinking  their champaign glasses because they thought the path of  enlargement wide open, today are coming down a peg. There is  not only the accord with Norway which is still clashing with the  fisheries dossier, but also the Twelve's inability to agree on a  joint position with regard to the decisionmaking process in the  expanded Union. The latter threatens to endanger the current  timetable, in other words, to postpone enlargement beyond the  planned date of 1 January 1995. The British and the Spanish,  intent on a better protection of their national interests, want  a blocking minority that can more easily be reached than today;  the other 10 member states, including France, have an opposite  viewpoint and want to avoid a more cumbersome decisionmaking  process in the expanded Europe. The failure, which is  indicative of EU [European Union] frictions, is not yet  definitive: A new meeting has been planned on 15 March and, if  the Twelve find back to path of compromise, everything may still  work out well.    This dispute, however, indicates how hazardous it is to  pursue an enlargement of the Union without having previously  defined its goals and operational procedures. This precipitance  was deliberate on the part of the EU heads of state and  government, who are not really inclined to foment a difficult  debate at home until the contrary winds emanating from public  opinion as a result of the Maastricht Treaty have dropped.    The Commission did not have the courage to oppose this  procrastination which plays into the hands of the opponents of a  federal Europe. Thus, the British rather favor an enlargement  -- including the four European Free Trade Organization countries  today, and the central European countries at a later date --  which would virtually annihilate the political links provided  for in the Rome and Maastricht treaties and thrust the Union  into the direction of a free trade zone.    France did not want to oppose enlargement. It first  advocated institutional reforms to accompany the enlargement  process, but it renounced them in face of its partners'  opposition, thus giving the impression that it did not know  where it was going nor even were it wanted to go. Thus, the  playing ground is now open to those, especially in Germany, who  do no longer believe in the possibility of a political union in  Europe.    For 40 years, the French have orchestrated European  construction -- sometimes maybe in a way irritating others.  Their current failure creates a malaise, all the more so since  it is suspected to be due to conceptual impotence. Political  determination is often necessary, and, as we have seen during  the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia issue, no only at the  implementation the level.</p>

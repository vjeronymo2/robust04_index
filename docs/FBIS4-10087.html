			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The National Aeronautical Enterprise, Enaer,  will become a center for repairing the Casa-212 and 235  transportation airplanes, which are used mostly in the Latin  American countries.    The information was provided by engineer Raul Herranz, a  specialist in nuclear energy and president of Construcciones  Aeronauticas S.A., CASA, of Spain, which manufactures the  airplanes used in about 10 countries on the continent. [passage  omitted]    Herranz pointed out the high level of efficiency of Enaer,  which co-produces the advanced C-101 training airplane -- known  as the T- 36 Halcon -- in Chile, as well as the ability of its  engineers and support personnel who work in the arsenals.    He added: "This is why the Chilean company was chosen to  represent us in Latin America for the maintenance or repair of  all CASA products. We already have that commitment, which is  unique because no authorization of this type to an industry has  been given in any other part of the world."    He said the exchange of aeronautics technology between Spain  and Chile has been fluid, and this transfer of technology will  be strengthened soon with the signing of a new contract. He  added: "We are open to any type of cooperation with Enaer."</p>

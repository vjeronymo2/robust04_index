			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: NOT ONLY DOES HE UNDERSTAND, HE SHOWS HE CARES  </P> <P> Too often, the major league ballplayer is portrayed as a churlish, graceless  individual who comes into public view brushing the little kid autograph seeker  aside, refusing to pose for pictures, announcing irritatedly that all he owes  his public is a .293 average or an appearance at a baseball card show for which  he gets $10,000.  </P> <P> There are, to be sure, a few who fit this unflattering image. They take the $2  million and run. The fans' love is unrequited. The record books sometime  identify these worthies as most valuable players. The public concept of what  these letters stand for is quite different.  </P> <P> So, it gives me great pleasure today to check in with a different kind of a  story, the account of a major league player who belongs to the world at large,  is a citizen in good standing with the rest of the community, a man who cares.  </P> <P> So far as I know, Jim Abbott is the only man in a big league uniform ever to  win the Sullivan Award as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete. He's the  only one in a big league uniform who only has one hand. Jim Abbott is the only  reason I know of to be glad there's a designated hitter rule in the American  League.  </P> <P> We all know what kind of pitcher Jim Abbott is -- eight wins, six losses, 62  strikeouts in 101 2/3 innings, an ERA of 3.45. But I have a clipping from an  Indianapolis newspaper that shows what kind of a person he is.  </P> <P> The circumstances require a bit of explanation. On the morning of April 17,  little 5-year-old Erin Bower went with her mother to the local K mart store in  the Castleton Farms section of Indianapolis. There was this tube of toothpaste  on the counter. Erin picked it up. It exploded. Some cretin with a grudge  against the store -- or the world -- had placed a bomb in it.  </P> <P> It didn't kill Erin. It just blew off her left hand. You don't even want to  think about it.  </P> <P> In all the outpouring of sympathy for little Erin, one letter came marked with  the logo of the California Angels. It read:  </P> <P> "Dear Erin:  </P> <P> "Perhaps somewhere later in your lifetime you will properly understand this  letter and the feelings that go behind it. Regardless, I wanted to send  something along now after being made aware of your terrible accident.  </P> <P> "As your parents have probably told you, I was born without a right hand. That  automatically made me different from the other kids I was around. But you know  what? It made me different only in their eyes. You see, I figured that's what  the good Lord wanted me to work with. So it was my responsibility to become as  good as I could at whatever I chose to do, regardless of my handicap.  </P> <P> "I just won my first major league game. When the final out was made, a lot of  things went through my mind. I thought of my parents and all the help they  provided; my brother and his support; and all of my friends along the way. The  only thing, Erin, that I didn't pay attention to was my handicap. You see, it  had nothing to do with anything.  </P> <P> "You're a young lady now with a tremendous life ahead of you. Whether you want  to be an athlete, a doctor, lawyer or anything else, it will be up to you, and  only you, how far you go. Certainly there will be some tough times ahead, but  with dedication and love of life, you'll be successful in any field you choose.  I'll look forward to reading about you in the future.  </P> <P> "Again, my best, Jim Abbott, California Angels."  </P> <P> Now that, you have to say, is the way to get an autograph. And the news from  Indianapolis, as reported in the Star, is good: Erin, who turned 6 today, has  been fitted with an electrically-powered hand at the Medical Prosthetics Center  in Houston. It'll do everything a real hand will do -- except throw the curve.  If Erin wants to do that, she'll have to learn to do it with her other hand. As  Jim Abbott has shown, that's no problem.  </P></p>

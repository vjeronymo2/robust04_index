Reacting in Strasbourg to the conclusions of the Council of  Foreign Ministers, which on Monday in Brussels had asked for the  "immediate lifting" of the siege of Sarajevo but did not issue  an ultimatum and left the decision to NATO, Mr. Tindemans  stressed that the Europeans remained divided.    "This inability strips the Maastricht Treaty of its  credibility: the treaty precisely provides for the application  of a joint foreign and security policy, starting this year,"  underlined the former Belgian prime minister. He went on to  qualify the stance taken by the "Twelve" as "an example of cheap  phraseology."    Mr. Tindemans observed that the EU member states were  sheltering behind NATO. "That organization is at least  credible," he said, "but the same cannot be said of Community  policy."    The leader of the Christian Democrat group has for a long  time been saying that other measures ought to have been taken to  end the carnage in the former Yugoslavia. "If no measures are  implemented, then we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnian  Muslims," he said.</p>

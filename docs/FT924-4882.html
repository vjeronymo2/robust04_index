			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Isosceles may face third refinancing plan: Investment vehicle considers debt for equity rescue as trading slows at its food stores ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted management buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food stores, is considering its third restructuring plan, only a month after its second was approved by shareholders. According to one of its financial advisers, the group is 'actively considering a debt into equity rescue plan' because of its inability to make significant inroads into debts of more than Pounds 1.2bn. Trading has deteriorated at Gateway, which has more than 600 outlets. Isosceles is expected to announce in January that Gateway's operating profits for the half-year to November 9 have fallen to between Pounds 60m and Pounds 65m, against Pounds 93m in the comparative period. The trading performance of Gateway's mainstream stores continues to be well below budget. Any new refinancing would have to be agreed by Wasserstein Perella, which has an inbuilt majority of A shares giving it a veto over any new proposals. One of the group's financial advisers said: 'We would obviously hope to avoid a new refinancing package. 'Not only would it be very expensive but Wasserstein Perella's support is by no means guaranteed. But since the debt is still so high it has to be actively considered,' he added. The group's immediate problems stem from its inability to make asset sales to reduce borrowings. Following last month's sale of its Wellworth subsidiary, the Northern Irish supermarket chain, Isosceles' net debt has fallen below Pounds 1.3bn. Wellworth was sold for Pounds 122m, a price below earlier hopes. But further delays in selling Herman's Sporting Goods, its US subsidiary, is likely to require agreement from the banks to defer principal debt repayments. In the year to April, Isosceles wrote off Pounds 145m from the value of Herman's leaving its net assets at about Pounds 50m. Only last month a buyer, believed to have been Odyssey, a New York based buy-out capital group, pulled out after being at an advanced stage of negotiations. The group is still looking for buyers for Herman's, but is understood to be no nearer to pulling off a deal. If Gateway's trading continues to deteriorate the group's banks may also be asked to waive covenants. While Isosceles is not in breach of its covenants at the moment its financial advisers fear a breach could occur next January if the results are as bad as expected. However, Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who recently took over Mr Bob Willett's role as chief executive of Gateway, is understood to believe that Wasserstein Perella may have to be persuaded to agree to a third refinancing agreement. Mr Mitchell-Innes, who is also chief executive of Isosceles and chairman of Gateway, hopes that Wasserstein Perella will recognise the depth of the problems and not block a debt to equity conversion if a third refinancing is needed.</p>

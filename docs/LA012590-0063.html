			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOUL OF 'WRITERS ROW' SHINES THROUGH  </P> <P> I was struck by the juxtaposition of two articles on the front page of the Jan.  10 View section: "Writers Row" about homeless artists and their struggle to  keep the muse alive despite the agonies of poverty, and "Passions Grounded in  Shoes" about women who collect large numbers of ultra-expensive designer shoes.  </P> <P> I would not suggest that these women refrain from indulging in their passion.  But, perhaps, in a spirit of social responsibility, they could find it in their  hearts to donate the boxes the shoes come in to the less fortunate who may find  them useful for repairing holes in the ceilings of their cardboard apartments.  </P> <P> DONNA BURKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

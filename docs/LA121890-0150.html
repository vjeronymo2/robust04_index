			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> AN AGE OF CHALLENGE AND MYSTERY  </P> <P> The ending of the Cold War has plunged the globe into a period of rapid and  pervasive change. As old tyrannies and antagonisms dissolve, new freedoms and  opportunities blossom.  </P> <P> Yet there is a paradox. New tensions are rising, seemingly rushing to fill a  vacuum.  </P> <P> Last week's special edition of World Report examined two challenges to the  post-Cold War world: how the ability to wield economic power, through control  of technology and markets, will determine who leads the industrialized world;  and how democracy, even in its hour of triumph, faces untold new pressures  around the globe.  </P> <P> This week, World Report explores the powerful forces that are now challenging  the dominant cultural and sociopolitical trends of the 20th Century: explosive  ethnic and national movements that contest some of the most fundamental  premises of modern statehood; vibrant religious movements that deny the  "truths" of the secular age; and the spread of weaponry that alters the very  concept of "superpower."  </P> <P> It looks to the death of the world's last empires, and the birth of a  post-modern age of challenge and mystery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shifting Realities in Global Power  </P> <P> War: What happens when ancient ethnic feuds go modern with chemical arms and  other high-tech weaponry?  </P> <P> Religion: Who determines God's will when fervent, well-armed men disagree?  </P> <P> Society: What's the future of chaotic megacities in which squatters outnumber  residents?  </P> <P> Geopolitics: How do spheres of influence change when the Third World can  suddenly target the First with long-range missiles?  </P> <P> Peace: Can the world find unity when so many of its peoples want to divide?  </P></p>

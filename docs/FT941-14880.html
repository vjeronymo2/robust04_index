			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Scottish fund managers with an eye on expansion - James Buxton examines the differing approaches as Edinburgh chases the US business hard Mr Iain Watt is in no doubt about it. 'I'd be a liar if I said that being Scottish wasn't an asset in marketing ourselves in the US,' he says. 'We capitalise on the respectability of Edinburgh. Mr Watt is chief executive of Edinburgh Fund Managers, the quoted investment management company based in the Scottish capital. It is now opening a small office in Atlanta, Georgia, to tap the US market for fund management services. As US pension funds diversify from their historical concentration on North American stock exchanges - nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.7bn) of pension fund assets flowed out of the US in the first half of 1993 alone - British fund managers are winning some of the international fund management business being generated, because of their experience in overseas markets, especially in east Asia. Edinburgh, Britain's main centre of fund management expertise after London, is chasing the US business hard. Fund managers such as Dunedin, Baillie Gifford and Martin Currie each have more than Dollars 1bn of US pension fund money under management. While all the Scottish fund managers make the investment decisions at head office, they differ in the way they operate in the US, and in whether or not they play the Scottish card. EFM currently manages only Dollars 200m on behalf of US clients and Mr Watt admits that its initial approach to the US market was wrong. For six years it was in a joint venture with Wilmington Trust, a US fund manager. 'The joint venture just confused the clients,' says Mr Watt. Last month it was dissolved. The company has now learned the lesson absorbed six years ago by Dunedin which, with Dollars 1.7bn worth of US money under management, is probably by a short head the most successful Scottish fund manager in the US. 'If someone else does your marketing for you, you don't do yourself justice,' says Mr Alan Kemp, deputy chief executive. Dunedin, 50 per cent owned by the British Linen Bank, part of Bank of Scotland, now has an office in Chicago employing five people to service clients. But presentations to the pension fund consultants who choose the fund managers are made by senior executives who fly out from Scotland. Mr Kemp says that it requires long lead times to make progress in the US fund management market. 'It can take several years for the consultants to feel comfortable with you. But after a certain point the money begins to flow. Dunedin, he says, owes much of its success to its investment record in Japanese and other east Asian markets, which is where it places most of the money it raises in the US. 'The US fund management market is highly professional and consultants are ruthless about performance. They really dismantle you. Even though a remarkable number of Americans claim some Scottish ancestry or have an affection for Scotland, Mr Kemp says Dunedin does not stress its Scottishness. 'They're not going to award you a fund management contract just because you're wearing a kilt. At Baillie Gifford, Mr Ross Lidstone, marketing director for US pension funds, agrees. 'I don't think people pick Scottish fund managers because they are Scottish. 'We sell ourselves as international investment managers who happen to be located in Scotland. But we do stress the advantages of being in Edinburgh: I see those as low staff turnover (the clients like to see the same people), and expertise based on international fund management going back to the 19th century. Baillie Gifford does not have an office in the US, doing all its marketing on visits from Scotland and inviting the clients to Edinburgh. 'Americans like to see the home office of the fund manager and meet a wider selection of people in the firm. They couldn't do that at an office in Chicago.' Baillie Gifford took about five years to make an impact in the US where it began operating in 1983. But last year alone, however, it gained Dollars 500m of new business and took in Dollars 200m from existing clients, bringing its US total up to Dollars 1.6bn - more than a tenth of the company's total funds under management of Pounds 10.1bn, or Dollars 14.9bn. At Martin Currie Mr James Dawnay, marketing director, says the company has been rebuilding its US operations since 1990, having started there in the 1970s before turning away to the UK pension market. 'We've grown dramatically in the US in the past 18 months and now manage about Dollars 1.4bn from there, using a marketing group in Connecticut to open doors for us. We don't hype up Edinburgh and Scotland but it helps differentiate us from London. What we sell is our ability to manage global equity portfolios with a bias towards smaller markets.' Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager which recently sold itself to United Asset Management of the US, handles its US operations through Murray Johnstone International, with an office in Chicago. Murray Johnstone International is a smaller participant in the US fund management market than the big three Edinburgh houses, but has pushed up its assets under management from Dollars 230m in 1990 to about Dollars 800m. Ivory &amp; Sime, the quoted Edinburgh fund management house which is now doing better after a few years of internal turmoil, manages Dollars 600m of US money, half of it from pension funds. It has a joint venture called Ivory &amp; Sime International in Chatham, New Jersey, with a US partner. Mr George Walker, marketing director, admits Ivory &amp; Sime had suffered in the US from the rapidly changing faces of its managers, but says things have stabilised in the last few years. 'Americans do like to see the same face,' he acknowledges.</p>

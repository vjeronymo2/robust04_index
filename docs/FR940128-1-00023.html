			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Preparing for HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA recognizes that this proposal involves a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> departure from current practices for most processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers and intends to work cooperatively with the industry in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the establishment of this proposed system. The agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences under both its HACCP-based low acid canned food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and the HACCP-based pilot programs for seafood that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it conducted with NOAA in 1991 demonstrate the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation and technical support between the agency and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry in order to establish HACCP and to make it work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA/NOAA joint pilot programs involved the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and implementation of HACCP-based systems by seafood processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and HACCP-based inspections by the two agencies. Even though the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA/NOAA pilots involved highly motivated seafood firms that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volunteered to adopt HACCP, the firms found it difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially to identify hazards and critical control points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with their own products and processes (Ref. 40). As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the agencies and the firms discovered, HACCP involved new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ways of thinking and behaving that were not readily understood or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented. A considerable amount of consultation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance between the firms and the Government proved to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely helpful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This experience reinforces the view that regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose a HACCP-based system are needed for the seafood industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thus represents a third factor supporting the appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this proposal. The systematic kind of preventive thinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HACCP requires is not universal, but it can be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations will ensure that processors and importers do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significantly, once participants in the pilot programs made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition to HACCP, they were able to identify benefits from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using HACCP to themselves and to consumers in terms of product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and quality, as well as plant sanitation and organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 40).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. International Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although not a public health issue, international trade is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also a major consideration in determining the advisability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of a new system of seafood regulation and therefore will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be addressed here. It is estimated that close to 40 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fish and shellfish harvested from the world's oceans, lakes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other bodies of water entered international trade in 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 41). This movement reflects the need to match supplies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with demand. Nations often have species in their waters for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which there is little or no demand among their consumers, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers in other countries may prefer these species. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, sometimes foreign markets are willing to pay higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices than domestic markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participation in the international trade in seafood is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical to U.S. consumers and industry. Approximately 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the U.S. supply of edible seafood is imported. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991, 3,014,819,000 pounds were imported, worth $5,617,887,000,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making the United States the world's second largest seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importing nation (Ref. 42).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Japan and the US are streets ahead Sir, While it is true that under the Prometheus programme ('The new road sense': December 8) European companies have done a reasonable amount of research into navigation and other intelligent guidance systems, there has been a woeful lack of follow-through into manufacture. By contrast, Rockwell of the United States already dominates the market for the electronic engines for navigation systems used in boats and cars, and since it developed the specialised chips itself, is likely to remain so. It gained its knowledge as the architect of the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) for the US Department of Defence - paid for by the US taxpayer, but turned into a big business. This is now the heart of all car navigation systems. Several US companies are already producing navigation systems for cars, and as Toyota's chairman Shoichiro Toyoda pointed out, over half a million such sets have already been produced and sold in Japan. In addition, there is already a system in which information is sent to subscribing drivers about traffic congestion in Tokyo. The information is verbal, but the network of beacons for a more advanced system is already planned. By contrast, the Philips Carin system becomes an option on the BMW 7 Series next spring. Clearly, Europe is years behind in this area. Apart from the Dollars 200m US automated highway project mentioned, several other projects are under way in the US, including one to determine the protocols for all traffic information - this is sorely needed in Europe. TRW and Amerigon are among the US companies that are ready to supply radar units as the heart of collision avoidance or intelligent cruise control systems. Amerigon claims its model will cost less than Dollars 10 a unit. US companies are not just talking research, they are investigating the practical and legal implications of such systems, and readying them for production - and so are the Japanese. When it comes to turning electronics projects into production and profits, the Japanese and Americans are miles ahead of the Europeans.

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FARM CHIEF URGES TRADE REFORM  </P> <P> U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter called today for countries to  push for farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round of multinational trade talks.  </P> <P> In a speech to Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, Yeutter said one of  his principle objectives in the Uruguay Round, which ends in December, is the  elimination of subsidies that distort global trade in agriculture.  </P> <P> Yeutter said talks have stalled in past years because the agricultural sector  of most nations is a strong political force, making reform difficult.  </P> <P> "Agriculture is a tough issue. We have been trying to negotiate better GATT  rules on agriculture for 40 years without success," he said, referring to the  Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Hopefully, we will have  some success this time for the first time ever."  </P></p>

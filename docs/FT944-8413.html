			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Travel: Paris match, Breton-style It strikes me as odd that a bride should take a pair of scissors and cut up her dress at her wedding reception. Could it be that this is the essential difference between a French and a British wedding? But there are other distinctions to be considered. I was at the marriage of a young Parisian couple in Tregrom, a village in Brittany's Cotes d'Armor. Formality was shunned. They were married by a farmer, the groom doubled up as a car park attendant, there were no boring speeches and no wedding cake. 'Le mariage' is a non-secular affair across France, signed and sealed in 10 minutes at the town hall. In Tregrom, the mayor is a farmer so it was his job to rubber- stamp this occasion. But Tregrom's chunky grey stone 15th century church did have a role to play  -if only to provide a fine photo opportunity for camera-laden guests. The bride, a literature student at the Sorbonne, her stylish white halter-neck bodice and flouncy, full-length layered dress still intact, wandered down the aisle unannounced while her husband, an engineer, finished a cigarette outside. Just before the blessing the priest signalled to those with cameras to step up to the altar so that they might get a better view. I looked round the church: the 100-strong congregation wore mostly casual dress. Some wore colourful suits, but there were few hats and no tails. A Breton pipe band, called the Sons of Plouaret - a trio of chubby pensioners from a nearby town with ruddy, smiling faces - led the procession from the church playing. The next time I saw the groom he was standing in a wet field. We had been part of a convoy of cars which had weaved its way through tiny country lanes to the reception. In keeping with French tradition we tooted our horns at anything that moved: an oncoming tractor, nonchalant farmers, hyperactive sheep dogs and grazing cows. The convoy halted sharply. We had arrived. It was chaos. Too many cars and not enough field. And there was the groom, arms waving, directing cars into hedgerows. Meanwhile, an apparently unperturbed chef was sitting in a pit roasting a pig on a spit. We were in a romantic valley at a large converted 15th century mill house, owned by the bridegroom's family. The river Leguer flows through forest turning a huge, wooden water wheel. Another English guest asked me: 'Do you think this is going to be like one of those French films where you find clandestine couples in every corner?' I could find no evidence of free love but plenty of free champagne. Enough to occupy 200 guests for two hours. But something was definitely going on in the mushroom house. A psychedelic orgy? No, it was the venue for a sumptuous five-course feast. This vast construction had been converted in to an ornate dining hall with a dance floor and bar at one end. Even the concrete floor was decorated - hand-painted by the bridegroom's youngest sister. The happy couple sat with friends - elder family members were relegated to other tables. We ate ham, chicken pate, salad with prawns, rice and salmon, the roasted pork, camembert and chevre, chocolate gateaux and redcurrant and blackcurrant mousse. It was drunk with copious quantities of Muscadet and Chateau Larcharas. Whenever anyone felt like it, they jumped to their feet and burst into song. Most were rowdy, old school numbers I could not translate. After the bridegroom had performed a tangled ceremony with several guests which involved drinking numerous glasses of red wine then wiping his mouth on their sleeves, the bride stood up and declared: 'Le marie est propre]' This is a soul-cleansing exercise and not just an excuse to get inebriated. The bride turned to me adding: 'Il boit comme un trou]' (he drinks like a hole). I will not forget the scene at 5am. The bride was dancing freely in her adulterated wedding dress, cut to above the knee. A cluster of inebriated men were bobbing around with the remains of her skirt draped over their heads.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Drugs investment drive eyes Japan The government will today announce a campaign designed to develop substantially Japanese investment in the UK pharmaceuticals and biotechnology sectors. It is the first attempt by ministers and leaders of the pharmaceuticals industry to take advantage of Britain's successful bid to house the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. The agency will manage the European Union's new system of medicines licensing that comes into force next month, and its location in London could prove a magnet for new pharmaceuticals investment. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and a team of senior representatives from the pharmaceuticals industry will visit Japan in March to try to sell the message of Prescribe UK, a joint inward investment campaign being launched by the government and industry today. Mrs Bottomley and the industry team will also travel to the US in the spring, but Japan is seen as the main target for their efforts. She said yesterday: 'We have to demonstrate that the factors which have led to successful Japanese manufacturing investment in the UK apply even more strongly to pharmaceuticals.' Britain's drugs industry is already substantial by world standards, and includes many subsidiaries of overseas companies. The UK market for medicines totalled Pounds 4.9bn last year, while 10 of the world's top 35 prescribed medicines were discovered and developed in the UK. Britain accounts for about 12 per cent of the international export market in medicines, and a third of all European biotechnology companies are located in the UK. The Prescribe UK team believes Britain has extra advantages to offer pharmaceutical investors that are sometimes overlooked. These include the National Health Service - the world's biggest healthcare organisation - which by its size offers unique opportunities for research and teaching in the use of new drug techniques. Mrs Bottomley said: 'The government worked with the industry to win the medicines evaluation agency for Britain. Many of the arguments that helped our success in that campaign, like our excellent communications and the use of English as the international language of the pharmaceuticals industry, also make a strong case for greater inward investment in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.'</p>

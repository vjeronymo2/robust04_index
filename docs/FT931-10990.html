			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Receivers act to allow truck plant to restart LIMITED production resumed yesterday at Leyland Daf's truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, as the receivers reactivated component supply lines that had been stopped on Tuesday when the truck group collapsed. The 2,000 employees at Leyland Daf's van plant, at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, are to resume production today. In Amsterdam, Daf said it expects regular production at its Eindhoven and Westerlo truck facilities to re-start on Monday. At present both its Dutch and Belgian truck plants are suffering parts shortages. As the UK plants began returning to life, Daf said the receivers of Leyland Daf would be travelling to Daf headquarters at Eindhoven 'in the near future' for consultations. Meanwhile, all 5,500 of Leyland Daf's employees were at their workplaces yesterday and its UK network of 54 dealers were told that they could take and place orders. The Leyland plant produced only a handful of trucks yesterday because of the components shortage. 'But the situation has been getting easier throughout the day,' said one employee. A spokesman for Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the receivers, said the intention was to resume 'business as normal' as quickly as possible while alternative strategies for the future of the UK operations were studied. He indicated that an initial assessment of whether and how the UK operations might be put on the market could be in place by early next week. More than half of the UK dealer network has pledged to continue at their its own expense to undertake warranty and other work ordinarily payable by Leyland Daf, in a show of continued support for the truckmaker. Meanwhile, some big fleet customers such as the Royal Mail and Parcelforce were understood to be standing by substantial orders already placed with Leyland Daf. Leyland Daf unions yesterday also kept up pressure on the government, demanding an early meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to discuss ways of preserving the company. Mr John Allen, chief negotiator with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said up to 18,000 jobs could be lost, taking component and other suppliers into account, if Leyland Daf went into liquidation. Such an assessment is not seen as an exaggeration by most motor industry analysts. Mr Allen said the losses would be even worse if the Leyland Daf dealer network, which employs just over 5,000 people, should collapse. But that may not be likely. 'We would have no problem surviving - there are other franchises which would love to snap us up,' said a director of North-east Leyland Daf, the country's largest Daf dealer.</p>

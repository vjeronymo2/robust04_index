			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Spotlight turns on Gas Light The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, is to investigate the arrangements by which Australian Gas Light is permitted to haul natural gas from the Cooper Basin in South Australia to heavily-populated east coast areas, writes Nikki Tait. The company is a quoted utility and the country's largest natural gas pipeline company. The TPC said it would draw on a separate Industry Commission study, to be completed by December 14, which will look at changes in gas industry operations.</p>

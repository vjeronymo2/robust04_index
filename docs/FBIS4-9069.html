			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 19 (ATA) -- Through a letter of April  18, 1994, Ronaldo Sardenberg, chairman of the Security Council  Committee created by the 724 Resolution on the former Yugoslavia  (Serbia and Montenegro), expressed its thanks to the Albanian  Government with regard to its stands towards violations of the  embargo by other ships, which have been detained and  investigated by Albanian authorities.    The committee expresses in particular its appreciation for  the good cooperation of the Albanian Government with the embargo  assistance mission in Albania. The letter says that the  investigations of the Albanian Government into the case of the  "Vela Luka" ship and other cases have been considered by the  committee as ample facts proving the violation of the embargo by  foreign ships.    The committee has been informed by Albanian authorities for  the "Valio" ship with 1,200 tons of gasoline, which tried to  enter Yugoslavia, thus violating the embargo.</p>

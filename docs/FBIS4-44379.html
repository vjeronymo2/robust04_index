			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ann-Leena Mikiver and Ragnar Roos: "Tactical </F> Voters Will Decide Election"]    [Text] This fall's election will be decided by the small  parties. With four parties hovering around the 4-percent  barrier, glorious days are ahead for party strategists.  Receiving 3.9 percent of the vote will mean having no seats and  being out in the cold, while 4.1 percent will mean 14 seats and  a chance at cooperation in the government. The difference  amounts to about 150,000 votes.    If, for example, New Democracy splits and disappears from  the  Riksdag, that will presumably wreck the only chance for a  government across the bloc boundary -- meaning, in fact, a  coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the  Liberal Party.    New Democracy's future will probably be decided as early as  this weekend, when the party holds its special congress. With  the party standing at about 2 percent in the polls, its party  group split into three factions, and a palace revolution under  way against the party leader, the odds do not look good.    But this does not necessarily mean that the party is on its  way out. That depends on how skillful it is at persuading  "tactical voters."    The reason is that all four small parties are swarming with  tactical voters, who are fickle by nature.    A full four out of every 10 New Democracy voters actually  favored a different party in the last election, according to a  voter poll by election researchers Mikael Gilljam and Soren  Holmberg. The most common case was that of a Moderate Party  voter who voted for New Democracy just to get fresh faces in the  Riksdag.    The Green Party's electorate also includes a great many  unfaithful voters. One-fourth of its voters actually favored  some other party -- in this case mostly the Liberal Party or the  Social Democratic Party [SDP].    Of the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] voters, 14 percent  actually favored another party -- not unexpectedly, the Moderate  Party. On the other hand, the Left Party, which by tradition has  always had a large element of tactical voters, has lost some of  its attractiveness in recent elections. Among those who voted  for it in 1991, only 10 percent were SDP supporters. That has  favored the Social Democrats.    The question, then, is what the tactical voters will do in  this fall's election: Will they abandon a sinking ship or put  their votes on the line to save it?    Things look brightest for the Left Party. Although that  party  has not yet benefited to any great extent from the wind blowing  to the left, it has the longest tradition of tactical voting. It  is strange, however, that the Left Party has not done better at  exploiting the feminist winds that are blowing, especially since  the party's leader is a woman. For the moment, it seems that  women prefer the SDP and the Liberal Party. It is also true that  Gudrun Schyman lacks Lars Werner's folksiness, and she will  probably never equal him in popularity.    With the child care allowance, the KDS has lost its only  distinctive issue in this fall's election. "Further  improvements" is a message that presumably will not sell as  well. The KDS will no doubt be wiser to become the  nonsocialists' "comrade 4 percent." Alf Svensson will presumably  be able to attract votes by standing out as a more obvious  supporter of a nonsocialist (Moderate) government than Olof  Johansson and Bengt Westerberg.    Both the Left Party and the KDS are helped by the fact that  they have taken a clear stand on the government issue. This  fall's election will be between two clear alternatives for  government, and the focus will be on the big issues: the economy  and unemployment.    The Green Party has cleared away most of its internal  conflicts, and that should bring some of its voters back. But  the party is empty-handed on economic issues, its profile is  fuzzy, its right wing from 1988 has still not returned, and its  set of leaders is a little weak.    "The party must come across properly in the media, otherwise  it probably won't succeed," says Mikael Gilljam.    What about New Democracy, then? Well, if the party still  exists in its present form after this weekend's special  congress, it will presumably have to make a big effort.    "It will probably be saved only if Bert Karlsson takes  command and succeeds in attracting conservative opponents of the  EU [European Union]," says Mikael Gilljam.  <H5>  Strong and Weak Points of Small Parties </H5>   The Left Party (leader: Gudrun Schyman) is in an extremely  strong position in terms of its opposition to the EU, and its  stands on the environment and women's issues are strong points.  It is neither strong nor weak as "comrade 4 percent." Schyman is  a weak point. Faithful tactical voters may save the day for this  party, although their numbers are dwindling.    The Green Party (leader: Birger Schlaug) is in a very strong  position in terms of its opposition to the EU and its stands on  the environment and the bridge over the Sound, but is extremely  weak in that it has not chosen sides and from the standpoint  that it is a single-issue party. The party probably needs a  nuclear accident, a couple of dead seals, or a comeback by Asa  Domeij.    The KDS (leader: Alf Svensson) is in a strong position in  terms of its family policy and a very strong position as a  "nonsocialist guarantor." Its stand in support of Christian  morality is an extremely weak point, and its stand on the child  care allowance is also a weak point. Having Alf Svensson as its  leader is an extremely strong point. The child care allowance is  dead as an election issue, although the KDS will certainly try  to revive it once again.    New Democracy (leader: Harriet Colliander) is extremely weak  from the standpoint of its internal split, its leadership  crisis, and its fuzzy profile. Its stand on the refugee issue is  an extremely strong point. As things stand now, there is no  chance that the party will win any seats in the Riksdag.  <H5>  Forming New Government May Be Harder Than Ever </H5>   Forming a new government after this fall's election may be  more complicated than ever. The more small parties there are  that clear the 4-percent hurdle and win seats in the Riksdag,  the more possibilities there will be for forming a government  coalition.    From a purely technical standpoint, the procedure for  equalizing representation in the Riksdag may create problems if  three or four parties end up just above the 4-percent mark. In  such a case, the 39 seats set aside for the equalization  procedure will probably not suffice for ensuring a completely  proportional distribution of seats.    In that case, the formation of a government may depend on  which parties end up under- or overrepresented.    In the present situation, three main alternatives emerge as  far as the government issue is concerned:    First, the four-party coalition could continue in power.  Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg has stated firmly that he  is not willing to be part of another nonsocialist minority  government dependent upon New Democracy. If Westerberg keeps his  word, what it will mean in practice is that the only chance for  the four-party coalition's survival will be New Democracy's  departure from the Riksdag. It seems completely unrealistic to  think that the four parties will win their own majority and that  the New Democrats will manage at the same time to remain in the  Riksdag.    This means that from the purely technical standpoint of  forming a government, hara-kiri by the New Democrats would make  it easier for the four-party coalition to survive. Where New  Democracy's former voters would go after that is another  question.    This alternative would also require that Alf Svensson and  his  Christian Democrats persuade their voters that they are needed  in the Riksdag for another term. The very best solution, of  course, would be for the Left Party to pack its bags and for the  Green Party to have to stay in its dandelion patch.    Second, the Social Democrats could form a government on  their  own. If they win their own majority, it will be just a matter of  moving ahead. But even though they are doing well in the opinion  polls, it is not likely that they will receive more than 50  percent of the vote in this election.    But if they win such a large majority on their own that no  other constellation of parties can form a majority, they could  form a minority government with one or more supporting parties.    In that case, it would be preferable for both the KDS and  New  Democracy to lose their representation in the Riksdag. On the  other hand, it would be best if the Left Party, which has  traditionally been the guarantor of a Social Democratic minority  government, were to remain in the Riksdag. Gudrun Schyman can  hope that "comrade 4 percent" is still functioning.    Alternatively, the Social Democrats would have to seek  support from a Green Party willing to negotiate. That is  probably a considerably less attractive alternative.    After a Social Democratic government is actually formed, it  can seek support from the Liberal Party or the Center Party on  specific issues.    Third, a government across the bloc boundary will be formed  only if none of the other alternatives is possible. In this  case, the most likely alliance would be one between the Social  Democrats and the Liberal Party. Bengt Westerberg and Ingvar  Carlsson have similar views on the public sector and on welfare  policy. The Center Party might also be brought into the  government, but that is less likely.    But this alternative is based on the assumption that the  Liberal Party will do well in the election and at least equal  its 1991 results. The Liberal Party can scarcely enter a  coalition government with the Social Democrats if it does worse  this time than it did in 1991. It will also have to be wooed  with a fairly fat offer giving it considerably more influence  than its size warrants.    A government across the bloc boundary will be more likely if  neither the Left Party nor the Green Party clears the 4-percent  hurdle and if New Democracy hangs on in the Riksdag.  <H5>  Guide for Tactical Voters </H5>   If the KDS wins seats in the Riksdag but New Democracy, the  Green Party, and the Left Party do not, the probable result will  be a nonsocialist four-party coalition.    If the Left Party and the Green Party win seats but the KDS  and New Democracy do not, the probable result will be a Social  Democratic government.    If New Democracy wins seats but the Left Party and the Green  Party do not, the probable result will be a government across  the bloc boundary.    If the KDS and the Left Party win seats but New Democracy  does not, it is probable that neither bloc will have the  advantage.</p>

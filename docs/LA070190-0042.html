			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD UC ADMISSIONS SET ETHNIC AND RACIAL GOALS?;  </P> <P> STANDARDS MUST REMAIN HIGH  </P> <P> California legislators will be unable to confront some of the more serious  issues facing higher education unless they drop the notion that equality means  every ethnic group must be proportionally represented in our state  universities.  </P> <P> If passed, Assemblyman Tom Hayden's bill would require the University of  California's nine campuses, the 19 institutions of the state university system  and all 100 community colleges "strive to approximate, by the year 2000, the  general ethnic, gender, economic and regional compositions of recent high  school graduates, both in first-year classes and subsequent college and  university graduating classes."  </P> <P> A further provision of the bill is the continued use of "special admissions  standards" to increase enrollment proportions of minority students not eligible  for admission to UC through the "regular" admissions categories.  </P> <P> Although the bill's language is imprecise, its general intent seems clear:  California's colleges and universities should guarantee the "right" proportion  of minority students in the freshman class and then, once enrolled, take steps  to ensure their successful graduation.  </P> <P> But there are two immediate and stubborn problems. The first involves the  distressing dropout rate of minority students admitted to the University of  California, because of a policy that admits many students with insufficient  academic qualifications who then leave without graduating. The second problem  revolves around increased demands nationally for higher standards for both  teachers and students. Yet, efforts to raise educational standards run up  against the certainty that, whatever standard is set, some people will not be  able to meet it.  </P> <P> The problem is exacerbated by ethnic, economic and racial factors. Stated  simply, a greater percentage of blacks and Latinos fail than whites and Asians  and, of late, more blacks than Latinos. Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer has  said any attempt to apply a high standard of competence across the board means  more blacks fail. Sadly, that is happening to a discouragingly large number of  blacks in institutions of higher education.  </P> <P> Thus, the raising of standards comes into direct conflict with the effort to  reach "parity" -- to achieve proportions of blacks and Latinos at each level of  the educational system that roughly match their proportions in the population  at large.  </P> <P> More alarming are critics such as Charles Willie, a professor of education at  Harvard, who says "excellence" should not be the primary concern of the  university because it serves to exclude minorities. Instead, he says, the  university should be concerned with "adequacy." Any talk of a master  university, he insists, smacks of a master race.  </P> <P> Willie adds that many whites who are highly qualified will have to make room  for those qualified on the basis of other kinds of "intelligence." He  acknowledges that white and Asian students with straight-A averages were turned  away from UC Berkeley, an action he claims is justified in the name of  "diversity." As for the way universities hire their faculty, Willie says they  should not choose the "best," but should instead give precedence to minority  candidates who fall within the range of adequacy.  </P> <P> Willie's recommendations to "rescue" members of minority groups from the  requirements and standards of academic excellence are a sure recipe for  mediocrity. Such proposals -- no matter how often they are bathed in the warm  light of "diversity" and "pluralism" -- are demeaning to minority students who  do not wish to be treated as exceptions to legitimate academic requirements.  </P> <P> There is also something terribly wrong about an affirmative-action "parity"  principle when, in the name of group equity, the percentage of whites in the  fall, 1989, Berkeley freshman class is only 32% -- even though they comprise  about 60% of California's public high-school graduates and almost 70% of those  academically eligible for admission to the UC system.  </P> <P> Everyone wants to see growing numbers of students from under-represented groups  in the freshman class. The question, however, is whether this commendable goal  should replace the principles of individual achievement, merit and academic  excellence as the primary criteria for university admissions.  </P> <P> Both Legislators and educators should concentrate less on the body count of  minority students admitted to Berkeley or UCLA and more on assuring that those  admitted can do the work and will graduate. The real challenge to California's  top universities is whether they can improve the education of all students to  the point where there can be diversity without a racially-based lowering of  performance standards or a decline in intellectual quality.  </P></p>

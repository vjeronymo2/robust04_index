			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / People: British Council picks deputy dg The British Council has appointed John Hanson as director-general, it was announced at yesterday's annual general meeting. Hanson, 53, was previously deputy director-general and had been acting director-general since the death of Sir Richard Francis in June. A graduate of Wadham College, Oxford, Hanson is a career civil servant who has spent most of his working life with the Council. Having become a fluent Arabic speaker during his second posting abroad in the Lebanon, he went on to be the Council's director in Bahrain and a cultural counsellor in Iran in the period leading up to the downfall of the Shah. His first and final postings abroad were to India. During his four years as deputy director-general, Hanson was responsible for developing and leading the Council's strategy for repositioning itself. This led to a radical re-appraisal of planning, management, personnel and financial systems. The decision to appoint Hanson as director-general won the unanimous backing of the Board of the Council and the warm endorsement of the Foreign Secretary, according to Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the Council. The post, advertised nationally, attracted 257 applications; 34 were interviewed and Hanson selected from a shortlist of three. ***** Haagen-Dazs, one of the UK's most successful ice cream brands despite having been launched just over one year ago, has lost its UK managing director, Justin King. Owned by Grand Metropolitan, Haagen-Dazs has prided itself on a successful high profile ad campaign which has gained much attention for its use of sexual teasing. So could King's demise thus be related to the ad campaign? Not at all, says Tony McGrath, managing director of Haagen-Dazs north Europe. 'We parted company by mutual agreement, following a disagreement over the future direction for the company.' ***** Tony Belisario is to become managing director of an enlarged Dowty Electronic Systems and Components, part of TI Group since it was bought in June. Belisario was with Dowty Defence and Air Systems and Dowty Fuel Systems before leaving to join GEC Aerospace. Geoff Bicknell has been appointed finance director, joining the division from Lucas. As part of the same management reorganisation, Colin Cocks is to move from managing director of Electronic Systems to vice chairman of Dowty, with responsibility for government relations. ***** Nigel Rudd, 45, chairman of Williams Holdings, is stepping down as non-executive chairman of Raine Industries and becomes deputy chairman. Peter Parkin, 46, Raine's current chief executive, will take over as full-time executive chairman after the agm. David Vincent, 49, md of Raine's Hall &amp; Tawse division, takes over as group md. He has spent 32 years in the construction industry, primarily with Aberdeen Construction which was acquired by Raine in 1987. Rudd intends to continue to take an active role; he will be a member of the audit committee and chair the remuneration committee.</p>

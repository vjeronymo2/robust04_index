			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;LS' DEPOSIT DRAIN REACHES NEAR-RECORD $9.4 BILLION IN MONTH  </P> <P> The heavy drain of funds from the nation's savings and loan associations  persisted during February, with total withdrawals of $9.4 billion, federal  regulators announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The month's outflow was only a slight improvement from the record withdrawal of  $10.6 billion during January, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.  </P> <P> The discouraging news came as a congressional subcommittee moved to strengthen  the federal government's powers to override state regulators, who have been  blamed for costly S&amp;L failures in California and Texas.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will become the principal regulator for  state-chartered S&amp;Ls under an amendment adopted Thursday by the financial  institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee. The panel is working  on a bill proposed by President Bush for the multibillion-dollar rescue of the  federal fund that insures deposits at S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> FDIC, already a key regulator for banks, will assume the same role for S&amp;Ls  as part of the legislation.  </P> <P> In 1982, the California Legislature gave S&amp;Ls virtually unlimited authority  to make investments outside their normal business of home mortgage lending.  Some S&amp;Ls suffered big financial losses on such diverse ventures as  restaurants, horse breeding farms, apartments, condominiums and shopping  centers, and windmills to generate electricity.  </P> <P> "We destroyed our financial institutions during a boom," said Rep. Richard H.  Lehman (D-Sanger), a Banking Committee member. The S&amp;L industry was given  total investment freedom through passage of a bill in the waning days of the  1982 Legislature, Lehman said.  </P> <P> "The state of California was completely derelict and to date has not changed  one law," he added. He expressed hope that the Legislature will act to limit  outside investment powers given to thrifts.  </P> <P> The amendment approved Thursday, if included in the final legislation, would  give FDIC a free hand as a regulator, able to deny federal deposit insurance if  a state allows its S&amp;Ls to engage in relatively risky practices.  </P> <P> The amendment, approved by a 27 to 12 vote, was sponsored by Rep. Jim Leach  (R-Iowa), a vociferous critic of California's action in removing limits on  S&amp;L activities.  </P> <P> The subcommittee disposed of 47 amendments Thursday but has not yet grappled  with the most controversial issues unresolved between Congress and the Bush  Administration. The legislators still must decide whether to give the S&amp;Ls  additional time to meet tough new capital standards proposed by the  Administration and whether to include the full cost in the federal budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Under an ambitious schedule, the subcommittee hopes to dispose of more than 150  amendments and complete work next week on the complex bill to rescue the  savings and loan insurance fund, which protects deposits up to $100,000.  </P> <P> The Administration has proposed a plan to spend $157 billion over 10 years for  closing or selling more than 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls. The money would be used to  pay off depositors, whose accounts are insured, or to provide financial  incentives to outside investors to buy ailing thrifts.  </P> <P> The Senate Banking Committee will begin work on the S&amp;L legislation next  week. The steady erosion of S&amp;L deposits gives a special impetus to  Congress' hopes to deal quickly with the legislation. Withdrawals during the  first two months of the year, totaling $20 billion, are dramatically larger  than the outflow of $8.6 billion for all of 1988.  </P> <P> Higher interest rates offered by money market funds, combined with some  nervousness over the financial health of thrift institutions, are the major  reasons for the steady loss of funds.  </P> <P> In other action Thursday, the financial institutions subcommittee rejected an  amendment proposed by Lehman to allow 31 financial institutions, including some  of California's biggest S&amp;Ls, to leave the S&amp;L regulatory system and  obtain bank charters. Under the Bush Administration plan, the S&amp;Ls would be  blocked from becoming banks for five years.  </P> <P> MORE THRIFT SEIZURES  </P> <P> Federal regulators seize 38 more troubled S&amp;Ls.

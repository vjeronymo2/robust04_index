			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / GCSEs confirm decline in science THE trend away from science subjects, noted in last week's A-level results which saw the numbers taking physics fall by 9.6 per cent, was confirmed by yesterday's GCSE results. Total science entries at GCSE have dropped by 4.15 per cent since 1989. It is government policy to encourage science. Earlier this week Sir David Weatherall, president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, complained of an 'anti-science' mood in Britain. However, direct comparisons are difficult because individual science subjects, such as physics and chemistry, have been replaced under the national curriculum by 'balanced science'. This has involved big falls in physics (74.2 per cent), chemistry (71.3 per cent) and biology (70.3 per cent). Meanwhile, balanced science has almost tripled at 281.4 per cent. Over the same period, entries to computer science GCSE have fallen by 63.6 per cent, as teachers have attempted to introduce information technology more widely into other subjects. Balanced science only counts as one GCSE, in which pupils must devote equal time to physics, chemistry and biology. Common practice is that only the ablest pupils do each of the three subjects separately. This is shown by the 23.5 per cent who received an 'A' in physics. In balanced science only 9.2 per cent did this well, a slight fall on last year. The National Union of Teachers suggested that the shortage of specialist science teachers, combined with the extra resources needed to teach the sciences separately, had persuaded schools to make the switch. There could also be problems reconciling GCSEs with the A-levels that are meant to follow, and which are still split into separate subjects. According to Ms Caroline McGrath, of the Association for Science Education, the national curriculum is working: 'What teachers are trying to do is give everyone a foundation to cope with life in the 20th century, rather than the specialist science A-level approach. The old O-levels came out of the need to assist A-levels, which in turn were designed for university entrants. Now what they are trying to do is build up from the bottom.'</p>

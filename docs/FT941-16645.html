			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Ladbroke shares rise as Stein decides to resign early Mr Cyril Stein is bowing out early from Ladbroke Group, the hotels and leisure company he built from a small bookmaker into a member of the FT-SE 100. Mr Stein, 66 next month, announced in September that he would step down as chairman at the end of 1993 after 37 years at the head of Ladbroke. He planned to stay as a non-executive director for a further three years and to head the property division, but yesterday Ladbroke said he had decided to resign. The company's shares put on 14p on the news, closing at 194p, on the expectation that Mr Stein's departure would allow new management to impose its own style on the group. The City had feared that a formidable personality such as Mr Stein would find it impossible to take a back seat. But there was sadness that, as one analyst said, 'the departure of a chairman who has done great things for the company should be greeted by a rally'. Mr John Jackson, who took over as chairman on January 1, said Mr Stein had liked the idea of staying on for another three years to complete 40 years with Ladbroke. But as December 31 approached, it became increasingly clear that it would be better both for himself and the group if he made a clean break. Mr Stein, who is to receive a Pounds 200,000 payment from the company, will remain as a consultant to Ladbroke. 'He has a massive knowledge of racing and a very large network of contacts,' said Mr Jackson. Analysts believe Mr Stein's departure clears the way for property disposals and a dividend cut. During his tenure, Ladbroke never cut its dividend. Ladbroke shares have suffered recently because of confusion over its dividend policy. Early last month the company cancelled its alternative scrip dividend after its shares fell on an announcement that it would be taking advantage of the new foreign income dividend scheme. FIDs are perceived to be detrimental to pension fund investors, which benefit from tax credits on normal dividends but not on foreign income payouts. London shares, Page 15 See Lex</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Property: Squire Heseltine slated for appeal - Cadogan's Place Michael Heseltine, the Trade and Industry Secretary and squire of Thenford, Northamptonshire, has appealed against the refusal of South Northamptonshire council to let him thatch Manor Cottage at Thenford with Norfolk reed and install sealed double-glazing units. The building is listed, and the case will now go to a Department of the Environment inspector in Bristol. The council refused because the reed was not the typical thatch of the region and the windows were not appropriate to an old listed building. It ruled both elements would change the look of the village as well as the cottage, and would be a precedent for similar changes elsewhere. The traditional local product is wispy, long straw. The cottage has slates which probably replaced the original thatch in the last century. After the refusal (Weekend FT, March 19/20), Heseltine applied again to make alterations using slates. The council has allowed that, which enables Heseltine to start work. But it looks as though he still hankers for thatch, on his terms. The appeal will probably take three to four months. That is the fast-track procedure, when the inspector views the property and both sides make written submissions, but there is no public inquiry. I shall keep you posted. If you are selling a farm with cottages, think twice about dividing it into lots, says Nicholas Leeming of Humberts. Following the last Budget, you might lose a large part of any gain to the Inland Revenue. The complication arises from the disparity between what has happened since March 31 1982 (the base date for long-held capital items for CGT purposes), to land prices, which have hardly risen, and to the prices of homes, which have doubled - or more. If the farm / estate is sold as a whole, the indexed loss on the land (which probably increases its base value by 80 per cent) can offset the gains on any cottages, with the result that there is likely to be little or no CGT liability. If the holding is divided, each lot is assessed separately, so that CGT on cottages (one lot) cannot be offset by any indexed loss on the land (another lot). The Budget allowed indexation only for diminishing or extinguishing a gain, not for creating a loss. An amendment modifies this new ruling for 1993 / 94 and 1994 / 95 and allows Pounds 10,000 of indexable losses for private persons which can be carried forward from 1993 / 94 to 1994 / 95, or used in 1994 / 95 alone. Even with this concession, sellers of farms will probably find it advantageous to sell the property as a whole rather than in lots where the indexed loss on the land exceeds Pounds 10,000. Buyers should keep in mind that there is normally a discount for buying the whole. Two ritzy houses in London are for sale at about Pounds 5m. No 47 Rutland Gate, SW7 is set at Pounds 4.95m freehold through De Groot Collis (071-235 8090). It is a beautifully restored end-of-terrace house with views north along the square and, from the upper floors, past the Brompton Oratory to Battersea power station, Westminster Cathedral and Crystal Palace. I admired the joinery especially. No 1 Cumberland Place, NW1, on the east side of Regent's Park, costs Pounds 5.85m for a 72-year lease from the Crown. It is also an end-of-terrace house but this terrace, designed by John Nash, has only four houses which look from the outside as if they form one exceptionally grand house. From De Groot Collis or Lassmans (071-499 3434).</p>

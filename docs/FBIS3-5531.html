			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "America With Crowbar in Hand"] </F>   [Text] It appears that the revival of the "Super 301  Provision" has triggered shocks and reactions in Japan. Let us,  however, see its revival as an aspect of the realities of the  post- Cold War era without overreacting to it.    President Clinton signed his executive order to revive the  Super 301 Provision in line with his long-advocated policy. We  use the term his long-advocated policy because the President  already made it clear that he would revive the provision if  elected in a campaign pledge titled "the Highest Priority to the  People," announced jointly by himself and Vice President Gore  (candidate at the time) as presidential and vice presidential  candidates running on the Democratic Party's ticket during the  1992 presidential campaign. The President has chosen the most  effective timing for revival of the provision in a bid to make  it clear that the revival of the provision targets Japan, among  other nations.    The most internationally notorious provision allows the  United States to identify "unfair nations" in trade with the  United States, negotiate with those unfair nations to remove  their trade barriers and open their markets to U.S. goods, and  raise large tariffs and impose sanctions against those nations  in case they refuse to make concessions.    There is no guarantee that the United States will not  identify unfair trading nations arbitrarily. There is doubt that  the revival of the provision constitutes a violation of GATT  rules which call for holding multilateral negotiations to settle  trade disputes. Japan has guarded, reacted, and toughened its  stand against the step the United States has recently taken, and  we think Japan has probably made reasonable responses.    We want to indicate two points.    Among other things, Japan's excessively emotional reaction  to  the U.S. decision to revive the prevision will never be a plus  not only for Japan itself, but for overall Japan-U.S. relations.    It can be said that the U.S. posture to hold negotiations  with Japan with a hint at the possibility of slapping sanctions  on Japan is aimed at bullying Japan to accept what it demands.  The U.S. posture may incur displeasure in Japan. There is a kind  of sense of a game in recent U.S. moves to use the revival of  the provision as a "tool to crack open Japan's closed market."    If Japan sticks to a single way of confronting the revival  of  the provision, it may increase differences and tensions between  the two countries. Japan needs to look at the situation with a  broad sense of a game.    Another point we want to indicate is that this time, Japan  must realize anew the significance and depth of the changes  taking place in the United States during the post-Cold War age.    The Clinton administration is pouring the same strong energy  into "revitalizing the U.S. economy" as successive U.S.  administrations did into their policies toward the Soviet Union  during the Cold War era. Promoting trade and stepping up  pressure for market opening is an extension of this energy.    Although it is true that there are a lot of problems with  the  specific methodology of dealing with the pressure, it appears  that Japan is still optimistic about the way the United States  will expend this energy. We believe this makes Japan's actions  inarticulate and restricted.</p>

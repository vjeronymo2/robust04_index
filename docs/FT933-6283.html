			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BRISK trading in stock index futures provided the opportunity for substantial arbitraging in equities yesterday, writes Terry Byland. However, traders said that once again, severe shortage of stock in the underlying blue chip stocks had hampered dealing. The September contract on the FT-SE Index traded 8,585 contracts, below Thursday's total, but still a healthy figure. Gains in the contract led the stock market ahead, taking it through the Footsie 3,100 mark as September moved to its day's peak of 3,123, at which stage it showed a premium of 20 points against cash. However, futures settled lower and at the close, September, at 3,108, was almost in line with the fair value premium of about 7, which allows for carrying costs and dividend flows. Wall Street's opening weakness took the shine off London futures. In traded options, activity focused on the Footsie option, where volume rose to 9,049 contracts from 7,098 the previous day, with the Euro Footsie recording 2,490.</p>

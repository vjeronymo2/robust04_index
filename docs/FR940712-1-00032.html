This large, powerful brown bird with a white head and tail is well known as our Nation's symbol. Young bald eagles are mostly dark brown until they reach 4 to 6 years in age and may be confused with the golden eagle ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aquila chrysaetos <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The bald eagle is the only sea eagle regularly occurring on the North American continent (American Ornithologists' Union 1983). Its range extends from central Alaska and Canada to northern Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bald eagle is a bird of aquatic ecosystems (Marshall and Nickerson 1976). It frequents estuaries, large lakes, reservoirs, major rivers, and some seacoast habitats. However, such areas must have an adequate food base, perching areas, and nesting sites meeting certain requirements to support bald eagles. In winter, bald eagles often congregate at specific wintering sites that are generally close to open water and that offer good perch trees and night roosts. Bald eagle habitats encompass both public and private lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bald eagle was first described in 1766 as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falco leucocephalus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by Linnaeus. This South Carolina bird was later renamed as the southern bald eagle, subspecies  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Linnaeus), when, in 1897, Townsend identified the northern bald eagle as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Haliaeetus leucocephalus alascanus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (American Ornithologists' Union 1957). These two subspecific names were in use when the southern bald eagle (arbitrarily declared to occur south of the 40th parallel) was listed (March 11, 1967; 32 FR 4001) as endangered under the Endangered Species Protection Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668aa&hyph;668cc). By the time the bald eagle was listed (February 14, 1978; 43 FR 6233) for the entire lower 48 States, the subspecies were no longer recognized by ornithologists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bald eagle historically ranged throughout North America except extreme northern Alaska and Canada and central and southern Mexico. Bald eagles nest on both coasts from Florida to Baja California, in the south, and from Labrador to the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, in the north (formerly to the Commander Islands, western Bering Sea). In many of these areas they were abundant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gerrard and Bortolotti (1988) describe early population trends. When Europeans first arrived on the North American continent, there were an estimated quarter- to a half-million bald eagles. The first major decline in the bald eagle population probably began in the mid to late 1800's. It coincided with declines in numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds and other major prey species. Direct eagle killing was also prevalent, and, coupled with loss of nesting habitat, these factors reduced bald eagle numbers until the 1940's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1940, the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668) was passed. This law prohibits the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit; ``take'' includes pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, or molest or disturb.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bald Eagle Protection Act and increased public awareness of the bald eagle resulted in a partial recovery or a slower decline of the species in most areas of the country. However, persecution continued, notably in Alaska, which was exempted from the Bald Eagle Protection Act and maintained a bounty on bald eagles. In 1952, after lengthy studies demonstrated that bald eagles were not affecting salmon numbers, Alaska was no longer exempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shortly after World War II, the use of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and other organochlorine compounds became widespread. Initially, DDT was sprayed extensively along coastal and other wetland areas to control mosquitos (Carson 1962). Later it was used as a general insecticide. As DDT accumulated in individual bald eagles from ingesting contaminated food, the species' reproduction plummeted. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was determined that dichlorophenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE), the principal metabolite of DDT, accumulated in the fatty tissues of the adult females and impaired calcium release for egg shell formation, thus inducing thin shells and reproductive failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

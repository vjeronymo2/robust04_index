			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Todo bom's hot line in Portugal Luis Todo Bom's climb to the top of the Portuguese business world has earned him a reputation as a strong-willed administrator with a low tolerance for complacency, writes Peter Wise. These qualities will be much in demand in his new post as president of Portugal Telecom, the country's largest company, measured by number of employees, which was created through last month's merger of three state-owned telecommunications utilities. Todo Bom, 46, faces the task of forging these unwieldy companies with different cultures into an attractive competitive enterprise; next year up to 30 per cent of Portugal Telecom will be floated in the country's biggest ever privatisation. He will not countenance resistance in his attempts to reshape the sector. Todo Bom is known for driving people hard. Former associates say his aggressive style means he is rarely challenged in the boardroom. Like several other prominent Portuguese, Todo Bom, originally a chemical engineer, began his career at Sines, a state-run oil, industrial and port complex that has proved something of a white elephant. Very much a politician - he is now a vice-president of the governing centre-right Social Democratic party - by 1983 he had been appointed head of the Tourism Fund, which dispenses government grants. Later, he served as junior industry minister from 1985 to 1987, and has since held a number of administrative posts in public-sector companies, and was appointed head of the now-extinct Telecom Portugal at the beginning of this year.</p>

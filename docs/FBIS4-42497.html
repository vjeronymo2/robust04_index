			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones article: "Howard Hits at Delors Drive for </F> Superstate"]    [Text] The sceptical tone of the Conservative  Euro-election campaign was intensified last night with an attack  by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, on M Jacques Delors,  the President of the EC Commission, for attempting to undermine  national independence.    Emphasising Britain's sense of national identity and its  pride in institutions such as the Monarchy and Parliament, Mr  Howard said EC leaders ignored popular feeling at their peril.    He singled out M Delors who steps down as president of the  Commission at the end of this year, for suggesting recently that  those who opposed federalism were encouraging racism and were  anti-European.    "It is those who wish to impose a European superstate over  the heads of the people of Europe, those who are obsessed with  their federalist mission, who risk stimulating a revival of  nationalist extremism," Mr Howard told a Tory campaign meeting  in his constituency at Hythe, Kent.    His tone was reminiscent of Mrs Thatcher's landmark speech  at  Bruges in 1988 when she gave a warning against the creation of a  "United States of Europe."    Mr Howard, a Cabinet Euro-sceptic, warmly welcomed Mr John  Major's call earlier this week for a multi-speed, multi-layered  Europe, in which member states could do some things in their own  way and at their own speed.    "What we need is a made-to-measure Europe in which the  institutional arrangements comfortably fit national interests,  not an off-the-peg standard-size Europe, ill-fitting and  splintering at the seams," he said.    There were some basic, unchanging requirements of the  European Union: an acceptance of the single market in goods and  services, free movement of citizens of member states to live and  work throughout the Community, and the need for common  institutions to make decisions and see they were enforced.    "Beyond these basic principles there is no need why all  states should move together or at the same speed and good  reasons why they might choose not to do so," he said.    Earlier this week, Lord Tebbit, the arch-Euro-sceptic,  welcomed Mr Major's speech as evidence that the Government was  coming round to the viewpoint of the anti-Maastricht rebels.    Mr Howard's speech is a further indication that the Cabinet  is adopting an increasingly sceptical approach in an attempt to  persuade core Tory supporters to vote on Thursday [9 June].    Mr Howard said the real debate was not about Britain's  membership, but about the future of the EC.    He emphasised that he wanted to see a free-trading Europe of  nation states. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, he said,  wanted a "one-way ticket on the federal express to a European  superstate."</p>

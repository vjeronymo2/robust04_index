			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico looks deeper into Nafta prospects - Damian Fraser sees a varied effect on companies The North American Free Trade Agreement should boost Mexican equity values over the long run, but not all companies stand to gain from the pact. Since the beginning of November, when investors began to conclude that Nafta's passage was probable, the bolsa has gained about 9 per cent. Yesterday the market closed 0.9 per cent up at 2,186. The market rose strongly in the run-up to the vote, largely because Nafta is expected to lift the economy. The agreement should attract capital, lower interest rates, and raise economic growth. Mr Jay Peloski, of Morgan Stanley, reckons that the agreement should add 1 percentage point to Mexico's economic growth rate in the long run. The agreement also makes the risk of a sudden reversal in economic policy less likely, and may lead to a partial closing of valuation differences between Mexico and the US, as Mexico is considered more mature, and less like an emerging market. Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs reckons that the current market p/e of about 12, excluding Telmex, should soon rise to about 15. US investors may be more comfortable about investing in Mexico with the trade pact in place. 'There will be bucketfuls of US institutional money coming into the market as Mexico becomes part of the North American economy,' predicts Mr Javier Munoz de Baeza, head of LMB,the Mexican money managers. US instititutions, says Morgan Stanley, currently invest less than 1 per cent of their money in all emerging markets combined. However, some stocks may be hurt from the treaty's passage. The trade pact is likely to strengthen the peso, squeezing companies exposed to international trade. That bodes ill for names like Vitro, the glass marker, Cydsa, the petrochemicals group, and Alfa, the steel to petrochemicals conglomerate, which have already suffered from the steady appreciation of Mexico's peso over the past three years. The treaty over the long run will also remove tariff barriers on imports into Mexico. This should put further pressure on trading companies, currently protected by an average tariff of over 10 per cent. If, as expected, the treaty raises economic growth and wages, then companies in labour intensive industries which are faced with international competition may find it increasingly hard to compete with low wage countries in Asia. Already, textile, paper, and toy companies have folded in droves since 1986, when Mexico opened to trade, and wages began to recover in dollar terms. Most brokers say that the best corporate bets under the treaty will be protected or well-placed to face domestic competition, and in a market which will outgrow the economy. Companies expected to benefit most from higher domestic economic growth include those in the consumer and retail sector, such as Femsa, the soft drinks company and Cifra, the supermarket chain; services, such as Telmex; construction and cement companies, like Cemex and ICA, and banks, including Banamex and Bancomer. In general, earnings of these companies rise by more than the increase in economic growth. Lower interest rates will help groups which have taken on debt to finance expansion, such as Aeromexico, the airline, Televisa, the giant media cocnern, Cemex, and ICA, and Alfa. While much of the debt is in dollars, the likely strengthening of the peso will reduce interest payments in peso terms. The banks are particularly sensitive to lower interest rates, since loan growth would increase and defaults fall, as financing costs come down. Mr Douglas Campbell of the brokers DA Campbell, strongly recommends both Banamex and Banacci, and believes the banks' poor loan quality will soon improve. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, says approval of Nafta could enable Mexico to be given investment grade status on foreign debt as early as next year, and several Mexican companies could then expect their credit rating to improve. Investment grade will help construction companies, such as Tribasa and ICA, to securitise toll roads, and finance other huge infrastructure projects. Over the long term the reduction of investment and trade barriers will reduce profit margins in all Mexican industries. Nafta gradually opens up the service sector to foreign investment, and in industries where margins are abnormally high (such as banks and telephones), new foreign competition is likely. Fears of competition in the telephone sector have kept Telmex shares at a discount to the market. Under Telmex's concession, profitable long distance and international telephone calls will be opened up to foreign competition after August 1996. In many cases foreigners will buy into or form strategic alliances with existing companies rather than start new ones afresh. This has already happened in the retail sector, in consumer goods, in telephones and in media. Baring Securities reckons more such agreements might be expected under Nafta.</p>

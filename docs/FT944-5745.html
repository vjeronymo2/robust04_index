			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Australian company case fails Charges filed by the Australian Securities Commission against Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, head of the Normandy Poseidon resources group and one of the most prominent figures in Australia's mining industry, and Mr Thomas Meiklejohn, a former Normandy employee, were yesterday dismissed in the Melbourne courts. The charges, brought by the ASC a year ago, centred on allegations that Mr de Crespigny and Mr Meiklejohn, while chairman and managing director respectively of Brunswick, a small mining company, that took over Bendigo Gold, had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that a statement to shareholders did not contain misleading information. At the heart of the matter was the valuation of certain mining interests.</p>

			<p>Apparently     reflecting conflict between Beijing and local leaders  over tax reform policies adopted at a party plenum last November,  some local officials have attempted to dilute a new "value-added  land tax"--a capital gains tax on real estate--that they fear  will discourage foreign investment.  Citing evidence that  investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan will be "compelled to give up  their development plans" if the land tax--promulgated with other  tax reforms on 1 January--is enacted, the Hong Kong-based PRC-  affiliated wire service Zhongguo Tongxun She on 1 February quoted  Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu as claiming that the tax is a "type of  local tax" and that "local governments" can therefore formulate  "detailed rules for implementation" by "themselves."  Asserting  that Guangzhou has its "own standard" in formulating these rules,  Li stated that investors may "set their minds at rest."  Politburo member and Shanghai party chief Wu Bangguo also seemed  to signal provincial resistance to the center's version of the  land tax in an interview with the PRC-owned Hong Kong paper Ta  Kung Pao on 14 January when he reportedly stated that the  collection of land taxes had "met with some problems" (15  January).  Implying that in driving Shanghai's already exorbitant  land prices even higher the tax would discourage investment, Wu  suggested that further "study" was needed on how local taxes can  be "fixed."     Central authorities, however, have underscored their resolve to  impose Beijing's version of the tax policy on the localities--a  move intended in part to reassert central control over China's  finances from increasingly powerful provincial leaders.  According to a report in the PRC-affiliated Hong Kong daily Wen  Wei Po, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli told reporters in Beijing on  1 February that the "provisional regulations" on administering  the "value-added land tax" must be "strictly enforced" and that  the "localities must comply" with the regulations (1 February).  Furthermore, Liu stated that "laws and regulations" formulated by  the localities without central approval are "null and void,"  although he conceded that "some readjustment" to the land tax law  may be considered in light of "proposals" made by foreign  investors.  Perhaps signaling Beijing's dissatisfaction with  former State General Administration of Taxation Director Jin  Xin's apparent inability to rein in assertive local leaders, the  State Council recently demoted Jin to the post of deputy director  and appointed Liu Zhongli in his stead (Xinhua, 16 February).  In  contrast to Liu, Jin Xin had not been reported to take a hard  line on the problem of local resistance to the land tax.  (AUTHOR:  VOSS.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Greece to privatise strike-bound buses ATHENS' commuters face the uncomfortable prospect of riding army lorries to work for the rest of the summer, after a government decision to privatise the strike-plagued city bus service. Legislation allowing private owners to operate the fleet of 1,400 buses was presented to parliament yesterday. Details of the transfer will take weeks to work out, according to government officials. The Greek capital has been without buses for two weeks. Bus company employees declared an indefinite strike after the government fired 1,024 clerical and technical staff under a scheme to reduce over-manning. The bus company has debts of more than Dr160bn (Pounds 450m). Its fleet of ageing buses is blamed for much of the pollution in the city centre. Private operators who run profitable regional bus services and some Athenian taxi co-operatives are showing interest in taking over the company's routes, provided the government goes on subsidising ticket prices. Meanwhile the army is running a skeleton transport service, using its own buses and hundreds of lorries. There is reduced demand for public transport at present because several hundred thousand Athenians have left the city for summer holidays.</p>

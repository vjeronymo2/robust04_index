			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Lamont's Statement Norman Lamont leaving the Treasury by the back door last night after making this statement: 'Today has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day. Massive financial flows have continued to disrupt the functioning of ERM. 'As chairman of the council of European finance ministers I have called a meeting of the monetary committee in Brussels urgently tonight to consider how stability can be restored to foreign exchange markets. 'In the meantime the government has concluded that Britain's best interests are served by suspending our membership of the exchange rate mechanism. 'As a result the second of the two interest rate increases that I sanctioned today will not take place tomorrow. The minimum lending rate will be at 12 per cent until conditions become calmer. 'I will be reporting to cabinet, discussing the situation with colleagues tomorrow and may make further statements then. But until then I have nothing further to say.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said  yesterday the U.S. trade watchdog is expected to keep Thailand  on its watchlist after the annual revision of the list is  announced today.    Churin said he was not optimistic that the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) would remove Thailand from all watchlist  categories, because "the U.S. is likely to wait until the Thai  parliament passes the third reading of the amended Copyright  Bill."    In response to an earlier report that the USTR had already  removed Thailand from its priority watchlist (PWL) and moved it  to the normal watchlist classification, Churin said the  announcement had not been made.    An economic officer at the U.S. Embassy also confirmed that  the USTR had yet to release an official statement. "I have not  received any report from Washington," he said. The officer,  however, noted that the USTR was at any moment expected to  announce a revision of the countries on its trade watchlist.    Thailand last year was removed from the most serious  classification, the priority foreign country (PFC) status, to  the lesser PWL after Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon  assured the USTR that the Thai government would introduce a new  copyright law soon. The new copyrights bill has yet to come  into force, pending its third reading in Parliament.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pharma Vision sells its stake in Ciba-Geigy Pharma Vision 2000, the Swiss pharmaceutical shares investment company, has arranged to sell its SFr410m (Dollars 283m) stake in Ciba-Geigy because it disagrees with the Basle-based group's policy to remain diversified in chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This decision could have some impact on Ciba shares in the next few days. Moves by Pharma Vision and other investment vehicles controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group are closely watched in Swiss equity markets. Two weeks ago, BK Vision, another investment company controlled by Mr Ebner and his associates, revealed it was running down its stake in CS Holding, the financial group built around Credit Suisse. Since then, CS shares have been significantly weaker than the Swiss banking sector as a whole. Mr Christoph Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision, said in his annual statement that the company reduced its Ciba holding last year because Ciba was 'sticking to its strategy of diversification rather than focusing on the pharmaceutical sector'. The Pharma Vision annual report showed that most of the remaining holding had been shifted from registered shares to the more liquid bearer shares. And Mr Ebner revealed yesterday that BZ Bank had recently placed 400,000 call options on Ciba bearer shares which would provide for the sale of these shares later this year. The disposal of the Ciba stake would leave Pharma Vision holding only securities of Roche, another large Swiss pharmaceutical group. At the end of last year, its investments in Roche shares were worth SFr3.1bn. Mr Ebner said Pharma Vision was aiming to buy large stakes in one or two non-Swiss pharmaceutical groups over the next few months. In preparation, it was raising SFr530m in a 1-for-5 rights issue at SFr4,250 per bearer share and SFr850 per registered share. This was in addition to SFr310.8m raised from a rights issue last September.</p>

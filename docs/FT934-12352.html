			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Relief of poverty should determine aid Sir, The distorting impact of foreign policy on Britain's aid ('Logic was no match for foreign policy', October 22) comes as no surprise to those of us who recall the government's explicit intention in 1980 to 'give greater weight in the allocation of our aid' to political considerations. In the Reality of Aid report earlier this year, NGOs working with the world's poorest communities noted the World Bank estimate that 40 per cent of world aid was diverted from poverty reduction to middle and high-income countries 'largely for political purposes'. The Overseas Development Administration has recently taken a number of important steps to increase its focus on poverty. The forthcoming European Community council of development ministers will consider a proposal to increase the poverty focus of EC aid, initiated during the British presidency. The record shows that, when the ODA is able to make poverty the priority, British aid can be very effective in areas such as humanitarian relief. The strong and consistent support of the public for UK aid targeted on poverty reduction was echoed in a June 1983 Actionaid/Gallup Survey, which found 87 per cent of MPs wanted more attention to be given in this category of spending to aid for basic needs. The National Audit Office report shows that the diversion of British aid for foreign policy purposes serves neither the interests of the poorest nor the taxpayer, nor indeed Britain's long-term commercial and political security. The government should end competition between the developmental, political and commercial interests in aid by stating explicitly (in line with the World Bank) that sustainable poverty reduction must be the primary determinant of British aid spending and the benchmark against which its success is evaluated.

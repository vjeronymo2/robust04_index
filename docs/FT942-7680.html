			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Quiet eurobond day puts focus on future issues Only a smattering of new issues emerged in the eurobond market yesterday as continental markets were closed, and attention was focused on forthcoming offerings. Among yesterday's issues, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan raised Dollars 75m through a three-tranche offering of 10-year floating rates while Finnish Export Credit raised Y5bn of three-year paper. However, market talk centred on a mooted launch from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp (CMHC). Syndicate managers said the government-owned issuer was likely to offer around Dollars 1bn of debt. The move was flagged when CMHC last came to the market in November to raise Dollars 1bn through five-year global bonds yielding 15 basis points over Canadian government bonds. It said then that the offering was designed to establish a benchmark for its initiative to lend to social housing and that it planned to raise CDollars 2bn a year over the next five years. There was also speculation that KfW, Germany's reconstruction bank, was considering a Dollars 300m dragon bond. In addition, the placing by the Taiwanese company, UMC, of a Dollars 160m convertible eurobond offering on Friday - which was oversubscribed and trading at 104 yesterday against an issue price of par - raised speculation that it would pave the way for a Dollars 900m to Dollars 1bn offering from Formosa Plastics. Nevertheless, dealers said the performance of recent issues showed the market was vulnerable. They reported the yield spread on the Kingdom of Spain's FFr6bn issue of seven-year eurobonds had widened to 30 basis points yesterday from 24 basis points at the launch on Friday, and the Republic of Finland's FFr10bn of 10-year debt launched a week ago was yielding 36 basis points against a launch spread of 32.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK water companies Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, clearly caught the water companies napping with his proposal to curb price increases by 2 per cent. Having agreed to restrain rises by around 1 per cent last year, the industry ex-pected plain sailing up to the comprehensive periodic review in 1994. However, the 3 per cent fall in the companies' share prices yesterday owed more to surprise at the regulator's ambush than to real worries about the industry's financial prospects. That surprise looks rather overdone. With the regulatory noose tightening everywhere, clawing back the benefits of lower than anticipated construction costs was the least Mr Byatt could do to maintain a macho reputation as a watchdog. Water company profits are running around 25 per cent ahead of estimates before privatisation. Yesterday's announcement will only cut next year's pre-tax figure by some 2 or 3 per cent. Earnings growth and dividend cover will remain high. There is no financial reason why water companies cannot continue to pay real dividend increases of 5 to 6 per cent a year. That said, the periodic review hangs heavily over the industry. Companies are understandably nervous at any hardening of the regulator's position. Some may even be tempted to try their strength against Mr Byatt by opposing this price restraint. Such tactics would only draw attention to their strong finances. Granted the review will make life harder for water companies, but shareholders have far more to lose from the ultimate sanction of a Monopolies Commission investigation than they could ever hope to gain.</p>

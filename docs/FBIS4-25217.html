			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The fifth Asia-Pacific  International Trade Fair (ASPAT '94) opened at the China  International Exhibition Center (CIEC) here this morning.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, executive secretary of the  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the  Pacific (UN-ESCAP) Rafeeudin Ahmed, and chairman of the China  Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Zheng  Hongye were present at the opening ceremony of the fair, which  is co-sponsored by CCPIT and UN-ESCAP.    The 80,000-square-meter exhibition includes about 3,000  participants from 30 countries and regions such as China,  Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany,  India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Russia and  the United States.    Exhibits display light industrial products, mechanical  equipment, electronics technology, communications equipment and  products, environmental protection facilities, high-tech and  patented products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional  handicrafts, and real estate projects.    During the fair, five symposiums will also be held on the  electronics trade, China's current economic situation and  investment environment, China's reform of its foreign trade  system and investment policies, and China's financial and  taxation reforms.    The Philippines and Hong Kong have sent large trade  delegations to the fair to conduct business talks.    ASPAT '94 is aimed at demonstrating economic achievements in  the region, highlighting economic and trade complementarity and  potential, promoting economic development and cooperation  throughout the Asia-Pacific region and with other countries in  the world, and exploring ways for strengthening cooperation and  jointly achieving prosperity among the Asia-Pacific countries in  a new world situation.    ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia  and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP.    The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972  in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The  fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a  complete success.</p>

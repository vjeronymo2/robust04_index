			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: Keeping up by satellite - Worth Watching For journalists tired of press conferences, or too busy or far away to attend them, Interactive Information Networks has come up with an answer, writes Andrew Fisher. The US company offers a 'front row seat' at news conferences of high- technology companies without anyone having to leave the office. Conferences can be broadcast live to newsrooms through IIN's packaged installation of a satellite-linked television, video recorder, and laser printer. Those receiving the news - journalists can ask questions via the system - pay nothing. The broadcasting companies - including IBM, Apple and Lotus - pay Dollars 25,000 an hour, or Dollars 100,000 for five hours. Florida-based IIN is now introducing its service to Europe. IIN: US, 407 234 1111; France, 1 4887 7044.</p>

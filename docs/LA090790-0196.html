			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS '90;  </P> <P> 1989 IN REVIEW  </P> <P> WEEK 1  </P> <P> Rams 31, Atlanta Falcons 21  </P> <P> Jim Everett's first-half-ending 46-yard "Hail Mary" touchdown pass to Henry  Ellard gave the Rams a 17-14 lead in Atlanta. Everett, who completed 14 of 25  passes for 206 yards, and Greg Bell, who ran for 128 yards, both ran for  second-half touchdowns. Ellard caught five passes for 99 yards and tight end  Pete Holohan had five catches for 76. The defense, led by linebacker Kevin  Greene's two sacks, sacked Falcon quarterback Chris Miller five times for a  loss of 28 yards. And the Falcons managed just 46 yards rushing.  </P> <P> WEEK 2  </P> <P> Rams 31, Indianapolis Colts 17  </P> <P> Jim Everett combined with Henry Ellard for three touchdown passes,  overshadowing Eric Dickerson's return to Anaheim. Ellard had a career-high 12  receptions for 230 yards and Everett completed 28 of 35 passes for 368 yards.  At one point, Everett completed 14 consecutive passes, a team record. Dickerson  carried the ball 21 times and gained 116 yards, but he scored only once as the  Ram defense shut out the Colts in the second half.  </P> <P> WEEK 3  </P> <P> Rams 41, Green Bay Pakcers 38  </P> <P> Greg Bell, left, rambled for a career-high 221 yards on 28 carries in Anaheim,  but the Rams almost let this one get away. After building a 38-7 halftime lead  with the help of four Packer turnovers, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski,  who threw for 335 yards, engineered four consecutive scoring drives that cut  the Rams' lead to seven. The Packers were on the verge of tying the game when  linebacker Frank Stams forced running back Brent Fullwood to fumble on the goal  line and defensive end Doug Reed recovered.  </P> <P> WEEK 4  </P> <P> Rams 13, San Francisco 49ers 12  </P> <P> Mike Lansford's 26-yard field goal with two seconds left to play lifted the  Rams to a come-from-behind victory in San Francisco. The 49ers led, 12-10, when  fullback Tom Rathman fumbled deep in Rams' territory and Kevin Greene  recovered. Jim Everett then orchestrated a nine-play, 72-yard drive that took  most of the last three minutes of the game and set up Lansford's game-winning  kick. Everett completed five passes during the drive, including two to tight  end Pete Holohan for 31 and 16 yards. Mike Cofer's four field goals accounted  for all the 49er scoring.  </P> <P> WEEK 5  </P> <P> Rams 26,  </P> <P> Atlanta Falcons 14  </P> <P> Mike Lansford kicked four field goals and Jim Everett threw two touchdown  passes as the Rams completed a season sweep of the Falcons in Anaheim. The Rams  scored on their first four possessions and led, 20-7, at the half. The Rams'  defense put together two goal-line stands to thwart a Falcon comeback. Kevin  Greene again sacked Chris Miller twice. Henry Ellard caught eight passes for  165 yards and Ron Brown's 76-yard kickoff return set up Lansford's third field  goal.  </P> <P> WEEK 6  </P> <P> Buffalo Bills 23,  </P> <P> Rams 20  </P> <P> It appeared as if the Rams had picked up their sixth consecutive victory when  Jim Everett hooked up with Flipper Anderson for a 78-yard scoring play with  less than two minutes remaining in the game at Orchard Park, N.Y. But, with  1:17 remaining left to play, Bills' quarterback Frank Reich connected on seven  passes in a row on a 64-yard drive that was culminated by an 8-yard touchdown  pass to Andre Reed that sent the Rams to their first defeat of the season.  </P> <P> WEEK 7  </P> <P> New Orleans Saints 40,  </P> <P> Rams 21  </P> <P> The Saints opened up a 10-0 lead and then outscored the Rams, 23-0, in a  stretch of the second and third quarters en route to a rout in Anaheim. Saints'  quarterback Bobby Hebert completed only 15 of 22 passes and threw one  interception, but he also threw three touchdown passes. Dalton Hilliard rushed  for 87 yards and two touchdowns and also scored on a 20-yard pass reception.  Jim Everett was intercepted twice and threw three touchdown passes, two to  tight end Damone Johnson.  </P> <P> WEEK 8  </P> <P> Chicago Bears 20,  </P> <P> Rams 10  </P> <P> In a game dominated by defense, the Bears were able to pull ahead in the second  half and hold off the Rams in Chicago. Mike Lansford's 45-yard field goal  midway through the second quarter opened the scoring and the teams were tied,  3-3, at the half. A 24-yard pass interference penalty called on Anthony Newman  led to the first touchdown of the day, a 1-yard run by Chicago's Brad Muster.  The Bears took a 17-3 lead with 11:11 to play on a 1-yard quarterback sneak by  Jim Harbaugh. Jim Everett completed just 13 of 35 passes and was intercepted  twice.  </P> <P> WEEK 9  </P> <P> Minnesota Vikings 23, Rams 21  </P> <P> Viking linebacker Mike Merriweather, above, streaked into the Ram backfield and  blocked a Dale Hatcher punt, the ball went through the end zone and the  first-ever overtime NFL game was decided by an safety in Minneapolis. Viking  Rich Karlis kicked seven field goals to tie a league record. The seventh, a  40-yarder with 12 seconds remaining in regulation, sent the game into overtime  after the Rams had rallied from an 18-7 deficit. The Rams took the lead on a  1-yard run by Greg Bell. Henry Ellard caught four passes for 82 yards,  including a fourth-down, 6-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> WEEK 10  </P> <P> Rams 31, New York Giants 10  </P> <P> The Rams snapped their four-game losing streak in grand fashion as Jim Everett  threw for two touchdowns and Greg Bell ran for two more in Anaheim. The Rams  led, 10-0, after one quarter and 24-3 at halftime. On their first possession of  the second half, the Rams drove 76 yards on 11 plays with Bell scoring on a  2-yard run to boost their lead to 31-3. Bell (14 carries for 42 yards),  Cleveland Gary (8 for 45 yards), Robert Delpino (11 for 34) and Buford McGee (5  for 17) shared the rushing duties. Eight different Rams caught passes.  </P> <P> WEEK 11  </P> <P> Rams 37, Phoenix Cardinals 14  </P> <P> Things went bad quickly for Phoenix in Anaheim as Michael Stewart intercepted a  Gary Hogeboom pass and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown with just 1:41  expired in the game. Then they got worse. The Rams took a 24-0 halftime lead  and the Cardinals' first score -- a 77-yard pass from Tom Tupa to Don Holmes --  didn't come until less than five minutes remained in the third quarter. Jerry  Gray had two interceptions for the Rams, Henry Ellard caught five passes for  163 yards and two touchdowns, and Mike Lansford kicked three field goals.  </P> <P> WEEK 12  </P> <P> Rams 20, New Orleans Saints 17  </P> <P> Mike Lansford's 31-yard field goal 6:38 into overtime gave the Rams a  come-from-behind overtime victory in New Orleans. The Rams trailed, 17-3, in  the fourth quarter, but rallied to score a pair of touchdowns in the final 2:46  of regulation. Buford McGee culminated a 61-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown  run to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Jim Everett's 15-yard pass to Flipper  Anderson tied the score, 17-17. Lansford missed a 51-yard field goal attempt as  time ran out in regulation. Anderson, who had 15 receptions for an NFL  single-game record of 336 yards, caught No. 15 for 26 yards to set up the  game-winner by Lansford, above, who celebrated with Pete Holohan.  </P> <P> WEEK 13  </P> <P> Rams 35,  </P> <P> Dallas Cowboys 31  </P> <P> The Cowboys fumbled on their first two possessions in Irving, Tex., the Rams  recovered both and took a 14-0 lead. But Dallas rebounded to cut the deficit to  14-10 at the half. The Cowboys, scoring on three Troy Aikman touchdown passes  in the second half, went ahead, 31-21, but Larry Kelm recovered another Dallas  fumble and Jim Everett hooked up with Ron Brown for a 39-yard scoring play two  plays later. The Rams took the lead with 1:50 left to play when Aaron Cox,  right, caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Everett. Dallas' attempt to win the  game stalled on the Ram 17 as time ran out.  </P> <P> WEEK 14  </P> <P> San Francisco 49ers 30,  </P> <P> Rams 27  </P> <P> The 49ers outscored the Rams, 20-3, in the final quarter to beat the Rams in  Anaheim. The Rams built a 17-0 advantage, scoring on their first three  possessions. Late in the second quarter, the Rams drove 76 yards to the 49er  four-yard line and, on fourth-and-goal, Pete Holohan came up one yard short of  the end zone on a fake field goal play. The 49ers' John Taylor, right, twice  turned short passes into long touchdowns -- of 92 and 95 yards -- and Joe  Montana finished another brilliant performance in Anaheim Stadium completing 30  of 42 passes for 458 yards.  </P> <P> WEEK 15  </P> <P> Rams 38,  </P> <P> New York Jets 14  </P> <P> The Rams took advantage of three New York turnovers, converting each into a  touchdown, on their way to a romp in Anaheim. Linebacker Brett Faryniarz led a  defensive charge that sacked Jets' quarterbacks Tony Eason and Ken O'Brien  seven times. Faryniarz had three sacks, recovered two fumbles and caused one.  Brian Smith had two sacks for the Rams. Greg Bell scored a pair of touchdowns  as the Rams compiled 422 yards of total offense.  </P> <P> WEEK 16  </P> <P> Rams 24, New England Patriots 20  </P> <P> The Rams scored to take the lead with 1:55 remaining in the game and then  managed a goal-line stand to hold off the Patriots on Christmas Eve in Foxboro,  Mass. Greg Bell rushed for 210 yards on 26 carries and one touchdown. The Rams  went ahead, 17-3, early in the third quarter, but New England came back to  forge a 17-17 tie. Jason Staurovsky's 48-yard field goal put the Patriots up,  20-17, but the Rams drove 80 yards, capped by 3-yard Bell touchdown with 1:55  left. Then the Rams survived three Grogan pass attempts from the Ram 4 in the  last nine seconds.  </P> <P> NFC WILD-CARD PLAYOFF  </P> <P> Rams 21,  </P> <P> Philadelphia Eagles 7  </P> <P> The Ram defense kept the Eagles out of the end zone until the fourth quarter on  New Year's Eve in Philadelphia. And the offense struck quickly as Jim Everett  threw two first-quarter touchdown passes. The Rams threatened to score twice  more before the half, but were stopped by turnovers. The Rams rolled up 409  yards of total offense with Everett completing 18 of 33 passes for 281 yards  and Greg Bell rushing for 124 yards on 27 carries. The Eagles didn't get a  first down in the first quarter and managed just 95 yards rushing. Kevin Greene  had two sacks and Fred Strickland registered 11 tackles. Willie Anderson, left,  and Aaron Cox, celebrated with a victory slap.  </P> <P> NFC PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Rams 19,  </P> <P> New York Giants 13  </P> <P> No Ram fan will forget Flipper Anderson's sprint into the end zone on a 30-yard  pass play in overtime . . . or his subsequent run into the tunnel at Giants  Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Trailing, 13-7, going into the fourth quarter,  the Rams tied the game on a pair of Mike Lansford field goals. The Rams won the  overtime coin toss and began a 77-yard drive that was aided by a play no Giant  fan will forget, the 27-yard pass interference call on Sheldon White. Two Raul  Allegre field goals gave the Giants a 6-0 first-quarter lead, but Jim Everett  and Anderson, left, hooked up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the half.  Henry Ellard finished with eight catches for 125 yards.  </P> <P> NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME  </P> <P> San Francisco 49ers 30,  </P> <P> Rams 3  </P> <P> From the Rams' standpoint, there was absolutely nothing charming about third  meeting between these teams. The Rams managed just 156 total yards; the 49ers  racked up 442. Jim Everett completed 44% of his passes and was intercepted  twice; Joe Montana completed 87% of his passes and had none intercepted. The  Rams rushed for 26 yards; the 49ers ran for 179. The Rams lost two fumbles; the  49ers lost none. The Rams did lead, 3-0, in the first quarter, but never  advanced beyond the San Francisco 40-yard line again. The 49ers could have  started packing for the Super Bowl after scoring touchdowns on all three of  their second-quarter possessions.  </P></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / US markets give mixed signal on economy plan: Bonds rise sharply but share prices decline THE US markets gave President Clinton's package a mixed reaction yesterday. Government bonds rose sharply but share prices ended a chaotic day mostly lower. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond, the key indicator of bond market performance, was up about a point at 101 9/32 . Investors in fixed-income government bonds bid prices higher because they believed that the tax-raising package would slow economic growth and therefore stifle inflation. Low inflation helps maintain the value of their investments. But the prospect of slower economic growth troubled the stock markets. Mr Will Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan in New York, said: 'The package will act as a modest restraint on demand, but not of a magnitude likely to derail a recovery.' After fluctuating wildly for most of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 10.0 at 3,3302.19. In early trading the Dow jumped 35 points, primarily a technical reaction from investors who felt that stocks had been oversold during the market's big plunge on Tuesday. Within hours, however, the Dow was showing a net decline of 35 points as pessimism about the tax increases swept the markets, although it eventually recovered most of the lost ground before the close. The overall market view of President Clinton's economic proposals was negative. Investors are concerned that the tax increases will hurt the economy, and were disappointed that the president's deficit reduction package was not tilted more towards spending cuts. The hardest hit sector in the stock markets was airline shares, which fell sharply on news of the energy tax and worries about the effect of higher income taxes on demand for air travel. UAL fell Dollars 3 1/2 to 115 3/4 , Delta fell 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 7/8 and the parent company of American Airlines dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57. The rise in the price of the 30-year bond pushed the yield, or investment return, down to 7.017 per cent, the lowest level it has been since the government began issuing 30-year bonds in the late 1970s. This makes it likely that US mortgage and corporate borrowing rates - many of which are pegged to the yield on the 30-year bond and other longer-maturing government securities - will come down over the next few days. The immediate reaction of the foreign exchange markets to the president's speech was positive, with the dollar rising almost 3 pfennigs to DM1.6515 on overseas markets late Wednesday night. In New York, however, trading was more subdued amid confusion over what the Clinton package will mean for the economy over the long term. At the close in New York the US currency had slipped back to stand at DM1.6315, up about a pfennig. Although most economists on Wall Street believe that higher personal and corporate taxes will slow economic growth, and with it corporate earnings, a few welcomed the president's economic proposals.

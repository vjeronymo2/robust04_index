			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM resists Tory Euro-sceptics ASSURANCES by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the Maastricht treaty marked the beginning of a reversal of the 'centralising trend' in the European Community failed to satisfy prominent Conservative backbench critics in the Commons last night. Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford and one of seven Tory backbenchers who called for the rejection of the Bill implementing the treaty, insisted that it was a 'very centralising measure'. A former cabinet minister, Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North) also expressed 'considerable reservations' about the treaty. He contended that it contained a great deal of senseless commitment to centralism. In a confident speech opening the two-day debate on the Bill, the prime minister maintained that the treaty marked 'an important change in direction' by enabling agreements to be reached by the member states of the European Community outside the confines of the Treaty of Rome which established it. Dealing with another issue that has caused considerable concern on the government back benches, he strongly reaffirmed Britain's determination to maintain frontier controls to guard against illegal immigration from non-EC countries, and to combat terrorism, crime and the traffic in drugs. Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, argued that the issue of immigration controls was one on which Britain could afford to make no concessions and should fight in the courts if necessary. Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), a leading critic of the EC, and Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney), a prominent opponent of the Maastricht treaty, warned that the government's position on frontier controls may be subject to legal challenge. The prime minister promised Britain would 'fiercely' contest such proceedings, citing the 1987 single European Act. He said Britain would co-operate within the framework of international law, but outside the framework of EC law. Emphasising the significance of the distinction, Mr Major said: 'Any dispute would go to the International Court of Justice, not the European Court of Justice.' The prime minister said the Maastricht treaty provided for those to be dealt with either under the Rome treaty or through intergovernmental co-operation. It also recognised that there might be circumstances in which 'the member states can act better on their own'. Underlining the negotiating objectives he achieved at the Maastricht summit, Mr Major said the treaty set 'exactly the framework' Britain wanted for economic and monetary union. It ensured 'an absolute right' for the UK parliament to decide later, at a time of its own choosing, whether Britain should move to the third stage of economic and monetary union. The prime minister hit out at Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, for his condemnation of the carefully negotiated provision giving Britain the right to decide whether or not to join a single currency. Those who supported Mr Kinnock's view, he said, were commiting themselves to 'enter a single currency now in unknown economic circumstances in the future, with the Community at an unknown size and with economic convergence at an unknown level'. Mr Major dismissed Labour's denunciation of the government's refusal to accept the social chapter. He said signing the chapter would have removed from British employers and their employees the right to determine working conditions. Mr Ray Whitney (C Wycombe) argued that the tenor of the debate was out of tune with the mood of the country. He said people outside the House were more disposed to accept the reality of Britain's relationship with Europe. In a maiden speech, Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (C Chingford) warned that the treaty kept the door open to federalist centralisation and an uncompetitive Europe which was clearly moving in the wrong direction from the rest of the world. Sir George Gardiner (C Reigate), who described himself as a 'Euro-pragmatist', said his support for the European ideal had never embraced a federalist structure. He deplored the efforts being made by some to force the EC step by step into a 'federal centralised straitjacket'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An extraordinary Council of Ministers' meeting  was held yesterday under the chairmanship, in turns, of Mr.  Anatole Kanyenkiko, the prime minister, and of Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, the interim head of state. The members of the  council analyzed exclusively the issue of the full restoration  of the presidential institution. The prime minister informed  the Council of Ministers on the progress made in the  consultations regarding this issue from 31 May to 4 June 1994  with legally recognized political parties. [passage omitted]    The Council of Ministers noted that certain preconditions  set  by the group of opposition parties were being met, notably the  ongoing disarmament operation. The government reiterated that  the process was to continue and [words indistinct] but the  government considered that it was technically impossible to set  a timetable for the operation given that the latter would be  undertaken whenever it was needed. This is an important issue  given that during recent previous meetings, the council went so  far as asking that laws and regulations on the possession of  arms [words indistinct] (?even) knives, machetes, etc, be  revised. [passage omitted]    While maintaining peace and security, the council  recommended  to the prime minister to speed up his consultations which should  result in a formula for the full restoration of the presidential  institution. The government's wish is for Burundi to have a new  head of state by 1 July 1994 at the latest. [passage omitted]</p>

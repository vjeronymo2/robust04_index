			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue The once pedestrian business of printing banknotes is booming. De La Rue increased banknote sales by 17 per cent last year, four times the trend rate of growth, due to demand from newly-independent countries. Profits grew by rather more as rising capacity utilisation led to wider margins. While the company's order book suggests the banknote bonanza will continue for a year or two yet, such heady growth is unsustainable. In the longer term, rapid progress in banknotes depends on unlocking public sector printing contracts  -which is why Portal's connections with central banks were almost worth bidding for. Unless it can win plum privatisations, De La Rue's interests in automated cash handling and payments systems will eventually have to take up the running. Even allowing for the favourable impact of currency movements, these businesses are performing well enough. Selling cash handling equipment should become easier as banks emerge from recession and start to refurbish branches. Such favourable impact from the banking cycle is already being felt in the US. If organic growth starts to slow, De La Rue's Pounds 260m cash pile will become a more pressing issue. In relation to net assets the company is already holding more cash than Glaxo. It is a measure of De La Rue's small balance sheet that fresh equity would almost certainly be required to offset the goodwill from a sizeable acquisition. That is all the more reason to deal with the cash pile before it starts to exert real drag on the shares' rating.</p>

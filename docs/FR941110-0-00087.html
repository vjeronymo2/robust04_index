			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Have an immediate family member who is a resident or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Finally, one commenter wants to prohibit any surveyor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual has last surveyed it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments, to preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflicts of interest and to ensure survey objectivity, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expanding &sect;488.314(a)(2) to disqualify anyone from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveying a facility if he or she works, or, within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous 2 years, has worked as an employee, as employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency staff at the facility, or as an officer, consultant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or agent for the facility to be surveyed. The surveyor is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also disqualified if a member of his or her immediate family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has, or, within the previous 2 years has had, such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship with the facility or if a member of his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate family is, or within the previous 2 years has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been, a resident of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;488.314(a)(2), we continue to disqualify surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who have a financial interest or any ownership interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility but have deleted the modifying phrase ``direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or indirect'' to preclude misunderstandings. One commenter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for example, interpreted the restriction against ``indirect''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial interest to mean that a surveyor would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disqualified if he or she held shares in a broad-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mutual fund which included ownership in health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. (This was not our intent.) The issue of what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes disqualifying financial interest must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in considerable detail, and our manuals provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most appropriate vehicle for this discussion. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have broken out the parallel restriction on surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose family members have direct or indirect ownership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest and placed it in a new &sect;488.314(a)(2)(iii). We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are also extending the &sect;488.314(a)(2)(i) disqualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to family members in paragraph (a)(2)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in a new paragraph (a)(2)(iv), we disqualify any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor who has an immediate family member who is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that these safeguards are sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure objectivity and that nothing beyond these is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted. Finally, in our view, prohibiting any surveyor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she has last surveyed it is unnecessary and would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to enforce. Whether or not the ex-surveyor has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed that particular facility before would be of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit to the facility than the in-depth knowledge of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal requirements that the individual could share with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility. We believe that such knowledge can help the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility achieve and maintain compliance which ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serves the residents. The protection of the residents'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health, safety, dignity, and general interests is our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters were generally critical of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor training and skills, and most offered specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions on how training could be enhanced. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples follow:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;There should be provider and/or ombudsman input for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor training and/or testing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Activity professionals'' or ``individuals with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant clinical and investigative skills'' should teach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least part of the surveyor training course;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training should include__  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Interviewing and investigatory skills;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Quality of care standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Communication skills, particularly for communicating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with residents who may have communication barriers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _How to identify outcomes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _How to identify iatrogenic declines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _How to identify care conditions that could lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline or failure to improve if not properly addressed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Standards of care for the professional disciplines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _More training on long term care issues;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

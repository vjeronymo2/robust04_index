			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Cancellations at Glasgow There has been bad news for users of transatlantic air services from Scotland in the past few weeks. First, American Airlines announced that its daily service from Glasgow to Chicago would in future only operate in the summer. Flights would finish this year on November 2. Next, Northwest Airlines said it was ending its daily Glasgow-Boston service altogether on October 25, after flying from Scotland for 14 years. These decisions reverse the gradual expansion of transatlantic services from Glasgow that began in 1990, when the government stopped forcing intercontinental flights to use Prestwick airport, 30 miles south-east of Glasgow. At that time, American Airlines and British Airways, which had refused to use Prestwick, launched services from Glasgow, with American flying daily to Chicago and BA three times a week to New York. Northwest and Air Canada moved to Glasgow from Prestwick, and last year United Airlines began flying daily from Washington DC. Aviation specialists believe the latest decisions to cancel flights reflect airlines' determination to improve returns on their assets rather than seek market share. American Airlines complained that, while summer holiday traffic was good, there were not enough year-round business travellers to give a satisfactory yield per seat and make the service profitable overall. Northwest also blamed low yields, and claimed there was excess capacity on transatlantic routes from Glasgow. One difficulty is that business or first-class passengers do not necessarily want to fly from their local airport. The convenience is offset by the fact that there are a much greater number of transatlantic services from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, giving passengers a range of options in case of delay or cancellation. And many of these flights go direct to the traveller's ultimate North American destination. Mr Bob Buntin, Northwest's general manager for Scotland, says that its Glasgow flights have had good capacity utilisation, but claims this is only because fares are low. 'We have been trapped for some time at the low end of the market,' he says. BAA, which runs Glasgow airport, hopes to persuade the remaining year-round transatlantic carriers, United, Air Canada and British Airways, to increase their services to take up any slack. British Airways says it will increase its frequency to New York from four flights a week to five, probably from January.</p>

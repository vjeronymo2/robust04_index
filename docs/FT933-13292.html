			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help WMI show 14% midway rise WASTE Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of WMX Technologies of the US, yesterday reported continued profit and revenue growth despite poor trading conditions in many of its European markets. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 increased by 14 per cent from Pounds 62.6m to Pounds 71.5m on revenues up 19 per cent to Pounds 455.7m (Pounds 382m). In the second quarter pre-tax profits increased 5 per cent to Pounds 37.1m (Pounds 35.3m) on revenues ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 234.9m (Pounds 195.8m). Operating profits for the half-year improved 25 per cent to Pounds 73.3m (Pounds 58.8m), but were offset by higher net interest costs of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 3.45m). Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the company continued to obtain selected price increases in its markets, but was experiencing volume pressures at a number of treatment and disposal facilities, particularly in France and Italy. He said the results reflected both the continued benefits from acquisitions, and the strengthening of management teams which has led to further improvement in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The group was floated on the Stock Exchange through a listing of 20 per cent of its shares in April last year by US-based Waste Management, since renamed WMX Technologies. It currently operates in nine European countries and seven others in south-east Asia, Australasia and South America and has completed about 25 acquisitions so far this year in order to strengthen its geographic and strategic position. Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 9.8p (8.5p) for the half year and by 22 per cent to 6.7p (5.5p) for the quarter. The figures were slightly below expectations and the share price slipped 4p to close at 638p yesterday.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Milk shakes It hardly seems fair. The UK government spent six years deciding the best way to reform the country's dairy market, only to be taken to court for botching the job. The Dairy Trade Federation announced this week that it is seeking judicial review of the government's efforts to shake up the milk market, which it claims threaten unnecessary price rises and job losses. The Milk Marketing Board was at the heart of a cartelised system of UK milk provision which kept prices high and stifled innovation. Abolishing the MMB's monopoly over milk supplies and allowing processors to compete for supplies with the Board's successor, Milk Marque, was intended to reverse both effects. It has done neither. What went wrong? The DTF's decision to seek a judicial review sounds like sour grapes. For the first time in 60 years, the dairy processors were this year allowed to bid direct for milk, but only managed to secure a third of what they required. Milk Marque signed up the rest and the resulting scramble for supplies allowed it to push up prices. If the DTF's complaint stemmed simply from its members having lost the first round of playing under the new rules, it should be rapidly dismissed. The trouble is that the rules themselves are fundamentally flawed. Any reform labours under two obstacles. First is that the UK's milk quota under the Common Agricultural Policy, currently 85 per cent of the country's needs, will always allow someone in the industry to make excess profits. The second is that, by failing to break up the old MMB into competing regional entities, the government has preserved a single body with a good chance of exploiting its position to share those profits with farmers at the expense of the processors. The best way of reforming the milk market would, of course, be to abolish the CAP, although this is beyond the government's power. In the long run, processors may turn to imports to make up their shortfall. But a quicker way of injecting flexibility into the current system would be to make milk quotas tradable across national borders. Meanwhile, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission might cast a fresh eye on the question of unfair competition closer to home.</p>

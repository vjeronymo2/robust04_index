			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cairo agreement on the implementation of self-  government in Gaza and Jericho will be translated into Arabic in  order to make even the junior Palestinian officers in Gaza and  Jericho familiar with it. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports  that it has emerged that the Palestinian leaders have failed to  explicate the written details of the agreement to the  Palestinian population and security forces. A Palestinian  source told our correspondent that the Palestinian leaders often  prefer to explain events on the ground in their own way and  contrary to the agreement, perhaps in order to win the  Palestinian public's support.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Weak consumer demand and falling car production hit BSG BSG INTERNATIONAL, the Birmingham-based motor components, vehicle distribution and childcare products group, has blamed weak consumer demand and falling European car production for flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.53m in the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 8.56m. The result, which the company said had been held back by difficult trading conditions at the end of 1992 and earlier this year, were achieved on higher turnover of Pounds 291.8m (Pounds 287.3m). Although the decline in profitability had been offset by falling interest rates and funds raised by the Pounds 31.4m rights issue in April, earnings per share fell from 2.53p to 2.07p. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p. Mr Astley Whittall, chairman, said the reduced earnings reflected a higher tax charge arising from increased profits in Germany and the impact of the rights shares. A 15 per cent fall in European car production increased the pressure on margins in the group's UK and French sun roof and mirror manufacturing operations. In the meantime, growth in the car leasing sector was hampered by fleet users delaying vehicle replacements, the directors stated. Recession in the airline industry, meanwhile, also dampened demand for BSG equipment for aircraft interiors. Mr Whittall warned that the sector would have to be restructured in the fourth quarter to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The difficulties of these sectors contributed to a 5.6 per cent decline in interim operating profits to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.7m). Nevertheless, Mr Whittall said satisfactory performances by operations in Australia and the US, and improved profits on production of child safety seats, were encouraging.</p>

We caught up with him at his general headquarters in  the center of Moscow. The building's corridors are festooned  with notice-boards covered in photographs of Vladimir Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy]. Telegrams expressing gratitude and  congratulations are displayed in front of the entrance to the  grandiose office. Members of the Russian Party of the Crimea  ask him to "assist historical justice and definitively affiliate  the Crimea to Russia." The head of the secretariat explains  that we must pay first and then we will be granted an interview.  Russian journalists are exempt from the charge. After a  two-hour wait, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy granted an exclusive  interview to LIDOVE NOVINY and Czech Television. Free of charge.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, have you received an  invitation from anyone to visit the Czech Republic?    [Zhirinovskiy] You cannot imagine how many different  invitations I receive. Yes, I received a fax from the  Republican Party. I will be very happy to visit your country.  Moreover, on 2 and 3 April we are organizing in Moscow a world  congress of Slavic and Orthodox peoples. We will also invite  politicians and deputies from the Czech lands.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your view of the talks on the  possible bombing of Serb positions in Bosnia?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am opposed to any kind of force against the  Serbs. I warn you, I view the bombing of Serb cities as if it  were the bombing of Russian cities. This would absolutely alter  Russia's foreign policy. If the bombing takes place, we will --  of course -- send protests to the countries whose pilots take  part in it. We will warn them that what they are doing to Serb  cities will be done to their countries. Bombs will be dropped  on the cities of those countries that bomb Serb cities.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Apparently, you believe that the Czechs are  not a full-fledged nation. At the same time, you want to visit  our country. What is your attitude toward us?    [Zhirinovskiy] I declare that, regardless of the collapse of  the USSR and the socialist camp, Russians enjoy the best of  relations with all Slavs, including the Czechs. I know your  films, culture, and products well, and I would not like there to  be any animosity between Czechs and Russians. I invite all  representatives of political parties, ministers, and deputies to  our World Slavic Congress. After all, we are one people, one  culture.... We have to put an end to the animosity that started  after 1968.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you aware that there is a great deal of  discussion in our country about your visit to the Czech Republic  and that not everyone is favorably inclined toward it?    [Zhirinovskiy] It would be strange if everyone loved me.  That is politics. Democracy. And do you think that everyone  adores your Hasek? [as published]    I do not need to have everyone kissing my hand. For  instance, in the Czech lands, people have a cooler attitude  toward me, while in Poland it is even hostile. Therefore, if  Vaclav Havel is unhappy, then I am also unhappy that a playwrite  can become the president of a country. I will not write the  Cherry Orchard, I am not Chekhov. Why is a playwrite a president?    Your country is on the decline. I assure you that in 10  years from now, there will be no Moravia and no Sudetenland. In  10 years time, the entire Czech nation will curse Havel the way  the Russian people are cursing Gorbachev. Everyone, including  myself, applauded him. After Chernenko, Gorbachev was good to  us. Now we curse this rogue. It will be the same with you.  Vaclav Havel will die, and in 10 years young Czechs will curse  him. They will be forced to speak German, to forget their  mother tongue, to go to German churches, and to clean the boots  of German officers. This is what will become of the Czechs in a  few years from now. I am very sorry about this. Therefore, we  want to talk to everyone at the congress of Slavic peoples.  After all, there are 300 million of us and we will live  together in an Eastern European Slavic community. We will not  serve the West.</p>

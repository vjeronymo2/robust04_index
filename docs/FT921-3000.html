			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Divestment of computer side planned IMI, which last December expanded its information technology interests with the Pounds 15m acquisition of Redwood International, is planning to float its computer servicing interests in about three years time, writes Paul Cheeseright. It is also likely, when property markets have strengthened, to seek outside investors for its property interests, grouped together under the title of Holford Estates. Mr Gary Allen, chief executive, acknowledged yesterday that these two arms 'don't seem to lie well' with the rest of IMI's businesses. The aim is to build up IMI Computing until it has turnover of about Pounds 200m a year before the flotation. This suggests further acquisitions. Buying Redwood doubled the size of turnover to about Pounds 60m. The same approach will be adopted with Holford Estates, which has been developing business parks on industrial land surplus to IMI's requirements. 'We need to build it up to a critical mass where it can attract outside investors,' Mr Allen said. IMI has five main operating divisions - building products, drink dispensing equipment, fluid power, special engineering and metals. But the metals business is being re-organised with the copper interests going into building products, and titanium into special engineering.</p>

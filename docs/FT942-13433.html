			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Row erupts over Harrods chief A bitter row erupted yesterday over the reasons for the sudden departure of Mr Peter Bolliger, managing director of Harrods department store in London's Knightsbridge for more than two years. Harrods had insisted last Friday that Mr Bolliger had resigned 'for personal reasons'. Mr Bolliger, however, told the Mail on Sunday newspaper yesterday that he had resigned because he found it impossible to work with the store's owner, Mr Mohammed al-Fayed. 'He likes to feel he is running the store,' Mr Bolliger said. 'He will even go behind the counter and cut salami. You simply can't have two kings in an organisation like Harrods. There are 5,000 staff and they have to know who to report to.' Harrods responded by issuing a strongly-worded statement saying Mr Bolliger had not resigned but had been sacked from his Pounds 100,000 a year job. The company said it had previously agreed to say Mr Bolliger's departure was for personal reasons out of consideration for his family. But Mr Bolliger's remarks left it no alternative but to 'put the record straight', it said. Among several charges, the company alleged that he had mishandled the dismissal of another member of staff. An internal audit of the performance of the Kurt Geiger shoe business, a Harrods subsidiary of which Mr Bolliger was chairman, had been 'unfavourable'. Mr Bolliger claimed that Mr Mohammed al-Fayed was 'totally surprised' by his resignation. But yesterday the company said: 'Mr Mohammed al-Fayed was not surprised when Mr Bolliger resigned, because he did not resign.' Harrods said Mr Bolliger was dismissed last Tuesday after receiving a warning letter the previous week. Mr Bolliger had been offered the opportunity to step down from Harrods and become managing director of Kurt Geiger, but this offer was withdrawn after the Fayeds received the internal audit. Mr Bolliger confirmed yesterday that he had received a warning letter on April 7, but said he had resigned the same day. He said he did not wish to comment on Harrods' other claims. Mr Bolliger moved out of his Knightsbridge home yesterday and was said to be planning to return to his native Switzerland, or to South Africa, where he has worked previously. His position has been taken by former deputy managing director Mr Clive de Boer.</p>

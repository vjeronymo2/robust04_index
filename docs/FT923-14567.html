			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: Economy counts the cost of its travails as industry starts lay-offs FRANCE yesterday counted the economic cost of the lorry drivers' dispute as food and fuel shortages worsened and dozens of factories were forced to lay off workers because of supply shortages. The worst affected sectors have been petrol, food, farming, chemicals, cars, textiles and tourism, according to the Patronat, which represents French employers. Provence, Rhone Alpes, the Cote d'Azur and Nord Pas de Calais have been hit hardest. The Patronat said it was impossible to quantify the damage caused so far but warned that lay-offs had begun and that many companies could eventually incur 'huge losses'. Small companies are particularly vulnerable. Mr Lucien Rebuffel, chairman of the French small companies' federation, said many businesses were running short of parts. Rockwool, a specialist chemical company at Saint-Eloi-les-Mines in Puy-de-Dome with 90 employees, was partially shut down yesterday because it was receiving only 10 of its usual 85 daily lorryloads of supplies. Mr Gilbert Cattin, a director, said a shutdown would cost FFr500,000 (Pounds 51,500) a day. French business is unlikely to be able to claim insurance as compensation for any losses. There is also concern about longer-term cashflow, particularly among small companies. Some companies are concerned that foreign competitors will take advantage of their problems to poach their contracts. Mr Vincent Ginestet, chairman of Motolita-France, a motor parts maker in Bordeaux, said: 'Unless we can make our usual deliveries to our US customers this week they will find other suppliers.' The impact on consumers also grew yesterday. There were reports of garages rationing petrol in Toulouse and Lille and in southern rural regions. There were also reports of fresh food shortages, mainly in small shops. The huge wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Arnavaux, north of Marseilles, received deliveries from only three lorries yesterday, rather than the 60 lorryloads it would expect on a normal Monday. France's importance as a transit country for goods travelling between other European states threatens to extend the effects. Spain and Portugal are particularly vulnerable. Italy is also badly exposed because Austria and Switzerland, the main alternatives to France as points of entry, tightly restrict heavy goods traffic. So far, sufficient traffic seems to be getting through France to have averted an immediate crisis. The effects on European industry have also been cushioned because businesses have been able to draw off stocks. But there is growing concern among European countries: Britain: The British manufacturing arm of Peugeot, the French car maker, re-started operations yesterday after being left temporarily short of components. The search for alternative transit routes has led many UK hauliers to switch to the Benelux countries. P&amp;O European Ferries said 50 per cent of the freight normally carried on its Dover-Calais route had switched to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. The Netherlands: Dutch companies have suffered damages exceeding Fl 250m (Pounds 75.8m) in lost sales and ruined goods, according to the EVO group, representing 40,000 Dutch companies. The organisation suggested members might shift freight to France, Spain and Portugal to coastal freighters. The Dutch Railway has also reported a sharp increase in demand for space on freight trains to France. Belgium: The Renault car factory at Vilvoorde temporarily suspended 1,500 employees from a workforce of 3,800 as a result of supply shortages. Mr Guy Coeme, , the Belgian transport minister, has written to his French counterpart to lay the groundwork for possible compensation claims by Belgian companies. Germany: A handful of German trucks managed to escape the French gridlock and return home yesterday thanks to police efforts to break the blockade, according to the BDF road transport industry association. However, between 500 and 800 German-registered lorries are still stuck. Spain: The dispute has cost Spanish companies more than 3bn pesetas (Pounds 16.4m) in agricultural exports and lost revenue from tourism, the government said yesterday. Some 500 Spanish trucks are stranded in France leaving 10,000 tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables to rot.

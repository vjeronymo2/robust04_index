			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS PLAN TO MEET NEEDS OF LATINOS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: BILINGUAL AIDES, STUDENTS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO BECOME INSTRUCTORS.  </P> <P> Long Beach Unified School District officials are developing a master plan to  address the needs of non-English-speaking students and a program that would  encourage bilingual aides and students to become teachers, according to a  district report released this week.  </P> <P> The plans are in response to recommendations made earlier this year by a  Hispanic Advisory Committee, which noted that the number of bilingual teachers  is inadequate to serve the district's Latino students -- half of whom cannot  speak English proficiently.  </P> <P> In response to the committee's recommendations, schools Supt. Tom Giugni  presented a 25-page report to the School Board on Monday, emphasizing the  district's commitment to serving Latino students and increasing the ranks of  bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> While encouraged by the new plans, the Latino leaders expressed disappointment  about the overall report, which they called "a rehash" of existing district  programs.  </P> <P> They also said they were disappointed that one of their priorities -- requiring  teachers and administrators to learn a second language -- apparently has been  rejected.  </P> <P> The report appeared to sidestep most of their specific suggestions and offered  very little in the way of future plans, committee members complained.  </P> <P> "It's a rehash," Jerome Torres, the chairman of the Hispanic Advisory  Committee, told the School Board on Monday. "We already know you guys have this  program and that program."  </P> <P> Committee member Roberto Uranga, president of the local chapter of LULAC, the  League of United Latin American Citizens, told the board: "We're very  disappointed with it. It was superficial."  </P> <P> In his report, Giugni detailed the various programs available in areas of  concern that the advisory committee cited in its report to the board last  spring.  </P> <P> For example, the committee asked the district to develop an internship program  to cultivate existing Latino staff for future administrative appointments. In  his response, Giugni implied that the district is doing what it can in the  area. He explained that the district's program for leadership development  includes opportunities to participate in various councils, committees, morale  building programs and "other growth enhancing activities." Among other things,  each assistant superintendent keeps a list of potential administrative  candidates, Giugni wrote. His response did not address the specific suggestion  of creating an internship program.  </P> <P> Giugni's report did, however, include some new elements. The most significant  of proposed changes, according to committee members, are creating a program  that would encourage bilingual aides and students to become teachers and  developing a master plan for students who have limited English proficiency. One  out of every four students in the district does not speak English proficiently.  </P> <P> Latino leaders said they are grateful to district officials for the strides  that have been made.  </P> <P> The committee members also said they were encouraged that the teachers' union  seems willing to compromise on a committee proposal to pay bilingual teachers a  higher salary.  </P> <P> After meeting with members of the committee, leaders of the Teachers Assn. of  Long Beach agreed to consider supporting a plan that would pay bilingual  teachers more when they go beyond their teaching duties, such as by helping  develop the curriculum or by working with new teachers, said Felice Strauss,  the union's president.  </P> <P> The teacher's union has traditionally opposed a bilingual pay differential.  </P> <P> While district officials avoided flatly opposing most of the recommendations,  they virtually rejected what was probably the committee's most radical  suggestion: that teachers, administrators and other staff learn a second  language if at least 30% of the students in their school can't speak English.  </P> <P> "This is a commendable recommendation; however, the district does not view the  recommendation as one of the high priority issues. . . . It would be difficult  to decide on a specific second language, and a project of this magnitude would  not be cost effective," Giugni wrote.  </P> <P> When it was first presented this summer, the concept of requiring a second  language was viewed with skepticism by most school board members, teachers'  union officials and top district administrators. But the idea was supported by  the Assn. of Hispanic Educators in Long Beach. On Monday, Alan Lowenthal, the  president of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, threw in his group's support  and called the proposal "a positive development."  </P> <P> "We're very disappointed that they (district administrators) didn't supportthe  second language requirement," Uranga said after the meeting.  </P> <P> As for the overall report, he said: "The language was saying, 'We're doing all  these things, what more can we do?' We wanted them to show us, with hard data,  whether those programs are working, and what more they plan to do in the  future."  </P> <P> Helen Hansen, the district's assistant superintendent of personnel services,  said officials emphasized existing programs rather than those in the discussion  stage.  </P> <P> "We wanted to put into this report things that are actually being done,"Hansen  said. "(But) we have other irons in the fire."  </P> <P> For example, she said officials are talking about developing a magnet  schoolwith a curriculum focused on encouraging students to become teachers.  </P> <P> "We know what a big job we have," Hansen said. "We're going to keep at it until  it's completed. We're committed."  </P> <P> District administrators said they are making some progress on new bilingual  hires. Between January and September of last year, for example, the district  hired 20 bilingual teachers, or 10% of the 200 new hires, according to Giugni's  report. Since September of 1988, the district hired 28 bilingual teachers, or  11% of the 255 new teachers.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're having a hard time finding minority applicants," Hansen said.  "It's a state problem and a national problem."  </P> <P> The National Education Assn. predicts that only one public school teacher in 20  will be a minority by the turn of the century.  </P></p>

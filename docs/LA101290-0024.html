The 60-member group, named Bolshoi Ballet Grigorovich Company,  will be independent of any government funding and will be made up of young  dancers graduating from the leading ballet academies in the Soviet Union. It  makes its debut appearance at Texas A&amp;M University on Nov. 23, with  Grigorovich's "Nutcracker," followed by a five-city tour. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are retaining this provision as written.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act use the word ``may,'' thus permitting the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency discretion in deciding to conduct a standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey or an abbreviated standard survey within 60 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the above stated changes to determine whether these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes have caused a decline in the quality of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished by the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few other commenters recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation specify that other surveys (&sect;488.308(c)) must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted as frequently as necessary to determine compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with participation requirements and to confirm the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction of previously cited deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are retaining this provision in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision to conduct other surveys under the circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified at &sect;488.308(c) be at the State survey agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion. We expect the survey agency to base its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision on the individuals and facilities involved and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's concern that the quality of care may have declined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to conduct a survey in those cases where one is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to confirm compliance with participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The correction of noncompliance will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored and verified by some type of follow up activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may or may not be a survey. Section 488.332 states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the State survey agency conducts on-site monitoring as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed when: a facility is not in substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements and is in the process of correcting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies; verification of continued substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance is needed after deficiencies have been corrected;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or, the survey agency has reason to question the substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance of the facility with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation. (Please refer to the discussion at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.332, Investigation of complaints of violations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring of compliance.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed regulation indicates that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency may conduct a standard or an abbreviated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard survey to determine whether certain changes have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused a decline in the quality of care furnished by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. The commenter recommended that the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``decline in the quality of care furnished by'' be modified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow special surveys for the purpose of determining whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility is out of compliance with any conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since the language of concern to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter simply reiterates the Act, at sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II), we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not free to modify the language as suggested. However, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe the Act gives States ample authority to conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys any time they suspect that conditions at a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be declining.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter proposed amending the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to expressly permit the survey agency to screen complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to decide if they merit an on-site investigation. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter wrote that this rule goes beyond the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires a standard or abbreviated survey in every instance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including those which may be an isolated complaint or abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter proposed revising &sect;488.308(e)(2) to read,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``The survey agency must conduct a standard or an abbreviated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard survey to investigate complaints of violations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements by SNFs and NFs that the agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed and determined to provide a reasonable basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are clarifying the wording of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to say the survey agency must review all complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations and conduct a standard or an abbreviated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard survey to investigate complaints of deficiencies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements by SNFs and NFs if after reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegation, the survey agency concludes that a violation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more of the requirements may have occurred and only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey can confirm that a deficiency or deficiencies exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A survey will not be conducted if the complaint raises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues that are outside the purview of Federal participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

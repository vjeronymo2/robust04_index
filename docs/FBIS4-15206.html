			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Stanislav Kondrashov article: "United States' `New </F> Approach' to Russia in Light of Ukrainian Elections"]    [Text] Next year over one-half of all U.S. aid earmarked  for the "heirs" of the USSR will be going not to Russia as it is  now, but to other members of the CIS. Although this is economic  aid, this shift is dictated by politics, the rudiments of a  different U.S. strategy that has not as yet been formulated  clearly enough.    The "new approach" to Russia that has been developing since  last December concerns both the situation within Russia and its  behavior in the "post-Soviet area." The aspirations nurtured by  some of the U.S. establishment to act as trailblazers en route  to the market economy of the future have virtually vanished into  thin air, and U.S. aid -- if you compare it to the extent of the  crisis in Russia and the tasks that lie ahead -- is paltry. But  Washington remains Moscow's main strategic interlocutor outside  the CIS, and the "new approach" needs scrutiny especially since,  even in the early stages, it appears to be flawed due to  inadequate understanding of the situation whereby trends toward  integration are confused with imperialism. If this confusion is  not avoided in time, the "new approach" will have to be adjusted  like the old one.    So, within Russia the Clinton administration has distanced  itself from Gaydar's radical-democrat school, ceased to  associate the future of economic reform and Russian democracy  with him and him alone, and to all intents and purposes  acknowledged Premier Chernomyrdin as a reformer and leading  contender for the post of president. While maintaining all the  necessary relations with the Russian head of state, it is  stealthily performing the delicate task of ensuring continuity  of the new-type U.S.-Russian relations in the post-Yeltsin era.  There is every indication that people in Washington are growing  accustomed to the idea that this time is not far off.    Another aspect of the "new approach" concerns the U.S.  attitude to the nearby foreign countries. Here too, relatively  speaking, they have stopped putting all their eggs in the  Yeltsin basket. The "counterbalance" of U.S. economic aid is the  response to the stepping up and tightening of Russia's policy in  neighboring countries -- the former Soviet republics. This is  eliciting more and more questions and growing misgivings in the  United States. That which all politicians in Moscow across the  board, including the foreign minister, call Russia's legitimate  "special interests," is generally qualified by people in  Washington as recurrences of "imperial ambitions." People there  would like to warn Russia by paying additional signs of  attention to those post-Soviet states which are the targets of  "imperial ambitions." This too is an extremely tricky  diplomatic task -- these signs must be noticeable otherwise they  become pointless, but not provocatively noticeable so as not to  further rouse Moscow "imperialists."    Mindful of this, official Washington received the leaders of  Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Georgia in February and March.  Likewise, Clinton gave Shevardnadze the go-ahead for the idea  of deploying UN peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia...on condition  that an agreement is concluded between the Georgians and the  Abkhazians and that U.S. servicemen are categorically excluded  from these forces. William Perry, the new U.S. secretary of  defense, carried out a tour under the slogan of a new "pragmatic  partnership," starting in Moscow and then visiting Alma-Ata  [Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk, announcing an increase in U.S. aid,  primarily for nuclear disarmament.    Despite the cautious nature of the "new approach," one  initially glimpses a failure to understand certain fundamental  and seemingly obvious things. That is to some extent excusable  since it was inspired by the Russian side.    People are talking, for instance, about the end of the  "honeymoon" between Russia and the United States. But was there  one at all? If you think about it, there was not a "marriage"  with the United States but a "divorce" between Russia and the  USSR, the Russian leadership and the Union leadership, and the  "divorce" went hand in hand with a "romance" with the United  States since Yeltsin and the democrats used the West's political  backing against Gorbachev and against preserving the "imperial"  union.    The "honeymoon" lasted as long as the amnesia over our own  national interests. It is not the "honeymoon" that is now over,  but the amnesia. In fact, it is impossible to divorce ourselves  from the fundamental geopolitical realities of Russian existence  in Eurasia and in this regard Russia is bound to inherit some of  the interests of the Soviet superpower and the Russian empire  especially since the main material justification for Russia's  great power status -- nuclear weapons -- was also the legacy of  the Soviet Union.    Tens of millions of people have been plunged into a new  historical era and they are behaving not quite or not at all as  the politicians who did the plunging would like. The people  formulating the "new approach," leaving aside this basic fact,  should look at the democracy of the ballot box, which now seems  different from that of the speeches made by politicians elected  previously.    The latest example being the Ukrainian elections, where  inhabitants of eastern oblasts and the Crimea voted by an  overwhelming majority in favor of union with Russia. So are  they voicing solidarity with Moscow's "imperial ambitions"? Who  else but Washington should realize that general democratic  elections are the main act and irrevocable verdict of democracy  (until the next elections take place). Unlike presidents,  ordinary people speak rarely but, when they do, what they say is  to the point and weighty, based not on speculative concepts but  on their own future.    However, the CIA guessed this result, predicting in a recent  secret report the possibility of Ukraine breaking into two  states over the dispute between the western part geared to the  West and the eastern oblasts with their leaning toward Russia.  And it did not ascribe this to Moscow's machinations.    Needless to say, it would be the height of folly for Moscow  to promote the worsening of the intra-Ukrainian confrontation  but surely Kiev's politicians are primarily responsible for  finding a peaceful and constructive solution to the situation  through Ukrainian federalism, say, and closer links with Russia?    In a recent programmatic article in the FOREIGN AFFAIRS  journal, Zbigniew Brzezinski declared that a U.S.-Russian  partnership would be premature and suggested an alternative  policy of "geopolitical pluralism," which means curbing Russia's  imperial instincts by developing relations with the "new  independent states." Brzezinski came up with a "simple but  indisputable axiom: Russia can either be an empire or a  democracy but it cannot be both." That is an example of the  rigid rule that is easily construed by an outsider. The  well-known conceptualist even sees Russia's confederative  relations with Ukraine as a roundabout victory for Russian  "imperialism." But the sentiments voiced during the elections  in eastern Ukraine and the Crimea illustrate that democracy  Brzezinski-style is a procrustean bed for millions of people  even if they opted to lie on it by voting in favor of Ukrainian  independence in the 1991 referendum by a majority.    Former President Richard Nixon is more of a pragmatist than  a  conceptualist and is not that keen on rules. During his recent  10th visit to Moscow he found the claims that Russia is once  again becoming an "imperialist power" "exaggerated." In Nixon's  opinion most Russians and their leaders are opposed to "fresh  adventures" and are unwilling to even "take economic  responsibility for the other new independent states."    At the same time he warned that any attempts by Moscow to  "destabilize" Ukraine will have "destructive consequences for  Russian-U.S. relations" since "Ukrainian stability is in the  U.S. strategic interests."    Indisputably such attempts would also be ruinous for Russian  stability, placing an intolerable burden on its already  extremely frail shoulders. But here too it is no good failing  to take life's complexities into consideration. Are the  Ukrainian elections part of Moscow's attempts to destabilize  Ukraine? Will the Kiev leadership's disregard for the results  of these elections, which revealed mass resistance to severing  the close economic, cultural, and human ties with Russia, be in  the interests of Ukrainian stability? This notwithstanding, can  U.S. "strategic interest" in Ukraine be ensured?    I think that Nazarbayev, if not Kravchuk, has already  answered these questions -- as regards Kazakhstan. He used his  stay in Moscow to proclaim his vision of the future from the  Moscow State University rostrum -- a Eurasian union throughout  the post-Soviet area apart from the Baltic countries (or at  least covering Russia and Kazakhstan) with a common parliament,  single citizenship, joint armed forces, and close economic  coordination. In the different Soviet conditions the idea of a  Eurasian union was advocated by Andrey Sakharov, if you recall,  as an idea for the democratic transformation of the totalitarian  superstate. It is now being revived amid the chaos, ashes, and  disorder of devastation.    As a politician who is better aware of our common realities  than the Americans, Nazarbayev does not absolutize the concept  of independence. Reasonable interdependence can be a guarantee  of reasonable, democratically sufficient independence and  stability. Nazarbayev the dialectician opposes dual citizenship  but is in favor of single, common citizenship. He is in favor  of U.S. cooperation in the running of Baykonur in order to  haggle over leasing the cosmodrome...with Russia.    But by the strictest criteria the Kazakhstani president  needs  good relations with the power on the other continent in order to  regulate and strengthen good relations with his immediate great  neighbor with the common destiny and to force this neighbor to  get a move on. And this is no paradox but the call of  geopolitics.    On the other hand, if stability, above all nuclear stability  (what else?) is primarily the U.S. strategic priority in the  post-Soviet area the "new approach" should have its supertask.  The avowed counterbalance of aid for Russia's neighbors ("over  one-half") is politically justified if it helps find a  reasonable measure and link between independence and  interdependence and places confederative (or federative!)  relations between the former republics, with Russia, and with  the center (not the imperial center!) in the form of Russia on a  new voluntary footing. Only then can lasting partnership  relations between Russia and the United States have a future.</p>

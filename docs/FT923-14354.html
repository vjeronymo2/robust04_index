			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Corruption allegations harm Brazilian equities - The political uncertainty has led to volatility and a drop in trading volume Sharp fluctuations, with diminishing volumes, have characterised the precipitate downward career of Brazil's equity market during last two months. During a lull in the country's wounding political crisis, the index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) recovered by 5.3 per cent on Monday, following a 6.2 per cent drop on Friday. By noon yesterday it gained a further 4.7 per cent to 22,387. However, it had fallen by 46.7 per cent in dollar terms between April 22 and June 30, sustaining its worst one-day fall of the year on Monday, June 29 with a drop in dollar terms of 15.6 per cent. Volume, meanwhile, was Dollars 33.9m on Monday, down from an already record low for the year of Dollars 43.4m on Friday. Trading for the first days of July was 43 per cent lower than the same period in June, when volume had dropped by 19.3 per cent from May. Daily trading of Dollars 100m, commonplace just a few months ago, is becoming a distant memory. Since the last week of May, the malaise in the market has reflected allegations of corruption involving President Fernando Collor de Mello, either in the press or in the parliamentary inquiry into charges of influence peddling and other wrongdoing by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a businessman who was treasurer of Mr Collor's campaign. Analysts are beginning to say that the ability of new revelations to shock the market may be wearing thin. The rise in the index on Monday came in spite of a new series of allegations in the press on Sunday. 'The effect of the headlines may be diminishing,' says Mr Julius Buchenrode, director for investments of the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank. However, investors who saw the market rise by 152 per cent in dollar terms in 1991, after a punishing crash in 1990 when the Bovespa fell 71 per cent in dollar terms, seem to be voting with their feet. They may be waiting for a definition in the political scenario. The parliamentary commission is continuing its investigation, and some members of Congress are calling for Mr Collor's resignation. The president says that he will stand firm, which could lead to a debate on impeachment. There is also uncertainty about the depth of the president's parliamentary support and the future of the economy minister, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, if Mr Collor were to step down. Mr Moreira has become a symbol of stability to the business community. 'I'd say that everything is being contaminated (by the political situation), and you should not draw conclusions on any investment,' says Mr Ken Baxter, general manager for foreign funds of the Bozano Simonsen bank. With growing uncertainty, trading is becoming even more concentrated than before, even by the normal standards of the traditionally narrow bourse. On Monday, Telebras, the public telecommunications company which makes up one-third of the Bovespa index, accounted for 64 per cent of volume; 90 per cent of trading was restricted to blue chip shares. Telebras rose by 10 per cent, and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining group, by 4.7 per cent. This concentration is reversing a trend evident before the political crisis: a move toward second-line equities, shares traditionally short on liquidity but in companies that are often industry leaders in Brazil. Traders disagree whether the current retrenchment is a response to current low prices for blue chips or if it reflects a search for greater security during the political upheaval. The ability of foreign investors to adjust to uncertainty in the Brazilian equities market was improved by the National Monetary Council's announcement last week that foreign investors will be eligible to operate in the options and futures markets. Previously, the only hedge available to foreign institutions, allowed to invest directly in Brazil since last year, was the foreign exchange market.</p>

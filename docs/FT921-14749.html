			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / French state groups to seek fresh capital AEROSPATIALE and Snecma, the French state-owned aircraft and jet engine makers, yesterday revealed they were seeking substantial injections of capital. This provides the latest evidence of the financial pressures on the French aerospace and defence industries, faced with falling orders from the declines in air travel and arms budgets, plus heavy investment demands for new products. The gloomy background was reinforced yesterday by the DGA, the French state weapons procurement agency, when Le Monde newspaper quoted DGA estimates that the French arms business would lose up to 18,000 jobs this year. Neither Aerospatiale nor Snecma gave exact details of their funding needs, though officials indicated that Aerospatiale was negotiating to raise around FFr1bn (Pounds 103m) by selling a minority equity stake to Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. Snecma has indicated in the past that its financing needs this year will be FFr750m. Mr Henri Martre, chairman of Aerospatiale, said he was negotiating for a capital increase with a state-owned bank, while Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of Snecma, warned that if the government could not provide the capital needed, he would seek an alliance with a new private or public partner. Aerospatiale revealed that new orders declined sharply last year to FFr28bn  -14 per cent below forecast  - from FFr55bn in 1990, leaving total orders at FFr100bn, or 2 1/2 years work.

			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DYMALLY DENIES THREAT IN AIDING FRIEND  </P> <P> Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) said Monday that he "routinely" sends  letters to African and Caribbean heads of state asking them to employ  black-owned firms like that of his friend and campaign contributor Mamadi  Diane.  </P> <P> But he strongly denied a report in the Journal of Commerce that he hinted at  possible retaliation in a letter to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last  August complaining that Diane's Washington-based firm, Amex International,  Inc., was not hired as an agent for U.S. food aid sent to Uganda.  </P> <P> As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dymally has a major role in  the allocation of $1.5 billion in assistance under the "Food for Peace"  program, which provides grain and other commodities to needy nations at  concessionary loan rates.  </P> <P> He said he had no apologies for advocating employment of Diane, head of the  Zaire American Research Institute, who accompanied him to Zaire on one of two  trips last year that were paid for by that African nation. Diane, he said, is a  friend he has known since coming to Washington as a member of Congress in 1981.  </P> <P> Diane contributed $1,500 and his wife gave $1,000 to Dymally's 1988  congressional campaign. "A lot of people contribute to my campaign," Dymally  said in a telephone interview. "Do you expect (Republican Whip) Newt Gingrich  to contribute to my campaign?"  </P> <P> Dymally said he and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus regularly  try to help black business firms.  </P> <P> "Who in this country is going to help a black firm in trouble? A white  congressman from Louisiana?" he asked. "If a black member of Congress can't do  it, who can?"  </P> <P> In a letter dated last Aug. 24 to Museveni, Dymally protested the decision by  Uganda not to select Amex, a firm that now is the agent for Zaire and three  other African nations in the food aid program. Uganda selected a white-owned  firm to handle its shipments of food aid. Agents buy the food, arrange for  transportation and are paid a percentage of the cargo's value as a commission,  a spokesman for the Agency for International Development said.  </P> <P> "President, it is our hope that you will intervene in this matter and instruct  your Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador of Uganda in  Washington, D.C., to correct this regrettable situation and consider nominating  Amex as Uganda's agent in the U.S. for all food aid-related programs," Dymally  wrote.  </P> <P> Urging pan-African solidarity throughout the world, he suggested that hiring  Amex would benefit Uganda's cause in Congress and in the executive branch of  government.  </P> <P> "It is easy to assume, for instance, that when African-Americans are supported,  they in turn are compelled to respond more appropriately to their duty of  supporting the efforts of African countries in Washington, through their  contacts with the Congress and the Administration," Dymally wrote the African  president.  </P> <P> Asked if there was an implication of retaliation if Uganda did not retain Amex,  Dymally replied: "Of course not." And he said: "These letters are sent out  routinely to heads of state. I met with the President (Museveni) on two  occasions and never mentioned it. I never sought any special treatment (for  Diane).  </P> <P> "In this climate of ethical hysteria, if you sleep with your wife, it's  regarded as a conflict of interest," he said.  </P> <P> Dymally said the letter mistakenly was sent on a letterhead of the  Congressional Black Caucus, which he formerly chaired. But he said the caucus  also tried to persuade African nations to hire black lawyers and lobbyists,  adding:  </P> <P> "We had the entire caucus meet with Les Aspin," chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee, "to help a black vendor in my district."  </P></p>

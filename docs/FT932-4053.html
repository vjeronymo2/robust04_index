			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Hun Sen warns of Cambodia break-up soon THE RULING Cambodian People's party, alleging that the election it lost last month was marked by widespread corruption, warned yesterday that the country could break up. Mr Hun Sen, prime minister, told political leaders that moves are already under way to establish an autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia. United Nations officials have so far dismissed the warning as a political bluff. Mr Eric Falt, the spokesman for the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), commented that 'at this stage we have no evidence that any province is dissociating itself from the rest of Cambodia.' Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of Untac, added that 'Cambodia is already small enough.' At yesterday's meeting Mr Hun Sen also repeated his party's complaints about the conduct of the election and warned that his party would not hand over power to Funcinpec, the royalist party which came first in the polls, unless these allegations are fully investigated. 'Until the many outstanding issues concerning the elections are resolved, the current government will stay in place,' he said. The party has submitted a list of technical complaints about the electoral process, none of which would make much difference to the result of the election. Talks involving the CPP and Funcinpec on a possible coalition are going on at the royal palace. Mr Akashi has told the party that he is totally satisfied with the conduct of the election. In a letter sent to the party president he said there was no question of starting a new investigation to the charges of electoral fraud. Mr Akashi also rejected the CPP's other main demand, that new elections be held in at least five provinces. Final results announced by Untac yesterday give Funcinpec 58 seats in the new constituent assembly and the CPP 51 seats. Two smaller parties will share the remaining 11 seats. The assembly is due to meet for the first time on Monday and begin its task of drafting a new constitution. After that it would become a legislative body. Mr Hun Sen's threat of a new autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia was widely seen as a political gambit and as part of coalition negotiations, although it was extremely well orchestrated. As he was speaking several hundred people gathered in three eastern provinces to voice their opposition to the election results. Most of the demonstrators were government employees.</p>

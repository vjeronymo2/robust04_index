			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee rises as Africans agree on retention scheme COFFEE PRICES built on strong gains in late trading in London yesterday after African producers agreed to join Latin American exporters in keeping up to 20 per cent of their output off the world market. The plan, designed to shore up coffee prices following the collapse of talks on a new international price pact in March, won the backing of the African robusta producers at a meeting with the Latin American arabica producers in Kampala. The price of the November robusta futures contract rose to a high of Dollars 1,171 after the news came out in the late afternoon, before easing to close at Dollars 1,161, up Dollars 39. 'It was already on the move and that just boosted it,' said one trader. 'It dispelled any doubts about the weakness of the market that had arisen after New York fell out of bed last week.' The New York December arabica contract was up 2.15 at 74.15 cents a lb in late trading. The decision by the African producers, which means some 80 per cent of world coffee output will be covered by the retention scheme, was generally expected. The November contract price has risen nearly 19 per cent in the past month, as the Latin American plan gained credibility. But analysts said last week's sell-off in the New York market, following the evaporation of the latest Brazilian frost scare, might have hastened yesterday's announcement by demonstrating to producers that the recovery in prices was not entirely self-supporting. The London robusta market held up reasonably well last week as traders anticipated good news from the Kampala meeting. The rise yesterday was helped by trade buying and a shortage of immediate physical supplies, as well as technical moves in the run-up to the expiry of options this week. 'Everything seems set fair,' said one trader. 'The more the market becomes convinced the retention scheme is going to become a reality, there's no reason why it shouldn't go on up.' The 25-nation Inter-African Coffee Organisation had originally proposed to retain 15 per cent of exportable production, but agreed to the 20 per cent figure under pressure from the Latin and Central American producers. 'We believe that a 20 per cent retention is the shock treatment required to deal with a sick market,' said Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast coffee minister and IACO chairman. Some coffee producers appear anxious to avoid antagonising consuming countries by pushing up prices too far. Mr Gauze said: 'I do not think that this policy of retention favours an excessive price explosion'. The Kampala meeting is also due to set up an association of coffee-producing nations to supervise retention.</p>

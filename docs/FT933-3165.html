			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Factory output growth weaker than expected BRITAIN'S manufacturing output bounced back in July after falling sharply in June, but changes to the way the figures are collated show that growth so far this year is not as strong as previously reported. Output in July showed a 0.7 per cent rise over June, when there was a 2.1 per cent fall from the previous month. Compared with the same month a year ago, July output was up 1.7 per cent. Although manufacturing output is still growing faster than other sectors of the economy, a new series of Central Statistical Office figures shows growth in the first half of the year as much weaker than thought. Figures rebased to 1990 show that output grew by 1.2 per cent and 0.6 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year, against 2 per cent and 1.4 per cent under the old series. However a drop in production towards the end of last year was not as steep as previously recorded and, compared with a year ago, the growth rates for the first six months of the year were revised downwards only slightly. The latest figures show that in the three months to July, manufacturing output grew by 0.1 per cent compared with the previous three-month period. However, compared with the same three months a year ago, output was up 2.2 per cent. The CSO said the changes would not have a big impact on gross domestic product. They may change the quarterly profile of non-oil GDP, but the strength of manufacturing output on a year-on-year basis means the changes are unlikely to alter the recent trend of steady growth. The monthly rise in manufacturing output was concentrated in investment goods. Output of this category rose by 1.5 per cent compared with June, when it dropped 2.9 per cent. The strongest industries were textiles, leather and clothing, coke, petrol and nuclear fuels. Food, drink and tobacco and chemicals suffered the sharpest quarter-on-quarter drops. Mining and quarrying, which under the new series no longer counts as manufacturing, grew by 6.3 per cent compared with the previous three months. Within this, coal production was 14.7 per cent lower, reflecting lower-volume contracts between British Coal and the electricity generating companies from April. Electricity, gas and water production was also strong, rising 4.1 per cent in the latest three months. Shape of recovery, Page 12 Currencies, Page 37 London stocks, Page 46 See Lex</p>

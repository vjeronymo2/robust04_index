			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: American Airlines seeks Dollars 1bn cuts American Airlines yesterday announced plans to reduce its annual expenses by Dollars 1bn, making it the latest US carrier to embark on a severe cost-cutting programme in an attempt to ensure long-term profitability. The big US airlines are suffering from damaging fare wars in their home market. Last year, AMR, American's parent group, reported a loss of Dollars 110m and recorded total operating expenses of more than Dollars 15bn. A project to streamline American's headquarters management and administrative staffs was unveiled yesterday by Mr Robert Crandall, American's chairman, who said the carrier wanted to reduce annual labour costs by Dollars 750m and other expenses by Dollars 250m. Mr Crandall did not provide details on how the savings would be realised, but said a team of executives would spend the next four to five months searching for ways to streamline management and staff support functions. American has been cutting its management wage bill for the past two years, but believes further job reductions are necessary, both in the management and union workforce. The key to American's cost-cutting programme, as at other airlines, lies in negotiating an agreement with employee unions. The carrier is following other leading US airlines, which have all instituted programmes to lower their expenses. In July, United Airlines was acquired by its employees in return for wage cuts and other labour concessions worth Dollars 4.9bn. Delta Air Lines recently introduced a plan to carve Dollars 2bn a year out of its annual operating costs within the next three years, while USAir has also launched a programme to cut Dollars 1bn in its annual operating costs within the same period of time. In spite of traffic growth and low fuel prices, the industry as a whole lost Dollars 2.1bn last year because airlines were unable to charge fares high enough to cover costs. America said yesterday it had proposed wide-ranging changes to its contract with the Allied Pilots' Association, which expires today. However, the pilots' union has yet to respond to those proposals. American also faces arbitration with the flight attendants' union later this year, which it hopes will yield productivity improvements. It has held preliminary talks with the union representing mechanics and ground employees about revising their contract when it becomes due for amendment in March next year. The news of American's cost-cutting ambitions lifted the airline's share price Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 59 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

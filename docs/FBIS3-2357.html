			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Wang </F> Shude (3769 2885 1795) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719  1807 2455); Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1349  GMT on 4 March transmits a service message placing an open-ended  embargo on this item]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Mar (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, met  all the delegates to the all-army legislative work meeting  today; and so did Central Military Commission Vice Chairman  Zhang Zhen and Central Military Commission members Zhang  Wannian, Yu Yongbo and Fu Quanyou. Liu Huaqing said: The  People's Liberation Army [PLA] has made great achievements in  military legislation. The tasks of governing the state and  managing the Army according to law remain very heavy in the days  to come, and we should continue to make efforts.    The all-army legislative work meeting was held in Beijing on  3 March with the approval of the Central Military Commission.  It was the first all-army legislative work meeting in the PLA's  history. The meeting seriously adhered to the party central  committee's guidelines on strengthening legislative work, as  well as the Central Military Commission's principle of managing  the Army according to law. It concentrated on studying how to  accelerate military legislation, create a new situation of  military legislation, and use military laws in guiding,  promoting and protecting defense construction and army building  under the conditions of building a socialist market economic  structure and stepping up army building in the new period.  Present at the meeting were persons in charge of relevant  departments under the PLA's three general departments and major  units and the Armed Police Force headquarters. The comrades in  charge of the legislative affairs departments of the party  central committee, the National People's Congress, and the State  Council attended and addressed the meeting.    China has paid great attention to military legislation in  recent years. The Central Military Commission set up its  legislative bureau in 1988 to strengthen its leadership over  military legislation. So far, the National People's Congress  and its Standing Committee have successively promulgated nine  military laws and legal decisions, including the "Military  Service Law" and the "Law on Protection of Military  Installations." More than 100 military regulations and military  administrative regulations have been enacted either by the  Central Military Commission alone or by the Central Military  Commission and the State Council jointly. More than 1,000 sets  of military rules have been formulated and published by the  three general departments and major PLA units. So, a more  feasible military legal system has been preliminarily  established, and the planning of military legislation has  improved. Moreover, the PLA has made great efforts to supervise  and inspect law enforcement and to register all military rules  and regulations, and the efforts have promoted the  implementation of military laws and upheld the unity and dignity  of the legal system. The PLA has also made remarkable  achievements in publicizing the law, carrying out legal  education, training legal affairs cadres, and providing legal  counsel, as well as in jurisprudential studies.</p>

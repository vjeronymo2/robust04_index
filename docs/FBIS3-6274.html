"It  is not possible to specify when we are going to attack. That  would depend on the opportunity," he said. However, according to  Tie Banh, the Royal Army will definitely move against Pailin as  it is the responsibility of government forces to suppress "the  outlaw forces". [passage omitted]    "(The Cambodian government) is to try to solve this (Khmer  Rouge) problem as soon as possible so people can live happily,"  Tie Banh said.    There have been rumours recently that about 9,000 government  forces had moved closer to Pailin, preparing for a major attack.  But according to Tie Banh, a large force would not necessarily  be helpful in fighting the Khmer Rouge who are accustomed to  hit-and-run fighting. "Effective and well-planned strategies  will be more useful," he said. The minister said the news media  had worsened the situation by publishing groundless reports.  "How would they know how many army personnel we have? And even  we don't know when to attack the Khmer Rouge," he said.    Asked if he knew the size of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla  force,  Tie Banh said it was difficult to estimate but he personally  believed the faction did not have as big a force as generally  reported. He said news reports have always overestimated the  guerrilla forces.    Despite the fact that the royalist Funcinpec [National  United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] and the Khmer Rouge had been allies for 13 years, from  1979 to 1992, fighting the Phnom Penh government, Tie Banh said  Funcinpec and the Cambodian Peoples Party did not have any  conflict over military policy. "Our policy is to clear the  country of outlaw forces responsible for public unrest," he  said. According to Tie Banh, it would be against the public  will for the army to be reluctant to suppress the Khmer Rouge.  "In the past, they were allies, but now they must be broken up  as we have to follow the rules," he said.    Meanwhile, Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat of Funcinpec said  military forces would not always be able to end every conflict  but "political approaches" in many cases would be more  successful. He cited as an example Thailand's long-unsuccessful  fight against the communist party which finally was resolved  through a combined political-social approach. "Cambodia would  do well to follow suit," he said.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acatos shares jump 19p on link-up with supplier Shares in Acatos &amp; Hutcheson rose by 19p to 335p after the edible oils and fats manufacturing group said it had reached agreement with an international supplier to take a 22.5 per cent stake in the company. Acatos declined to identify the supplier, and said the agreement to subscribe for new shares was subject to contract. The company put out a statement late on Friday evening, after market rumours had pushed its share price up 33p during last week. Acatos said the two companies intended to co-operate on various areas of business of mutual interest and advantage. The proposed share subscription would be based on a price of 288p, the level at which Acatos' shares closed on Thursday. Analysts said one possible candidate was Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness group which supplies Acatos's biggest refinery in London's Docklands and which likes to take stakes in trading partners. The edible oils market is dominated by international, privately-owned companies such as Cargill of the US and Bunge y Born of Argentina. Other players include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group that dominates the UK branded edible oils market, and Aarhus of Denmark. Analysts said Acatos - which is the biggest supplier of own-label food oils and margarine in the UK, with about a 30 per market share - has long wanted to move beyond the UK. In 1990 it pulled out of an unsuccessful joint venture in Spain, writing off Pounds 6.9m. In the same year, Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, abandoned an attempt to take the group private after he could not reach agreement with potential institutional investors. The group's weekend statement also said it was proceeding with a planned reconstruction of the 37.1 per cent shareholding currently controlled by Acatos Limited, a private company which owns the shares previously owned by Mr Hutcheson, his family and other parties. Advisers are working on a scheme to improve the shares' liquidity by making it easier for stakeholders in the private company to sell their shares. The group said it hoped agreement on this would be reached before its year-end on September 30.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX-SEGODNYA report under the "Expectations" rubric: </F> "Government Forecasts Growth in Wages, Prices, and Unemployment  in 1994"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Economy Ministry has  prepared a report together with the State Statistics Committee  "On the State of the Russian Economy in 1993 and the Prospects  of its Development for 1994." The economic slump continued in  1993, the report says: GDP [gross domestic product] shrunk 12  percent compared with 1992, and the budget deficit was 7 percent.    Despite the slump in production, the report continues, the  situation on the consumer market has improved. The supply of  commodities has increased, and aggregate trade volume was up  against 1992. Money incomes of the population grew 10 percent,  while the share of food in household expenditures began to  decline.    The nonstate sector of the economy is beginning to play a  significant role in the market transformations, the ministry  says. It employs over 40 percent of the country's working  population. Municipal property privatization entered its final  stage. By the end of 1993, the program of "small privatization"  covered around 70 percent of trade, public catering, and  consumer service enterprises. The process of switching to a  single agricultural market has been under way. The formation of  a two-tier banking system continued. Aside from the Central  Bank, around 2,000 commercial banks operated in the sector.  They accounted for 80 percent of the total volume of credits.    An important characteristic of the current economic  situation  in Russia, the report says, is the growth of the service sector  as a share of GDP, a trend attributable to a stepped-up activity  in the service and finance industries. In 1993, they accounted  for around 42 percent in actual prices, whereas in 1992 their  share was 33 percent.    The report says that the government's main objective in 1994  will be to continue moderately tight financial and monetary  policies aimed at reducing the inflation rate and cutting the  budget deficit. According to the authors of the report, the  anti-inflation measures will make it possible to reduce the  inflation index to 5-7 percent per month by year's end, or three  times lower compared to the fourth quarter of 1993.    In 1994 nominal monthly wages will continue to rise and,  according to the authors' forecasts, may reach 240,000 rubles  [R], which amounts to a 4.1- to 4.2-fold increase against 1992.  The ratio of nominal money incomes and consumer prices will be  85-90 percent. The minimum pay, taking into account the  subsistence minimum, will reach R50,000 plus by year's end.    It is expected, the report notes, that the volume of retail  sales will stabilize in 1994 and the share of light industry  production will increase. So will the share of paid services in  the structure of consumer expenditures: up to 14-15 percent  against 7.5 percent in 1993.    The authors see growing unemployment as a characteristic  feature of 1994 caused by the slump in production and the  restructuring of enterprises: the number of unemployed will  rise to 7 million against 4 million in 1993, but only around 3  million people will be officially registered as such. By the  end of 1994 unemployment is expected to rise to 5-6 percent.    The report predicts that the growth in retail and wholesale  prices will slow steadily in 1994. Wholesale prices are  expected to rise 3.6-fold by December 1994 compared with  December 1992. The ruble's slide is also expected to slow down  between twofold and threefold.</p>

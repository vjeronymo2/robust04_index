			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Chicago returns to its 19th century origins - The Midwest has had its day The Midwest Stock Exchange will go back to its 19th century roots and re-assume the name 'Chicago' this summer, after a 45-year hiatus which has seen America's second-largest stock exchange decline in stature and in focus. Its newly-installed chief executive, Mr Homer Livingston, believes that the name 'Chicago Stock Exchange' more precisely locates the exchange in the minds of international investors, and will associate his regional market with the innovative reputations of Chicago's derivatives exchanges. 'Nobody really knows where the Midwest is,' says Mr Livingston. 'Chicago is an international financial centre and as the second oldest exchange in Chicago (after the Chicago Board of Trade), we are an integral part of this community.' Geography and sentiment aside, the new name will also go a long way to put some distance between the stock exchange, and an embarrasing scandal for which it paid Dollars 2m in fines last year to the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, it will do little to address the critical issues which are vital to the MSE's survival. Organised in 1882 to trade securities in local railroads, banks and energy companies, the MSE now trades in many of the same stocks as the New York and American Stock Exchanges. It survives by taking overflow orders from New York, specialising in block trades and competing with the NYSE by offering lower prices, faster executions, and better service. Its niche is a thin one, and threatens to be eroded by technology and lower-priced competitors. The MSE, along with other established US securities exchanges, is in a fierce battle for market share with privately operated over-the-counter exchanges. Relative newcomers like the New York-based Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities have managed in the last five years to capture 10 per cent of the volume in New York stock exchange-listed stocks, at the expense of the NYSE, MSE, and other regional exchanges. Known as the Third Market, over-the-counter exchanges have entrepreneurial ownership and operate with much lower overheads than traditional member-owned exchanges. They are also subject to far fewer federal regulations, and frequently generate business by paying their brokerage house customers for orders, a controversial practice under scrutiny by the SEC. In the last five years the MSE has seen its share of trading in NYSE-listed stocks drop from 9.74 per cent to 7.92 per cent, while NASD-cleared market share rose to 10.10 per cent, from 2.91 per cent. The NYSE's share of trading in its own stocks dropped to 66.88 per cent, from 72.99 per cent. Mr Livingston, who arrived at the exchange in January after a 25-year career in banking, has attacked the competition head-on. In April the MSE slashed its trading fees, offered to match NYSE and Amex prices on limit trades, and will help its members, known as specialists, pay for orders. The exchange cannot force its tradition-bound members to adopt aggressive attitudes, but it has been putting competitive pressure on them by publicising the specialists which are offering new services. One month is hardly a test, but the new strategy appeared to succeed in April. After seeing volume decline by 4 per cent in the first quarter, the MSE's turnover jumped by 8 per cent in April to 275m shares. It remains to be seen if the improvement can be sustained, and if the higher volumes can be translated into higher profits. The exchange is at a crucial juncture. Members' equity dropped to Dollars 20.4m last year, from Dollars 26.3m the year before, after a Dollars 10mn property write-down and a one-time accounting charge turned a Dollars 3m operating profit into a Dollars 5.8m loss. Volume, at 2.97bn shares in 1992, was the second-best on record. Seat prices also began to edge up last year, topping Dollars 40,000 for the first time in four years, but remaining well below the 1987 high of Dollars 107,000. The improvement, analysts say, is evidence that member and customer confidence is returning following the SEC settlement over improper accounting practices by two of its affiliates, Midwest Clearing and Midwest Securities. The subsidiaries, the SEC said, had, over a period of a decade, improperly retained interest earnings on the deposits of the brokers who did business with them. In a settlement last year, the Midwest paid the Dollars 2m fine and agreed to jettison its long-time outside auditors and overhaul its administrative staff. As part of the blood-letting Mr John Weithers, the longstanding MSE chairman, departed and Mr Livingston, a graduate of Princeton and of the University of Chicago Law School, was hired to turn the exchange around. Although this is his first foray into the securities business, Mr Livingston appears well suited for the job, having earned a reputation in Chicago as a bank rescue artist. His business strategy for the exchange is simple. 'We are going to provide cheaper, faster order delivery,' he says. In the long run, however, he admits that the MSE's competitiveness will hinge on having a more level regulatory playing field between private and SEC-regulated exchanges.</p>

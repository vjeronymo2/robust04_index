			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- The Romanian  Chamber of Deputies unanimously adopted, on 9 May, the draft law  regarding the ratification of the convention on human rights  defense and fundamental freedoms, as well as its additional  protocols. By this convention -- adopted on 4 November 1950 and  signed or ratified by all member states of the Council of Europe  -- as well as by the ten protocols added subsequently, several  civil and political rights are guaranteed: the right to freedom  and security of the individual, the right to an equitable civil  and criminal trial, freedom of expression, the right to free  elections and respect of property.    The adopted draft provides however under the following  reserve: "The adoption of the convention shall not prevent  Romania from putting into application the legal provisions  through which military discipline is regulated and neither shall  it impose additional financial obligations related to the  private education system, others than those set under the  domestic law". The convention has been previously adopted by  Romania's Senate.</p>

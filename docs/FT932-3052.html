			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Attila' and 'The Flute' - Opera in London As revived at the Royal Opera by David Edwards, Elijah Moshinsky's splendid Verdi production retains all the power it had in 1990. Verdi composed Attila some four years after Stiffelio (which Moshinsky staged triumphantly this spring), and four years before Nabucco. It counts unambiguously as 'early Verdi', which most often means bald melodrama and stand-and-deliver arias. In that restricted style Verdi could already write potently expressive music, and sometimes break through the period routines; but his libretti and their schematic situations - which Verdi took quite seriously as his inspiration - now inspire only patronising attitudes. Moshinsky's great practical gift is for forcing us, too, to recognise that those situations are serious at heart, at least as Verdi sets them; that the apparent veering between banality and lofty extravagance is only a matter of surface style, as in Handel's operas; that all those arias are human responses to grave circumstances, not mere operatic showpieces. No doubt, early Verdi with exotic trappings like Attila - decadent 5th-century Romans fending off hell-bent Attila and his Huns - has looked ridiculous in revivals this century which tried to play him 'naturalistically'. Moshinsky's solution here is inseparable from Michael Yeargan's sets: stage-high wooden palisades parting at unpredictable angles to reveal ancient towns, mudflats and barrens, gloweringly lit by Robert Bryan. The time and the places are evoked palpably, but with a minimum of picturesque detail; and in those louring spaces, the performers can make their old-fashioned gestural semaphore tell. As the posturing becomes transparent, we see through it to tribal loyalties, fraught personal trusts, voracious ambitions and old, inconsolable regrets for a 'noble' world lost. (Verdi honoured all the Risorgimento ideals.) If almost every aria begins with either a rumpty-tum village-band flourish or a strummed harp - quite rightly, the conductor Edward Downes swings into those things with unabashed fervour - in this cleverly stripped-down context its vocal line soon says something sharper and more poignant. That needs a superlative cast, and again the Royal Opera have got one. From earlier runs we have Giorgio Zancanaro again as the disillusioned, backward-looking Roman general Ezio, confounding the New Grove Opera diagnosis of his role ('vague and undefined') by a searching account of 'Dagl'immortali vertici'; and as the romantically besotted Foresto, Dennis O'Neill - our best mock-Italian tenor, by a very long way - can at last marry his guilty hangdog look to passionate expression. Above all, the new incumbents in the central roles serve Verdi's (and Moshinsky's) intentions with severe honesty. Elizabeth Connell's Odabella, reeling between Italian patriotism and Attila's macho appeal, wields all the requisite vocal steel - unlovely, but hard-wrought and gripping - and yet melts beautifully for her last, compromised plea to Foresto. Attila himself is the American baritone Samuel Ramey, deploying all his best strengths: coiled-spring intensity, dark eloquence and a sculpted Tartar face. Directed by Terry Edwards, the Royal Opera chorus makes a decisive mark at each opportunity. Such tautly contrived mixes are unstable; hear this one if you can, while it lasts]                             *      *      * On the same night English National Opera reached its final presentation of the season, a revival of The Magic Flute. Whenever the company is in search of an audience, this is an opera to which it can turn. The present production, dating from 1988, is sophisticated and morally unimpeachable: it erases all suggestions of racism from the text by painting Monostatos white and avoids sexism by introducing a woman into the Brotherhood. An easy sense of humour, the opera's childlike innocence, come to it less easily. This revival is not especially distinguished, in either orchestral or vocal terms. Alan Opie's genial Papageno was worth his bottle of scrumpy, shared no doubt with Sally Harrison's bubbly Papagena at the end. Otherwise, the chief pleasure of the evening came from the radiant singing of Gillian Webster, whose Pamina is in a class of her own, a beautifully pure soprano and a musician who shapes every phrase in the most personal manner. In the favourite duet with Papageno this translation has her singing of 'truth and beauty' - just the qualities that she alone brought to the performance. There are seven more peformances of Attila at Covent Garden between tonight and July 3; The Magic Flute is at the London Coliseum until June 25 (sponsor: United Airlines)</p>

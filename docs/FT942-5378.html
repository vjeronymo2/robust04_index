			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: English restraint in Bond St - Caroline Charles tells Lucia van der Post about her latest shop Something extraordinary is happening in Bond Street next week - a British designer is opening a shop. Here in the street where the big international names such as Versace and Chanel, St Laurent and Hermes have their flagship stores British designer Caroline Charles has decided to open up for business. One is tempted to ask if she is entirely right in the head - this, after all, is the street where Pierre Cardin, Etienne Aigner, Chaumet and Birger-Christiansen came to grief. But Charles smiles serenely and says that she is 'quite, quite sure that it is time to open in another area of London. 'We were on a roll, you see,' she tells me. 'The Beauchamp Place shop is a success, the licences in Japan are doing well, the business has until now been totally owned by me but I found I could borrow money from the City to expand and when I found the shop in Bond Street that seemed the perfect answer.' Indeed she may be right - later in the year Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Joseph and several other fashion luminaries will be opening in Bond Street, suggesting a kind of collective vote of confidence in the revival of the street's fortunes. Charles is a quintessentially English designer and her success, as she acknowledges, is founded on understanding perfectly the world the Englishwoman moves in. She understands the grand occasion clothes the season calls for as well as the English preference for reticence and restraint. Her clothes are, above all, ladylike. 'Anybody who has to launch a ship, sing at Bayreuth, get married or make a public speech could be a customer of ours,' she tells me. 'We make clothes that stand up well to public scrutiny and I am absolutely obsessed with making sure the clothes work. I like to make the basic lines in plain fabrics that don't get noticed too much and then they can be mixed with embroideries and special weavings, what I call collectables. All the time I tell the design team to check - are they warm enough if it is for Glyndebourne, can they move their arms properly in that sleeve, will the skirt deal with a windy day.' She has been providing these special clothes in her own quiet way ever since 1963 when she showed her first collection in her tiny flat and both Woollands (the chic Knightsbridge store which today is Harvey Nichols) and Harrods decided they had to have it. 'You couldn't begin to call it a show,' she says, 'We could hardly afford a hanger, let alone a show. I used to get my hangers from Sketchley and buy my labels from Harrods which I would then rush back to sew in before delivering the clothes back to Harrods. 'It was incredibly lucky timing - Mary Quant had beaten a great path and a little group of us were able to follow. We swung along through the 1960s, all short and sharp and then we moved into slightly hippy but very beautiful embroidered Lebanese inspired clothes, then into gipsyish boots and petticoats. 'We got another boost when oil brought the Arabs to London and they liked our sequins and embroideries but it wasn't until the 1980s that I finally got the courage to open my own shop in Beauchamp Place. It was absolute heaven to have my own clothes hanging up as I chose.' It was not long before she realised that many of her customers wanted a total service. 'If you buy here,' says Charles, 'not only will we make sure the dress or outfit fits (there are alterations experts on the premises at both shops) but we will trim your hat, find you a pair of shoes, give you a cup-of-tea and even find something as small as a handkerchief.' The new shop manages to be both intimate and grand. There are the trademark cream and black interior, spacious changing-rooms, helpful assistants and there on the rails, the hallmarks of the Caroline Charles style - an investment evening dress on a hanger there, a discreet navy suit that would go from school-run to cocktail party taking in the boardroom in between. There is lots of her favourite wool crepe ('perfect for the English climate'), soft, floaty skirts, lean waistcoats, very plain and simple wide trousers and a palette that is mainly cream and black, ivory and honey and maize. Anyone still dithering about how to dress for the occasions that make up the English season could do worse than look at the new shop at 170 New Bond Street, London W1.</p>

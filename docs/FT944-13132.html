			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated Treasuries stage advance Longer-dated US Treasury bonds staged a modest advance yesterday ahead of today's data on economic growth, suggesting the market had already factored an unfavourable reading into bond prices. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/16 better at 93 13/16 , with the yield at 8.043 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 6.875 per cent. The slight advance across the board was not a reflection of any fundamental shift in sentiment. The tone remained marginally negative, with most traders merely squaring their positions ahead of the advance estimate of gross domestic product in the three months to the end of September. Few were willing to make big commitments beforehand, even though many believe the market has established a bottom. Most economists have already revised upwards their forecasts. The consensus view sees growth at 3 per cent during the quarter, as weaker initial forecasts have fallen victim to the series of stronger than expected economic indicators in recent weeks. Few doubt that the Federal Reserve is poised to lift short-term interest rates again. For the same reasons, bond yields had climbed to their highest levels in 2 1/2 years. With the return on the long bond hovering above 8 per cent all week, buyers finally reappeared yesterday, though the activity was restrained, at best. Improvement in the dollar against the yen and D-Mark was a help, as was the willingness of traders to ignore a mildly discouraging economic report. Initial claims for unemployment benefit showed a small dip last week, against expectations of a slight gain. At the short end, uncertainty over the aggressiveness of the Fed's expected move after the November elections held back activity. Today's GDP data may provide a clue on the size of the next rate increase. European government bonds extended their early gains in late trading, supported by firmer US Treasuries and lifted by a break of key resistance on the German bund futures contract. However, market participants remained nervous ahead of today's release of US GDP data, and dealers said investor participation was minimal, with most of the activity taking place in the futures pits. UK gilts rallied by about a point, strongly out-performing German bunds. The December long gilt future on Liffe ended the day around 100 1/4 , up  15/16 . The 10-year gilt yield spread over bunds narrowed to 133 from 142 basis points on Wednesday. In large part, gilts were lifted by comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, who said that UK interest rates would not have to rise much if a tight fiscal policy was maintained. 'This may be a hint that the (November 29) Budget will be comparatively tight,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at ABN Amro Hoare Govett. The market was also relieved by ebbing supply concerns after Wednesday's gilt auction, which has left the funding pipeline clear of supply until December. A stronger currency also supported gilts and encouraged some foreign buying. Dealers reported overseas purchases in seven to 10-year maturities, while domestic investors were said to have been moving into longer maturities. German bonds rose by more than  1/2 point in largely technical dealings. Early in the day, prices rose on hopes that the Bundesbank might revert to variable-rate securities repurchase agreements from the current regime of fixed-rate repos, which was seen to pave the way for lower short-term rates. Although the Bundesbank's Council at its meeting yesterday left interest rates unchanged and announced two more weeks of fixed-rate repos at an unchanged 4.85 per cent, the market held on to its gains. In the afternoon, slightly firmer US Treasuries helped the December bund future breach key resistance at 89.00; it closed around its day's high of 89.25, up 0.62. Europe's high-yielders continued their recent rally. Italy again out-performed Germany, its yield spread over bunds narrowing to 422 from 437 basis points on Wednesday; Sweden's yield gap remained steady around 315 basis points. Swedish bonds were lifted by the Riksbank's 20 basis point increase in the repo rate to 7.40 per cent, seen as a credibility-bolstering move by the newly-appointed central bank council. Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday's cabinet agreement on amendments to pension reform, the nomination of Mr Vincenzo Desario as central bank deputy governor and buying by domestic investors.</p>

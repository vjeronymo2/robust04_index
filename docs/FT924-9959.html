			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific takes CDollars 270m item for lay-offs CANADIAN Pacific has taken a CDollars 270m charge in its third quarter to cover the cost of laying off one-third of the train crews in its core railway business. The charge, combined with higher losses from truck operations and sharply reduced income from coal mining, quadrupled the Montreal-based conglomerate's third-quarter loss to CDollars 205.6m (Dollars 165.8m), or 64 cents a share, from CDollars 51.8m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. The special CP Rail charge will cover severance costs resulting from new labour agreements with unions in the US and Canada, under which the size of each train's crew will be cut from three to two. A total of 1,600 workers out of CP Rail's workforce of 27,400 people will lose their jobs. CP is trying to improve its competitiveness, not only in its core transport operations but also in its forestry, real estate and coal mining subsidiaries. The company said yesterday that further job cuts and asset sales were in the wings. CP's third-quarter operating loss was CDollars 165.9m, compared with earnings of CDollars 144.2m a year earlier. The trucking division's losses soared to CDollars 14m from CDollars 1.8m, reflecting declining traffic and increasingly stiff price competition. Third-quarter revenues dipped to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.5bn. A five-month strike at Fording Coal and the difficulties of other coal mines in south-east British Columbia contributed to a CDollars 51m slump in the rail division's revenues. CP Rail was also hit by lower iron and steel, energy and container traffic. CP's share of losses suffered by CP Forest, its forest products subsidiary, dropped by CDollars 21m to CDollars 52.4m. The company said newsprint demand in the US had improved in recent months. The US pulp market also picked up, but was offset by lower demand from Europe and Japan. Demand for white paper has weakened. PanCanadian Petroleum's operating earnings improved in the third quarter, due mainly to a 25 per cent rise in crude oil output and a 46 per cent jump in natural gas production. This was partially offset by lower prices. For the nine months, including unusual items, the loss amounted to CDollars 224.3m, or 70 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 26.2m, or 8 cents, last year.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Honeypot of as much as Pounds 4bn 'down the drain' - Trade patterns / Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies One Kuala Lumpur based British businessman had a straightforward reaction to events of the last few days. 'It's terrible, terrible. Three years of negotiations down the drain. I'm going to get drunk.' It is hard to over-estimate the effect of yesterday's Malaysian government action against British companies. Over the past six years, Malaysia has been a honeypot for British business. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister who made yesterday's announcement, said up to MDollars 16bn (Pounds 4bn) could be affected by the move. John Laing, the British construction and engineering company, has had its regional HQ in Malaysia for the past eight years. With its Malaysian partners Laing is involved in a Pounds 212m hospital building programme, a Pounds 30m airport project in East Malaysia and has recently invested Pounds 12m in a power station project. But Laing will now have to wave goodbye to possible multi million pound contracts to build an extensive army barracks complex and a private university complex in Kuala Lumpur. Negotiations on the barracks have been going on for four years. For Laing and companies like it, Malaysia was a shop window to the region. Malaysia is a regional pioneer in build, operate, transfer contracts and in privatising its power sector. British Gas, the National Grid, John Brown, Rolls Royce and others had hoped to use their involvement in the Malaysian power sector as a springboard in the world's fastest growing economic region. The most cruel blow has been dealt to the group of companies involved in the Anglo- Japanese consortium working on a new MDollars 12bn (Pounds 3bn) airport south of Kuala Lumpur. Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon and G-Mats (part of GEC) - in partnership with Marubeni of Japan had been assured of the bulk of the work. Yesterday Mr Anwar said the British companies involved had already been informed that they would been awarded no further work on the project. The airport, due to be completed before 1998 when Malaysia is due to host the Commonwealth Games, could be delayed by the forced British withdrawal. The cost could also rise. Malaysia does not seem concerned. There are many grey areas in the midst of this fracas: Mr Anwar said compensation would be paid in some instances and all existing contracts would be honoured. But he said the Malaysian government was under no obligation to abide by memorandums of understanding and letters of intent with British companies. However some contracts already signed are the first phase of more extensive agreements. Mr Anwar said Malaysia would still be taking delivery of 28 British Aerospace Hawk aircraft - a deal which formed part of the controversial 1988 MOU on defence sales agreed between Dr Mahathir and Mrs Thatcher. But question marks arise over a comprehensive maintenance and technology transfer agreement allied to the Hawk contract. Clearly some agreements are going to be very difficult to unwind. Mr Anwar said only government contracts will be effected by the Malaysian move, but many private deals are also likely to be in jeopardy. Many of Malaysia's biggest companies - some involved in joint ventures with British companies - are closely connected with Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the country's dominant political party. Britain does have some leverage: Malaysia exports well over Pounds 1bn worth of goods to Britain each year and the trade surplus is substantially in Malaysia's favour. Britain is the main export market for the Proton, the Malaysian car manufactured in conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan. But confident in its own economic success, Malaysia is not concerned about the fallout. When John Major visited Kuala Lumpur last September, he announced that British companies were negotiating contracts worth Pounds 1bn which could secure 25,000 UK jobs. Mr Anwar's answer on those negotiations was unequivocal. 'Virtually all those contracts will not be approved,' he said.</p>

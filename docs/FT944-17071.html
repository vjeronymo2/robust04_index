			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Chrysler - Other companies The good news from US carmakers looks set to continue into the final months of this year. Despite the potential damage done to sales by higher interest rates, all three big producers continue to have trouble meeting demand. Chrysler, which tomorrow will be the first of the three to report third-quarter figures, made Dollars 350m after tax a year ago: this time, most expectations are running at about Dollars 550m. Mr David Healy, motors analyst at SG Warburg in New York, is even more optimistic. With vehicle sales up by as much as 100,000 over a year ago, net income could reach Dollars 750m, he says.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RSPCA puts its mark on humanely-produced food Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals launched its 'Freedom Food' label yesterday, which it hopes will encourage farmers to improve standards of animal welfare. The mark will be applied to eggs and pork where animals have been reared and treated according to guidelines laid down by the charity. The RSPCA hailed the initiative as 'allowing farm animals to take the first step back from the factory to the farm'. But the standards adopted were criticised by other animal welfare groups as being too lax. For example, the RSPCA does not specify that eggs must come only from free-range chickens, but that barn eggs are acceptable as long as the birds have enough space. Mr Mike Sharpe of Freedom Food argued that the guidelines were based on five years of research into welfare issues and adapted in a way that farmers would stick to. The organisation draws up a plan for each participating farm, tailoring the guidelines to each individual situation. 'It's the beginning of a revolution in farming practice by linking the good, caring farmer directly to the consumer,' said Mr Sharpe. So far he has signed up 200 large producers with Tesco and the Co-op agreeing to stock the produce. Freedom Food will conduct yearly inspections of the registered farmers as well as random checks to ensure that standards are being met. The RSPCA maintains that consumers are prepared to pay a premium for food that they know comes from well-treated animals. It hopes to extend the scheme to beef, lamb and dairy products later in the year. Mr Mike Baxter, an animal welfare expert from Brunel university said: 'Freedom Food's standards are the most comprehensive in existence and most rigorously derived from scientific experience'.</p>

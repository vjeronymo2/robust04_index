			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Congress delay may hit IMF funds THE prospects of the Int-ernational Monetary Fund winning its Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34bn) funding increase this year are receding because of mounting opposition in the US to foreign aid. The US administration has asked Congress to approve the funding for the US's Dollars 12bn share of the increase, but has made little effort to press for the quota increase in the face of opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. Congressmen and congressional aides now say attempts to pass legislation this year authorising the IMF quota increase appear virtually dead. The administration's reluctance to push for the quota increase has been reinforced by the challenge to Mr Bush posed by Mr Patrick Buchanan, the isolationist candidate for the Republican party nomination for president. Mr Buchanan has denounced foreign aid in general and the IMF funding in particular. Most other IMF member countries have already approved their contributions, but under IMF rules the overall quota increase cannot go ahead unless approved by countries representing 85 per cent of voting powers. The US has 19 per cent of the IMF's voting rights. Without the rise, the IMF could face a serious cash shortage later this year as it attempts to meet growing loan demands, especially from Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The IMF has headroom for future lending of only Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn, which could easily be absorbed in loans for members of the CIS. Liquidity could fall to 'dangerously low levels by the end of this year', according to western diplomats. In the past the IMF has overcome temporary liquidity shortages by borrowing directly from member countries, but with most leading industrial countries running large budget deficits, Japan is the only likely source of bilateral support for the IMF. US reluctance to contribute is also delaying a planned Dollars 1.3bn capital increase for the International Finance Corporation - the World Bank's arm for promoting the private sector in developing countries. The IFC has already had to cut its lending operations at a time when the World Bank is under pressure from the US administration to expand its direct support for the private sector. Congress still stands a slim chance of passing a foreign aid appropriations bill - the natural home for the quota increase provision - before the current funding expires at the end of this month. This bill is, however, currently tied up by the impasse over Israel's request for Dollars 10bn of loan guarantees to help it absorb up to one million immigrants from the former Soviet Union. But even if an aid bill is put forward, neither Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate appropriation subcommittee on foreign operations, nor Congressman David Obey, his opposite number in the House of Representatives, plans to include the IMF quota increase. Congressional aides do not rule out the possibility that a member could propose funding the quota increase in an amendment but it is extremely unlikely that any member would want to take this politically unprofitable risk.

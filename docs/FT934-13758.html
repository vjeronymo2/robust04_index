			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Placing values Cantab at lower end of range Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the bio-technology group, said yesterday that the placing which will bring it to the London market was fully subscribed at 460p and had raised Pounds 13.8m for the company. The pricing was dictated by the price prevailing for the shares already quoted on New York's Nasdaq exchange where the shares were listed in 1992. The placing values Cantab at Pounds 45.3m, towards the bottom of the range that the company had been seeking. Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said he was pleased with the placing. Together with Pounds 7m of net cash already in the company Cantab could now fund at least two years of development, the upgrading of facilities and working capital. Cantab is some way from producing a marketable product but is closest with a drug called LM-CD45, designed to reduce the incidence of rejection in kidney transplant operations. Last year, when Cantab came to the US market, it issued 1m shares at Dollars 10.</p>

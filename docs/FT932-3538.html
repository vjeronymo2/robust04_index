			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: A mindset to escape from the tiger - Bryan Webster offers an unconventional view We need to face the unpalatable fact that our national management mindset is affecting the whole of our national performance. That mindset projects the manager as troubleshooter, problem-solver, dynamic decision-maker. It is responsible for our love of organisation charts and job descriptions for particular managers, so that we know who to blame if things go wrong. It is underpinned by our ubiquitous appraisal and by our performance-related pay schemes. Above all, there is our touching belief that we can improve our businesses by training managers - the Charter Initiative, MBAs and extremely expensive Executive Development Programmes. While we are wasting our time and energy on such a management model they have discovered something different elsewhere. The Japanese, for instance, have demonstrated that companies are not collections of managers, nor even of functions; they are combinations of interacting processes. If these processes are understood, refined, controlled and continuously improved, goes their view, the organisation will achieve its goals. So what can we learn? If our current management mindset is dragging us down, what will lift us up? The emerging management is organic rather than mechanical; rather than attempting to manipulate the ends, top management seeks to cultivate the capability of the company. We can think of this capability in three ways. The first is process capability. Quality of product and service is achieved by controlling the interacting productive, business and management processes. Nissan have so developed process control that improvements of 0.6 of a second can now be picked up and implemented. The second element is organisational capability. It consists of obvious things such as, buildings, finance, technology, systems and people, and not so obvious, such as employee goodwill and behaviour, credibility with customers, market awareness, the ability of the organisation to learn and, of course, the directing of all these towards a common goal (management). Organisational capability is what the Japanese are preserving when they hold on to their skilled people in a downturn, and what brings them running out of it. The third element is personal capability. Everyone, everywhere must keep their face turned to the real world, and keep learning how to prosper in it. In particular it means top management encouraging the awkward questions that challenge their own self satisfaction and so lead them to search for new learning and new answers. The world's best companies are already well into the process capability method of management. Asea Brown Boveri, for instance, has cut its lead times by an average of 21 per cent and hopes to take them down to 50 per cent by the end of this year. To achieve this Percy Barnevik, ABB's chief executive, has changed the role of his managers from 'a combination of policemen and errand boys; now they act as support for the workers'. And the workers are working at the processes. This way of managing will become common in the next 10-20 years and those who wish to cling to the manager-dominated model should pay heed to the parable of the tiger, which is now fast becoming part of management folklore. It tells of two hikers, who find themselves facing a man-eating tiger. One pulls out a pair of trainers and puts them on. 'You must be joking,' says his companion, 'you can't outrun a tiger.' 'No,' he replies, 'but I can outrun you.' I first heard the story six years ago, from a chief executive in one of Britain's top companies. He thought it was funny. But in those six years his company lost its profitability, much of its market and two-thirds of its workforce. Finally, it dispensed with his services. He was nearer the tiger than he thought. The author is an independent management counsellor.                           *      *      * Check your organisation's mindset by giving this case study to your managers: You discover customers have been told that a particular service is available from you at half its real cost.  You track the mistake to a particular section.  The company value statement says it will honour its word, but to provide the service at the cost quoted will seriously affect quarterly profits in you unit. What is to be done? A manager in a manager-centered company will: tell staff to stop the service; drop everything to find out what has gone wrong; hold meetings to get to the bottom of it; decide what went wrong; find who is to blame; if another area is to blame, sort out the manager (unless it is their own boss); personally restart the service to show staff how it is to be done; if individuals are to blame, counsel them or give them a warning; congratulate self on decisive management A manager in a process-centered company will: ask staff to advise customers that service  has been withdrawn; ask team to investigate, then correct factors within their control; review team's findings; review the process by which policies are implemented at unit level; set right factors external to team; systems, resources, communication; confirm new procedures and train everyone; take team through the incident specifically to learn lesson; give individual help where needed</p>

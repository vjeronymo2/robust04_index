			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico Stocks ended sharply higher, driven by demand from foreign investors and expectations of a decline in interest rates. The key IPC index climbed 65.51 points, or 3.05 per cent, to 2,213.09. Turnover was a moderate 85.32m shares. Rises exceeded declines by 63 to 15. Traders said the market was also helped by the strong gains on Wall Street, which spilled over into Mexican shares trading there. The stock exchange authorities said yesterday that the value of foreign holdings in ADRs fell to Dollars 30bn at the end of April from Dollars 33.5bn at the beginning of the year.</p>

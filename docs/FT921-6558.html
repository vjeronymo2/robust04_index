			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Varez poised to buy Ibercorp MR Jose Luis Varez, the Spanish financier, was yesterday poised to buy Grupo Ibercorp, the troubled private bank at the centre of a scandal involving allegations of insider dealing. If it goes through, the acquisition will save Ibercorp from the threat of receivership and contain at least some of the damage wrought by a scandal which has cast a deep shadow over Spain's specialised banking sector. Mr Varez controls Agepasa, a leading domestic fund management group, and Banco Inversion, the investment bank which is a designated market-maker in Spanish government bonds. Ibercorp, known as the 'beautiful people's' bank and emblematic of the new wealth in Spain, is the most spectacular casualty to date among the banking boutiques created in the late 1980s. It potentially constitutes one of the most damaging financial and political scandals in post-Franco Spain. Ibercorp was driven into losses by the weakness of the Spanish stock market and by difficulties in the interbank market. But its problems have been fuelled by press allegations that social celebrities and public figures had been given favourable treatment when Ibercorp's shares fell steeply. Amid reports of massive withdrawals of investor funds from Ibercorp's portfolio, the conservative opposition party, Partido Popular, has called for a parliamentary investigation into possible fraud by Ibercorp's co-presidents, Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former chairman of the Madrid stock exchange and Mr Jaime Soto, one of the most aggressive of Spain's new breed of bankers. Mr Varez, whose board was yesterday negotiating the terms of Ibercorp's acquisition, is one of the few socially reclusive members of a domestic class of financier that is increasingly dominated by flamboyant and publicly-courted individuals. He launched Agepasa in 1974 and then bought a banking licence in 1988 to create Banco Inversion.</p>

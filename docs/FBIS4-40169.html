			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- A Russian Foreign Ministry's  official said Russia is likely to join the European Council in a  few months.    "We presume that Russia might become a member of the  European  Council within the next six months, and not later than next  spring", Galina Sidorova, a spokeswoman for Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, told reporters on Tuesday.    According to Sidorova, earlier, Russia's entering the EC was  conditioned on the adoption of a new constitution.    Now Russia has its new constitution adopted. And this  "enables her to bid for an equal place among the members of the  European Council", she said.</p>

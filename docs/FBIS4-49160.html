			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC  committee, and Wang Yang, member of the provincial party  committee standing committee and vice governor, separately led  comrades in charge of various provincial departments concerned  in visiting Hefei, Xuancheng, Wuhu, Fuyang, Huaibei, Suxian, and  Bengbu from 13 to 22 April. They conducted investigations and  studies on how to deal with new circumstances and problems in  those localities during the course of reforming the fiscal and  taxation system.    They pointed out during the visits: The reform of the fiscal  and taxation system is one of the several major reforms this  year, and it is of great significance to promoting smooth  proceeding of other reforms and to keeping a sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development. Leading cadres at all levels  should seriously enhance their understanding of the importance  of the fiscal and taxation system reform. The no. 1 men of  party and government organizations should conduct investigation  and study at lower levels on problems relating to local revenue  sources. They should clearly know local situations so as to  provide correct guidance for economic work.    Lu Rongjing and other leading comrades called on all  localities and departments to actively adapt themselves to the  new fiscal and taxation system. They called on all localities  and departments to pay attention to the following several  points: (1) It is necessary to adhere to the notion that  development is the last word, make great efforts to further  promote economic growth, cultivate new revenue sources, link the  fiscal and taxation work with economic development, and increase  revenues on the basis of reliable economic development. (2) It  is necessary to enhance the awareness of economic efficiency,  strive to invest the limited financial and material resources in  industries and products of high added value and high economic  returns, and truly make the improvement of economic efficiency  the central task of economic development. (3) It is necessary  to change the idea of helping enterprises by relying solely on  reduction of tax payment and profit delivery quota. We should  help enterprises enter the market to participate in fair  competition. We should enhance the government's ability in  macroeconomic regulation and control. (4) Importance should be  attached to both increase of revenues and reduction of  expenditures. It is necessary to improve the management of  funds, particularly the extra-budgetary funds, reduce  expenditure and promote the work style of diligence and thrift.  We must resolutely overcome the bad phenomenon of being  wasteful and extravagant while being financially tight. We must  maintain a basic balance between revenue and expenditure.    During a discussion with local cadres, Comrades Lu Rongjing  and Wang Yang repeatedly urged all localities to make efforts to  study the new circumstances and new problems during the current  reform of the fiscal and taxation system. The study should be  conducted in a comprehensive, systematic, and thorough way on  the basis of the preliminary study done in the preceding period.  To build a leading force and work force that meet the needs of  the fiscal and taxation system reform, leading cadres and staff  members of various departments at various levels should be  trained, either on a rotational basis or in regular training  classes, in party or cadre schools. The propaganda departments  at all levels should step up propaganda. The fiscal and  taxation departments at various levels should set up a hotline  for answering people's questions about fiscal and taxation work,  accurately explain new policies to enterprises and families, and  enthusiastically provide good service to urban and rural  production units and businesses.</p>

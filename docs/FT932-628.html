			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / National Express turns skywards for expansion: An unlikely bid to run an airport has some logic COACH operator National Express knows little about airports but a good deal about passengers. So when it emerged this week as the favoured bidder for East Midlands International Airport, likely to take it over next month or in August, the group made clear there would be no managerial bloodletting. Mr Ray McEnhill, National Express chief executive, said the airport has a strong team. 'It will continue to manage the airport with our commercial overview,' he said. This is practical magnanimity. The airport management was a rival bidder for control of the airport when the local authority owners - Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Nottingham City - decided to sell it. The other bidders were Regional Airports, a UK private company, and the airport operations subsidiary of Lockheed, the US aerospace group. National Express was the only contender without airport experience. Whether there is a correlation between that and the size of its bid is not clear. Yet National Express was the only contender with coaches daily trundling off the M1, south-west of Nottingham, carrying passengers to the airport at Castle Donington. In that fact, from the group's point of view, lies the sense behind what looks at first an unlikely bid. During the year to last March East Midlands Airport handled 1.26m passengers, mostly on charter flights. Most of these were inclusive tour passengers, described by Mr McEnhill as mainly in the 'C' and 'D' income brackets. 'That represents our custo-mer base too,' he noted. The fastest growing sector of the coach market is taking people to and from airports. One of National Express's first tasks is to find ways of increasing its coach traffic into the airport and increasing the airport traffic on to the coaches. East Midlands is a good place to try; it has no rail link. It is an airport for vehicles. It offers the opportunity of trying to extract more revenue from the mature coach market. The airport is a revenue stream in its own right, with operating profits in the year to March 1992 of Pounds 2.5m. When the figures for March this year are published they will probably show a profits rise of about 15 per cent. With only restricted possibilities of growth in the coach market, this is the sort of diversification National Express needs if it is to provide returns for shareholders it obtained by its market flotation last December.</p>

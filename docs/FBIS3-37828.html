Leaders of conservative factions, who have up to now demanded  that the commission be vested with the broadest powers possible,  agreed to persuade their deputies to refrain altogether from  intervening in the investigation conducted by the prosecutor's  office, and to act as if the vote on setting up a commission  never took place. Their political rivals agreed in response to  add a number of "political" provisions to the amnesty decree.  The decision on the "purely criminal" amnesty, however, will  still be made separately from decisions on the "political and  economic" amnesty. Another participant in the meeting, however,  told SEGODNYA that "A political amnesty does not mean at all  that all those charged with organizing rebellions in 1991 and  1993 and the instigators of last May's disturbances will be  pardoned at once."</p>

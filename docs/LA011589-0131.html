			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL PALESTINIAN ISSUES MIRROR THE POLITICAL;  </P> <P> PLO'S DRIVE TO ESTABLISH A STATE HAS BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ISRAELI PSYCHE  </P> <P> Munir Fasheh, a Palestinian sociologist who lives in the Israeli-occupied West  Bank, recalls how he tried twice over a 10-year period to visit his family home  in Jerusalem, abandoned during the early years of the Arab-Israeli conflict  after war sent many Palestinians into exile.  </P> <P> Each time, the Israeli woman living in the house greeted him with fear, a broom  and a refusal to let him tour the premises. "She became nearly hysterical. She  thought I had come to take it back. No matter what I said, she would not let me  in," Fasheh said.  </P> <P> "My presence set off a whole string of emotions. I reminded her that this is  perhaps not her home after all. I felt she just wanted me to disappear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal and Political  </P> <P> This personal scene, one encountered by a number of Palestinians who seek to  view the land they left behind decades ago, is also being played out on the  political level as Israel resists calls to talk with the Palestine Liberation  Organization about possible solutions to the Middle East conflict.  </P> <P> In the diplomatic case, the problem is not only that the potential visitor --  the PLO -- has proved willing to kill to try to get some or all of the land  between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea.  </P> <P> More profoundly, it is also a question of the content and implication of the  PLO's message: the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel and the  effect such an event would have on the Israeli psyche.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Philosophy Challenged  </P> <P> Although public discussion in Israel of the Palestinian quest for a homeland  usually centers on the country's fears for its security, the issue also is  viewed as undermining the philosophical basis for the Israeli state and the  sense of its citizens that they belong in the Holy Land.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in an interview Friday with the Jerusalem Post,  declared flatly that a Palestinian state "negates our existence as a state."  </P> <P> Commentators say they see a reflection of deeply rooted fears in Shamir's  words.  </P> <P> "The Palestinians are touching the existential threat to our being at home, as  if we Israelis were some evil wind that blew in here and took over," said  Jewish philosopher David Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Diminish Moral Right  </P> <P> Former Israeli diplomat Shaul Ramati added: "When Zionists came here, we were  sure that we had the moral right to come and live here. To recognize the  Palestinian state would diminish that moral right. It would suggest we took  something from someone else."  </P> <P> The complex web of resistance to the PLO and to Palestinian national rights is  bound up with the troubled history of Israel as well as the long history of the  Jews and their persecution at the hands of non-Jewish communities worldwide,  observers say.  </P> <P> Hartman notes out that the PLO's standard anti-Israeli campaign focused on  pushing Israel into the sea, reviving memories of other persecutions in other  places. PLO chief Yasser Arafat's recent renunciation of terrorism cannot erase  an Israeli suspicion that Arafat himself, and Palestinians in general, think  Israel should disappear, he argues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Touches a Deep Fear'  </P> <P> "The traditional Palestinian delegitimization of Jews touches a deep fear. They  say we do not belong here and thus tamper with the most transformative event in  Jewish history -- the creation of Israel," Hartman asserted.  </P> <P> Political scientist Shlomo Avineri added: "Here is an organization (the PLO)  that for 20 years has said that Israel is a fascist, racist state, the product  of imperialism, and has no legitimate right to be here. That idea may be  changing, but one must recognize that it will take time for Israelis to change  also."  </P> <P> In a recent newspaper article, historian Shaul Friedlander took the view that  the rejection of Palestinian nationalism and the PLO originates in scars from  the Holocaust. "Inside society, there are fears concerning Palestinian matters  wrapped up in other things. . . . These fears are connected to the Holocaust,"  he wrote.  </P> <P> Friedlander argued that Israelis are faced with the possibility that the Arabs  have some measure of right on their side and thus will never give up in their  quest to eliminate Israel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Based on a Just Claim'  </P> <P> "The fear today still derives from the feeling that the Arab striving for  revenge is so total exactly because it is based on a just claim," he said.  </P> <P> The very proximity and visibility of the Arabs, Friedlander added, challenge  the idea, widely held at the beginning of the mass Zionist movement into  Palestine, that the area was "a land without people for a people without land."  </P> <P> "Well, after a while, it was discovered that there is a people living here and  their living here is a very live reality," he wrote. "The wish was precisely  that the problem will disappear somehow, that the land will be emptied of this  disturbing people."  </P> <P> Other observers say they think that fear is less an obstacle to meeting with  the PLO than the Israeli's view of himself as a victim of history, coupled with  an unwillingness to consider that another victim of history lives nearby.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scenario Rewritten  </P> <P> In effect, the 13-month-old Arab uprising, with its daily image of underdog  Palestinian stone throwers up against armed Israeli soldiers, is upstaging a  previous scenario that featured underdog Israel up against the Arab world and  PLO terror.  </P> <P> "Before, we were the victims of the world. When the PLO espoused and practiced  terror, it fit into our world view: We were still the victimized," said Yaron  Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University. "By talking to the PLO, we  would be suggesting that we are victimizers as well."  </P> <P> Ezrahi and other political experts view Israel's efforts to counter the PLO's  diplomatic moves by emphasizing the terrorist threat as a means of painting  Palestinians as the aggressor and Israel the perpetual victim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Both Are Victims  </P> <P> But Ezrahi notes out that the Palestinians share with Jews similar feelings of  being eternally aggrieved. "Both, in essence, are victims, and it seems hard to  get victim to talk with victim," he said.  </P> <P> In any event, should the PLO prove to have truly abandoned terrorism -- a  still-unsettled question -- Israel could find itself without the means of  resisting peace talks.  </P> <P> "The more moderate the PLO appears, the worse it is for the Israeli  government," Ezrahi said.  </P> <P> Fasheh, the Palestinian sociologist, noted that the United States' decision  last month to open talks with the PLO helped reduce the feeling among  Palestinians that they are unfairly judged in the Middle East conflict and that  this has helped put Palestinians in a negotiating mood.  </P> <P> "Palestinians were sitting in refugee camps away from their homes and yet were  called the criminal," Fasheh said. "The United States' action lifted that onus.  It is not completely lifted, but it was a start."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Can't Ignore Them'  </P> <P> Jewish philosopher Hartman said he thinks Washington's decision forced Israel  to open its eyes and gaze on its neighbors: "Washington is the dispenser of  grace. The Palestinians have taken on the mask of reality. They exist. We can't  ignore them."  </P> <P> With stiff resistance to both the PLO and a Palestinian state, it is not clear  what ideas Israel would bring to peace talks. So far, the Israeli government  seems willing to give in on certain questions about the form of the talks, but  not their substance.  </P> <P> In the Jerusalem Post interview, Shamir hinted that he would accept an  international conference as a backdrop for peace talks. This had long been a  proposal made by his chief political rival, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, but  generally rejected by Shamir.  </P> <P> The United Nations or Washington and Moscow together could moderate the talks,  as long as "the external bodies do not intervene in the content of the  negotiations," Shamir said.  </P> <P> "It just shows how far we are willing to go, even to take certain risks," he  added. "I stress that this is not a risk, because it cannot affect the  substance."  </P></p>

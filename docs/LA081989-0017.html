			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL THINKING OF R.M. NIXON  </P> <P> Stanley Kutler's article (Op-Ed, Aug. 8) on Richard Nixon's resignation is the  same old rehash on the subject that we are always subjected to at this time of  year. One certainly gets the feeling that Mr. Kutler is in a vain campaign  against Richard Nixon!  </P> <P> I really feel sorry for Mr. Kutler's students, as they will surely be required  to read his negatively biased view of history. His students could use their  time much more wisely by reading Mr. Nixon's book, "1999: Victory Without War."  This is a book every college student should be required to read.  </P> <P> CHRIS CRAIN  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

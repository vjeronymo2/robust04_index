The British commander of a UN forward base in Zepce said the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was blocked in  Teslic, only a few kilometres west of the Maglaj pocket where  some 16,000 Moslems in Maglaj itself and over 100,000 people in  the region are under a fierce Serb attack.    Maglaj, where UNHCR officials have described the situation  as  desperate, has received no humanitarian aid by road since last  October, and is entirely dependent on NATO food airdrops. The  commander of a 150-strong Light Dragoons reconnaissance unit  said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy leaders to sign "a  disclaimer saying they would take responsibility" for the aid  trucks and personnel if they entered the Maglaj area. He said  the UNHCR officials had refused to do this.    The convoy left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia last week and  has been blocked at Teslic for several days. Several UNHCR  convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj, in northern Bosnia,  aid officials said. The commander spoke to AFP on condition that  he not be named. The Dragoons, who arrived 10 days ago, were  still filling in sandbags and working on positions at the  abandoned factory where they are installed. The commander said  the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of which the British soldiers  are a part had several options available to ensure that the  convoy enters Maglaj "in a very, very short period of time." He  said these included the Serbs agreeing to let it pass, Croat  militia in the area helping it pass or for UNPROFOR to act on  its own.</p>

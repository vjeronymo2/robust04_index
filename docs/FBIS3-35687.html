			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Outside of parliamentary business, there will be no  contacts between Zhirinovskiy's party and ourselves, said  Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement of Democratic  Reforms, commenting on the statement he made at the second  congress of the movement about the inevitability of cooperation  with the present Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  before it degenerates into a fascist structure.    It is still premature to talk about the LDPR as a proper  party, Gavriil Popov believes. The possibility that it will  fall apart like Vasilyev's Pamyat cannot be ruled out.</p>

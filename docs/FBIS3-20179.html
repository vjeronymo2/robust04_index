			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker by </F> Manfred Bissinger and Lutz Spenneberg; place and date not given:  "Gestures Rather Than Calculation"]    [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Mr. President, you were the first one  to put the move to Berlin into practice. The government and  Bundestag will follow suit sometime in the future. Do you think  Germany will change once it is governed from Berlin?    [Weizsaecker] No, there is no Berlin policy. There is only  a German policy, which the move might only change insofar as the  German unification process is deepened and completed more  quickly.    [DIE WOCHE] The Americans are already talking about the end  of the Bonn Republic and the beginning of the Berlin Republic.  They obviously want to point out a difference. Do you not see  this difference?    [Weizsaecker] No. The great achievements of the Bonn  Republic will be kept entirely. The name Bonn is associated  with our development to become a reliable, democratic society  internally and a predictable partner situated in the center of  the continent for the outside world.    When the Americans talk about a "Berlin Republic" they are  thinking of their own way, going from a victorious world power  fighting against the Germans to cooperation and friendship with  this former adversary. It was the attitude of the Berlin  population during the 1947/48 blockade that made them first feel  respect for the Germans. Berlin has not lost its good  reputation in the United States.    It does not make any difference for our future policy. If we  stayed in Bonn we would have to have an equally active policy in  the east. And, just as we have learned to do in Bonn, we will  keep realizing in Berlin that this eastern policy will only be  successful if it is conducted in close cooperation with our  Western neighbors, especially France. Cooperation with our  neighbors in the East will be all the more successful if it is  done with, or via, Paris.    [DIE WOCHE] Are Poland and other Eastern countries to be  included in the European Union [EU]?    [Weizsaecker] As a first stage, the European Union has  concluded association agreements with these states, opening up a  clear perspective for later membership. Germany has been a  driving force in this process, and quite rightly. But this does  not mean that Germany is returning to a see-saw policy between  West and East or that it is even trying to secure spheres of  influence and economic monopolies in the East and southeast.  After the end of the Cold War, we are living in a new era of  European policy. When Jean Monnet spoke of Europe, he was not  thinking of a rift going right through the continent. He did  not want to allocate the name "Europe" to the Western Europeans  alone. Rather, he meant a complete and joint Europe, such as  the one that we solemnly included as objective and task in the  preamble of the 1957 Treaties of Rome. The Baltic states,  Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, and other  nations are part of Europe just as the existing members of the  European Union are.    We all have to get used to this new situation. It is in our  German interest to get this across to our partners in the  European Union.    [DIE WOCHE] But right now there are tensions with the  French. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have made himself  unpopular by being a bit too outspoken in the latest membership  negotiations. These things irritate our neighbors. Problems  like this occur as regularly as the tides.    [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are differences of opinion  sometimes. This happened when the Gulf war broke out and at the  beginning of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. In the  GATT negotiations we held different opinions at first as well.  But the important thing is the quality of the complete historic  change that took place in French-German relations. Discussions  now end with friendly agreements on a common policy. This was  the case in the final stages of the GATT round, as well as in  the preparations for a new policy on Bosnia. But it is the same  as with all friendships: Tact, consideration, and understanding  for the other's worries are absolutely necessary. In the end,  these qualities best serve one's own interests.    [DIE WOCHE] The tensions between Bonn and Paris are partly  due to a conflict we already had 10 years ago. June sees the  50th anniversary of the allied forces' landing in Normandy. The  Americans, British, and French will go to the Channel coast for  this. The Germans have not been invited. How are you going to  explain this to a young person in Europe? After half a century  we are not even able to celebrate the victory over tyranny  together.    [Weizsaecker] Back on 8 May 1985, I said that we have to  respect the completely different fate each nation associates  with the end of the war. Symbolic gestures of a grown  friendship between nations are helpful, and they are all the  more convincing the more spontaneously and naturally they come  and the less they are the result of a well-considered  calculation.    [DIE WOCHE] The past keeps catching up with us. Reaction to  the film "Schindler's List" speaks for itself. Do we still need  these impulses from outside to discuss the difficult German  history?    [Weizsaecker] The holocaust is beyond any comprehensible  description. I have great respect for efforts trying to  document it. Spielberg has tried to describe individual fates.  The director does not shy away from using the means of art,  acting. This does not make the film a historic document, but it  makes individual fates more tangible and comprehensible.    I think that we should be grateful for the film. It can  teach us something that at least gets us near understanding the  incomprehensible. It will always remain difficult. If we do  not want others to keep reminding us of the past we would be  well-advised not to suppress the past.    [DIE WOCHE] This is why we want to come back to the move  from Bonn to Berlin. What is the starting point of a Berlin  Republic? Shall it be based on traditions? Prussia perhaps?    [Weizsaecker] There is no Prussian political tradition that  is relevant to the present. As you will know, Prussia came to  an end in three different ways: formally, by the Allies at the  end of World War II; before that, by the Papen government in  1932; and in the view of most of the real Prussians, in  Versailles in 1871 when the Prussian king was proclaimed German  emperor.    [DIE WOCHE] Which of these opinions do you share?    [Weizsaecker] My family comes from Wurttemberg, not from  Prussia. But I grew up in Berlin, and I think that the 1871  theory makes the most sense in historic, cultural, and human  terms.    Today, we can discuss Prussia quite unemotionally. I am  pleased to hear the French president speak with interest and  respect of the historic achievements of the great Prussian  reformers in the early 19th century. He is not thinking of  militarism, but of the reforms by Stein and Humboldt in the  fields of democracy and education. He considers it a mistake of  19th century France not to have recognized the Prussian  qualities and learned from them at the time. When we had a  great Prussia exhibition in Berlin 12 years ago, the  contributions by historians from France, Britain, the United  States, and even Poland were more positive, open-minded, and  unbiased than the German contributions.    [DIE WOCHE] This is the fifth year after reunification. The  image the Germans have abroad has not necessarily improved.  There is increasing concern over a new German self-confidence.  What is the reason for this?    [Weizsaecker] Considering our population figures, our  comparative economic strength, and our geographical position,  this is quite understandable. This makes it all the more  important to clearly recognize the interests of unified Germany  and voice them without fear.    [DIE WOCHE] Yet, our neighbors can easily mistake this for a  new German nationalism.    [Weizsaecker] It is our task to deal with this  misunderstanding. I remember the debate on the West's  assistance to the eastern reform states. We Germans treated  this with more urgency than the other Western states. Then the  Americans, French, and English said: "If this is so important  to you, why don't you help these states?" When we started doing  that we were blamed for seeking monopolies for our economic  interests in the East. In fact, the eastern reform states need  much more assistance than Germany can give.    [DIE WOCHE] If a German mentions German interests, he is  often given funny looks. The French and British talk about  their countries' interests much more freely. We do not really  dare do so. I suppose this has something to do with our past.    [Weizsaecker] As always, honesty is the best policy. The  English especially quite often say: "If you Germans do not talk  of your interests, this makes us all the more suspicious. Every  country has its interests, including Germany. So, please tell  us what your interests are."    [DIE WOCHE] What are the German interests?    [Weizsaecker] Every country is formed by its geographical  position. Our position is: central, surrounded by new  neighbors. An island nation starts out from a completely  different position.    German interests want to overcome the employment crisis,  conduct a long-term energy supply policy, provide open borders  for trade, and keep the environment fit to live in. Our  interests are stability in our country and around us, open  borders, and contributions toward the survival of our planet.  We cannot solve any of these problems on our own. It is our  national interest to promote European cooperation with all  possible means.    [DIE WOCHE] Unfortunately, the Germans are wary of Europe at  the moment.    [Weizsaecker] I do not think so.    [DIE WOCHE] All opinion polls indicate that.    [Weizsaecker] What are the questions they put? A more  detailed analysis shows that the Germans do not have a basic  dislike of the European process. There is, however, opposition  against the strict regulations of European authorities and  councils that involve many problems for local politicians and  some professions in agriculture, in the villages, towns, and  laender.    Also, Germany lacks a large-scale open debate on Europe. We  are controlled by a Weimar nightmare that makes us still think  that elements of plebiscite would harm our democracy. I  consider this to be unfounded faintheartedness. Of course,  referendums are often exciting processes. We were quite excited  ourselves when a referendum on Europe was held in France and two  in Denmark. But today, people there are generally better  informed about Europe than we Germans. Why? Because they had a  serious and big debate about the subject before us.    [DIE WOCHE] They talked about Maastricht when we were  discussing reunification.    [Weizsaecker] That is right. But unification of our own  country is inseparably linked with European developments. And  to understand what Europe is all about, many citizens are not  content with having their say reduced to putting crosses on  lists of parties standing for a European Parliament that still  has very little power.    I certainly do not advocate replacing our representative  democracy by a direct one. But there are sensible middle  courses that can strengthen people's need for information and  codetermination in the interest of the entire state.    [DIE WOCHE] Can Europe help us with the complicated  questions we are facing, such as growing unemployment?    [Weizsaecker] By all means. We cannot do without that. At  the moment, the unemployment rate is 12 percent in France and 10  percent in Germany. In the OECD countries, 36 million people  are out of work. It is no coincidence that the recent meeting  of the seven major industrial countries in Detroit did for the  first time not discuss foreign and security policy, nor fiscal  or monetary problems, but unemployment. We have to get used to  a different agenda on a national, continental, and global level.  It is no longer strategic questions of the Cold War that have  priority, but economic and social developments, migration, and  the environment. The United Nations, too, must pay more  attention to these issues. The 1945 founding fathers of the  Security Council had an almost exclusively military definition  of security. Today, security is jeopardized by economic  weaknesses, hunger, social unrest, human rights violations, and  ecological imbalances. These problems facing the coexistence of  nations and the survival of our planet earth need to be put on  the Security Council's agenda and must not be left to  comparatively powerless special organizations.    [DIE WOCHE] Should we increase our commitment in the  Security Council for this reason?    [Weizsaecker] Yes.    [DIE WOCHE] Is it wise, though, to take on new commitments?    [Weizsaecker] Yes. Anybody who wants to have more  influence, has to take on more responsibility. We do not  qualify for a permanent seat in the Security Council by thinking  in terms of prestige, but by presenting constructive  suggestions. This is not idealistic noble-mindedness, but  realizing our interests.</p>

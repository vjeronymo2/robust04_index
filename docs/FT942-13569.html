			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World News in Brief: Peace talks today as Serbs pull guns out of Gorazde Talks on reviving peace efforts in Bosnia will be held between the US, Britain, France and Russia in London today following the removal of Serb weapons from the centre of Gorazde under threat of air strikes. The Serbs, defying international condemnation, have established a stranglehold on Gorazde. More than 700 people have died in the 65,000-strong enclave, one of six so-called safe havens in Bosnia which the UN has pledged to protect. Page 20; Nato tries to play down row, Page 3</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The 13th economic and  technical cooperation meeting Between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia  opened at the Ministry of Economic Affairs Tuesday [12 April].    Addressing the opening ceremony, Vice Economic Affairs  Minister S.J. Li said that this session of the Sino-Saudi  Permanent Joint Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation  aims to review bilateral cooperation between the two countries.    Li pledged that the two countries "will join hands to make  the best use of what the other can offer in creating the  greatest well- being for the people."    Li represents Taiwan at the meeting, while the 30-member  Saudi Arabian delegation is led by Ibrahim Bin Salamah, a vice  minister and concurrently vice chairman of the semi-official  Saudi Arabia Basic Industry Corporation.    The meeting will focus discussion on trade, investment, and  economic cooperation.    The meeting, which will continue through Wednesday, marks  the  first vice ministerial-level contact in Taipei since the two  countries suspended diplomatic relations in July 1990. The last  meeting was held in Riyadh 1992.    Meanwhile, a seminar on Saudi Arabia's investment climate,  sponsored by the Taipei-based Sino-Arabian Cultural and Economic  Association, will be held at the Taipei International Convention  Center Wednesday.    This will also be the first time such a seminar has taken  place here since 1990.    The two delegation leaders to the economic and technical  cooperation meeting will be invited to the seminar, which aims  to lure Taiwan manufacturers to Saudi Arabia and to promote  business alliances between the two countries.    The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has long been one of Taiwan's  most important trading partners. Taiwan exported about US$500  million worth of products to the kingdom last year, while  imports from the kingdom totaled US$1.5 billion.</p>

			<p>Waste   Control   <F P=102> 94WN0057A Beijing ZHONGGUO HUANJING BAO [CHINA ENVIRONMENTAL  NEWS] in Chinese 3 Aug 93 p 3 </F>  <F P=103> 94WN0057A </F> <F P=104>  Beijing ZHONGGUO HUANJING BAO [CHINA ENVIRONMENTAL  NEWS] </F>  <F P=105>  Chinese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Chen Shuxian [7115 0647 6343]: </F> "Accelerating Solid Waste Legislation Cannot Be Delayed"]    [Excerpts] The development of production inevitably leads  to consumption of resources, and as resources are developed the  inevitable result is a substantial increase in solid wastes and  ecological and environmental destruction. Household wastes are  now increasing at an alarming rate. In the developed country  Germany, for example, the amount of garbage per capita doubled  from the 1950's to 1990's, and the amount of garbage per capita  in West Germany in 1989 was 239 kilograms. It is no wonder that  people have exclaimed that "mankind will drown in the garbage it  has created".    China is a developing country and reform and opening up have  spurred rapid economic development. As production develops and  people's living standards improve, we similarly will face heavy  pressures from growing amounts of solid wastes. Statistics show  that industrial residues reached about 700 million tons in 1991  and per capita household garbage in urban areas has now reached  440 kilograms and is growing at an annual rate of eight to 10  percent.    [passage omitted]    The Chinese Government has consistently advocated the  rational and full use of resources and protection of the  environment is an established basic national policy. The  government has conducted broad-ranging propaganda in this area  that has now effectively aroused people's environmental  consciousness. However, our countermeasures and measures would  seem to be ineffective, especially in the areas of using  administrative legislation to strengthen restrictions on the  generation of solid wastes and in their recovery and  utilization, where we lag far behind the developed countries.  Thus, it is essential that we strengthen legislation to increase  restrictions on the generation of solid wastes and require their  re-use to the greatest possible extent to protect resources and  the environment, avoid taking the winding path of the developed  countries, and deal with the matter of creating prosperity for  generations of our descendants as quickly as possible.    [passage omitted]    China is now in the process of making a transition to a  market economy, and improving packaging designs is an essential  way for enterprises to make their products more competitive.  Thus, in shortening the useful lifespans of products and  improving packaging designs, enabling resource utilization and  recovery is a question that is very deserving of attention, but  it is ignored by most enterprises at the present time.    Because of the growing amount of solid wastes arising from  packaging and the continual renovation that is going on now,  many countries have formulated specialized decrees to restrict  the generation of solid wastes from packaging and help expanded  reproduction and utilization. Thus, formulation of the related  decrees is the key step, especially in the future when China's  enterprises become independently managed legal persons and the  government's use of legislation will be an important way to  implement macro management.</p>

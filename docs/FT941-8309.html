			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Major and Clinton to meet next week US President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, UK prime minister, are to meet next Monday in Pittsburgh, in a gesture to the time spent by Mr Major's father and grandfather in that area. The two will travel back together from western Pennsylvania to Washington. Mr Major will then spend the night at the White House, as the first foreign leader to be invited to do so since Mr Clinton took office. 'I know the president is looking forward to it,' a White House official said. The arrangements for Mr Major's visit are seen as an effort to smooth over the apparent rift between the US and the UK. Besides differences of political philosophy between Mr Clinton and Mr Major, their two governments have appeared at odds over Bosnia. Also, friction was exacerbated by the Clinton administration's recent decision to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US this month. Mr Major's father, Tom Ball, sailed from Liverpool to Philadelphia in the 1880s with his father, a master builder who worked at the Carnegie steel works in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>

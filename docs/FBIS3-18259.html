That classical statement also applies to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  even before he has reached the zenith of his political career.  Why has he, more than any other politician in the second half  of the 20th century, come under such heavy fire from the  international media?    De Gaulle was right: "The Germans are poor bastards. Their  backbone has been broken." A great part of our population has  lost the ability to recognize German interests as a result of  systematic indoctrination. The reeducation conducted by the  victors of World War II and their helpers has wiped out the  capacity for logical political thought in many Germans. Of  course, it has always been a peculiar trait of the German mind  to show exceptional understanding for the interests of others  while disregarding one's own. That any other nation should  display similar inclinations is scarcely conceivable.  <H5>  The Role of the West </H5>   At the end of World War II, the Western powers believed that  "the German question" had been solved. Churchill's ideas about  the establishment of a northern German state and a southern  German state including Bavaria and Austria were not given a  chance at all. The dismemberment of the country into four zones  of occupation and a fifth Polish occupation zone seemed to be  our fate. The Cold War prompted Washington to force through the  establishment of two zones initially and then three zones  despite considerable resistance from Paris. Even Saarland,  which was considered war booty, escaped France's grasp under the  minor reunification.    In the treaty on Germany, the three Western victors -- in  the  case of Britain and France, the price of "victory" was the loss  of their empires -- undertook to support German unity with a  light heart. U.S. policy proceeded from the assumption that the  unification of western and central Germany would in any case  never come about. Only a few far-sighted people such as the  U.S. ambassador in Bonn, General Walters, foresaw that the GDR  and Federal Republic would be united and even welcomed that.    For Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand, reunification  was the worse possible evil. The two of them did all they could  within their weak power to prevent the unification of western  and central Germany, and did so in vain. Great Britain and  France had exhausted their roles as great powers. Nevertheless,  Mitterrand and Thatcher -- those "true friends" of the Federal  Republic -- were able to force through the sanctioning of the  Oder Neisse Line -- in other words, the crimes against humanity  of genocide and mass expulsion that occurred in a quarter of  Germany -- as part of the negotiating package at the time.  <H5>  The Fettering of the German Giant </H5>   Today, the FRG is by far the greatest power in Central and  West Europe. All French and British political skills are  directed toward -- to use Thatcher's language -- "chaining down  Gulliver." This calculation assumes that the number one factor  to the east of Germany, that is, Russia, will go back to a  policy of opposition with regard to Bonn or Berlin, or will at  least go along with game of "fettering the German giant"  (Thatcher). However, if Moscow were to respect German interests  in Central Europe and adopt a favorable or even friendly stance  toward Germany, then Paris' and London's game of intrigue,  designed to establish something of a large protectorate in the  heart of Europe, would be doomed to fail.    Political friendship between peoples and states can by all  means be cultivated with a view to being long-lasting or even  "eternal." This kind of partnership endures all the more if one  does not interfere in the domestic affairs of one's partner and  in general concentrates on achieving a balance in those areas  where there are joint interests. Relations between Russia and  Kazakhstan will never be Berlin's business and neither do social  and other circumstances in Russia concern us.    Europe's monarchs, especially those of Great Britain,  Germany, and Russia, were related in many ways, including  marriage. They nevertheless slid into World War I, which became  an inferno for all.    On the other hand, when, at the end of the Seven Years' War,  which Prussia seemed to have lost, Catherine II's Russia went  over to supporting Prussia, Frederick the Great did not call on  his savior to abolish serfdom in the greatest empire in the  world. Let us consider another case: Imperial Foreign Minister  Rathenau could certainly not have been suspected of being  favorably disposed toward the Soviet Union when in 1922 he,  along with the imperial chancellor at the time, Rath, made  Rapallo possible, which meant that Germany no longer had its  back against the wall.  <H5>  Russia's Key Role </H5>   Germany had the good fortune of being represented in St.  Petersburg by particularly competent diplomats at key periods,  namely, by Bismarck under the Czars, Schulenburg under Stalin,  and Kroll under Khruschev. The establishment of the 1871 German  Empire was only possible because the tsar was favorably disposed  toward Bismarck and Germany and maintained benevolent  neutrality. Europe could still have been a French colony today  if Russia had not liberated us from Napoleon's yoke of terror.    Murderous World War II seemed to make any kind of sensible  association between Germany and Russia impossible. However,  present-day historical research confirms the views of the  pioneering Prof. Diwald, who maintained that Stalin's policies  were directed toward a single Germany and those of the Western  powers toward its division. The rejection of Stalin's note on  Germany in 1952 by Adenauer, who refused any kind of closer  consideration of the issue let alone negotiations, prevented the  unification of western and central Germany a decade after World  War II in every possible way.    The big question was when would the Soviet Union or Russia  be  led by politicians whose policies would see German unity as  being compatible with Moscow's interests. The security service  chief Beria, who was despicable in every other respect, is  supposed to have pursued such ideas before he was killed.  Malenkov was considered to have been an advocate of a  pro-German policy, but he left the inner circles of power. With  Gorbachev, the course of history began to shift in the  Bismarckian sense and Kohl made use that in 1990, at the end of  which Gorbachev had to step down.    The fact that today, as at one time in the past, Russian  policy -- and this practically applies to all parties --  involves defending Serbia's interests, whereas German policy,  now as in the past, is geared toward Slovenia and Croatia does  not have to be a misfortune if it results in possible and  necessary compromises. No side has the right to dominate the  other or even to tell it what to do.    In the Duma, among all the Russian parties, including the  communists, the postwar prejudices against Germany are being  eroded. When Zhirinovskiy, the leader of what is by far the  strongest Russian party, propagates a solution to the East  Prussia question that favors Germany, he is paving the way to a  return to old German-Russian friendship, which was a blessing  for our two nations for hundreds of years. Bonn politicians  invoke Lithuanian, Polish, and French "interests in East  Prussia." In doing so, they call to mind the unfortunate "all  Germany" Minister Wilms, who, shortly before reunification,  demanded that the GDR should only be united with the Federal  Republic when, in addition to the four victorious powers, all  our neighbors without exception express their agreement.    Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany, which has been put down in  writing -- including the famous lines that were drawn on the map  belonging to the diplomat Rolf Gauffin, who was himself an  ambassador in Moscow at one time -- envisages a completely  peaceful revision of the Oder Neisse Line achieved through  negotiations. Eastern Pomerania, West and East Prussia, and  Silesia should be returned to Germany, while Poland would  receive a corridor to the Baltic between Danzig and Koenigsberg  as well as a large area around Lemberg, which lies outside its  borders today.  <H5>  The Revision of Oder Neisse Line </H5>   The German eastern territories have really been no blessing  for Warsaw. Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany is a new version of  the old, traditional pro-German policy in Moscow or St.  Petersburg. It must be recognized as a fact that generally  arguments between Russian politicians are accompanied by violent  exchanges of words that tend to get out of control, exchanges  that are more reminiscent of clashes with sabers than fencing  with foils, and by the same token it must also be recognized  that what is "cultivated" on all sides in Bonn is a political  jargon that is completely incomprehensible to the people.    In keeping with Lenin's words that "trust is good, but  control is better," no sensible person is going to entertain  illusions that paradise will be established in Europe in the  near future. A quick look at Sarajevo shows how serious the  situation is. This makes the constant reductions in the size  and weaponry of the Bundeswehr, especially the splitting up of  the Bundeswehr and placing it under foreign command, all the  more incomprehensible. We do need a strong Army under German  command, but we will no longer tolerate the presence of foreign  troops in Germany. NATO's sole task increasingly appears to be  that of depriving Germany of its rights.    There might be circles in the "Western honorable society"  who  want to make a bogey man or monster out of Zhirinovskiy, for  example to give a boost to the defense industry, to create a new  potential enemy, and bring about a return to the Cold War, which  will see an even deeper gulf separating use from our old friend  Russia. There can scarcely be another explanation for such a  degree of rabble- rousing propaganda and condemnation, one that  is based on stupefying the masses, for which Stalinism is  supposed to be the same thing as communism, which is in turn the  same thing as Russia. However, German interests require  categorically that a serious effort be repeatedly made in the  East and the West to make it clear to politicians that the  fundamental interests of our people are completely compatible  with their own interests.</p>

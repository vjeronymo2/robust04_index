			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Wants To Reach </F> Understanding on Everything with Israelis Before Signing Peace  Agreement"]    [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had  hardly started to get ready to return to Washington at the end  of his Middle East tour, which involved diplomatic efforts  between Damascus and Tel Aviv, when Syria announced that the  Israeli proposals conveyed by Christopher to President Hafiz  al-Asad had not helped to achieve progress toward peace, because  they did not contain a fundamental change in the Israeli  position. And that the differences are still "wide" over the  peaceful solution method. [passage omitted]    Christopher's visit has revealed that the axes of the  Syrian-Israeli negotiations are: withdrawal, security, and  relations. And that with regard to the first axis the  negotiations focus on the depth of the withdrawal, its duration,  and its stages. With regard to the second axis, the two sides  discuss security arrangements, their locations, their  technologies, and deployment of the two sides' armed forces. As  for the third axis, it concerns measures to build trust and  relations between the two sides after the full withdrawal from  the Golan, and the linkage between relations and the withdrawal  question and the coincidence between them.    While Israeli sources point to Syria's agreement to conduct  a  phased withdrawal over three years and to establish direct  relations with Israel -- but Syria still has not agreed to the  question of opening an Israeli embassy -- [Syrian] Vice  President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam stresses the Syrians' rejection  of a phased withdrawal, saying that Syria demands a "quick  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan completed in a reasonable  time," without Syrian officials' involvement in determining the  period, leaving this to "the time Israeli forces need to conduct  the logistic withdrawal process," otherwise the conflict between  the two sides would remain, "and let it continue for 500 years"  between Syria and Israel.    Well-informed sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said  "Israel  did not occupy the Golan in stages. The Golan is 15 km wide  (the front from north to south), so why phased withdrawal now."  The sources, which attended Khaddam's meeting with a U.S.  delegation during Christopher's presence in Damascus, said that  Syria rejects a phased withdrawal. And that the vice president  was not optimistic about achieving important progress in  negotiations. "We cannot talk about optimism" as long as Israel  is not committed to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights to  the 4 June 1967 borders.    This means Syria's rejection of any Israeli demand for  "minor  alterations" to the borders involving incomplete withdrawal.    As for the security question, a high-ranking Syrian official  stressed to AL-HAYAH that [security arrangements] should be  "equal" on both sides of the border. He also stressed Syria's  refusal to make security arrangements on the Syrian side  different from those on the Israeli side, especially as Syria  believes that, if arrangements are not equal, they should be at  the expense of the Israelis, who "are the occupying party and  the aggressor." This is in addition to deploying international  forces (U.S. and Russian), as President Boris Yeltsin announced  his country's willingness to respond to this request in more  than one message conveyed to President al-Asad. [passage  omitted]    The sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said: "Israel wants  both land and peace, and the two conflict with one another. And  no peace can be achieved without full withdrawal." The Syrian  vice president believes that any agreement not based on justice  and right "will not last long, and the principles of justice  prompt that all the Golan Heights return to Syria."    Khaddam was asked: "Do you believe that we could see the  picture of an Israeli family under the flag of an Israeli  embassy in Damascus?" He replied: "When Israel withdraws fully  from the Golan and Yitzhaq Rabin announces his willingness to  withdraw, he will hear the answer." [passage omitted]</p>

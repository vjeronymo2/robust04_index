			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose ground on fears of tighter money US Treasury bonds lost ground yesterday, with stronger than expected housing data fuelling speculation over the timing of the next change in monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 lower at 99 15/32 , with the yield rising to 7.799 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 9/16 , to yield 6.473 per cent. The day's economic news was mildly unfavourable, and provided an excuse for traders to lighten up on government securities amid the current uncertainty over interest rates. The Commerce Department reported that August housing starts had risen 2.1 per cent, against forecasts of a slight decline. Bonds lurched downward on the headline figure, but immediately began to retrace their steps on closer examination of the report. Economists pointed out that most of the month's activity was concentrated in the multi-family sector. Single-family housing starts, a more reliable measure of the industry's strength, showed a 2.7 per cent downturn in August. Still, the pessimism dominating the market over the past fortnight held prices firmly in negative ground. Traders appeared divided in their bets on when the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates again. The recent signs of accelerating inflation and last week's evidence of a bubbling economy suggested an early move by the Fed. Despite the data, some observers believed the central bank would wait until after the mid-term elections in early November before taking any action which could be construed as politically motivated. The first camp was given a boost yesterday by Mr Wayne Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns and a former Fed governor. In a statement prepared for clients of the securities house, Mr Angell said he believed there was a 60 per cent chance that the central bank's policy-making arm would decide to lift rates at its September 27 meeting. He said the Fed was likely to sanction an increase in both the Fed funds and discount rates by 50 basis points each, to 5.25 and 4.50 per cent respectively. Lower than expected German money supply numbers gave European government bonds an early lift but prices drifted lower in the afternoon to end the day weaker. 'M3 provided some support, but the reaction was pretty anaemic, which suggests that underlying sentiment is still very weak,' said Mr Philip Tyson, European bond analyst at CS First Boston. European bonds were dragged lower in the afternoon by weaker US Treasuries amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve plans to tighten monetary policy in the near future. German bunds ended the day slightly stronger but off their highs, with the December bund future closing around 88.32, up 0.24 on the day. Shrugging off strong producer prices, bunds rose on lower than expected August M3 money supply data showing an annualised growth rate of 8.2 per cent. However, they were dragged back down by weaker US Treasuries. The German market remains overshadowed by Bavarian state elections this weekend, which are seen as an indication of voting behaviour in the federal elections on October 16. Moreover, a heavy supply burden looms in the final quarter, all of which is likely to keep bunds subdued. UK gilts drifted in lacklustre trading, led by overseas bond markets. The December gilt future on Liffe rose just  1/32 on the day to 98 1/8 in late trading. UK trade figures were shrugged off by the market, as were the minutes of the July meeting on monetary policy between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Traders said the minutes were overtaken by last week's 50 basis point rise in the base rate. Mr Simon Briscoe, of S. G. Warburg, said the trade figures were good for gilts, as were the minutes, since they showed agreement on policy between the governor and the chancellor. But Mr Huw Roberts, at NatWest Markets, said there was little sentiment behind gilts, and any rally was met with a wave of selling. 'It is a brave man who would step back into this market.' Among the higher-yielding markets, Italy put on a strong performance, with the December bond futures contract on Liffe rising by 0.81 to 98.64. Elsewhere, Portugal appears to be mulling the issuance of floating-rate debt for the first time since 1992. After failing to place fixed-rate Treasury bonds for six consecutive weeks, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters that 'it is very likely that the state will issue more OTs (fixed-rate bonds) this year or perhaps floating-rate paper'.</p>

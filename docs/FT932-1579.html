			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Jesuit for Dixons ethics chair Jack Mahoney is to become Dixons professor of business ethics and social responsibility at the London Business School, filling the post created by a Pounds 1m bequest from the UK electronics group in July last year. Mahoney, a Jesuit priest and former principal of Heythrop College at the University of London, is currently F D Maurice professor of moral and social theology at King's College, London. He is also the founder and director of the King's College Business Ethics Research Centre, which he says is likely to wither with his move to the London Business School in October this year. 'Complacency was beginning to set in,' he said. 'I saw myself coasting gently to retirement. I realised that if I was serious about business ethics this was something I should not pass up.' 'As a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit I don't have a strongly biblical basis nor fundamentalism. I happen to believe that there are God-given capacities that allow everyone to work out what is right to do. I want to help them find the ordinary human decencies and apply them in business.' In addition to the professorship, the Pounds 1m bequest paid over five years by the Dixons Charitable Foundation, will fund a research and teaching programme in ethics and responsibility. As part of the programme, Diana Robertson is to be appointed assistant professor of organisational behaviour and business ethics in August 1994. Robertson is currently assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, and taught courses on business ethics while a visiting assistant professor at LBS during 1990-92. Andrew Likierman, deputy principal of the London Business School, said: 'I am very enthusiastic. We have an extremely strong team with these two which will give us a big push in the area of business ethics.' Mahoney said his priorities were to put the teaching of the subject on to the agenda of the school; consider ethical audits of companies; and to develop a series of debates and a network of business ethics teachers.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: EC urged to renegotiate trade deals with eastern Europe - EBRD chief Attali warns of 'slide into tribalism' THE EC was urged yesterday to renegotiate its trade association agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to overcome protectionism in dealings with eastern Europe. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, painted a sombre picture of a 'slide into tribalism' in the former communist bloc which could disrupt both eastern and western Europe. He underlined the link between economic dislocation and social and political unrest, saying the Yugoslav conflict 'may only be the beginning' of fresh turmoil elsewhere. Mr Attali, a former adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, used his speech and Britain's EC conference to deliver a ringing endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty. If the French failed to ratify it - which he was convinced would not happen - this would be 'a disaster for the whole continent'. Once the treaty had come into effect, the EC should draw up better terms for the trade agreements with the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. They should be seen 'as future members, not as competitors to be kept out'. The accords lay down strict quotas for exports of goods such as chemicals, textiles, coal and steel from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. These were the products where these countries' chances of earning foreign exchange were highest, Mr Attali said. He omitted to mention that in another field - agriculture - the French government has taken a tough line on limiting access from the east to the EC market. 'I would not like historians to conclude that the agreements were conceived to help the EC by seeking protection,' he added. Mr Attali pointed out that since the events of 1989, the Czechoslovak and Polish economies had shrunk by about 20 per cent, with the economy in Bulgaria declining 30 per cent. He called on the British government, as current president of the EC, to signal a more open stance towards EC trade with eastern Europe in general. He suggested the Community hold multilateral talks between up to 40 countries on free trade within Europe after the Edinburgh EC summit this winter. Editorial comment, Page 22</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis calls on help from the Caped Crusader CHRYSALIS, the music publishing, communications and media company, is calling on the Caped Crusader to help it return to the record business. Mr Chris Wright, founder and chairman of the company which sold its 50 per cent stake in a records venture to partner Thorn EMI last year, said Chrysalis would announce the creation of a spoken word and TV advertising record company within the next few weeks. The company has acquired the rights to Batman, the book of the movie, to be read aloud by a star from the film. Mr Wright made the announcement as he revealed that Chrysalis had emerged from the first half with sharply lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 987,000, partly due to selling the records business stake. The sale resulted in an extraordinary gain of Pounds 11.7m. The chairman added that excluding the records division, the group made a small pre-tax profit of Pounds 38,000 for the six months to February 29. However, he warned that the company's 'aggressive' investment programme this year would mean a loss in the second half. The pre-tax return, compared with losses last year of Pounds 2.9m, was struck on sales 9 per cent down at Pounds 45.7m. Again, a sharp drop in the records business had disguised a six per cent rise in sales of on-going operations to Pounds 38m. Mr Wright said the music publishing business had made a small loss. Publishing would incur heavier losses in the current half as Chrysalis stepped up its programme to sign writers. The fruit machines and juke box business suffered losses of just under Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.25m).</p>

Fateyev, NIKIMT Scientific Production  Association; UDC 621.791.05:620.179]    [Abstract] The association's achievements in the field of  nondestructive testing, particularly the development of a broad  range of both traditional and special-purpose skill-intensive  processes, procedures, and facilities on the basis of radiation,  acoustic, eddy current, magnetic, optical, and other types of  inspection are reviewed, and it is noted that several institute  departments are engaged in addressing other testing issues. A  number of designs in the field of nondestructive testing  realized on the basis of the institute's own unique developments  is summarized. Attention is focused on developing methods and  facilities for ultrasonic testing of austenite welds and  procedures which would make it possible to classify the detected  flaws. In recent years, more than 30 types of reactor vessel and  primary circuit testing equipment have been developed by the  institute. It is noted that the institute's work in this field  is characterized by its comprehensive approach to solving  problems. The outlook for further development in the field of  nondestructive testing is discussed. Figures 7; references 3.</p>

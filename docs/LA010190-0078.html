			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN POPULATION POSES CENSUS WINDFALL FOR CITIES  </P> <P> It was a natural fear, and Quach Tho Ninh was no different than the rest. In  the grim months after the fall of Saigon in 1975, Vietnamese authorities would  conduct an occasional head count, marching house to house with automatic rifles  slung over their shoulders.  </P> <P> This was only a census, but the questions invariably strayed. Were you in the  army of the south? What are your beliefs? Your politics? Quach would always  give the correct responses, the answers that would keep him alive.  </P> <P> Now more than a decade has passed. Quach has come to Orange County, hoping for  a new life. One recent day, the 46-year-old immigrant was sitting in an  English-language class, grappling with strange new vowels and syllables, when a  visitor appeared -- a man from the U.S. Census Bureau.  </P> <P> This, Quach soon realized, was different than the homeland. The census  employee, a slight Vietnamese man named Vong Ngo, softened up the class with a  few one-liners in his native tongue, then explained the importance of the  nationwide survey.  </P> <P> The spiel did the trick. Afterward, Quach, without fear, was eager to  participate in the U.S. Census.  </P> <P> Such small victories, however, could prove the exception rather than the rule  when the 1990 census is launched in late March. While the past decade saw  perhaps the greatest influx of foreign newcomers in Orange County's history,  many of those immigrants from south of the border and Indochina might go  uncounted in the upcoming national survey.  </P> <P> They are among the nation's hidden population, which also includes the  homeless: families tucked into garages or vans, and drifters with no fixed  addresses. Wary of the government and its emissaries, both recent immigrants  and the homeless typically are not counted in the U.S. Census.  </P> <P> Although the census missed about 1.4% of the overall U.S. populace in 1980, the  undercount was greater among minorities, with the rate of omission for black  and Latino inner-city residents pegged at 12%.  </P> <P> The undercount is unfortunate, since the census serves as an important  springboard for help. It bears directly on the distribution of about $30  billion in federal aid and millions more in state subsidies for a variety of  programs. Each city's share of that money is generally based on its numbers of  poor, homeless or unemployed people.  </P> <P> Federal officials contend that the 1990 census can overcome the daunting  obstacles to produce a reasonably complete count, even among immigrants and in  the pockets of poverty that lace Orange County and other communities. The  bureau has pressed ahead with a spate of programs to reach the types of people  who have been overlooked in past decades.  </P> <P> In Orange County, census officials will enlist the help of churches, schools  and social service agencies. Outreach specialists have been dispatched to give  presentations to community organizations, adult English-language classes and  Head Start groups.  </P> <P> Census officials also plan to hire temporary employees directly from the ethnic  minority neighborhoods, marching into apartment complexes and housing projects  to make a pitch for recruits. By tapping workers from the community, officials  hope to ease the tensions and worries of residents facing the census.  </P> <P> Orange County cities such as Santa Ana have also helped, promoting the census  with videos on local cable channels and distributing literature.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau, meanwhile, is gearing up for an ambitious, one-night  campaign to count the homeless. Dubbed "shelter and street night," the special  push is expected to far surpass the bureau's past enumeration efforts, which  have focused on flophouses and other places of refuge.  </P> <P> But several problems persist.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau's promotional literature in Spanish and other languages has  largely failed to materialize in district offices throughout the United States.  Aghast at the information gap, a nonprofit Latino group has stepped in to  provide pamphlets in Spanish for many regions of the country.  </P> <P> For the Indochinese communities in Orange County, local census officials have  resorted to producing their own literature, drawing up and photocopying  rudimentary pamphlets for distribution.  </P> <P> Beyond logistical glitches, critics also see problems with the census form. The  questionnaire comes only in English, with a small paragraph at the bottom  giving a toll- free number to order a copy in Spanish. The form is unavailable  in Vietnamese, Chinese or any of the scores of other languages spoken in the  United States.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is a lot of people will not even see the paragraph at the bottom  of the census saying they can request one in Spanish," said Berta Saavedra,  state census coordinator for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education  Fund. "It could cause problems. And it's even worse for people who speak other  languages."  </P> <P> Census officials attribute such drawbacks mostly to a lack of funds. But they  insist the informational literature will be arriving at most district offices  in January. They also stress that residents who speak another language can get  help at special translation centers.  </P> <P> "It's a concern," said Fernando Tafoya, a census district manager in Orange  County. "But it's up to all of us on the local level to get the word out, and I  feel we've got all the bases covered. The literature is important, but what's  even more important is the personal contact we hope to establish."  </P> <P> Such a face-to-face approach could prove invaluable.  </P> <P> Undocumented immigrants, most of them Latinos settled in cities such as Santa  Ana and Anaheim, fear the census will be used by immigration officials to track  them down. (Illegal immigrants are counted by the census, despite repeated  efforts by some congressmen to repeal the practice.) Even those granted legal  status under the amnesty program are sometimes filled with distrust or don't  understand the benefits of being counted, authorities say.  </P> <P> New arrivals from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos carry not only fears imported from  their homelands, but a suspicion that the census might help housing authorities  root out large families packed into cramped apartments in immigrant enclaves  like Orange County's Little Saigon in Westminster.  </P> <P> "Most of our efforts have to be aimed at saturating the community with accurate  information about the census," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of the Hispanic  community for the Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We need to get out the message  that the information is confidential, and that the census could actually help  them a lot."  </P> <P> The news is only beginning to trickle out.  </P> <P> Consider the case of Natividad, a 26-year-old Latino woman in Santa Ana. An  illegal immigrant who asked that only her first name be used, Natividad said  she did not know what the census is. The mother of four also said she feared  filling out government forms because of what she believes is the threat of  deportation.  </P> <P> But Maria, another undocumented immigrant, said she planned to participate in  the census, even though many of her friends are too frightened to be counted.  </P> <P> "My friends have a lot of concern that the census is a way the government can  find out we are here illegally," said Maria, 23, who learned about the  nationwide survey from a Spanish-language news program.  </P> <P> There are others just like them, in Anaheim, in Westminster, in Santa Ana and  Garden Grove. And that is where people like Vong Ngo come in.  </P> <P> A bespectacled 29-year-old with a wife and two children, Ngo came to the United  States as a boat person in 1980 after five years under the communist regime in  Vietnam. Now a community outreach specialist for the Census Bureau, he spends  his days combing the Indochinese communities throughout Southern California,  urging people to come forward and be counted.  </P> <P> So it was that he arrived one recent day for a presentation at Cambodian Family  Inc., a nonprofit community services agency in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Talking in a mix of English and Vietnamese, Ngo stressed that the census is  confidential. Moreover, he pointed out how the count would actually help the  community. More money would come for day-care centers, for health care, for  sidewalks on a street.  </P> <P> "We have to explain it in terms of how it will help their own neighborhood and  family," Ngo said. "That's why these presentations are important. But there's  never enough. There is no way that we can spread out the message to everyone."  </P> <P> Across town, Tafoya was delivering a similar talk to a room packed with about  50 young Latino families at a community center. A murmur filled the room and  small children in hooded jackets squirmed at their parents' feet as Tafoya  spoke in English. But the audience grew attentive when he broke into Spanish.  </P> <P> Afterward, Tafoya talked of building bridges.  </P> <P> "You're sort of in their environment when you come out to these meetings," he  said. "It strengthens the relationship. And it helps that we're going to give  some of them a job with the census. The others know that their neighbor is not  going to do something to hurt them."  </P> <P> But it is a fragile trust. Some community leaders argue that unconnected events  such as an immigration sweep a few days or weeks before the census could  convince many immigrants not to participate. They have asked the Immigration  and Naturalization Service for a moratorium on sweeps in the months before the  census.  </P> <P> "If they decide to raid, it'll put a damper on a complete count," said  Saavedra. "These people don't understand that one hand of the federal  government doesn't always know what the other is doing. When they think of the  government, they think of the INS, IRS, FBI. It all begins to run together."  </P> <P> The Census Bureau faces no less troubling a dilemma with the homeless.  Street-corner preachers and bedraggled bag ladies drifting on the periphery of  society often hold a chilling animosity toward any type of government  representative.  </P> <P> To prepare for the 1990 count, census officials have been putting their heads  together with homeless advocates and others to pinpoint all the shelters and  street locations that need to be visited.  </P> <P> On March 20, the massive operation will begin across the country. Shelters and  low-cost motels will be visited between 6 p.m. and midnight. Streets will be  searched the next morning from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. Sleeping persons will not be  awakened, but enumerators will estimate as best they can the person's age and  race.  </P> <P> Even with such tactics, a percentage of the United States' hidden population  will likely remain uncounted, experts say. For many cities, that will mean less  federal money for streets, social services and other programs.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, for instance, officials estimate that $2.5 million a year could  be lost during the coming decade if the city's estimated 50,000 Latino  newcomers are omitted. Officials in Los Angeles, which has an even greater  variety of needy immigrants, say their city stands to lose $12 million annually  if there is an under-count.  </P> <P> "It boils down to the fact that if we do not count everybody, these people will  not exist on paper," noted Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido. "Everything  from reapportionment to tax dollars will be affected."  </P> <P> Eager to ensure an accurate tally, many state and city officials are pushing  for the Census Bureau to use a new technique it has developed to estimate the  nation's hidden population and adjust the census accordingly.  </P> <P> The concept is similar to a 100-year-old method for counting fish in a lake.  Immediately after the census, an intense recount will be conducted of 150,000  randomly selected households across the country, including neighborhoods that  have been habitually undercounted. By comparing the survey results against the  census, the percentage of residents not included in the original count can be  estimated.  </P> <P> The idea was initially endorsed by several key officials with the Census  Bureau, but the Reagan Administration rejected the technique, prompting  protests from critics who accused the president of playing politics.  </P> <P> As the critics saw it, the Republican president opposed the concept because of  a probable rise in population totals in areas that are Democratic strongholds.  As a result, those regions would gain Congressional seats and more federal  money.  </P> <P> Several large states and cities, including California and Los Angeles, sued to  reverse Reagan's decision. The result was a settlement in 1989 that created an  eight-member committee that will recommend whether the survey results should be  used to adjust the nation's population.  </P> <P> But politics could still come into play, the survey's advocates contend,  because the final decision, expected in mid-July, rests with Secretary of  Commerce Robert Mosbacher, a Republican political appointee.  </P> <P> While the intrigue continues in Washington, the mood in Orange County has  remained one of optimism, of hope that all segments of society will be counted  on April 1, Census Day.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping the census will be the beginning of a reorientation in the way we  see ourselves here in Orange County," Father Soto said. "One of the critical  issues facing the county will be ethnic pluralism, how we choose to engage the  reality of who we are. The census could be a pivotal beginning to bringing that  reality to us and making us face it."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lily Eng contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The official Australian market indicator fell another 7 cents this week, to 516c/kg, but this still leaves it only 30 cents below its peak early in February. Wool prices continue to present an erratic appearance. Finer Merinos this week were irregularly lower, with considerable variations between the main auction centres in Australia for normally comparable types. Crossbreds and some border Merinos have not eased much, if at all, during the present market downturn. New Zealand was dearer, and in South Africa offerings are tailing off early in the closing stages of the selling season. Trading activity in the industry beyond the wool market itself is subdued, and prices are very competitive. The recovery from recession remains very mixed according to market sector and the country involved.</p>

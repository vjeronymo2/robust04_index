			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Slowdown at Quaker Oats but Kellogg ahead despite tax rise Quaker Oats warned of a profit standstill but Kellogg reported a 6 per cent increase in net income in separate announcements from the two US breakfast cereal manufacturers. Chicago-based Quaker Oats, recently the subject of bid speculation, said earnings in the fourth quarter to June would be 'about even' with the Dollars 1.30 of last year's comparable period, even ignoring the effect of a previously-announced restructuring charge. The company blamed the slowdown on disappointing sales in Europe, resulting from poor economic conditions, and the effects of hyperinflation on its Brazilian business. Quaker Oats said that its US businesses were doing well, with higher overall volume coming from its Gatorade sports drink and cereal products. It said it expected to report higher profits and earnings per share for the full year, excluding the restructuring charge. In May, the company said it would be taking a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 110m and Dollars 130m in the fourth quarter to cover the cost of consolidating some of its US and international operations and reducing employment. Kellogg reported a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 245.5m for the second quarter to June, but a higher tax charge reduced the increase to 6 per cent at the after-tax level. Net income rose from Dollars 142.7m to Dollars 151.5m. Sales rose by nearly 5 per cent to Dollars 1.62bn and earnings per share by nearly 10 per cent to 68 cents, reflecting stock repurchases. For the first six months, net income was 4 per cent ahead at Dollars 335.4m. Kellogg said operational improvements and cost-cutting boosted the results. The company has lost market share in the US over the past few years and this month replaced the head of its North American ready-to-eat cereal business.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (8): EC legislation sets the pace - Environmental issues EC LEGISLATION is the main force behind the introduction of environmental measures by companies, according to a survey of the logistics and distribution industry by management consultants PE International. Eighty-one per cent of respondents cite Brussels as a main source of environmental pressure, with 44 per cent indicating UK legislation and 40 per cent saying the impetus comes from customers. The survey, produced earlier this year, revealed that more than two thirds of companies expect operating costs to increase as a result of addressing environmental issues. However, it also found that nearly all improvements implemented so far have had a significant element of cost reduction. Most companies are likely to have taken the obvious steps such as more efficient routing and fuel economy measures, explains Mr Jan Szymankiewicz, managing director of P-E's logistics consulting arm. He says that they are less willing to take initiatives that do not produce savings. When compared to other companies involved in logistics in sectors such as retailing, dedicated distribution companies feel under less pressure to respond to environmental issues. Their main concern, according to the survey, is to meet the needs of clients and environmental action follows from contractual arrangements. In total, the companies surveyed - all members of the Institute of Logistics and Distribution management, now merged into the Institute of Logistics - are responsible for 40,000 commercial vehicles, 32,000 company cars and 1,700 warehouses. But only 19 per cent have a specific logistics-and-the-environment policy. Only 7 per cent have so far carried out work in all of the areas surveyed, which included environmental auditing and adoption of relevant training policies. There are bright spots: nine out of 10 companies expect to adopt environmentally aware policies within the next five years, and larger companies are taking the lead in introducing policies and training. Parcelforce, the UK's biggest carrier of parcels and packages, won the Motor Transport Journal's prestigious environmental award this year. It was judged to be the haulier with the biggest environmental commitment. Parcelforce has a battery of environmental measures. Rather than wait for full implementation of the EC directive on speed limiters next year, it has already set them to 56mph. Many other large companies are keeping them at 60mph for as long as possible, saying fuel consumption will rise. 'Our experience is that we are saving 7 per cent on our fuel bill,' says Mr Ken Mabbett, Parcelforce's head of transport. Advanced driver training has also reduced fuel consumption: 'They use the vehicle better; they use the gears properly,' says Mr Mabbett. Parcelforce has also improved vehicle design. Parcels can be loaded onto both decks of the new 13-metre 'double deck' trailer, providing 60 per cent greater capacity. A reduction of 20 per cent in overall trailer numbers is expected. Innovations such as this are helping to ease traffic congestion, one of the biggest environmental issues facing the industry. The government says that in the 1980s motorway traffic doubled, and forecasts that by 2025 all road traffic will increase twofold. Overall, however, although freight vehicles cover more than 60bn kilometres in the UK each year, this is less than a fifth of car mileage. The government is mooting a toll of 4.5p a mile for lorries in its green paper on motorway finance, but tolls at this level are unlikely to impact significantly on the volume of road freight. The government claims that its intermodal freight initiative, which involves 44-tonne lorries being allowed on UK roads from next year, could reduce the number of lorries on the road by about 5,000 vehicles. 'This is just a back door way of allowing 44-tonne lorries,' says Mr Stephen Joseph, executive director of campaigners group Transport 2000. He foresees the limit being raised for all lorries and points out that because bigger vehicles are more economic, greater numbers of heavy lorries will appear. Under EC legislation, the UK must allow trucks of up to 40 tonnes by 1999. If the Department of Transport continues its policy of imposing improved road-friendly suspension for lorries, some environmental damage will be avoided. Unfortunately, it is restricted in doing this by European legislation for some categories of heavy goods vehicle. Companies actually regard the disposal of waste and packaging as the most important environmental problem facing them. Large volumes of packaging waste can accumulate at stores and depots, and companies have started to sort, bale and recycle it. Some businesses have also had their hands full with registration requirements for waste transportation required under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990, which define waste very widely. The industry is awaiting implementation of the EC directive on packaging and packaging waste with some apprehension.</p>

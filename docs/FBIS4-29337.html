			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- North Korea will propose a  compromise package to the United States to solve the nuclear  confrontation if Washington agrees to resume bilateral talks, a  Japanese politician Friday quoted a senior North Korean official  as saying.    Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the (North) Korean Workers' Party  in charge of international affairs, told Taku Yamasaki, a  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet member, late Thursday the  package would incorporate "all points of concern for the United  States," Yamasaki told reporters in a phone call from Pyongyang.    "If U.S.-N. Korea talks are reopened, we are ready to  propose  a lump compromise package regarding the nuclear issue, through  which everything will be solved," Kim said in a four-hour  meeting with Yamasaki, a former director general of the Defense  Agency.    Pyongyang would offer to give up its current nuclear  facilities if the U.S. helps North Korea to replace its  graphite-moderated reactor program with light-water reactors, as  the U.S. has previously offered to do.    Alluding to U.S. calls for sanctions against North Korea for  its refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, Kim  warned against putting further pressure on Pyongyang.    "We cannot allow others to keep punching us," he was quoted  as saying.    Yamasaki and LDP Diet member Yoichi Tani, a former head of  the Hokkaido Development Agency, who also participated in the  talks, urged Kim to seek a negotiated solution of the nuclear  row.    "We strongly hope that North Korea will resolve its  differences with the United States and the International Atomic  Energy Agency with the wisdom of an upright man," they said.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Banks turn the screw - Will current accounts cost more? FOR MANY people, it could be the last straw. Fed up with unexpected charges on their statements or high overdraft fees, news that the Big Four banks - Midland, National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays - and the TSB are thinking of ending most free banking, even for those in credit, could force depositors to think about an alternative home for their money. The number of people with bank accounts has increased substantially in the past decade - 95 per cent of UK adults have a current account compared with 60 per cent 10 years ago. The British Banking Association says there were 53.5m current accounts at the end of December, 31.3m of them interest-bearing. This proliferation of accounts coincided with the introduction of free banking, first by the building societies and then the banks. This week, Midland chief executive Brian Pearse made clear what the banks were thinking. Referring to the 3m of the Midland's 4.5m current account-holders who do not pay charges, he declared: 'Over time, hopefully, we'll persuade our customers you don't get anything for nothing.' This was particularly ironic since the Midland was the first of the Big Four to act in 1984 and abolish charges on customers every time they drew a cheque or made a cash withdrawal (although the Co-Operative bank had pioneered that route 10 years earlier). Because of the recession, banks already have been taking measures to cut costs, mainly through reducing branches and cutting staff. (The NatWest, for example, has made nearly 500 employees redundant in London alone over the past two months). They have also been quick to reduce the rate of interest paid on current accounts while increasing some existing charges. Later this month, for example, the NatWest will increase its quarterly charge on overdrafts from Pounds 16 to Pounds 19. As the banks try to improve profitability, the idea of introducing a minimum balance on current accounts, or charging customers who have small balances but make heavy use of their accounts, is gaining ground. Many people, however, will not be convinced by the banks' argument that they cannot afford to run charge-free accounts any more. After all, banks can invest their customers' money elsewhere. And they pay only between 0.75 per cent net (Lloyds) and 1.86 per cent net (Midland) in interest on a current account. But they can charge as much as 37.4 per cent a year (Midland) for an unauthorised overdraft, while NatWest bills customers Pounds 20 for a letter telling them they have gone into the red. Of the Big Four, only Barclays does not charge for an overdraft letter. The banks do incur heavy costs in maintaining their branch networks and in processing the billions of transactions their customers make each year. At the moment, they say, the minority of overdrawn customers, or those with loans, are paying these costs and, effectively, subsidising the majority. 'We are conscious that there is an imbalance between the 80 per cent who pay no current account charges and those that are overdrawn,' said an official for Barclays bank, which has 6.5m current account-holders. 'Most current accounts are run at a great loss.' Charges for those in credit have begun already - but on savings, not current, accounts. In February the Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, introduced charges for those with less than Pounds 50 in their savings accounts, and for those with less than Pounds 250 who make more than two cash withdrawals over the counter a month. The rationale was the same as the banks are employing today. The Halifax justified the move by saying: 'It is only fair that where additional costs arise from customers who make high usage of certain services, that these customers should make a contribution towards those costs rather than spreading the expenses over all accounts. 'In general, savings accounts with very low balances and, in particular, those with frequent transactions, run at a loss to the society.' But these are not the only Halifax charges. For the past two years, its 3.6m Cardcash account customers have been paying 60p each time they use a cash machine which does not belong to the society. And, earlier this year, it began charging some Cardcash customers who keep less than Pounds 250 in their accounts. The banks rule out an indiscriminate policy of charges for those in credit. Customers most at risk are those with a low balance in a very active account. 'We would take into consideration the way the account was used, the real costs associated with it, and whether the customer was a heavy or light user of the account,' said a Barclays' spokesman. Charges could also be formulated in a way to discourage using cheques, which cost more to process compared with direct debits or cash machine withdrawals. 'The physical shifting of paper is expensive,' said a spokesman for Midland (which, before free banking, used to charge 28p for non-automated items and 15p for automated ones). With this in mind, the Co-Op launched a Pathfinder account last year. This is a card-based account offering standing orders and direct debits  - but no cheque book.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     ALTERNATIVES TO THE BIG FOUR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Net interest          Arranged Institution:                            percent             overdraft Current account                   on Pounds 1  on Pounds  1,001 (% APR)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia: React 365                 1.38        4.03         18.3 Co-Op Bank: Ultra                    0.75        1.50         31.4** FirstDirect                          2.63        2.81         20.7 Girobank: Keyway                     1.50        3.19         19.5 EARNorthern Rock: Current            2.25        3.20         19.9 Robt Fleming/S&amp;P Classic****         1.88        4.88         20.5 Woolwich: Current account            3.38        3.38         21.0 Yorkshire Bk:Paymaster Pl            1.13        2.63         24.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Free Pounds 100 overdraft; **Free Pounds 250 overdraft for 3 days; Pounds 400 minimum must be credited each month; EAR= Equivalent Annual Rate: add on Pounds 9 a month; Pounds 500 to open the account; ****Pounds 1,000 to open the account  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Svetlana Sukhova report: "Azerbaijan Signs NATO Program. </F> Aliyev Has Preferred a Brussels Trip to Talks With Armenians"]    [Excerpt] A situation developing in the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict clearly does not favor Baku.  Yesterday, Armenian troop units continued their advance along  the northern (Geranboy), northeastern (Ter-Ter), and eastern  (Agdam-Agdzhabedi) axes. Owing to the aggravation of tensions  Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Speaker Rasul Guliyev could not  arrive in Bishkek for talks with an Armenian delegation and  representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Instead, he sent  his deputy, Afiyaddin Dzhalilov. Azerbaijani leader Geydar  Aliyev did not arrive for the talks, either: He chose another  venue for a visit, Brussels. Yesterday, he signed an agreement  on Azerbaijan's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program at  NATO headquarters.    That Aliyev's demarche has been prompted by the desire to  spite Russia was confirmed by its abruptness. By some accounts,  it was precisely the recommendation not to rush the signing of  the NATO program, given to parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev the  day before yesterday in Moscow, that "helped" the Azerbaijani  president definitely to make up his mind. In addition,  Azerbaijan, which has lost over 20 percent of its territory, has  yet another reason to affix its signature to the "Partnership"  agreement. The TURAN news agency has been told at the  Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that units made up completely of  Russian servicemen have been sighted seizing settlements and  turning them over to Armenian formations in a number of front  sectors (six villages in the Agdam district alone). At the same  time, the "sighted Russians" use state-of-the-art military  equipment, including T-80 tanks; the Russian Foreign Ministry  would not comment on the report. [passage omitted]</p>

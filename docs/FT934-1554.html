			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / French education finance row flares The first open row between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and the conservative Balladur government erupted yesterday over the latter's move to scrap a 143-year-old restriction on public financing of private schools. On a visit to south-west France, Mr Mitterrand told a delegation of teachers and parents from the state school system that he was 'surprised and shocked' at the 'precipitation' of the government in getting the Senate, at 5am on Wednesday, to change an 1850 law on school finance. The new bill would scrap the limitation on private, mainly Catholic, schools which up to now have only been able to draw 10 per cent of their funding from local public authorities. The government claimed it had to act quickly on recent reports that half the country's private schools were unsafe and needed money for urgent repairs. Left-wing parties and teachers' unions have said the move will drain money from the state system. The Socialist and Communist parties have said they will appeal to the country's constitutional court, and the president indicated yesterday he would await that judgment before considering whether to throw the school finance law back to parliament for further debate. Many French schools were empty yesterday, as half the country's teachers walked out and several thousand demonstrated in Paris. Another day of protest has been set for January 16. Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party leader, called for supporters of state education to turn out then in the same huge numbers as private school backers had done in 1984 in protest at Socialist education policy. The 77-year-old president said that in his 35 years of parliamentary experience he had never seen a similarly 'rushed' piece of legislation. 'If one were to push this to extremes, all difficult laws could be torn up in the same way,' he said. The row may mark an end to the 'gentle cohabitation' between the Socialist president and conservative prime minister, with the latter now clearly emboldened by his success on the Gatt agreements.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A look at the crystal ball - Jancis Robinson reports from beleaguered Bordeaux The Bordeaux wine trade, plagued by la crise (economique), a run of three difficult vintages, and accusations that its basic bread-and-butter bottles could do with at least a smear of nice fruity jam to attract the modern wine drinker, has been sleeping a bit easier since June 25. At this year's exceptionally soggy Fete de la Fleur at Chateau Lilian Ladouys in St Estephe, one of the guests honoured with the pomp and crimson velvet traditional at such gatherings was France's clairvoyant, Madame Yaguel Didier. Asked to forecast the quality of the 1994 vintage, she wisely predicted: 'It will be a great, great year.' The Bordelais need a vintage of irresistible quality, and the vine flowering, which the Fete de la Fleur celebrated, did nothing to preclude such an outcome. But international competition has never been tougher - even Bordeaux's own airport cafe, Le Millesime, is committed to a festival of beers of the world. The Bordeaux trade still has an embarrassing amount of the light 1992 wines and the better 1993s to sell, even at classed growth level. And in the all-important lower ranks, which represent the bulk of Bordeaux's produce and the world's greatest single unit of controlled appellation wine, far too many of the region's thousands of wine producers still believe that the name Bordeaux is sufficient to guarantee them a sale (which it is - in France). The merchants' problem has been to energise and educate these smallholders, to convince them that it is worth cutting yields, harvesting later, improving vinification techniques, and generally keeping up to scratch with international competition in order to sell outside France. Increasing numbers have seen the light, but they represent a small minority. The difficulty for the consumer is to identify, from thousands of labels, which generic bordeaux and petits chateaux reds can now deliver fruity, supple, exciting wines that are so much more attractive than the unappetising combination of vapidity and tough tannins typical of basic Bordeaux wines made in the image of the great classed growths. Even Hugues Lawton, seventh generation Bordeaux wine merchant and one of the city's most respected figures, admits that at petit chateau level he finds it impossible to tell the goodies from the baddies by the label. Bordeaux does have many good value reds to offer, however, with considerably more subtlety than many of their New World price counterparts. Now is the time to stock up on the attractively plump and well-balanced 1990s in order to sit out most 1991s and 1992s (see box, next page, for specific recommendations). Weighed against this vintage character argument, however, is the fact that winemaking techniques are improving all the time. A recent tasting of 1990 crus bourgeois in London, for example, showed that a good number even of these properties, wedged promisingly between the classed growths and the petits chateaux, are asleep at the wheel. Of the 40 wines shown, only nine - Chx Biston-Brillette, Deyrem-Valentin, La Tour de By, Lamothe-Cissac, Lestage, Lilian-Ladouys, Mayne-Lalande, an oaky Poujeaux and Tour-Haut-Caussan - convinced me that their owner or winemaker realised how competitive the market is. As for the Sauternais, life is bleak. They too had an exciting run from 1988 to 1990, but very little sweet wine was made in 1991, and practically none in 1992 or 1993. It is they who must hope most fervently that Madame Didier has a direct line to the future.</p>

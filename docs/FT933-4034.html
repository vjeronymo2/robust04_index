			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Plus ca change across Europe THE CASUAL observer, returning tanned from a long news-free vacation, could be forgiven for thinking that nothing has changed in Europe's tense and turbulent foreign exchange markets. The Bundesbank continues to tease the traders, yesterday delivering an unexpectedly large cut in official interest rates. Meanwhile, much of the rest of Europe - France, Belgium and Denmark in particular - continues to shadow the D-Mark and assume the punishingly high real interest rates that Bundesbank policy implies. But the world has changed. The collapse of the hard version of the exchange rate mechanism in late July has removed the last remaining rationale for these suicidal policies. Moreover, yesterday's rate cut, and the market response to it, confirm that policy changes must come. First, domestic conditions in Germany mean that monetary policy is not going to fall fast enough to suit the rest of Europe's needs. Second, the rise of the D-Mark against the dollar is tightening the economic squeeze across the rest of Europe, and thus hastening the day when interest rates will have to fall below those in Germany. It may seem strange that the D-Mark should rally against the dollar in response to a cut in official German rates. German three-month market rates remain over three percentage points above rates in the US, while 10-year yields are more than one point higher. But economic trends seem to imply lower German rates and higher US yields. So why has the D-Mark risen by 6 3/4 per cent against the dollar since June? Slow pace The explanation is to be found in the economic news that has emerged over the summer on both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundesbank has signalled unambiguously that the slow pace of monetary policy easing will continue throughout the autumn. Monetary growth remains above its target range and at the top of the Bundesbank president-elect's list of concerns. Yesterday's discount rate cut makes room for more easing. But the 'repo' rate was cut by a mere tenth of one per cent, suggesting that this space will be exploited slowly. The headline German economic indicators send uncertain signals. Output rose by half a per cent between the first and second quarters, while industrial orders grew by 3 per cent in July. This growth was largely driven by stockbuilding while German industry remains under severe pressure. But short and long-term real interest rates are not punitively high, at least by French standards. Reduced forecasts In the US, by contrast, the economic news has been bad. Output in the second quarter grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, slightly slower than in Germany; employment fell again last month, and the Clinton administration has reduced its forecasts of US economic growth to 2 per cent this year, from 3.1 per cent as forecast in April. Of course, the US recovery will eventually accelerate - short and long-term real rates are very low and anecdotal evidence suggests that the housing market is beginning to lead a pick-up in spending on consumer durables. But the next move on US short-term interest rates could still be down. This is why foreign investors have been happy to stay in Germany. Over the next year the recent D-Mark rally may well unwind or worse; for the moment, the currency is rising. What is perverse is the desire of much of the rest of continental northern Europe to rise with it. In France, that means that the key intervention rate has not fallen since July's crisis, that short-term real interest rates remain in excess of 5 per cent, that output is depressed and that unemployment is both very high and rising. In Belgium, recent interest rate increases are deepening the fiscal crisis and weakening the currency while not easing market fears. Europe ought now to let the D-Mark gyrate alone. There is no fundamental reason why the French franc ought either to follow the D-Mark down next year or up over the coming months. The best thing for continental European governments would be to acknowledge that the D-Mark's fluctuations reflect German instability, to ignore Bundesbank council meetings and to set interest rates according to domestic needs. The sooner they recognise that the world has changed, the better.</p>

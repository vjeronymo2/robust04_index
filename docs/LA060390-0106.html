			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF ANY LOS ANGELES SITE COULD BE A RESTAURANT. . .  </P> <P> Steven Ehrlich: "The old restaurant in Union Station. It's a wonderful space  and ready to go. Second, a cafe in the main atrium of the Bradbury Building,  one of my favorite spaces in all of L.A. Also: It would be great to have a  wonderful restaurant overlooking the Sepulveda Dam in the Valley with an old,  sculptural long vista. You'd have to make a journey to get there and it would  be worth it. We need more of the kind of restaurants you find in Europe, which  are simply 'there' because there's a wonderful view."  </P> <P> Tony Greenberg: "Windward Street in Venice between Pacific and Speedway. It's  not a building, per se, but a whole block as outdoor space. I'd close off the  street and create an outdoor plaza."  </P> <P> Elyse Grinstein: "My very favorite place: Union Station. There's a great  restaurant that was open in the '20s with an enormous copper bar. I would have  loved to have done the Pan Pacific. It seems like that's a good way to preserve  these old buildings. Like what was done with Campanile."  </P> <P> David Kellen: "The Griffith Observatory, a very heroic form. The location is  fantastic, it has great views. I would make sure that there were tables all  around looking out. We'd have to punch a few holes in the walls. . . ."  </P> <P> Michael Rotondi: "Found spaces, the kind you can't do from scratch anymore, are  what gets an architect excited. There's one building I like a lot on Glendale  Boulevard, an old brick warehouse on the side of a hill. . . ."  </P> <P> Michele Saee: "I would take any space. I don't really believe that specific  spaces really exist in Los Angeles. I think they're all the same. What was  City? And Angeli Trattoria was a carpet store. These big warehouses are the  ugliest buildings, but you can invest your own fantasy in it."  </P> <P> Josh Schweitzer: "There's an old Spanish Mediterranean courtyard, all worn in  with those wonderful qualities you get in European courtyards in hot climates.  It's on Wilshire between Western and Oxford. It's a little microwave place now.  But it's just great: The space is all there. Put out some new tables and chairs  and it's done. It would be spectacular."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Obstrusive and Imprudent Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  told foreign reporters on May 23 that "the North must not try to  settle the questions on the Korean peninsula only with the  United States" and it "must begin North-South dialogue",  according to a radio report from Seoul.    This is a feeble entreaty and complaint of the pitiful  colonial puppet utterly forsaken by history and the people.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is very jealous of the North  sitting  at a negotiating table with the United States and feels very  uneasy and nervous over it.    The traitor most dependent on outside, flunkeyist and  treacherous among the successive rulers of South Korea, is  trying to squeeze himself into DPRK-U.S. negotiations without  any power and capacity, and is obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks.    In urging the North not to deal only with the United States,  he was motivated by the sinister political purpose of putting a  spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The traitor driveled about the North-South dialogue this  time. But the puppet has no elementary qualification and face to  talk about the dialogue. It is an intolerable mockery of  dialogue for its very wrecker to cry for its "resumption".    The ulterior intention of the puppets is to create  difficulties again to foil the third round of the DPRK-U.S.  talks at any cost and proceed with the moves to stifle the DPRK  in league with international reactionaries.    If the tense situation is to be eased in Korea and a correct  way of settling the question be found today, the United States  must change its hostile policy against the DPRK and such  flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from power in  South Korea.</p>

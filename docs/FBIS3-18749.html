City Government Will  Decide How the Savings Share of Akava Employees Will Be  Collected"]    [Text] Deputy City Manager Antti Viinikka intends to  propose to the Helsinki City Government that the city start  discharging and furloughing its college-educated employees.    Viinikka estimated that the number to be discharged would  rise to 400-600 persons if the savings share of college-educated  persons belonging to Akava [trade union for college-educated  employees] is collected completely through layoffs.    If Viinikka's proposal goes through, the city's various  offices will be given the right to discharge and furlough as  many college-educated employees as are needed to save 2.7  percent on their wage and salary expenditures, just as for the  other personnel groups. In addition the offices have the  possibility of saving people by reducing the offices' general  2-percent savings obligation. From this will come a total of  400-600 persons.    Viinikka, who is responsible for the city's personnel  matters, said that the employer no longer has any alternative.  "The other organizations have demanded that those who have  remained outside be treated at least in the same manner as those  covered by the contract."    There is a total of about 37,000 persons serving the city of  Helsinki. About a fourth of them belong to the Akava trade  union. The organizations representing all of the other employee  groups have approved the local collective bargaining agreement,  which is called the coping agreement. It will be signed on  Friday [4 February]. According to the agreement only 40 percent  of the vacation pay will be paid this year, which corresponds to  a saving of 2.7 percent on wage expenditures.</p>

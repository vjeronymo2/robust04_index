			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES OF RUNNING A COCAINE RING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles lawyer and former federal prosecutor was arrested Friday outside  his Pacific Palisades house on charges -- detailed in indictments in San Diego  and Phoenix -- that he ran a cocaine ring with his clients and failed to pay  taxes on drug money, federal authorities said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also suggested that Juan Paul Robertson, 44, stole $980,000 cash, a  1979 Cadillac and two kilograms of cocaine from his clients.  </P> <P> Calling it the "ultimate betrayal," U.S. Atty. William Braniff in San Diego  said Robertson had taken the cash, car and cocaine from California to Arizona.  </P> <P> Robertson, who prosecuted criminal cases as an assistant U.S. attorney from  1976 to 1980, pleaded innocent to the charges during an arraignment Friday  afternoon in federal court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The cocaine-related charges were filed in San Diego because agents believe most  of the cocaine was distributed in northern San Diego County, Peterson said.  </P> <P> The tax charges were filed in Phoenix because Robertson maintained a house in  Paradise Valley, Ariz., from 1984 through 1988, and because the $980,000 cash,  the Cadillac and the cocaine were transported to Arizona, he said.  </P> <P> The San Diego indictment, filed Thursday, details eight felony counts --  including a racketeering charge -- linked to the cocaine ring, which  prosecutors said Robertson directed from 1983 through 1987.  </P> <P> The indictment charges Robertson with one count of conspiracy to possess  cocaine, three counts of distributing cocaine, a sole count of using the  telephone to distribute cocaine, a single count of running a "continuing  criminal enterprise" and one count of criminal racketeering.  </P></p>

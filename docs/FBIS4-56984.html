			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Montevideo, 9 May (EFE) -- Cardiologist Roberto  Canessa, 42, who survived the Andean tragedy 20 years ago, has  promised "new winds" will blow through Uruguayan politics. He  founded the "Blue Party" and will run in the 29 November  election.    Canessa and 122 citizens founded the party and today, will  start formal steps to register it at the Electoral Court.  [passage omitted] At least seven presidential candidates will  run in the 29 November election.    The ruling National Party (White Party) has become the most  divided. Four different candidates have already announced their  candidacies; former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez, who  is preferred by President Luis Alberto Lacalle among three  possible candidates; Alberto Volonte, current head of the state  electricity company; Carlos Julio Pereyra, historic party  leader; and current Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre.    The Colorado Party, which leads the surveys with a  seven-point advantage over the leftist coalition Broad Front and  10 points over the "White" Party, has two candidates.    Former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, representing the  center, has a strong possibility of winning because he is  supported by 76 percent of his party members. The second  candidate is former President Jorge Pacheco Areco, a right wing  leader.    The leftist coalition Broad Front will run with a single  candidate, current Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez.    The fourth block in Congress, the social democratic Party  for  the Government of the People, which has seven percent of the  votes, will not present a presidential candidate because its  leader, Senator Hugo Batalla, has closed a political agreement  with former President Sanguinetti.    Electoral laws in Uruguay do not limit the number of  candidates because voters vote for a party, and the candidate  with most votes within that party becomes president.    Canessa will probably run for president representing the  Blue  Party. He has always said he would like to run for president.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVE OF OCEANSIDE SOUP KITCHEN OKD  </P> <P> Brother Benno's soup kitchen in Oceanside has won city approval to move from  downtown, where it has caused controversy, to an industrial area near the  Oceanside Municipal Airport.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission voted, 7-0, Monday night to let the 6-year-old kitchen  relocate and begin new services, including job counseling, showers, a day room  and substance abuse therapy.  </P> <P> However, the commission required Brother Benno's, which is run by a nonprofit  foundation, to follow strict rules to make sure its patrons do not loiter  around nearby businesses.  </P> <P> Despite receiving acclaim, the existing Brother Benno's kitchen on Minnesota  Street, where 225 dinners a night are served, has drawn criticism that drunks  and loiterers have burglarized and littered.

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Boost to innovation urged by Nedo UK BUSINESSES are diverting cash that should be spent on research and development into dividend payments for shareholders, according the National Economic Development Office (Nedo). Companies are also inhibited from exploiting innovations by rules on insider trading which prevent close collaboration between scientists and financiers, says Mr Colin Mayer, Price Waterhouse professor of corporate finance at City University Business School. His comments come in a book published today by Nedo. Nedo argues that the UK's poor industrial performance could be improved through innovation. This would use resources more effectively, cut costs and improve cashflows, says Mr Walter Eltis, Nedo's director-general, in the book. Almost two thirds of UK growth between 1913 and 1984 has resulted from innovation. But over 20 years the UK has fallen from second to fifth place among the six biggest industrialised countries in terms of the proportion of gross domestic product spent on R&amp;D. This has had a disproportionate effect on the economic health of the nation, says Nedo. Comparing the UK with Germany, Mr Mayer notes that the main difference between the two is seen as smaller companies grow. 'In the UK they typically seek a stock market quotation; in Germany they are funded by their banks', which, he says, are prepared 'to forego dividends during periods of financial distress'. But Mr Eltis rejects the interventionist policies of the 1940s to 1970s. He gives examples of Britain's nuclear programme and Concorde, the supersonic passenger aircraft, as cases where government investment failed to meet market needs. Nedo makes a series of policy recommendations for both corporate management and the government. These include encouraging joint ventures and collaboration, both across frontiers and with suppliers and customers. It says that heavy spending on defence R&amp;D is inefficient, adding: 'Projects become enmeshed in a public purchasing programme which is both bureaucratic and inflexible.' It argues that any government incentives to innovation through subsidy 'must be balanced by the maintenance of vigorous competition'. Stimulating Innovation in Industry.

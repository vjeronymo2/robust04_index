			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): Patten reforms make headway - Simon Holberton gives his assessment of the political mood A calm that has not been seen since before the arrival of Mr Chris Patten, its populist governor, almost two years ago, has returned to politics in Hong Kong. Whether this is because the eye of the storm is presently passing over the colony, or because the storm has run its course cannot be known with total confidence. But what is clear is that ever since the breakdown in Sino-British co-operation on Hong Kong's political develop- ment - especially since February, when the colony's legislative council (LegCo) passed the first stage of Mr Patten's democracy legislation - both sides have moved to take the heat out of the issue. China has scaled back its attack on the governor and his pro-democracy supporters in LegCo. For his part, Mr Patten has drawn back from engaging in the high-profile political campaign promised late last year and is watching the LegCo process of ratifying, or amending, his second reform bill, with cool detachment. Apart from lowering the volume of the abuse it directs at Mr Patten, there are plenty of signs of China's new attitude. Beijing now appears prepared to settle some out- standing issues relating to Hong Kong's economic devel- opment. Prospects have brightened for a resolution to the dispute over financing Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport and railway. Some in the colonial government are hopeful of an agreement before the summer; pessimists look to the autumn. There are also indications that China will permit its surrogates in Hong Kong to contest elections under the terms of the Patten provisions. The Chinese Communist party's main grassroots political organisation, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, seems likely to run candidates in the elections due this autumn for 'district boards', the lowest level of local government in Hong Kong. The better atmosphere, however, may be no more than inaction born of distraction. A less optimistic interpretation of current events is that China's leaders have their hands full with more pressing matters, such as getting control of the economy and jockeying to secure a place in the post-Deng Xiaoping leadership of the country. Whatever the case, the Hong Kong government has some cause to feel pleased with itself. Mr Patten's first political reform bill got through LegCo with a higher-than-expected vote of support. The bill cleared the way for this September's district board elections and municipal council elections in March next year. The governor's aides are quietly confident that his second reform bill - which seeks to broaden the demo- cratic franchise for the LegCo elections to be held in autumn 1995 - will also get through relatively unscathed, if only because the bill is too difficult to amend substantially. On balance, this is probably correct, although Mr Patten's plan to increase democracy by enfranchising the colony's working population is seen as vulnerable to amendment. Under this proposal, Mr Patten envisages dividing the colony's working population of 2.7m into nine 'functional' electorates along industry lines. This is likely to be opposed by conservative and ind- ependent members, who together may have a majority to block the proposal. Together, they may amend the provision so that the nine new functional constituencies resemble the existing 21 constituencies which represent business and professional interests. It it less certain, however, if a majority exists to block Mr Patten's other proposal which so angered Beijing: the method of electing 10 LegCo members in 1995 via an electoral college. Mr Patten has proposed that the 347 district board members elected this autumn form a committee next year and from among their number elect 10 LegCo members. Conservatives will attempt to amend this provision to bring it more in line with China's wish to see a committee which consists of four broad sections of Hong Kong society. Soon after Mr Patten unveiled his political proposals in October 1992 LegCo supported his proposal for the election committee. Although Beijing's pressure on individual members has eroded some of this support, even conservative members are unsure if they can defeat this measure. The recently announced merger between the United Democrats and Meeting Point will make the Demo- cratic Party, with 17 followers, the largest party in the 60-strong LegCo. This group will support Mr Patten. The prevailing view among middle-of-the-road LegCo members was summed up by one recently as follows: 'Ironically, the hardliners in Beijing and Chris Patten are on the same side. He wants his bill to go through and so do they, so they can tear it up in 1997. It would be more difficult for China to tear it up if the middle view prevails.' China is, however, keeping its powder dry. Among much fanfare and sabre rattling it launched last summer the 'Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Admin- istrative Region' - to give the PWC its full name. As a precaution against failure in talks with Britain, which were then under way, one of its first tasks was to draw up a specif- ication for elections to be held in the second half of 1997. However, according to one member of the PWC, the committee is unlikely to come up with recommendations that are set in concrete. 'There is a long time between now and 1997, much can happen and we want to retain flexibility,' he says. Such an attitude casts an interesting light on China's threat to disband the LegCo elected in 1995 upon its resumption of sovereignty in mid-1997; it suggests that Beijing may want to assess the outcome of the elections before it makes any firm decision.</p>

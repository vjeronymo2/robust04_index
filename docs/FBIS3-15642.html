Its  participants adopted a statement, which notes in particular:  "The People's Movement of Ukraine appealed to all of Ukraine's  political forces back in the autumn with a request to avoid  discussing the issue of electing a president of Ukraine and  possible candidates for this post during the Supreme Council  election campaign.    "With his latest statements about the untimeliness of  presidential elections and his possible non-participation in  them, President Kravchuk has caused political tension in  society, which could be negatively reflected in the Supreme  Council elections.    "Under such conditions the Lesser Council of the People's  Movement of Ukraine considers holding presidential elections  before either the existing or the newly-elected Supreme Council  decides on the status and powers of Ukraine's president to be  illogical (?and) differing from the practice of civilized  countries. The people of Ukraine should know whom they will be  electing: Only the head of state or the head of executive power.    "We are calling on all political parties, public  organizations and groupings to refrain from discussing  candidacies for the post of president of Ukraine in the mass  media. All forces should be concentrated on the Supreme Council  elections not being disrupted, because this would lead Ukraine  to anarchy or dictatorship by the nomenklatura elite.    "We believe that following Ukraine's Supreme Council  elections, parties and public organizations of a  national-democratic tendency should hold consultations with the  aim of agreeing on a single candidacy for the post of president  from all of the national-democratic forces."</p>

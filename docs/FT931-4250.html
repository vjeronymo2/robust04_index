			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Fed presidents called to account by senators THE regional presidents of the US Federal Reserve should be made more directly accountable to the public, Mr Donald Riegle, Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, said yesterday. He delivered his recommendation directly to the 12 regional presidents who were summoned to Washington yesterday to testify before the committee. The presidents have never before been required to testify en masse before the committee. Following the election of President Bill Clinton, said Mr Riegle, the nation was expecting 'more accountability from everybody'. He told the regional presidents he wanted to see more constructive teamwork on fiscal and monetary policy and would call them back to testify again in about six months. The presidents gave an upbeat assessment of economic prospects, predicting that growth would be 3 per cent or more this year. They declined, however, to respond to suggestions from the committee that the contractionary impact of the deficit reduction package might need to be offset by a more expansionary monetary policy. Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, warned that long-term rates might go up if the final deficit reduction package fell short of expectations in financial markets. The hearing was part of a campaign by Democratic members of Congress to increase their leverage over the regional presidents, who hold five of the 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, the body that sets the level of short-term interest rates. The Fed's Washington-based board of governors hold the other seven votes. Many Democrats dislike the fact that regional presidents are elected by private sector boards and thus escape direct scrutiny by Congress. Fed governors, by contrast, are appointed by the White House and subject to confirmation by the Senate. Mr Riegle is co-sponsor of a bill introduced this year that would rescind the right of regional presidents to vote on monetary policy.</p>

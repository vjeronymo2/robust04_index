			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Credit can be reclaimed I hold some shares on behalf of a four-year-old grand-daughter in National Power and Powergen. 1. Is it possible for the tax credit to be reclaimed on the dividends? 2. Can the dividends be re-invested automatically? 1. Yes. The child's parents (or other legal guardians) should write to their local tax office for a claim form, which they must complete and sign on the child's behalf. 2. Ask each of the companies if they operate such a scheme for their shareholders. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

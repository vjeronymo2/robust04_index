			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the </F> Political Bureau of the General People's Congress, by Salwa  al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the General  Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress  [GPC] and head of its General Department, has announced that the  Sanaa government and people reject any Arab military  intervention, and called on the Arab states to stop their media  vituperation.    Yemen, he said, will solve its own problems and the battles  will settle the situation. The Yemeni official arrived in  Damascus two days ago to meet with Yemeni leaders and figures  and with Syrian officials to explain the explosive situation in  his country and convey his party's views on the situation.    Al-'Ansi said he did not believe that the unity [of Yemen]  was at an end because "unity is the fate and destiny of the  Yemeni people. That is what we will fight for." He added that  intervention by Arab forces would mean promotion of secession.  Our unity, he said, is not a unity between two peoples to  warrant comparison with the Syrian-Egyptian unity. Yemen has  been united since the beginning of time.    He also said: "We do not want to be carried away with the  Western and Arab media which are now claiming that there is  civil war. That is a misconception. What is taking place in  Yemen is not civil war. A civil war is a war between members of  the public or between tribes, sects, or parties."    What is going on, he emphasized, is fighting between armed  forces upholding constitutional legitimacy and forces rebelling  against legitimacy "and we consider that to be military mutiny  which must be destroyed by military means."    Then, speaking tactically, he said that "the civil war  description applies to some southern governorates where there is  a conflict in the governorates of Abyan, Shabwah, Hadramaut,  Lahij, and Aden between the people there, between those  supporting the unity line and the renegade secessionist forces  of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]."    [Al-Ustuwani] Would you bet on anyone in the south?    [Al-'Ansi] Yes, we bet on the unionist forces within the YSP  and we bank on them to settle the issue and to rebel against the  leadership which we do not consider to be legitimate. In Yemen,  the army which is fighting the renegade and secessionist forces  is being described by news agencies and the media as the  northern army. It is not the northern army. It is the army of  unity and it includes people from the south and the north. The  opposing forces, which they describe as southern, include  elements from the north and the south.    The north's big wager is on the unionist forces in Aden and  in the armed forces. Currently there are reports that Muhammad  'Ali Ahmad and large groups loyal to former southern President  'Ali Nasir Muhammad are beginning to respond to YSP appeals and  take up arms inside Aden. Battles are raging in Lahij, Radfan,  al-Dali', Mukayris, and Abyan. There is a conflict between the  unionists and the secessionists. But there is no fighting in  Ibb, Ta'izz, or Sanaa. There is no fighting between the people  nor between one force and another there.    [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, is the solution?    [Al-'Ansi] It is to uphold the constitution, the will of the  people, and constitutional legitimacy. What is now being said  about Arab mediation is a thing of the past and no longer valid.  If, in a calm atmosphere, the mediations in Amman and Salalah  failed, what would happen against a background of military  conflict?    I urge the Arab states to refrain from mediation because  they  only want to take positions in the media. There are more of  such states but they know that it would be futile to intervene  because when guns speak, reason disappears. I urge the states  now initiating mediations to look for something else to do. We  Yemenis are sensitive people. Above all, we say to those who  want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue  or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly  that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of  invaders. That is why we reject intervention.    What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of  mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and  dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a  thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a  month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces  would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell  them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far  as we are concerned.    [Al-Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative  solution?    [Al-'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and  solve our own problems by military or political means. They  would then have a clear conscience.    [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the  disappearance of the current leaderships?    [Al-'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The  solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives.  It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al-Bid and  Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as  Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution.    As far as the north is concerned we have invoked  constitutional legitimacy and the people's will. 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih is there by popular demand. When the people tell 'Ali  Salim al-Bid to go then he must go. But for him to impose a  rule of fire and the sword on the people, exploit the crisis,  and, against a background of mediation, sidestep the results we  have achieved for our people, that is totally rejected. It is  not a personal matter between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali  Salim al-Bid. I am not revealing a secret when I say that some  members of the Yemeni House of Representatives have proposed two  names for membership of the Presidential Council to replace 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad. They are (former  southern President) 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al-Qawi  Makkawi. These are two patriotic figures with a formidable  struggle record, respected by the Yemeni people. (It is well  known that the Presidential Council consists of five members who  are: 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani,  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and Salim Salih  Muhammad).    [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the pledge and accord  document could still be implemented or should a new document or  a new solution be considered?    [Al-'Ansi] The document is still suitable as far as we are  concerned but the mechanism must change. Once 'Ali Salim al-Bid  and Salim Salih Muhammad are out and are replaced in the  Presidential Council by others, matters begin to crystallize and  solutions to be implemented.    [Al-Ustuwani] So you are against the war decision?    [Al-'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was "force majeure." Our  war was limited and the military eruptions and escalations were  on a limited scale, but when this war started three days ago our  forces were hit in Abyan, the central security units in Aden  were besieged and hit, and the power station in Dhummar was  suddenly hit to disrupt the power supply to Sanaa, and the camps  in Dhummar were hit. It was premeditated aggression. The  Yemeni Army (northern) could not possibly remain idle. The war  was imposed on us and we are fighting it in defense of  legitimacy and to strike at the centers of mutiny.    I wish to stress that in many of the current battles, the  main parties involved are not northern and southern forces but  forces of mutiny and popular forces now fighting and resisting  the rebels in the southern governorates.    [Al-Ustuwani] According to some reports, the northern  forces have reached the outskirts of Aden. Do you believe it is  possible to take control of Aden?    [Al-'Ansi] God willing, the situation will certainly be  decided and control will be gained, and the brothers will lay  down their arms. If they want destruction for their country,  then they should continue their aggression but we ask them to  lay down their arms and to stop the war.    [Al-Ustuwani] What is the purpose of besieging Aden?    [Al-'Ansi] To bring them down, arrest them, and refer them  to trial because they are the ones who triggered the war.    [Al-Ustuwani] Are the north Yemeni forces fighting fit,  enough to settle the situation in Aden?    [Al-'Ansi] It is not just a question of fitness. We are  fighting for what is right and we are the stronger in that  respect. We are fighting for a cause. I am optimistic that  Aden will be brought under control very soon, not because we are  the stronger in authority and in the Army but because the people  are against mutiny and secession.    [Al-Ustuwani] If Aden is brought under control, what would  be the steps to follow?    [Al-'Ansi] (Defense Minister) Haytham Qasim will be referred  to trial according to the Presidential Council's decision,  because he is to blame for the war. Those responsible for the  Dhummar and 'Imran massacres will also be referred to trial.  Regarding the other brothers in the south, the people have  dismissed them from the leadership, but 'Ali Salim al-Bid cannot  be dismissed from the post of party secretary general. What is  important is that the party should be a party in the full sense  of the word, without militia, without forces, and without an  iron fist. There should be a peaceful assumption of authority.  That is what we and the Yemeni people want.</p>

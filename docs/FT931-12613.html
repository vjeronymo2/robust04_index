			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: UK gilt prices mixed after Bank auction UK government bond prices were mixed in the wake of the Bank of England's Pounds 2.5bn auction of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock. Dealers said that although the market was long of stock at current levels, prospects had improved now that the auction was out of the way. Cover on the auction was 1.18 times, the lowest since the Bank resumed its auctions in April 1991, but above the all-time low of 1.07 times reached in January 1988. The 'tail' was also long at  7/32 , which compared with just 1/32 or  1/16 in previous auctions. After the auction, the Bank of England issued a further Pounds 550m worth of existing gilts: Pounds 300m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003 at 124 7/16 ; Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2001 at 162; and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2009 at 147 1/8 . The Liffe March long gilt futures contract fell to 100.26 immediately after the auction results but then climbed to the day's high of 101.09. It closed at 101.03, down  1/16 on the day on volume of 55,937 lots. GERMAN government bond prices got some support from the successful auction of 7 1/8 per cent 10-year bonds for the Treuhand privatisation agency which raised DM4.76bn. However, dealers said the shorter end of the market underperformed the longer end as remarks by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank's president, on Tuesday dashed hopes of an early cut in domestic interest rates. The Liffe March bund futures ended 0.12 point higher at 92.83 in average volume of 42,770 lots. Dealers who are expecting a downward correction in the market said the contract could fall to around 92.30. FRENCH government bond prices also came under pressure at the short end as rate cut hopes faded in spite of a firm franc. The market was weighed down by news that Standard &amp; Poors, the US credit rating agency, may downgrade the credit rating of six French banks. The 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2003 ended down 0.19 point at 103.80 to yield 7.95 per cent, while on the Matif, the March bond futures contract closed at 112.92, down 0.14 on the day in volume of 125,662 lots. US TREASURIES rose across the maturity range after strong demand at the afternoon sale of new five-year notes erased the market's bad memories of Tuesday's much less successful two-year note auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 104 19/32 , yielding 7.240 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16 at 99 31/32 , yielding 4.250 per cent. The lack of demand for the two-year notes on Tuesday caught dealers and investors by surprise, and cast a cloud over the auction of Dollars 11.5bn in five-year notes scheduled for the afternoon. Early indications that demand for the five-year issue would be strong, however, helped buoy prices in morning trading. Strong demand for the new issue resulted in the five-year notes being awarded at a yield of 5.66 per cent, better than expected. Prices were also helped by comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said that while the economy was growing at a quicker pace, it was still moving into 'headwinds'.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VERDICT ON CUP LEAVES QUESTIONS IN WAKE  </P> <P> The reality of San Diego winning the chance -- finally -- to serve as host of  the America's Cup regatta in 1992 brought hurrahs and cheers from many corners  of the city Thursday, but the questions of a few clouded the enthusiasm of  others.  </P> <P> Not long after the New York Court of Appeals upheld by a 5-2 vote a lower court  decision awarding sailing's top prize to the San Diego Yacht Club, city  officials and others debated just what it meant and how everyone ought to  proceed.  </P> <P> The estimated $1.2-billion windfall the event is expected to bring the city had  a lot of people excited.  </P> <P> "We're particularly happy the citizens of San Diego have the America's Cup  back," said Al Reese, spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors  Bureau. "The Cup competition will bring significant international attention to  San Diego as a destination, and a significant number of international  visitors."  </P> <P> In the office of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, the reaction was equally positive.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the mayor is delighted -- this is great for San Diego," said Paul  Downey, the mayor's press secretary. "We've been fighting for well over two  years to get the Cup here, to earn the right to a full-scale regatta, and now  we'll have it in 1992."  </P> <P> Actually, 1992 is a bit misleading. The finals of the America's Cup regatta  will begin in May, 1992, but Tom Ehman of the America's Cup Organizing  Committee said preparations, and preliminary races will begin long before then.  </P> <P> Ehman said the "challenge period" will allow international yachting syndicates  to enter the Cup competition for one more month. By May 26, he said, the  committee will have a list of the estimated 12 to 20 syndicates that will come  from as far away as Japan, West Germany, Sweden -- and, yes, even New Zealand  -- to compete. It was Michael Fay's Mercury Bay Boating Club of Auckland, New  Zealand, that was the plaintiff in the longstanding litigation that kept the  San Diego Yacht Club at bay.  </P> <P> Ehman said another important date is May 30, when competitors will meet to  spell out rules and conditions.  </P> <P> "And that's a big deal," he said.  </P> <P> By Christmas, he said, syndicates will be arriving and setting up camp, and a  year from now, in May 1991, the city will play host to a world championship  race, a kind of "dress rehearsal," in Ehman's words, followed by the America's  Cup trials from January through April of 1992. The two teams that win the  challenge races will vie for the America's Cup trophy a month later.  </P> <P> Ehman conceded that it's "a lot to get done" in a short time, and some openly  wondered if everything that needs to happen will, in fact, happen.  </P> <P> Don Nay, port director of the San Diego Unified Port District, said he has "no  idea" how much preparations for the race will cost, or who will pay for it.  But, because port revenues now exceed expenditures by more than $40 million a  year, Nay said he expects a few people to cast "a hungry eye" toward his  agency.  </P> <P> "We have a question of how much we'll have to spend for the lawsuit in which  Point Loma residents are suing us in a $200-million complaint," Nay said,  referring to litigation brought by homeowners irate over noise from Lindbergh  Field, which is operated by the Port District. "We also have the duty of  ridding the bay of toxic pollution, and that may cost $100 million.  </P> <P> "I'm sure people will turn to us, but we have many more demands than  resources."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Board of Port Commissioners has long been enthusiastic about  the city's chances for being host of the world's premier yachting spectacle.  Commissioner Dan Larsen was once quoted as saying the port would pay "whatever  it costs" to get the event.  </P> <P> Nay said money is not the only problem. Recent rule changes in keel size could  prevent access to parts of the bay.  </P> <P> "They've increased the draft from 9 to 13 or 14 feet, which eliminates a good  deal of our bay from housing these syndicates," Nay said. "We have a very  shallow bay. Plus, no Harbor Island marinas are available, few on Shelter  Island are available, and it's next to impossible to dredge because of  environmental concerns. I honestly don't know where many of these syndicates  will go."  </P> <P> Ehman said the 14-foot draft poses "a bit of a problem, but I thought it would  be a bigger problem than it looks like it's going to be. In other words, I'm  more optimistic than I was before."  </P> <P> He said the committee has isolated 20 sites around the area, extending from  Mission Bay to National City. He said private shipyards and marinas will house  most of the crews "without environmentally intrusive work having to be done."  He mentioned Commercial Basin as one possible site.  </P> <P> And cost?  </P> <P> "It could be next to nothing, if all are accommodated in private shipyards,"  Ehman said. "Some improvements may be necessary, and those may cost several  million dollars, but we expect private money to be the source of that. And,  whatever is done has residual value. It benefits the sites long after the race  is over."  </P> <P> Ehman said that, if any public money is used "it will be port money. In other  words, it will be port revenue, which is quasi-public money but isn't taxpayer  money."  </P> <P> Ehman said the committee's operating budget is about $20 million. Most of that  goes to organizing the event and paying for administration, race management and  overhead. He said the Media Center, which took up a 20,000-square-foot building  when the race was held in Fremantle, Australia, may end up in the B Street Pier  area, but again, private money is hoped to be the primary funding source. The  former San Diego Police headquarters was used as media center for the America's  Cup Challenge in 1988, but that site is no longer available.  </P> <P> Ehman said the estimated $1.2 billion in revenues for the city -- a figure  based on a 1987 research study -- should exceed all previous America's Cup  competitions. He said the 1983 race in Newport, R.I., brought in an estimated  $500 million, with the last America's Cup netting Fremantle and nearby Perth  $650 million.  </P> <P> Ehman estimated the event as having the impact of eight to nine Super Bowls  being played in San Diego all at once.  </P> <P> Downey said the city expects an economic windfall from the event, using the  recent Soviet Arts Festival and the 1988 Super Bowl as barometers. He said the  three-week arts festival brought in $50 million, the one-week Super Bowl  festivities $150 million.  </P> <P> "Given that five to six months of trials will precede the finals, I see the $1  billion figure as realistic," Downey said.  </P> <P> Not everyone was inclined to laud the economic benefits, and some were  skeptical about the cost.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced of the economic boon to the city, and I'm delighted it will be  held here," said City Councilman Bob Filner, whose District 8 includes  waterfront areas. "It's clear to me that the city ought to work with the group  that's going to sponsor this thing and facilitate it the best way we can.  </P> <P> "But we are not in a position to pump public financing into the America's Cup.  It's not only because of our $60-million budget deficit, although that's  certainly a factor. But this boon that's predicted will go only toward  well-defined sectors -- hotels, restaurants, etc. If some subsidy has to come  on the front end, why don't those groups get together and put the money up? Why  does it have to be public money?  </P> <P> "The groups that directly benefit, these are the ones that ought to be funding.  I don't know what the thing costs, but I've seen figures in the millions of  dollars thrown around, and I'm hardly prepared to support that," Filner said.  </P> <P> "This is the type of event in which the vast majority of the city's population  will not be involved, or even able to witness the event. If this is such a big  moneymaker, why is it costing anything? Governmental monies can't be  justified."  </P> <P> Last month, a bill designed to help finance preparations for the race was  introduced by Assemblyman Bob Frazee (R-Carlsbad), but Richard Ledford,  Frazee's chief of staff, said Thursday that the bill has been withdrawn from  consideration.  </P> <P> Ledford said the bill proposed to loan either the city or county $10 million  with which to fund race preparations.  </P> <P> "But neither the city nor the county felt comfortable with repayment coming  from the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), or the state taking a portion of  revenue from city and county sales taxes," Ledford said. "So, it's dead."  </P> <P> Downey said the mayor's office wants to work with the organizing committee as  much as possible, but with talk of libraries and parks being closed and funding  for the arts slashed to accommodate budgetary needs, the city can't justify  money for a yacht race, he said.  </P> <P> "When it comes to hard cash," he said, "we just don't have it."  </P></p>

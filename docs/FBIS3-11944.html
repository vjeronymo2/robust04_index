The development of these parliaments was in keeping with one  of the principles proposed in that process: to think up measures  and to act immediately. That is what was discussed in the  summary of the workers parliament process. The tasks  implemented, which have already solved specific problems in  economic and services fields and which were presented to and  debated by the workers, were also discussed at the meeting.    For example, the La Cuba Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise was  highlighted. In the first two months of this year, the  enterprise's plantain harvest increased by 18,000 quintals. This  was achieved with a 135,000-peso reduction in labor costs  because of the measures adopted by enterprise workers. Similar  cases can be found in sugar harvest, construction, and services  activities.    Approximately 96,000 workers participated in the parliaments  that were held at the various work centers of Ciego de Avila  Province. In these parliaments, ideas to improve economic  efficiency, restructure domestic finances, and improve  discipline at the work centers were presented.    Meanwhile, at the meeting concluding the workers parliament  process in Camaguey Province, participants reached the consensus  that the continuation of the workers parliaments will depend on  the attention given to the aspects and problems presented at  each work center.    The reduction of agricultural and sugar industry subsidies,  greater control of resources, discipline, efficient use of the  work force, and, above all, the need to efficiently produce more  were topics that were reiterated during the 3,919 workers  parliaments in Camaguey Province. In evaluating the process of  the workers parliaments, Pedro Ross said:    [Begin Ross recording] We can say that we are satisfied with  this process, which is now beginning. There are some who say  that the process has terminated, that is not the case. This  process is the beginning of a much longer and moire important  process of following up on the ideas presented by the workers.  [end recording]</p>

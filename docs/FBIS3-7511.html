			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     (Text) United Nations -- Following is the text of a  proposed Security Council resolution calling on North Korea to  permit completion of an inspection by a team from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify there has  been no diversion of nuclear materials.    IAEA inspectors were in North Korea from March 3 to 14 but  the agency says they were not allowed to carry out all required  activities.    The resolution, still subject to amendment, is expected to  be  voted on some time next week.    The Security Council,    --Recalling its resolution 825 (1993), and the statement  made  by the President of the Council on 9 April 1993,    --Reaffirming the critical importance of International  Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the implementation of the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the Treaty)  and the contribution which progress in nonproliferation makes to  the maintenance of international peace and security,    --Endorsing and commending the efforts of the  Director-General of the IAEA and the IAEA Secretariat to  implement the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/403)    --Recalling the expressed willingness of the DPRK to seek a  proper settlement of the nuclear safeguards issue in the DPRK  within the framework of resolution 825 (1993),    --Reaffirming the importance of the Joint Declaration by the  DPRK and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula, and of the parties to that declaration  addressing the nuclear issue in their continuing dialogue,    --Having considered with grave concern the IAEA Board of  Governors' findings contained in its resolution of 21 March 1994  that the DPRK is in further non-compliance with its safeguards  agreement, and has aggravated this situation by not allowing  IAEA inspectors, as agreed between the IAEA and DPRK on 15  February 1994, to conduct indispensable inspection activities at  their seven declared nuclear sites,    --Deploring the fact that the IAEA is, therefore, still  unable to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear  material required to be safeguarded under the terms of the  IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement to nuclear weapons or other  nuclear explosive devices,    1. Urges the DPRK to allow the IAEA inspectors to complete  the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK  on Feb. 15 1994, as the first step in fulfilling its obligations  under the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement and in honoring its  nonproliferation obligations under the Treaty;    2. Requests the director-general of the IAEA to report to  the Security Council within one month of the adoption of the  present resolution on the implementation of the IAEA-DPRK  safeguards agreement;    3. Requests the DPRK and ROK to renew discussions whose  purpose is implementation of the Joint Declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula;    4. Requests further that those member states engaged in  dialogue with the DPRK to facilitate a solution in accordance  with resolution 825 (1993) continue that dialogue, after the  IAEA completes all inspections at their seven declared nuclear  sites necessary to verify that there has been no diversion of  nuclear material since earlier inspections;    5. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter and to  consider further Security Council action if necessary.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Entrepreneurs complain of bank pains: FT reporters ask why small businesses find it so difficult to coax banks into lending them money FREDERICK Warren is hopping mad. He runs a kitchens business in Rayleigh, Essex, with a turnover of Pounds 500,000 a year. Having held an account at National Westminster Bank for 40 years, he has been incensed by the bank's attitude to his effort to agree a Pounds 7,500 loan to expand his business. Mr Warren has spent five days this month preparing financial information for his local bank manager, only to be told that the bank still wants more details about his seven-employee company, European Kitchens, before agreeing to lend. 'It's a joke for banks to say they are trying to help small businesses,' says Mr Warren. He is meeting his bank manager this week for yet more discussions. Anecdotes like this have fuelled concern that clearing banks may be adopting over-rigorous procedures for small-businesses. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, is examining these worries in a probe of small-business finance that started during the summer. The health of small businesses will be vital to the recovery. Businesses with sales of Pounds 1m or less account for more than 95 per cent of all UK enterprises and a third of the non-government workforce. The big four clearers - NatWest, Barclays, Midland and Lloyds - are especially important to the fortunes of Britain's 3m or so small businesses as 80 per cent of them rely on the banks for short-term finance. In recent months the nature of the complaints about banks has changed. During the recession small-business lobby groups criticised them for increasing charges and reducing credit lines. The grouses now are that banks are instituting much tougher criteria when deciding on small-business loans, making the decisions in regional offices on the basis of financial information rather than on the judgment of local bank managers who have dealt with clients over many years. Mr Stephen Alambritis of the 58,000-member Federation of Private Businesses says: 'Many local bank branches won't talk to people running small businesses, even when they've got good ideas.' Mr Charles Burton, partner in the Bradford office of accountants Haines Watts, specialising in small businesses, says: 'If you have a newish business or are looking to expand, then the banks are being extremely sceptical. It's a waste of time putting some ideas to the bank.' Mr Hikmet Ozkutan runs a petrol station and shop in east London with annual sales of Pounds 2.2m. Having built up the business tenfold in the past seven years, Mr Ozkutan has spent two months putting his case to four separate bank branches for a Pounds 750,000 loan to buy the freehold on his property and expand his shop. 'I'm depressed that so far I've failed to get a fair hearing,' he says. These complaints are supported by at least one branch manager of one of the big four banks in the north of England who says that head-office controls on lending have intensified and that 'some of the local managers' discretion has been eroded'. Professor David Storey, director of the small and medium-sized enterprise centre at Warwick University, says that banks have 'a bloody good case' for tightening controls after large losses in recent years. But not all small businesses agree that lending conditions have worsened. Some say the relationship between banks and small companies has eased after the tensions bred by the recession, when the government launched two separate studies to determine whether banks were failing to pass on interest-rate cuts and being too tough with their small-business customers. 'Banks had a strike against lending, but that seems to be over now,' said Mr Peter Folkman, managing director of North of England Ventures, a Manchester-based venture-capital fund. One explanation for banks' reluctance to lend may be a lack of staff trained to assess small-business risk. Mr Grahame Elliott, a partner at the Manchester office of accountants Stoy Hayward, says banks in general are becoming more co-operative towards small businesses. 'The real problem now is that they don't have enough personnel to understand widely enough how to assess risk.' Another problem, according to Mr Richard Brucciani, the Leicester-based chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's small-firms council, is that banks largely offer loans secured against fixed assets such as property rather than against the strength of the business. He says: 'Reliance on security encourages provision of short-term finance rather than long-term debt or equity, compounding balance-sheet problems and overgearing.' One idea proposed by many in both the banking and the small-business communities is to build better relationships through such measures as enrolling more local branch managers as company directors. Mr Sean Henry, administrative director of Lastolite, a photographic equipment company based in Coalville, Leicestershire, said: 'In Germany it's quite common for a bank manager to be on the board. I would welcome that in Britain.' Reporting by Peter Marsh, Ian Hamilton Fazey, Andrew Jack and Tim Burt.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Nokia strengthens its hand in telecoms: The Finnish group's latest move in the mobile phone market NOKIA, Europe's biggest manufacturer of cellular mobile telephones, moved yesterday to strengthen its position in Asia and the US by buying out its partner in two joint ventures. The purchases continue the Finnish group's efforts to focus on telecommunications and to lessen its dependence on electronics. Nokia has bought for Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21m) the 50 per cent stakes held by Tandy Corporation of the US, in two mobile telephone manufacturing joint ventures in South Korea and Texas. It is also selling its two electrical wholesale units in Finland to Otra, of the Netherlands, one of the world's largest electrical wholesale groups. That deal is understood to be worth Dollars 23m. 'We have changed dramatically in the past few years towards being a telecommunications company and that will continue,' said Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive. The moves follow the completion by Nokia last week of the placement with international investors of 6m preference shares, which raised FM954m (Pounds 113m)to help finance the group's shift away from televisions and other consumer electronics, which have suffered severe losses in recent years. About half of Nokia's sales, which last year reached FM18.2bn, are now accounted for by telecoms. Strong growth in telephone system and mobile telephone sales enabled the group to return to profit in the first four months, despite continued heavy losses in consumer electronics which still make up about a third of group sales. In the US, Nokia has a 20 per cent share of the cellular telephone manufacturing market, second to Motorola. Nokia began making mobile phones in South Korea with Tandy in 1984 through a company called TMC which now produces 8 per cent of world cellular phone output. They repeated the formula last year in Fort Worth, Texas, with TNC. However, Tandy's decision to pull out of manufacturing prompted Nokia to buy out its partner's shares. Mr Ollila said the ventures would continue to supply Tandy label telephones to Tandy retail outlets, which would continue to market Nokia label machines. Nokia's SLO Tuottajain Kone wholesale electrical outlet in Finland, sold to Otra, accounts for about one third of turnover in the group's cable and machinery division, which in turn makes up about 25 per cent of Nokia's overall turnover. They are the main non-telecoms part of the cable operation. With the international market for mobile telecommunications booming, Nokia's decision to concentrate its resources in the field is unsurprising. The number of subscribers to cellular networks worldwide rose by 43 per cent last year, taking it to 23m in January, according to figures collected by the FT Mobile Communications newsletter. Growth was driven by markets in North America and south-east Asia, with subscriber numbers rising by 46 per cent in the US, 54 per cent in Australia, 56 per cent in South Korea and more than 400 per cent in China, where it still stands at less than 50,000. Although last year saw a slowing of growth in Europe, Nokia's strongest market, momentum is likely to be regained this year with the introduction across the continent of new digital networks operating to the pan-European GSM standard, and competitively priced 'low user' programmes geared to the consumer market.</p>

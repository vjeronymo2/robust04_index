V. Korobeynikova, Technology and Organization </F> or Production SRI, St. Petersburg]    [Abstract] Means for individual protection of respiratory  organs (SIZOD) are used in those cases where equipment design or  other factors endanger personal safety. The basic requirement of  a SIZOD is to provide air to a worker that meets sanitary norms.  In the case of filtering type SIZODs this means an ability to  treat incoming air in such a way as to bring it to within PDK  (maximum allowable concentration) levels. An isolating type  SIZOD must also provide sufficient oxygen. Thus the procedures  and methods for evaluating SIZODs involve certain special  considerations. In domestic standards the evaluation methods are  slanted toward determining how complete the device is in  preventing harmful substances from entering the respiratory  organs of a human being and the extent to which the SIZOD can  maintain this air quality over the period in which it is  expected to be used. Therefore the following basic conditions  are regulated: the space velocity of the incoming air stream  passing through the SIZOD and its components; type and  concentration of a control substance in the air stream; relative  humidity of incoming air; nature of the incoming air stream,  i.e. steady or sinusoidal (simulating breathing); number of  component parts in the SIZOD subject to testing; duration of  exposure during testing, the period of time during which a  control substance penetrates the component; criteria for  evaluating penetration, methods for determining them, and their  levels as specified in the evaluation; accuracy and errors of  the testing equipment. The regulations are covered in GOST  12.4.034-85 SSBT SIZOD. Some regulations of foreign countries  are also presented.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper climbs to 7 1/2 -month high COPPER SUPPLY fears helped to lift prices of the metal yesterday. On the London Metal Exchange copper's price reached its highest level in seven and a half months while on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) futures contracts touched lifetime highs. Traders suggested the market was particularly concerned that labour contract negotiations at Asarco, the big US copper group which produces about 450,000 tonnes a year, were making slow progress. There were also labour tensions in the Polish copper industry and bad weather had affected Chile's output. However, analysts said copper's fundamental situation was bullish. Mr William Adams at Rudolf Wolff said it now seemed likely that, instead of the 50,000 tonnes surplus expected at the begining of this year, there would be a 100,000 tonnes copper deficit in 1992. Mr Robin Bhar at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken has lifted his copper price forecasts for this year from Dollars 1 a lb to Dollars 1.05 and for 1993 from Dollars 1.05 to Dollars 1.15 a lb. On Comex the July copper futures contract touched a lifetime high of Dollars 1.05.90 a lb at one point yesterday morning, up 11 cents from Tuesday's closing level. At the LME the price of copper for immediate delivery closed last night at Pounds 1,245.50 a tonne, up Pounds 9.50, while three-month metal ended at Pounds 1,263.75, up Pounds 6.50 a tonne.</p>

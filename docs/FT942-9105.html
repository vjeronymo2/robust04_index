			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (10): Reprieve for debt-laden company - Profile, prospects have improved for Chicago-based Stone Container Stone Container, the Chicago-based paper and packaging manufacturer, is counting on this year's modest but steady increases in linerboard and newsprint prices to rescue it from the financial conundrum that has brought it three consecutive years of deepening losses. Stone, a 68-year-old company which started as a family business that traded in twine and used corrugated cartons, entered the 1980s as a vertically-integrated packaging company with sales of Dollars 600m. Then, under the tutelage of Roger Stone, a grandson of the founders and a disciple of junk bond king Michael Milken, Stone Container ballooned to a company with Dollars 5.7bn in sales during its peak year, 1990. However, the growth was achieved through a series of highly leveraged acquisitions that left the company in debt. The purchases coincided with a boom in the cyclical paper and packaging business, and the biggest were made at the height of the market. The largest of these, the purchase of Montreal-based Consolidated Bathurst, came in 1989 at a price of Dollars 2.6bn. Consolidated Bathurst owns four newsprint plants in Canada, and one in Ellesmere Port in the UK. Analysts say Stone's acquisition of Consolidated Bathurst was an exercise in bad timing. 'Basically, Stone paid a high price for Consolidated and got stuck with a lot of debt just as the market (for paper and container board) weakened and cash flow was going down,' says Brian Bogart, a bond analyst for Duff and Phelps. As a result, Stone Container entered the 1990s more than Dollars 4bn in debt, and with cash flow that was not adequate to meet both operating needs and debt-service obligations. Annual losses grew from Dollars 49.1m in 1991 to 1993's record Dollars 358.7m. The company's desperate need for cash led to a dilutive plan for a Dollars 500m equity offering early last year that was aborted after the announcement sent Stone's shares into a tailspin, depreciating their value by half. However, since then the markets for Stone's primary products have strengthened. The industry announced price increases for newsprint and linerboard in March, and has been successful at implementing them. Linerboard supplies are particularly tight, with manufacturers, including Stone, operating plants full-out in the first quarter. Stone announced a second Dollars 40 per tonne price increase for linerboard effective June 1, and is optimistic it will stick. At the same time, discounts for newsprint have been trimmed. The market turnaround has given Roger Stone the reprieve he needs to restructure Stone's mountain of debt and ward off creditors. In December, he created a company called Stone-Consolidated using most of Consolidated-Bathurst's assets, and then sold a 25.4 per cent stake in the new entity to Canadian investors hungry for new offerings. A series of smaller asset sales have followed, and the company has not ruled out selling a further stake in Stone-Consolidated as a means of raising cash. In February, the company completed a public offering of 16.5m shares of common stock and Dollars 710m in senior debentures. The proceeds from the Dollars 925m offering were used to prepay creditors. Ira Stone, Stone Container's chief spokesman, says the company has met all of its requirements for long-term debt maturing through 1995 and much of 1996. However, the debt clock continues to tick, with another Dollars 732m in long-term debt due in 1997 and some Dollars 2.9bn due thereafter. Even with some debt relief and what appears to be an upswing in business conditions, analysts say Stone has a rough year ahead. 'I think their business will continue to get better, but they still lost money in the first quarter, even with the price improvements,' says Mark Rogers, an industry analyst for Prudential Securities. If annualised, the first quarter loss translates into a Dollars 500m deficit for the year, he said. Part of the problem is that even though product prices strengthened in the first quarter, they still did not recover to the point where they were in the first quarter of 1993. Forest products analysts says that if the forest products market continues to firm it will be in the areas where Stone is most heavily invested - linerboard, corrugated containers, and newsprint and market pulp. Mr Bogart, with Duff and Phelps, says Stone may not see a profit until 1996. 'Stone has done a great deal of financing to stay ahead of its debt maturities, and now its cash flow is improving,' he said. 'They have a high degree of operating leverage, and each price increase has a generous impact on their bottom line.' However, he said, Stone faces hefty environmental charges to clean up air and water emissions at its plants and factories. Those charges, according to the company, could be as high as Dollars 400m. Shareholders appear to be banking on Stone's leveraged position in a rising forest products market. Stone Container shares have nearly trebled from a 1993 low of Dollars 6.50 2 per share to more than Dollars 16 recently.</p>

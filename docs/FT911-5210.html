			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Bush could lose vote on 'fast-track' negotiating authority OPPOSITION to President Bush's proposed North American Free Trade Agreement has grown to the point that his request for the extension of the 'fast track' negotiating authority could be defeated in either house of Congress. A coalition of labour, environmentalists, consumer groups, farm and church organisations has been lobbying for months against the 'fast track' which gives the administration power to negotiate trade agreements that Congress cannot amend. However, the 'fast track' can be defeated if one house votes against it. The administration is so concerned that President Bush last week launched a fierce attack on the opposition labelling those against the FTA 'fear mongers' who practise 'defeatism.' Yesterday, he warned that if he loses the fast track vote, 'we lose trade, we lose jobs and jeopardise economic growth; we unleash horrifying new waves of protectionism.' Mr Mark Ritchie, one of the opposition leaders and president of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, said at least 37 senators were almost certain to support a resolution killing the 'fast track', introduced by Senators Fritz Hollings of North Carolina and Kent Conrad of North Dakota. Another 28 senators are undecided. 'We just have to get 14 more to defeat it,' Mr Ritchie said. However, the opposition is divided over tactics. Some are moving to split the resolution to defeat the fast-track request for the FTA but retain it for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). In the House, there is widespread confidence that the FTA could easily be defeated if the two issues are separated. President Salinas of Mexico last week urged approval of the FTA and promised to address concerns about environmental enforcement and Mexican labour practices. Business groups trooped up to Capitol Hill to extol the benefit of an agreement which would create 'the largest market in the world' with 360m consumers and Dollars 6,000bn output. Administration officials contend that defeat of the 'fast-track,' would kill the Uruguay Round. The opposition, led by the AFL-CIO, one of the main trade union groupings, says it does not oppose free trade with Mexico. It calls the 'fast track' device 'undemocratic' and wants more Congressional control over the negotiations. It has little confidence in promises by the administration that few US jobs will be lost and that concerns about food safety and labour practices will be addressed. Unions contend that the White House is pushing the Mexico FTA because it helps big businesses that will profit by cross-border moves. The argument plays well in public at a time of rising US unemployment. In the end, the administration may seek a compromise to save the more than four years of work on trade reform in the Uruguay Round talks.</p>

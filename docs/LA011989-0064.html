			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO BECOMES LATEST CLEVELAND VICTIM  </P> <P> With Cleveland High tearing up the Northwest Valley Conference, San Fernando  boys' basketball Coach Dick Crowell adopted a realistic approach to Wednesday's  game at San Fernando.  </P> <P> Instead of succumbing to the pressure of playing The Times' top-ranked team in  the Valley area, Crowell resolved to take the game -- and an anticipated loss  -- in stride.  </P> <P> The approach proved prudent for Crowell and San Fernando as Cleveland  controlled the game from start to finish en route to an 89-65 victory.  </P> <P> Crowell had expected as much. "We're going to try and run on them, and if that  doesn't work we won't be worse off than anyone else they've played," he said  before the game. "But no matter what happens, I'm going to have a good time."  </P> <P> The Tigers (7-10, 1-3 in conference play) appeared to enjoy themselves early  on, taking a 4-2 lead on Sean Williams' breakaway layup and stretching the lead  to 6 points with a pair of unanswered baskets.  </P> <P> But the good times came to a screeching halt for San Fernando. Adonis Jordan,  who finished with 21 points, hit the front end of a 1-and-1, sending Cleveland  on a 19-2 run that ended with a Lucious Harris dunk.  </P> <P> Cleveland (14-2, 4-0) forced 15 first-half turnovers to stretch its lead to  39-26 at intermission and broke the game open with scoring runs of 14-3 and  15-4 in the second half. Harris led all scorers with 23 points and Ben Boyd led  San Fernando with 19.  </P> <P> Despite the easy victory, Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell was dissatisfied with  his team's intensity. "You do get a sense of complacency, but before we get  into the playoffs, we're going to have to get out of this rut," Braswell said.  </P> <P> Crowell, who is gearing his team for a Friday encounter at El Camino Real, got  exactly what he bargained for from the Cavaliers.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone in our league is going to beat Cleveland," said Crowell.  "This Friday's game is the game we've been looking forward to. This was just  fun."  </P></p>

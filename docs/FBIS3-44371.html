He stressed during the discussion: Party organizations  at various levels across China should earnestly implement the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; further strengthen party building; and make fresh  contributions to expeditiously establishing a socialist market  economy, and to enhancing a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.    The three-day eighth party work meeting of central  government  organs ended today.    Luo Gan, state councillor, secretary general of the State  Council, and secretary of the Work Committee for Central  Government Organs, chaired the discussion meeting. At the  meeting, Liu Zhengwei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee  for Central Government Organs, reported on the eighth party work  meeting of central government organs. Responsible people of  party committees of organs under the Ministries of State  Security and Water Resources and the China National Petroleum  Corporation successively spoke on ways to strengthen leadership  in the party organizations of government organs, reform and  operations in their respective departments, and giving play to  the roles of the party organizations of government organs.    Li Peng said: In 1993, the party organizations at various  levels of central government organs and the vast number of  personnel handling party affairs have done a lot of work in  conscientiously helping departmental party organizations and  administrative leaders. They have played an important role and  achieved relatively good results in promoting reform,  accomplishing departmental work and missions, and waging  anticorruption struggles.    Li Peng expounded the current situation and missions, and  pointed out that central government organs shoulder important  responsibilities to deepen reform, develop the economy, and  safeguard social stability. He said: We must be guided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, unify our thinking with the guidelines  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  and the National Economic Work Meeting, and maintain a high  degree of unanimity with the party central committee so as to  ensure the smooth implementation of government orders.    Li Peng stressed: In the process of establishing a socialist  market economy, we should correctly handle relations among  reform, development, and stability to ensure successful  implementation of various reforms and a sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy in 1994. He said:  Party organizations at various levels should give full play to  their roles as fighting bastions, give full play to the roles of  party members as vanguard models, lead the broad masses of  cadres, staff, and workers; help the leading party groups and  administrative leaders of various departments to complete all  missions, and work hard to accomplish various tasks laid down by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.    Li Peng said: Throughout the course of carrying out reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive, we should persistently  pay attention to reform and economic progress on the one hand,  and launch an anticorruption campaign and step up the building  of a socialist spiritual civilization on the other. We should  persistently uphold the policy of "building both material and  spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both."  He urged the leading party groups in various departments to  provide better guidance for the party work of government organs,  to earnestly improve the thinking and work style of government  organs, and to wholeheartedly serve the people with  down-to-earth, efficient and honest work. He pointed out the  need to intensify the cultivation of middle-aged and young  cadres, to strengthen the development of grass-roots party  organizations, and to implement various tasks all the way down  to the grass-roots level.    Luo Gan said in his speech: In 1994, the party organizations  of central government organs should understand the situation,  specify their tasks, and mobilize and organize the broad masses  of communist party members to lead the campaign to deepen  reform, develop the economy, safeguard social stability, and to  play their roles as vanguards and models. They should uphold  the policy of building both material and spiritual civilizations  and attaching equal importance to both. They should continually  deepen the anticorruption struggle, and earnestly improve the  thinking and work style of government organs. While  establishing a socialist market economy, they should further  strengthen and improve the party building of government organs.    Attending the discussion meeting were responsible comrades  of  the leading party groups of various departments of central  government organs, responsible comrades of the party committees  of government organs, and responsible people from relevant  departments.</p>

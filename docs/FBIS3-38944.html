			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] The West's new hard-nosed approach towards Bosnia  appeared tonight to have forced a remarkable peace settlement in  the besieged capital Sarajevo. Serb and Muslim military  commanders agreed to a ceasefire and the Bosnian Serb army  pledged to withdraw its artillery guns from around the city.    However, NATO members remained cynical about the  effectiveness of the ceasefire given the notoriously short time  previous deals have lasted.    The agreement came as NATO threatened air strikes if the  Serbs did not withdraw from Sarajevo. Following a meeting of  NATO ambassadors in Brussels, the alliance agreed to threaten  air strikes unless the Serbs withdraw heavy weapons from around  Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days.    Tonight, the ambassadors were still discussing whether to  describe the threat publicly as an ultimatum, said one alliance  source, adding: "But there is now agreement in principle that a  deadline will be set, beyond which air strikes will be used.  The rest of the discussion concerns details, not the principle."    The agreement came only a couple of weeks after the arrival  of Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose as the new UN commander  in Bosnia. With the unqualified backing of the Government for  tough action, the former SAS [Special Air Service] chief has had  a dramatic effect on Serb intransigence. An impressive figure  with piercing, cold blue eyes and an equally impressive military  record, he has warned the leaders of the warring factions that  he will no longer tolerate interference in UN operations. But  above all, he has convinced them he is not bluffing and that he  is not a man to be messed with.    It was clear tonight that Sir Michael's tough new stance  together with the West's determination to use the savage  marketplace massacre in which 68 civilians died at the weekend  to force a peace accord in Sarajevo had placed the Serbs on the  back foot.    The talks in Sarajevo were attended by Muslim army Gen Jovan  Divjak and Bosnian Serb Gen Manojlo Milovanovic. Sir Michael  reportedly shuttled back and forth between the Muslim and Serb  representatives in separate rooms at Sarajevo airport.    It is proposed that UN soldiers will take over sensitive  positions in and around Sarajevo, he said.    In Brussels, the NATO meeting opened with a general debate  about delivering an ultimatum to the Serbs, giving them a  timetable for withdrawing from Sarajevo or face air strikes.  The most reluctant participants in such a threat remain the  Canadians, Spanish, Greeks and the British, although Mr Major  has made it clear the Government is ready to support a  "muscular" response. He is willing to endorse an ultimatum,  with the threat of air strikes to follow, "provided the  commanders judge it appropriate." But Britain's NATO ambassador  John Weston was at pains to emphasise that Britain remains  convinced a negotiated settlement of the war in the former  Yugoslavia is the only long-term solution.    The political implications of any NATO action are still  being  analysed -- but today's talks indicate overwhelming agreement  that last Saturday's [5 February] market massacre marked what  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called "a turning point" in the  22-month war.    President Clinton called Mr Major and had a 30-minute phone  conversation this afternoon to discuss the Bosnia situation in  detail, Downing Street said. It was learned later that Mr  Clinton tried to telephone the Prime Minister last night. But  Mr Major was aloft in a helicopter at the time and the call was  rescheduled for this afternoon.    Downing Street said of the call later: "This was a very good  and productive conversation. The Prime Minister and President  agreed that what was needed was a clear decision from NATO for  the use of air power to support UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force]  efforts to stop the bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo. The  President acknowledged that the safety of British and other  UNPROFOR troops on the ground was a very important  consideration."    Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, commenting on  today's developments, said: "This shows that a tough attitude  towards the Serbs would have yielded dividends before. It is  vital that the pressure is kept up on the Serbs and that the  United Nations maintains its initiative. The right next step  would be to open Tuzla Airport."</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The Israeli security leak that could save Rabin: David Horovitz on the prime minister and the judicial inquiry into the massacre in Hebron Until this week, few Israelis had heard of the 'Territories Forum,' a top-secret gathering at which Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister and defence minister, hosts his most senior army and intelligence officers for discussions on all aspects of the Israeli presence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Now the existence of this forum has taken on tremendous importance: a meeting held last October may prove crucial to Mr Rabin's efforts to avoid taking personal responsibility for failing to prevent the massacre last month of Palestinian worshippers at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs by Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein. On October 16 last year, the Moslem authorities in Hebron sent Mr Rabin a letter, accusing a settler they named only as 'Baruch' of attacking Moslem guards and pouring acid on Moslem prayer mats in the mosque. The Moslem authorities insist now that the 'Baruch' in question was Goldstein - although they didn't know his surname at the time, they had witnesses who could have described him to Mr Rabin or any Israeli investigating official. Mr Rabin never responded to their letter. However, on October 22, at the defence ministry in Tel Aviv, he convened the Territories Forum. According to an excerpt from the minutes, leaked to the Israeli media this week, Mr Rabin warned his top officers that, among West Bank settlers, were several individuals who would stop at nothing to torpedo the peace process. The acid-pouring incident 'must put us on alert', he cautioned. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there were those among the Jews who don't just want to destroy prayer mats, but who will try to create a religious conflict to destroy the peace deal as well.' The aim of this extraordinary leak, from the highly-confidential discussions of a security forum, seems plain: to demonstrate that, months before Goldstein carried out the massacre, Mr Rabin had urged his commanders to take precautions against precisely such an incident. And while, as minister of defence, Mr Rabin in theory carries ultimate responsibility for the entire Israeli military establishment, the leak seems clearly designed to exonerate him from personal blame. The guilty men, runs the implication, are the commanders in the field who failed to heed his warning. In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, Mr Rabin at first resisted calls for the appointment of an independent commission of inquiry, fearful, it was presumed, that the finger of blame might point in his direction. He only gave in when he realised how overwhelming was the cabinet majority against him. Now, day after day, new evidence is emerging of security blunders, imperfect precautions and unclear orders at the tomb. Low-ranking soldiers have been blatantly contradicting evidence given by their decorated seniors. The stench of failure is rising ever-higher. Tomorrow the commander of the army's Central Command, General Danny Yatom, is being recalled to testify again about open-fire regulations - approved late last year both by Mr Rabin and by chief of staff Ehud Barak - which some soldiers interpreted as forbidding them ever to shoot at settlers. Later tomorrow, chief of staff Barak is himself to give evidence. Officials at the inquiry refuse to say whether Mr Rabin will also be called. But there are reports that he has instructed a lawyer attached to his office, Shmuel Hollander, to begin gathering relevant material, just in case. Mr Rabin knows he may have cause for concern. The Kahan Commission of inquiry, which investigated the massacre in 1982 of Palestinians at Beirut's Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, found that Ariel Sharon should have realised Christian Phalangists were 'liable to commit atrocities' against the Palestinians, and in the end forced Mr Sharon's resignation as defence minister. Mr Moshe Negbi, Israel's most prominent legal analyst, says that the present commission under the chairmanship of Meir Shamgar, the Supreme Court president, has equivalent powers to the Kahan Commission, that at some stage he believes Mr Rabin will be summoned, and that 'there is a possibility' the inquiry could badly damage him. As the army's top legal officer in the 1960s, Mr Justice Shamgar worked closely with then-chief-of-staff Rabin. Last year, a full quarter-of-a-century on, after Mr Rabin had ordered 400 alleged Islamic militants into exile, it was Mr Justice Shamgar who headed the Supreme Court panel that allowed the deportations to proceed, saving Mr Rabin from considerable embarrassment and possibly resignation. One question is whether the commission will consider Mr Rabin's warning on October 22 to his commanders as sufficient grounds for his exoneration. After all, the inquiry has heard that the army's governing strategy in devising security precautions at the Cave of the Patriarchs was that while an attack by Arabs on Jews was quite probable, an attack by Jews on Arabs was unthinkable.</p>

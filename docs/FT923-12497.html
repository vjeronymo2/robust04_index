			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Property and land writedowns wipe out Goode Durrant profits GOODE DURRANT, the mini-conglomerate involved in vehicle hire, motor distribution and housebuilding, has wiped out its pre-tax profits by heavily writing down the value of the group's property assets and land bank. Exceptional provisions of Pounds 6.27m helped produce a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.98m for the year to April 30, against a profit of Pounds 5.2m last time. Turnover fell from Pounds 241.2m to Pounds 178.16m. Mr Derek Kingsbury, who became group chairman in June, said the board had decided before he joined that it would be imprudent to carry any asset, particularly property assets, at other than the most conservative valuation  -what price they could fetch in the current market. The land bank belonging to the group's housebuilder Rawlings had been reduced in value to Pounds 6.4m after an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.81m. The group's fixed property assets were written down from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 10.6m. Of this amount, Pounds 2.46m was shown as an exceptional item, and Pounds 2.54m treated as movement in reserves. Mr Kingsbury said the group did not have to take such a cautious view because its surveyor, Jones Lang Wootton, had written to say it did not believe there had been any permanent diminution in the value of the group's property since it valued the portfolio in April, 1990, increasing its value by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 15.6m. He added: 'We believe the market for property - particularly in the south-east - has changed permanently since the late eighties. We are ahead of other companies in this, but believe they will have to follow.' The final dividend was held at 3.25p, giving a maintained total of 5.4p. Mr Kingsbury said the writedown in assets did not affect the group's strong cashflow of Pounds 19.7m, which was seven times the dividend payment. He said the profit figure before tax and exceptionals of Pounds 5.14m (Pounds 7.37m) was very commendable, given the market conditions facing group companies. A reorganisation at Northgate, the group's vehicle hire subsidiary, tripled operating profits from Pounds 748,000 to Pounds 2.52m. Equipment hire had a mixed year, with the success of Tam, the cabin and portable accommodation hire business, being more than offset by a very poor year for Ravenstock, which hires containers to the commercial and industrial market. Operating profits dropped from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 300,000. Laidlaw, the group's motor distributor, saw profits drop from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 1.31m, a performance which Mr Kingsbury said compared favourably with that of many other distributors. Rawlings saw profits fall from Pounds 862,000 to Pounds 362,000. Economic conditions further depressed house sales, selling prices and profit margins during the year. The shares closed 2p lower at 73p. Winnedael, the family company of the South African Nash family, said it was disappointed in the results.  It holds a 25 per cent stake in Goode Durrant and has been a long-standing critic of its performance. Mr Graham Perrins, a Winnedael director, said he was worried by the prospects for Ravenstock, which was dependent on the construction market. However, he did not wish to comment further until he had met the group's chief executive and new chairman.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: In the prime of life with Three Tall Women - The renaissance of controversial Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Edward Albee, author of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' The fallen genius of the American theatre is back on his feet again. What has been a renaissance season for Edward Albee peaked last month when the 66-year-old writer was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, his third, for Three Tall Women, an autobiographical play that is running at the Promenade Theatre off-Broadway. Three Tall Women is the work of a great writer in his later prime: rich and ruminative, but still exhibiting Albee's trademark capacity to scathe. Albee grabbed public and critical attention in the early 1960s with his first plays, strychnine-soaked family dramas filled with dissatisfied people taking their frustrations out on everyone around them. His merciless view of married life in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? so shocked the Pulitzer Prize committee that it chose not to give the Award for Drama in 1963 rather than give it to Albee's play - the nominating panel's unanimous choice for the award. It was the only slightly less disturbing A Delicate Balance which won Albee his first Pulitzer, in 1967. Albee's longtime interest in the works of Ionesco showed through not only in his spare, often barely linear dialogue, but also in his penchant for the absurd situation: Seascape, which won him his second Pulitzer in 1975, features as main characters a married couple of life-sized lizards. As Albee's work became more abstract and, in some cases, self-indulgent, he fell into critical and popular disrepute among the New York mainstream. He found a second artistic home in academic and regional theatres, and in Europe: Vienna's American Theatre was the first producer of both Marriage Play, in 1987, and Three Tall Women, in 1991. The current interest in Albee's work at home was sparked by the tiny Signature Theatre Company off-Broadway, which devotes each season to the work of one playwright. The New York premiere of Marriage Play launched Signature's Albee season last autumn, followed by several evenings of shorter plays - some moody and abstract vig-nettes, others fully fleshed-out one-acts - written in the 1960s and 1970s. Though the routes they take are different, all of these shorter plays seem part of a journey into the looking-glass of experience that has lent Albee, in his later efforts, a deeper understanding of - perhaps even compassion for - human foibles. This is not to suggest that he has gone soft on us. Jack and Gillian, the couple whose union dissolves in the course of Marriage Play, might be Virginia Woolf's George and Martha 15 years on - no longer swinging machetes in verbal combat but twisting daggers. Yet there seems in Marriage Play a striving for, and achieving of, some kind of enlightenment, even if the revelations are of the bleakest sort: 'We come to the moment when we understand that nothing has made any difference,' says Jack, 'that the failure is built into us, that the greatest awareness gives to the greatest dark.' In Three Tall Women, Albee delves deeper yet into his characters' psyches, smoothly melding his interest in formal abstraction with his roots in naturalistic family drama. In the play's first half, we meet a cranky, spirited dowager in her nineties (a character based on Albee's adoptive mother, with whom he had a troubled relationship), her long-suffering 50-ish carer, and her 26-year-old female lawyer who has come to the elder woman's home to put her affairs in order. The play's heart is in the second half, which features a simple but effective staging device. The figure of an old woman lies in a bed upstage, while downstage the actresses portray the older woman at three crucial stages in her life - callow and selfish youth, hardened middle age and sadder-but-wiser old age. They rant, reminisce, bicker and philosophise while a fourth character, the woman's young gay son who left her long ago, enters and sits silently by his dying mother's bedside, his wordlessness evoking the extremity of their estrangement. Piecing together a total picture of this woman from the bits of information we are given is an engrossing experience, and one, we gradually realise, more like real life than straightforward dramatic exposition. Lawrence Sacharow's understated production at the Vineyard Theatre allows the writing - at turns poetic, thoughtful and deliciously barbed - and the actresses' marvellous performances to carry the evening. Jordan Baker gives a fine and detailed performance as the younger woman, but cannot help but be overshadowed by her elders. Marian Seldes, never the subtlest of actresses, brings a bold theatricality to her performance as the middle-aged woman - sweeping gestures, exaggerated postures, rolling eyes - that is entirely appropriate and a wonder to watch. Myra Carter, as the dowager herself, is mercurial - girlish, then dottily forgetful, then fiendishly cruel. Like the play itself it is a performance full of venom, full of insight, and still very full of life.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F> unidentified correspondents at Beirut Airport on 1  June--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Buwayz] For us, the return of the permanent  headquarters of ESCWA [UN Economic and Social Commission for  Western Asia] to Beirut is an important issue. Lebanon was the  seat of this organization before the Lebanese incidents broke  out. This organization employs a large number of experts as well  as locals. Lebanon can benefit from those employees, from the  conferences to be held by this organization, and from the  studies it will make for the Lebanese state and institutions.  The decision to return ESCWA to Beirut was not an easy one, and  it required a secret vote. However, I believe that Lebanon is  entitled to repatriate this organization since it can provide  the academic, scientific, and cultural atmosphere needed for its  work.    [Correspondent] A report by the UN accuses Israel of  stealing  Lebanese waters, as is known. What will Lebanon do about it?    [Buwayz] This is a very delicate matter. We have repeatedly  asked the UN and a number of organizations to thoroughly verify  the matter. I cannot say as yet that we have proof that there  is direct stealing of water in the south. So far, we have not  had any clear reports pointing to that direction. The term  stealing of water can be interpreted in various ways. First we  have to define if we are talking about subterranean or surface  water, underground water or river basins, rivers that originate  and pour its water onto Lebanese territory or rivers that  originate in Lebanon and flow into other territory. I believe  that a careful examination of this matter is essential before  taking any decision about it.    [Correspondent] The report mentioned the al-Litani and  al-Wazzani rivers in particular.    [Buwayz] We will study this file thoroughly and we will act  accordingly.    [Correspondent] Reports say that an informal meeting of the  Security Council will be held to discuss Lebanon's complaint  against Israel. What can you tell us about Lebanon's activity  in this regard?    [Buwayz] As you know, despite the suspicions we have about  the Security Council's treatment of the Israeli operation in  Lebanon [to kidnap Faithful Resistance leader Mustafa  al-Dirani], we wanted the Security Council to live up to its  responsibilities. We hope that the Security Council will prove  that it is still in existence, fair, and still reflects  international justice. [passage omitted]</p>

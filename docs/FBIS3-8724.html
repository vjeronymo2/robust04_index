			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M. Mihajlovic: "Time Is Ripe for Great Serbia"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade -- The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] takes  the view that the present moment is the best opportunity for the  unification of Serbian lands, Vojislav Seselj, president of the  SRS, said at a news conference yesterday.    "If the Bosnian Jamahiriyah can make a joint state with the  Croats, who could stop the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK],  the Srpska republic, and the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] from uniting among themselves," Seselj said, adding  that one should exploit the West's stands and form a "single,  unitary state that could be called Great Serbia. Its internal  organization could be discussed later."    The Radicals hold the view that the indecisiveness of the  authorities regarding the unification is leading into new  diplomatic mistakes, and that the least that should be done at  present is to form a joint state of the Srpska republic and the  RSK, "with one president, one assembly, and one government."    The Radicals said that they would speed up the initiative  they announced last fall on staging a vote of confidence in the  federal government of Radoje Kontic, and an action on the  replacement of Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of  Citizens in the Federal Assembly.    In response to a question on the possibility of reshuffle of  Radoje Kontic's cabinet, Seselj said that the reshuffle is in  fact already completed: "Nikola Sainovic, the exceptionally  successful head of the Serbian Government, has been made into  the deputy federal prime minister. It remains to be seen  whether he will be able to achieve there everything he had  achieved as Serbian prime minister," Seselj said, ironically.    The leader of the Radicals first refused to comment on the  situation in the Democratic Party (the entry of two members of  the Democratic Party into the government), but then immediately  said that this was consistent with the SRS' predictions. The  Democrats have entered the waters they indicated they would  during the preelection campaign. They are wrong, however, if  they think that they will benefit from it, as the socialists are  crafty. The Democratic Party will be outplayed, Seselj said.    The SRS news conference yesterday was also attended by a  crew  from Radio and Television of Serbia, after a six-month absence.  "They are probably looking for something they can use in the  campaign against our party," Seselj explained, denying rumors  that there was new, secret friendship between the SRS and the  Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS].</p>

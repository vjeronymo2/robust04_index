Contouring is based on  spatial differentiation, and various spatial differentiation  algorithms are compared. An approach to paralleling the  algorithms is proposed, and implementation of the resultant  parallel algorithms on a computing system with a MIKROS  programmable structure is studied. The MIKROS architecture is  described. The programs were written in Fortran-S. Subroutines  in the programs are described. The efficiency of execution is  evaluated. Analysis of processing effic iency indicated a  speed-up of a factor of 2-3. Figures 5; references 11 (Russian).</p>

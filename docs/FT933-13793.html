			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Ukraine begins to dismantle missiles UKRAINE, which has faced harsh international criticism because of its increasingly vocal pro-nuclear lobby, yesterday took a quiet step in the opposite direction when technicians began dismantling some of the strategic nuclear missiles on its territory. Officials in Kiev yesterday confirmed a report in the Moscow daily newspaper Izvestia that they had this week begun dismantling 10 of the country's 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles. The decision represents the first concrete step that Ukraine - which has come under fierce diplomatic pressure for failing to ratify two key international disarmament treaties - has taken to reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal since becoming independent nearly two years ago. In contrast with its often hostile reporting on Ukraine, Izvestia welcomed the action as a signal that 'although one swallow does not make a summer, it cannot be denied that the ice has been broken'. However, the Ukrainian move did not deter the Russian Foreign Ministry from issuing a tough statement condemning Kiev's decision earlier this month to claim ownership over nuclear warheads on its territory. In keeping with that decision, Ukrainian military officials said the warheads from the disabled missiles would be temporarily stored in Ukraine. At a press conference in Kiev Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma defended the ownership claim, saying it was necessary to ensure Ukraine received compensation for the valuable enriched uranium released when warheads are dismantled. But Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned Ukraine against going a step further and declaring itself a nuclear power, a move the Ukrainian prime minister and a large lobby in parliament favour as a temporary measure. 'Is it not clear that making Ukraine a nuclear state is tantamount to opening a Pandora's box, giving the go-ahead to the appearance of other nuclear states, putting an end to the non-proliferation of nuclear arms and saying No to nuclear disarmament?' Mr Yastrzhembsky asked. Kiev's tentative step toward disarmament, taken with little fanfare or attempt to win political credit from the west, does not rule out a future attempt by Ukraine to become a nuclear power. The 10 missiles which have been taken off military alert are Russian-manufactured SS-18s. Even Ukrainian hawks like Mr Kuchma support the dismantling of these weapons. Their position is that Ukraine should, at least temporarily, keep only the 46 SS-24 missiles on Ukrainian territory, which were made in Ukraine and are serviced by a Ukrainian factory.</p>

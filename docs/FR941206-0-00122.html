			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cable industry generally opposes the proposed rule arguing that the proposal would require operators and programmers to adopt costly, inefficient and unnecessary methodologies to document the estimated fair market value of the assets or services exchanged. Some operators argue that the 75% bright-line test would impose administrative burdens that would be excessive and outweigh the speculative benefits that might result. Several other parties oppose the proposed rules on the grounds that these requirements would discourage vertical integration and would result in decreased investment in quality cable programming. Others also oppose the proposal and state that the only rationale for the rules comes from an incorrect premise that the application of such rules in the telephone context necessitates similar rules in the cable industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission declines to adopt the proposal to prevent cable operators from valuing assets or services at the operators' prevailing company prices unless the providing affiliates sell more than 75% of their output to non-affiliates. The Commission finds that this proposal would prevent, in many cases, cable operators from establishing a prevailing company price for programming services that have achieved wide distribution among cable operators. In addition, the Commission is concerned that by preventing cable operators from valuing programming at the prevailing company price, it may discourage major MSOs with substantial resources from investing in cable programming and related services that could benefit subscribers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will, therefore, retain the existing cable affiliate transaction rule which provides that a cable operator may value an asset or service at the prevailing company price if the provider has sold the same kind of service or asset to a substantial number of third parties at a generally available price. For cable affiliate transactions, the sale of an asset to a substantial number of third parties will ensure that cable operators will not have an incentive to pay excessive prices when they obtain services and assets from affiliates because in such cases the primary purpose of the transaction would not be to provide services and assets to the affiliated programmer. However, the Commission will continue to examine our test for the establishment of a prevailing company price in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215 and as the Commission gains experience with our current cable affiliate transaction rule, it may seek further comment in order to refine the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Cost Further Notice sought comment on (1) the proposal to require cable operators that do not meet the prevailing company price test to value services at the higher of cost and fair market value when the cable operator is the seller and the lower of cost and fair market value when the cable operator is the buyer; (2) whether the current definition of an affiliate should be retained; (3) whether the interim cable affiliate transaction rules should be adopted as our final rules; and (4) whether our final cable affiliate transaction rule should be included in the uniform system of accounts that we adopted for cable operators. The Commission will address these issues in conjunction with our general consideration of final cost rules in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215 at a later time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12, the Commission's final analysis with respect to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with section 3(i) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 pertaining to rate regulation, adopts rules and procedures intended to ensure cable subscribers reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory and administrative burden on cable entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

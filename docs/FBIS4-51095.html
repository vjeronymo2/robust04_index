			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Hu Xiujuan (5170 4423 1227): "Heilongjiang's </F> Individual and Private Economies Experience New Changes"]    [Text] A joint investigation group organized by the policy  research office of the provincial party committee, the  investigation and study office of the provincial government, the  provincial planning commission, provincial industrial and  commercial administration, and provincial federation of commerce  and industry conducted a survey on the development of the  individual and private economies in some prefectures and cities  of Heilongjiang. The result showed that new changes had taken  shape in the development of Heilongjiang's individual and  private economies.    The number and the scale were continuously increasing and  expanding. By the end of 1993, Heilongjiang's individual  industrial and commercial household businesses had totaled  517,500, and their registered funds 4.19 billion yuan, up 23.1  and 61.8 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. In  terms of the number of the individual industrial and commercial  household businesses, Heilongjiang's ranking rose from 15th to  13th in the country, and each household business had 6,304 yuan  of funds in average, higher than the national average of 4,838  yuan. The number of private enterprises totaled 3,595 in  Heilongjiang, up 120 percent from the preceding year. In 1993,  Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises paid 796  million yuan of taxes and created 3.65 billion yuan in output  value, up 35 and 62.2 percent, respectively, from 1992. People  employed by individual enterprises have reached 810,000 so far.    Another change in Heilongjiang's individual and private  economies was one from the unitary structure to diverse  development. Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises  used to have very unitary structure, with most them engaged in  commerce and catering trade. The unitary structure has been  changing since last year. First, the enterprises were developing  toward the processing industry and the scientific and  technological field. According to statistics, individual and  private enterprises engaged in production and scientific and  technological development totaled 180 last year. Second,  individual household businesses increased by 30,955 in rural  areas in 1993, up 29.7 percent from the preceding year. In  Zhaozhou county alone, 1,696 individual enterprises were  established last year, of which 84.2 percent were in rural  areas. Third, a number of specialized villages emerged.  According to statistics of Daqing city, over 100 specialized  villages were established, which also achieved good economic  efficiency.    Judging from the measures of management, Heilongjiang's  individual industrial and commercial enterprises were marching  toward cooperation and have created a situation of specialized  production and operation. Heilongjiang's private enterprises  also became dissatisfied with exclusively invested, joint, or  limited liability companies. They were developing toward the  direction of shareholding group companies and joint operation.  In Harbin city alone, four private enterprise groups have been  established.    The survey also showed improved quality in the people  working  at individual and private enterprises. A considerable number of  them were technical personnel, retired personnel, personnel on  leave without pay, and incumbent personnel moonlighting. Take  Harbin for example. Over 50 percent of the personnel of private  enterprises had a senior high school education level, of whom a  large part had a college education level or higher.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 1 -- Commenting on President Walesa's  yesterday's decision to veto the Sejm act on wage control, the  leader of the largest Sejm faction Aleksander Kwasniewski said  on Friday that the decision was risky. "I hope the president  was aware of the consequences of his move when he made it," said  Kwasniewski.    Another leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy played down yesterday's comments from his  party colleague Marek Borowski who termed Walesa's veto a  declaration of war on the ruling coalition.    Oleksy said he believed the presidential decision had a  broader meaning than just opposing the law on wage controls.  What it means we will have to find out, Oleksy said.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / SFO may renew home fraud probe: Homes Assured retrial considered after two former directors convicted of fraudulent trading but jury fails to reach a verdict on one other THE Serious Fraud Office is to consider a fresh prosecution of Mr Michael Robinson, the former managing director of collapsed mortgage broker Homes Assured, after the conviction of two of his fellow directors for fraudulent trading. The SFO, which handled both the investigation and the prosecution of Homes Assured's directors following its collapse in 1989 owing Pounds 10.7m to creditors, said it would decide on the matter within the next month. The Department of Trade and Industry may also restart civil actions against seven former Homes Assured directors, including Sir Edward du Cann, the former Conservative party chairman, to bar them from holding directorships. The Homes Assured trial concluded on Saturday with the conviction of Mr Anthony Dobson, 60, founder of the company that helped council tenants to buy their properties, and Mr Keith Woodward, 56, its former finance director. The two men were convicted of trading while the company was insolvent. Mr Dobson was also found guilty of two charges of procuring the execution of a security by deception, and Mr Woodward was convicted of furnishing false information. The convictions came at the end of a four-month trial, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on Mr Robinson on the charge of fraudulent trading. The company traded between November 1988 and August 1989 while insolvent. Mr Dobson and Mr Woodward are due to be sentenced by Southwark Crown Court on October 1. The jury was told during the trial that Homes Assured had been burdened by inadequate funds. Mr Michael Kalisher QC, the prosecuting counsel, said it had stumbled along 'borrowing from Peter to pay Paul' to stave off inevitable failure. Witnesses described Mr Dobson, who had been involved in four liquidations, as prone to exaggeration. He had avoided personal bankruptcy through a voluntary agreement before launching Homes Assured. While the company was insolvent a total of Pounds 116,000 was paid to companies owned by Mr Dobson or members of his family. None of the directors charged gave evidence, but their barristers argued they had honestly believed that sufficient funds would be available to justify staying in business. Mr Dobson's QC said that the group's late chairman Mr Eric Orbell, Sir Edward, and Mr Douglas Perryman, another director, had all decided to continue trading.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ridvan Sapmaz] </F>   [Text] Baku--The CIS Interparliamentary Assembly  delegation, which is continuing contacts in the region to find a  solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, has resubmitted a  proposal to set up 36 military garrisons in Karabakh and grant  them the status of a military base. President Geydar Aliyev  rejected the proposal.    According to a high-ranking official in the Azerbaijani  president's office who wanted to remain anonymous, the package  of proposals submitted by the delegation headed by Medetkan  Sherimkulov, the chairman of the Kyrgyzstan Parliament, asks for  military base status to be granted to the Russian peacekeeping  force garrisons to be stationed in Karabakh. The Azerbaijani  side opposes this.</p>

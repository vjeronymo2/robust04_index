			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The situation remains very tense in Rwanda, where  fresh negotiations opened this morning between rebels of the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and government forces. These  negotiations under the mediation of the United Nations are aimed  at achieving a cease-fire. Concerning today's negotiations, let  us listen to the views of RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba:    [Begin Gawumba recording] Talks are also necessary to stop  the massacres still prevailing in the country. We have always  said that meetings between the RPF and government forces could  help to stop the massacres and we continue to believe so. If  there is a possibility of stopping the massacres to enable the  people to live in security, well we believe it would have a  positive effect on our country. [end recording]    While negotiations continue at Amahoro Hotel in Kigali,  fierce fighting is taking place in the Rwandan capital. The  RPF, which is seeking a position of strength, has increased its  pressure on the contested interim government. [passage omitted]</p>

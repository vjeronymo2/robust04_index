			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mirko Lauer] </F>   [Text] The pamphlet that the Army Press Office (OIE) has  been circulating against the independent press shows that  attempts to turn the Armed Forces into a political party are  becoming increasingly daring. We were well aware that retired  members of the upper echelons of the Armed Forces were  deliberately outspoken, but had no idea of the degree to which  Nicolas Hermoza's [chairman of the Armed Forces Joint command]  men had become devoted to proselytism.    The OIE document does not address the members of the Armed  Forces as professionals, engaged in the defense of the  Constitution and the state, but rather real or potential  political cadres that are being instigated to mobilize those who  oppose the current regime. Couched in the best Leninist style,  the tract has a message for insiders, but does not reveal it to  outsiders.    Besides being a pamphlet of proselytism, the OIE document is  a piece of disinformation for military professionals, which  caricatures domestic concern for human rights, drug trafficking,  and precisely the institutionalism of the Armed Forces. In the  view of the OIE there does not seem to be any difference between  democratic opposition to Alberto Fujimori and the Shining Path.    It is obvious that OIE editors are not interested in  promoting a debate within its organization, but rather in  dispelling the possible doubts of its captive audience by  seeking to provoke in them a mood of paranoia. To this effect  they invent the idea that the press and public are hostile to  the Armed Forces as a whole. This is, to say the least, a clumsy  psychosocial technique.    It is not the opposition, but rather high-ranking officials  from Fujimori's regime who are against trying the most serious  cases of drug trafficking and violations of human rights in  civil court. The civil courts are precisely where it is  acknowledged that the crimes of which a defendant is accused are  of a nonmilitary nature. To insist on military jurisdiction is  to do the Armed Forces a disservice.    The OIE document seems rather an attempt to involve a  protective institution in political matters because of some  individuals' "serious mistakes." In fact, rather than a threat  against the press (which it certainly is), the document is an  attempt to impose a certain political line of thought among  those who wear a uniform on behalf of the nation as a whole.    The reiterated allusions to "disloyal people" in the  pamphlet  remind one of the secret pacts outside the law that are made by  some organizations like the Yakuza [Japanese mafia]. The  officers who at this juncture submit reliable information about  drug trafficking in the tropical forests are showing in an  exemplary manner what the sole and top loyalty of a military  should be: loyalty to the Constitution and to the laws of our  homeland.    The OIE seems to be inviting members of our Armed Forces to  forget their oaths of allegiance and side with a political  party. The problem with this lies in the fact that once the  military begin to get involved in politics, nothing will prevent  them from increasingly siding with those political options  offered to them. A leadership that is devoted to making  officers and the rank-and-file side with Fujimori may end up  harming the professional, institutional, and democratic feelings  that prevail in the barracks.</p>

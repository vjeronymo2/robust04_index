			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Givi Lominadze, chairman </F> of the Temporary Committee on Emergency Situations in the West  Georgian Zone, by Rusudan Lordkipanidze: "`It's a Long Way to  Complete Calm"; place and date not given]    [Text] "The situation in western Georgia is somewhat  better. Processes are manageable, but we are still a long way  from complete stabilization," Minister of State Givi Lominadze  said recently at a session of Parliament; he is chairman of the  Temporary Committee on Emergency Situations in Georgia's Western  Zone.    And no wonder: as long as the front line runs along the  Inguri, the process of reconciliation of supporters of the  former government has not been completed (by no means have all  the opponents of the present government extended the hand of  friendship to us), and they have yet to be disarmed, it's still  a long way to complete calm.    Recently the Georgian Parliament's Juridical Commission  and the Justice Ministry drafted a statute "On Temporary  Commissions for the Reconciliation of Supporters of the  Government of the Ex-President, Attached to Local Administrative  Bodies in the Emergency Situation Zone of Western Georgia,"  stipulating the creation, organization, and operational  procedures and jurisdiction of the Reconciliation Commission  (that is what it is called for short).    As we know, Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze last  year, in October, called upon all fighters in the  Gamsakhurdia-Kobalia ranks to turn in their weapons and give  themselves up. At the same time, a guarantee of immunity was  given to anyone who had not committed a grave crime. The task of  studying the cases of those who turned themselves in was turned  over to the Procuracy. Why, then, has it become necessary to set  up reconciliation commissions? We asked Givi Lominadze to answer  this question and explain the statute.    Districts of Mingrelia, unfortunately, are suffering  from an information famine. Owing to the particular urgency of  this article, therefore, we asked Communications Minister Pridon  Indzhia to do everything possible to see that this edition makes  it into Mingrelia.    "When chaos reigns in the country," Batoni Givi said, "when  illegal armed units are roaming in rather large areas--and not  just units but criminal armed gangs which, by their treacherous  actions, basically caused the loss of the war in Abkhazia--at a  time when weapons and medicine were supposed to be sent to the  front but never got there, and a hostile force was formed in our  rear and not only betrayed us but worked in harmony with the  enemy, openly joined forces with outside mercenaries and  Abkhazian separatists, and almost got as far as Kutaisi, the  government had no choice but to use force. The government was  also aware that those forces also included numerous persons who  had gone astray and lost their way. This is what impelled the  Head of State to make his appeal, in which he showed clearly  that the government was not interested in reprisals. The  Procuracy's agencies would run a check of all adversaries who  had turned in their weapons voluntarily, and anyone not guilty  of war crimes, anyone who had made a mistake and been deceived,  would be granted clemency by the Georgian government and Eduard  Shevardnadze personally as the Head of State, in accordance with  legislation in force; such persons would be treated humanely and  helped to return to their homes in safety. Many heeded this  call, many didn't. There was some misunderstanding in the law  enforcement agencies as well. Persons who came over to the  present government's side were supposed to be investigated only  by the Procuracy's agencies, yet that work was undertaken by the  Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry, structures  of the Defense Ministry, and a number of officials having the  right qualifications but not the jurisdiction; this resulted in  provocative rumors as well as unlawful actions on the part of  some law enforcement structures and, in many cases, specific  subjects. This is what necessitated the creation of an  institution designed to detect organized groups and armed  formations supporting the ex-president in the emergency zones of  western Georgia, as well as persons acting against the Georgian  government in other ways, and examine their actions in a  collegial manner, taking account of public opinion.    "Let me say also that any affirmative decision by the  Commission does not have the force of law; it is not the final  authority in the matter. It is supposed to study public opinion  in particular rayons and cities, relay it to Procuracy agencies,  and they, in turn, are to take account of it in making their  decision, if the investigation has not revealed any grave crime  committed by the specific person.    The reconciliation commissions are set up under regional and  rayon-level administrative bodies in western Georgia's emergency  zone.    [Lordkipanidze] Who are the members of the commissions?    [Lominadze] Officials of regional (rayon-level)  administrative bodies, members of Parliament elected from the  relevant electoral districts, deputies to the local agencies of  authority, and representatives of the public--all with an equal  vote, of course.    [Lordkipanidze] Could you say a couple of words about the  rights and duties of the Reconciliation Commission?    [Lominadze] To coordinate the activity of law enforcement  and  other state and civic bodies to detect and reconcile persons,  groups of persons, and armed units in opposition to the  government of Georgia, if, as I mentioned, they have not  committed a grave crime; within its jurisdiction, to coordinate  the activity of local law enforcement agencies in order to  prevent the punishment of persons who oppose the government but  have not committed a grave crime, who have turned in their  weapons and ammunition, and have sincerely repented of their  actions; to create all the conditions necessary to see that such  persons are returned to their place of work and residence; to  give them guarantees of a peaceful life; and many other  things....    [Lordkipanidze] What are the procedures of the Commission's  work?    [Lominadze] Basically it will work on the basis of citizens'  individual or group statements, also petitions coming in from  enterprises, organizations, and establishments, and  representations from law enforcement agencies. The materials are  to be examined in 10 days and a well-motivated decision made.    [Lordkipanidze] What happens if it is found that the actions  of a person or group of persons are criminal?    [Lominadze] The material is turned over to investigative  agencies.    [Lordkipanidze] Is it possible to appeal a decision of the  Reconciliation Commission or an action taken by it in connection  with the examination of a case?    [Lominadze] It can be done in the Temporary Committee of the  Emergency Zone, which has the right to overturn the Commission's  decision.    [Lordkipanidze] I understand that such commissions have been  set up under all the city and rayon administrations in the  emergency zone. When are they to take action on the statute?    [Lominadze] The statute has been sent out and has been in  force since 10 March. [end of Q and A]    One more cause for hope on the way to stabilization,  perhaps not in vain.</p>

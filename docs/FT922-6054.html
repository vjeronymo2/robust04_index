			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / A matter of striking a balance: The new trade minister discusses his objectives MR Richard Needham, the new trade minister, is anxious to deflect criticism of Britain's export performance. He treads a balanced path between reassuring businessmen worried by trade deficits and avoiding overt backing for a more interventionist government policy. After a month in his job, the new man at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is sufficiently astute not to criticise his predecessors but believes that in promoting UK exports there has to be a more constructive relationship between the DTI and industrialists. It would be churlish to make too much of the fact that his predecessors made similar noises and made light of the steady deterioration in relations with industry. Yesterday Mr Needham faced top exporters concerned at the lack of support and frustrated by the government's preference for seemingly endless bright public-relations ploys - such as last September's export initiative to Venezuela, or the Kuwait 'task force' aimed at winning business after the Gulf war. Exporters would rather have help on export finance or the use of more aid funds to boost exports. Britain's export performance is not as bad as critics claim, Mr Needham says. The long-term decline in Britain's share of world trade has stabilised. The UK exports the equivalent of Pounds 1,800 a person a year. Japan manages only Pounds 1,000. The volume of UK exports has grown significantly faster in the last year than many other leading industrial countries. 'That gives us a base on which we can build,' he says. When he was Ulster's economy minister he was regarded as interventionist, a charge he does not deny, but he rejects any suggestion that he wants a greater injection of public money into industry, talking instead of working in 'partnership'. While his statements suffer from cliche, he does strive to give them substance. 'What the DTI can do . . . in many parts of the world is to work together with industry to ensure that if there are orders out there, that they are got by us.' Support should not just be forthcoming in officially sponsored export drives but also when the DTI negotiates on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or on the European single market, he says. The government, he adds, should be seen to be backing winners and encourage industry 'to feel that they have got that backing. That 'backing winners' principle is going to be very important.' He was unwilling to offer any pledges to increase the support that government gives to exporters to sell goods in volatile or difficult markets. UK industrialists complain regularly about the limited availability of medium and long-term export-credit cover and the high cost of export-credit insurance premiums, which they regard as unfair handicaps on exports. Yet there is not even a hint that Mr Needham will try to meet their complaints. He is sympathetic, if uncompromising. 'Not everyone is going to get what they want, but at least if you have a partnership and there is a large degree of trust and confidence it is much easier, in those circumstances when things don't always go right, to ride the squalls.' Such backing for exporters extends to spending time on helping to restore the image of industry and selling the idea of industrial benefits to young people. 'The last great exposition of British industrial might was in 1851 . . . Ever since then, the whole atmosphere and attitude of the establishment towards industry has declined, right through the education system, through the Civil Service, through the professions and so on. Now I believe that that is starting to come back.'</p>

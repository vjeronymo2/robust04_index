			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Thirst for Vimto prompts 8% gain at JN Nichols STRONG SALES of Vimto, the fruit and herb drink, helped JN Nichols report an 8 per cent increase to Pounds 8.36m in pre-tax profits for 1992, on sales virtually unchanged at Pounds 47m. The campaign to widen the appeal of Vimto, traditionally the favourite soft drink of Northern non-drinkers, and an increased contribution from Nichols Foods helped to offset a decline in contract canning and export sales. The company said the Pounds 1m decline in exports, a significant proportion of which are targeted at the Middle Eastern market where Vimto is often used to break the Ramadan fast, had been due to the timing of deliveries. Ramadan had fallen later than the previous year. The group's main export markets continued to grow, however. In the UK, bad weather last summer had had an adverse affect on sales in the latter half of the year. Nevertheless, Vimto showed a strong improvement and the can vending business helped to increase sales. The final dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 8.5p, for a total 1.3p higher at 13.6p. Earnings were ahead from 32.6p to 35.4p.</p>

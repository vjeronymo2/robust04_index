			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Fiji, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has won a  convincing victory in the country's 1994 snap election. South  Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports that Fiji's  Constitution guarantees indigenous Fijians political dominance  over the country's Indian population.    [Reddan] Rabuka called this snap election just 18 months  into  his five-year term after a leadership challenge last November.  He returns to parliament with the same number of seats in his  coalition, counting two independents and four general voter  seats, but his SVT [Fijian Political Party] party is down by two  seats to 31. Josevata Kamikamica, who mounted the leadership  challenge, has lost his seat, but his newly launched Fijian  Association did pick up five seats. The anti-Indian Nationalist  Party lost all of its five seats and the All Nations Congress  won one seat.    Rabuka says he'll find it easy to work with the National  Federation Party, which won 20 seats at the expense of the Labor  Party, which is down from 13 to seven seats.    Prime Minister Rabuka says he's very happy with his win.    [Begin Rabuka recording] Well, any victory is good. I had  hoped that we would get 33 or 34 seats. A four majority in the  house is still enough to run a government and its very, very  satisfying, very comforting to know that people still have a lot  of confidence in the party. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday [17 April], at a provincial meeting  attended by commissioners, prefectural chiefs, mayors, and  county magistrates, the provincial government commended and  awarded 20 counties, cities, and regions, including Youxian  County and others, whose total production output of township and  town enterprises topped one billion yuan in 1993; 140 townships  and towns including Xiangbei in Changsha County whose total  production output of township and town enterprises reached 100  million yuan; and two units including the village of Jinyuanshan  in Jinhuahu Township of the city of Yueyang, and the Langli  automobile body plant in Changsha County. The honorific title  of "Township and Town Enterprise Entrepreneur in Hunan Province"  was also conferred on 100 comrades, including Comrade Tao  Guoqing and others.    Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Comrade Yang  Zhengwu. Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying made a work report  on township and town enterprises. He said: The CPC Central  Committee and the State Council have promulgated a series of  measures for economic structural reform. Such economic reform  will, in the long run, benefit economic development as a whole,  and the development of township and town enterprises as well.  However, in the course of implementing some specific measures,  and especially those connected with financial, tax and monetary  reform, township and town enterprises are directly affected. It  is obvious that those measures will give sharp shock to some  trades and services, and enterprises with poor economic  efficiency in particular. This has required that leaders at all  levels strengthen their confidence and determination in speeding  up reform and development, and truly do well in ensuring a  smooth transition in light of practical conditions. Township  and town enterprises must deepen their internal reform, further  improve their quality, and strengthen their capability in  dealing with emergencies and enduring difficulties. On the one  hand, they must truly do well in adjusting industrial setups and  product mix, and they must strengthen and improve internal  management of enterprises to promote their export-oriented  economy. On the other hand, the development strategy for  township and town enterprises should be changed from the  previous main reliance on extensive expansion into tapping  intensive potentials to broaden enterprises in scale, promote  their technical level, and upgrade their products.    Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying also stressed: Pursuing  a shareholding system and a shareholding cooperative system is a  nucleus of deepening the present reform of township and town  enterprises. Through popularizing the shareholding and  shareholding cooperative system, various localities must solve  the three main difficult problems facing the development of  township and town enterprises: Enterprises' vague equity  relationships, severe degeneration of operational mechanisms,  and utterly insufficient input of funds.    In his speech, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out:  Governments at all levels and various departments must support  township and town enterprises in terms of policies, input,  import and export trade, and mass media guidance, whereas  township and town enterprises must scale new heights in terms of  mechanisms, management, technical progress, and their ability to  earn foreign exchange. This will enable them to make new  progress in the production of the second quarter.</p>

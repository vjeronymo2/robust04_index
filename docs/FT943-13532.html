			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: N&amp;P launches home insurance products National &amp; Provincial Building Society yesterday launched a new range of home insurance products in what could be a prelude to a move into general insurance under the proposed new powers for societies. N&amp;P, the UK's eighth-largest society, said it would go into general insurance if it decided that customers would benefit, for example, through greater flexibility in products that could be offered. 'The new legislative plans open up quite a big opportunity for building societies,' said Mr Michael Pendle, N&amp;P's director of general insurance. He said the new Homechoice range of insurance policies was competitively priced and offered great flexibility. Mr David Conway, customer requirements director, said the price competitiveness had been achieved partly through negotiations with the insurance companies to reduce the costs of manufacturing the policies, and partly through N&amp;P cutting its margins 'in some cases very substantially'. 'Building societies have perhaps been too cosy with insurers,' he said. N&amp;P is initially targeting the new products at its existing 2.8m customers, savers as well as borrowers. Some 400,000 to 450,000 customers already have building and contents insurance with N&amp;P.</p>

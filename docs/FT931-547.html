			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Deputies struggle to hang on to the good life: Membership of parliament brings fringe benefits no one gives up lightly MR VLADIMIR ISAKOV is no average deputy. He is an important political figure in the Russian parliament, the guiding intelligence behind the Russian Unity bloc (generally known as 'hardline'). In the details of his election and political development since then and in the conditions of his work - his pay, benefits and privileges - lie some of the reasons for the reluctance of many deputies to give up their seats in parliament. It explains why, yesterday, deputies voted to include a question on their re-election ina referendum set for April 25 - but gave no date, hoping to be able to keep their seats for as long as possible. Mr Isakov, 43, was elected from the city of Ekaterinburg, which was called Sverdlovsk when he was elected, and was the home base of Mr Yeltsin when he was a district Communist party secretary. Now one of the Russian president's bitterest critics, Mr Isakov was then a keen, even fervent, member of Democratic Russia, a pro-Yeltsin reform grouping. His journey across the political spectrum to Russian Unity has been further than most have cared to go, but it is far from unique. Mr Yeltsin had a majority in this parliament: present voting shows his support to be somewhere between one quarter and one third. As one of the 245 deputies who serve in the small, permanent Supreme Soviet, he qualifies for a range of - in Russian terms - impressive benefits. He receives a monthly salary of Rbs40,000 (around Dollars 60 at the present exchange rate), more than twice the average wage; he also gets Rbs46,000 a month to pay for secretarial or other assistance. He has an office in the 'White House', or Russian parliament; a pleasant flat in Moscow for free; a dacha in one of the 17 dacha settlements or sanatoriums owned by the Russian parliament. He does not pay for any travel within Russia, and he can always get a seat on Aeroflot aircraft: at nearly all airports except the smallest, there is a 'deputies' hall', usually an oasis of peace in a surrounding of noise and squalor. All of this, plus influence, prominence, and offers of foreign trips, make Mr Isakov's job highly desirable. For his colleagues who are members only of the larger Congress, the benefits are much less. They receive Rbs6,000 a month, plus Rbs23,000 for assistance and free travel in Russia: it is assumed they will keep their regular jobs. Although many of these deputies have turned into effective local representatives, Mr Isakov said yesterday, however, that 'they are now tired of being insulted by their constituents, who think the hard life they're suffering is all their fault'. Mr Isakov freely admits that the good life offered to deputies, many of whom had modest means before, constitutes a 'severe problem for our movement'. Though it supports extraordinary elections for both the presidency and the deputies the Russian Unity group has, he says, a number of deputies who 'try to find any rationalisation, any argument, to cover the fact that they do't want to lose what they have gained. They must understand this is a moral position which they must take,' he says. However, he admits he is luckier than most. A lawyer by profession, and a lecturer at the Sverdlovsk Law Institute before he was elected in 1990, he says he has a good job to which to return. But 'I can only feel pity for those who have to return to find a job in the economy they themselves destroyed'. Like nearly all of the deputies, Mr Isakov was selected in 1990 for a four-year term. He was also elected fairly freely - a fact which, when ignored by the president's side and by foreign press and governments, makes him and his colleagues angry. The March 4, 1990, elections to the Congress of People's Deputies saw 6,700 candidates fight for 1,068 seats in total, an average of six candidates for each seat. The justification for calling the parliament 'Communist-dominated' is that more than 80 per cent of those contesting the seats were members of the Communist party. However, they also often represented the emerging political and social movements of the time - like the anti-Stalinist Memorial society - and many of the successful candidates, like Mr Yeltsin himself, were liberal Communists running against party apparatchiks.</p>

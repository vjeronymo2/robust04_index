These violations constitute a serious threat to  Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national unity.    In a letter addressed the day before yesterday to the Arab  League's secretary general, Iraq's permanent representative said  that between 9 and 16 June, these aircraft conducted 301 hostile  sorties and violated Iraqi airspace after taking off from bases  in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

The party's resolution on history and other documents  have summarized the principles, and further study is certainly  needed on the details. As far as Mao Zedong's own thinking and  understanding are concerned, the following two points should at  least be given special attention.    First, there were errors in assessment and a tendency  toward rash advances in regard to China's effort to build  socialism in terms of the historical starting point of the  effort, the historical stage in which the effort was carried  out, and the construction goals and speed involved in the  effort. As discussed above, the understanding of socialism  that the Communist Party of China, including Comrade Mao Zedong,  had during the long period of struggle for democratic revolution  was rather abstract, and it can be said that they were not fully  prepared. One manifestation of such abstractness was that in  regard to understanding Marxism, there was no sufficient  understanding of the fact that Marx's discussions of socialism  were based on temporal and historical conditions totally  different from those in China; another manifestation was the  practice of making Soviet experience and realities the only  basis, despite the fact that Stalin had not resolved the issue  of integrating Marxism with Russian realities either and that he  had rushed things and disregarded the limits imposed by the  historical stage, whether in declaring the establishment of  socialism or in announcing the outlines of features of socialism  (including making those later comments on the transition to  communism). In the early years of the PRC, Mao Zedong was still  rather cautious in his assessment of the process of socialist  construction in China. Later, because of the expeditious  achievement of socialist transformation and a lack of sober  understanding of the masses' enthusiasm, his assessments of such  things as the historical stage in which China was situated and  the goals and speed of socialist construction became  increasingly divorced from reality. In 1955, efforts to fight  conservative tendencies were started, involving criticisms of  "women with bound feet." The efforts started in the area of  forming agricultural cooperatives, and then were extended to the  economic spheres including the spheres of industrial and  agricultural production, transportation, and capital  construction as well as the scientific, educational, cultural  and other spheres. It was demanded that there be persistent  criticisms of right deviationist conservative views on the scale  and speed of construction. In the period between the making of  the speech, "On the Ten Major Relationships," and the Eighth CPC  Congress, because of problems in actual economic construction  and resistance from many in the party leadership, he gave  approval to rather realistic plans and measures, but was never  happy about the activity of "opposing rash advances." As  discussed earlier, he made many creative breakthroughs on the  issue of China's approach to socialist construction in view of  the lessons of the Soviet Union, but he did not do one thing,  that is, to criticize Stalin's simplistic summarizing of the  process of socialist construction, the summarizing which had  been done too early. On the contrary, he believed that China's  approach to construction could lead to even faster development  than achieved by the Soviet Union. At the 1957 Moscow  conference, he and Khrushchev already had disputes between  themselves, but they were basically in agreement on the  situation and speed of the development of socialism, that is,  believing that the east wind was prevailing over the west wind  and that socialist economic development could soon lead to  catching up with and surpassing the West. Hence the criticism of  the activity of "opposing rash advances" in early 1958 and the  "Great Leap Forward" later.    The "Great Leap Forward" was a rash advance based on  disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage in two  aspects. The first was to propose struggle goals and development  speed concerning economic development which were totally  divorced from the realities in China, applying the phrase, "one  day equals 20 years," used by Marx to describe the time of  revolution to the development of economic construction, material  production, and cultural undertakings. The second was the  attempt to establish production and distribution relationships  and to change the look of society completely according to the  principles of communism with respect to the relations of  production and even overall social development, disregarding the  backwardness of China. This totally deviated from Marxism and  was entirely divorced from the realities in China, becoming the  root cause of all the errors on the issue of economic  construction.    Our country had previously been a large semicolonial,  semifeudal country in the east, and was one era behind  capitalist societies with ripe preconditions for socialist  revolution and construction, in terms of the development levels  of the economy and social relationships. Even the task of  anti-imperialist, antifeudal democratic revolution which had  involved the resolution of various social contradictions under  ripe conditions had been completed only after long, tortuous,  and hard struggle. In those years the insufficient understanding  of the realities in China, of the historical stage in which  China had been situated, and of the long-term and arduous nature  of the revolution had resulted in the cause of revolution  suffering great losses. Because of the absence of adequate  economic conditions and social and cultural preconditions, the  transition to socialism on the basis of the victory of  democratic revolution and socialist construction would  inevitably go through a series of transitional stages and an  even longer and more arduous process of struggle, as Lenin said.  People of each generation, Marx said, can only create their own  history under the definite material conditions created by their  predecessors; people, he also said, can only propose tasks for  which historical conditions are ripe. That is, the development  of the social productive forces and changes in the relations of  production or in social relationships in general must all be  based on definite conditions and laws. During the democratic  revolution, Mao Zedong's understanding and handling of this  issue was correct, and therefore he was able to lead the entire  party and people in achieving victory step by step. However,  after the victory of the democratic revolution, especially after  the middle of the socialist transformation stage, he became  increasingly unable to make sober assessments. "On the Ten Major  Relationships" did contain some creative breakthroughs with  respect to approaches to, and models of socialist construction,  but still basically followed Stalin with respect to views on the  historical stage of socialism or on criteria about socialist  construction. As a result, under the theme of exploring China's  approach to socialist construction lurked the danger of an even  stronger tendency toward rash advances on the basis of  disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage. Thus,  at the time of the "Great Leap Forward," the series of correct  policies and measures put forward in the period between "On the  Ten Major Relationships" and the Eighth CPC Congress were  completely changed. The "Great Leap Forward" was not only a  manifestation of a simplistic and vulgarized understanding of  socialism and communism, but also a manifestation of a lack of  understanding of modern industrial society (that is, the entire  stage of capitalism). It in fact reflected the mental state and  limited horizon of the Chinese people who, living in a poor  agricultural society, were anxious to change the existing state  of affairs. This was exactly the reason why the "Great Leap  Forward" was able to gather support from huge numbers of people  in a short time and arouse tremendous, but very blind,  enthusiasm. In this sense, Peng Dehuai hit home when he used the  phrase, "petty bourgeois fanaticism," at the Lushan conference.  As shown here, Mao Zedong's tragedy not only carried a personal  flavor but also reflected characteristics of Chinese society.    Second, he failed to achieve the transition from  revolutionary movement (especially revolutionary war) to routine  economic construction in respect to working methods,  disregarding the laws of economics and one-sidedly emphasizing  reliance on political mobilization and mass movement. The  approach to socialist construction in China proposed in "On the  Ten Major Relationships" represented breaking away from the  Soviet Union's rigid model of construction (encompassing its  development strategy and economic system); but there were more  philosophical and political supporting arguments than economic  supporting arguments. He did not take a position different from  the Soviet model on a fundamental point, that is, the failure to  regard the economic development of society as an objective  process which would function according to its own laws  irrespective of any human wills, and to understand that even the  most advanced people and the strongest power would only be able  to exercise guidance on the basis of the conditions they  enjoyed, but could not make designs and plans at will as if  building a house. In discussing the relationships among  agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, he mainly  discussed how to correctly adjust the distribution of investment  in state plans; in discussing the relationships among the state,  collectives, and individuals and between the center and the  localities, he mainly discussed how the central state power  should correctly demarcate various powers and correctly  distribute benefits among groups. This was necessary, but in  fact still represented the way of thinking characteristic of a  highly centralized planned economic model as the Soviet Union  had. He correctly emphasized that it was necessary to give great  attention to agriculture and light industry, to pay attention to  the interests of the localities, of various economic  collectives, and of workers at large, and to arouse their  enthusiasm. All this was basically in line with the objective  demands of economic development. Such measures as delegating  power and a series of "concurrent development" measures adopted  for that reason were for the purpose of meeting those demands at  the systems level (for instance, the effort to develop industry  across the urban and rural areas nationwide through small-scale  operations, the use of homegrown practices, and mass  participation all failed together with the "Great Leap Forward,"  but gave the peasants some preliminary education on spreading  industrialization; thus the effort had a historical link to the  widespread development of township enterprises today). These  represented fundamental differences with the Soviet system.  However, on the whole, he was less inclined to consider  analyzing things on the basis of economic conditions and the  laws of economics and to exercise regulation and guidance  through manipulating the economic system and economic policy. He  was more inclined to rely on political mobilization and mass  movement. Especially, later on, because of the abovementioned  assessments involving the disregarding of the limits imposed by  the historical stage and the development demands which  contributed to rash advances, he disregarded objective economic  laws to an increasing extent, and one-sidedly emphasized  stimulating people's subjective initiative through political  mobilization; he even promoted the "Great Leap Forward"  coercively through applying the pressures of political criticism  and mass movement.    Aside from disregarding the law that the social productive  forces should be developed gradually under the given material  conditions and that the relations of production should suit the  level and state of the productive forces, the most concentrated  manifestation of the so-called disregarding of economic laws in  the actual process was the disregarding of the law of value, the  basic law of the commodity economy. For, under the condition of  low level productive forces in China, whatever form the  relations of production take, people inevitably demand the use  of the principle of equal exchange to govern the exchange of  labor with other people or society, and do not tolerate the  uncompensated appropriation of their labor. The distorted public  ownership system and egalitarian distribution based on  disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage in  existence at that time inevitably inhibited or even hurt the  display of workers' enthusiasm and the development of the  productive forces; and political agitation, however forceful,  could only achieve temporary effects. Because of such a state of  affairs, the economic system and policy of that time were often  in contradiction and conflict with the demands of the law of  value and the wishes of workers; and Mao Zedong held wavering  and contradictory views of the law of value, sometimes accepting  the idea and sometimes rejecting the idea. Mao Zedong made a  series of contradictory statements on the law of value, but  fundamentally he disregarded or even rejected the idea. During  the high tide of the "Great Leap Forward" he expressed approval  to the effort to oppose bourgeois rights, and gave approval to  many practices such as levelling, transferring, and  egalitarianism. However, after he discovered that such practices  had caused many difficulties in, and harm to economic life, and  that Chen Boda and others were advocating the abolition of  commodity production, he repeatedly stressed the roles of  commodity production and the law of value. He criticized Stalin  for setting the state and collective peasants against each other  and for not daring to put means of production in the category of  commodities, thereby being more advanced than Stalin; but he  also criticized Stalin for talking about only economic  relationships and material interests, but not making politics  the commanding matter, and for failing to promote communist  elements, thereby going one step backward from Stalin. He  understood Stalin's contradictory state of mind, saying that  Stalin had had 30 years of experience, but had not found the way  out and that as could been seen he (Stalin) had been dejected.  In fact Mao Zedong was also very dejected in relation to this  issue. On the one hand he said that there was no need to fear  that the negative effects of commodity economy and the law of  value would lead to the appearance of the ghost of capitalism,  but in fact he feared this ghost of capitalism greatly and thus  tried every means to suppress it, giving increasing emphasis to  relying on the practice of making politics the commanding matter  and on mass movement. All this made it impossible to adopt the  approach of applying the law of value in the form of using  multiple economic forms and measures to arouse the masses'  enthusiasm for production so as to promote the development of  the productive forces, and eliminated various possibilities of  reforming the economic system on the basis of proceeding from  realities.    Here we are only discussing how and why Mao Zedong turned  from making creative breakthroughs into suffering tragic  failures on the issue of China's approach to socialist  construction, but are by no means arguing that there were no  people with sober understandings of those issues within Chinese  society and the CPC as well as its leadership. Whether among the  cadres, masses, and intellectuals at large or within the party's  leadership teams at various levels, there were many people who  had rather sober understandings of the realities in China and  the historical stage in which China was situated, and who put  forward rather realistic views on the goals and speed of China's  economic development and on the balances that should be kept,  believing that various impure economic forms should be tolerated  under China's socialist economic system. Such correct views and  ideas were also the reasons why Mao Zedong could outline a  correct approach to construction when making the speech, "On the  Ten Major Relationships," in 1956, and why the Eighth CPC  Congress was able to make correct decisions. For, at that time,  inner-party democracy and the system of collective leadership  were still in rather good shape; various ideas could all be put  forward to be discussed so that they might complement each  other. Nevertheless, after the start of the "Great Leap Forward"  in 1958, people became more or less hotheaded; in addition, Mao  Zedong severely criticized the activity of "opposing rash  advances," and refused to listen to dissenting views, resulting  in initial damages to inner-party democracy and the practice of  collective leadership. This was an important reason. During and  after the 1959 Lushan conference, inner-party democracy and the  practice of collective leadership were thoroughly destroyed. Any  discussions of, or debates over, different views on economic  construction became political struggles; as a result, there  emerged autocratic and arbitrary decision making on important  issues, and checking and balancing forces disappeared. All this  further deepened Mao Zedong's tragedy. It can be said that "On  the Ten Major Relationships" and the Eighth CPC Congress were  the crystallization of collective wisdom, and that the "Great  Leap Forward" and the Lushan conference were the disastrous  results of rejecting democracy and the practice of collective  leadership. This is material covered by our next two topics.  <H5>  [15 Nov 93 pp 9-12] </H5>   [Text] Part III--The Second Breakthrough and Tragedy:  Concerning Contradictions Among the People and the "Policy of  Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and Letting a Hundred Schools  Contend"    Socialism is not only an economic system. Socialism is a  social system encompassing economic, political, cultural, and  other systems and policies. Its central task is to promote the  sustained and rapid growth of the productive forces. At the same  time, it should also enhance the comprehensive construction of  social relationships, enhance the construction of such things as  democratic politics and spiritual civilization so as to ensure  the healthy development of economic construction, improve the  entire people's material and cultural standards of living, and  promote comprehensive social progress.    Thus, while exploring the approach to socialist construction  in China, Mao Zedong also conducted bold explorations regarding  the development of social relationships and the construction of  democratic politics and science and culture under the conditions  of socialism in China, and made creative breakthroughs.    After leading the Chinese people in overthrowing the  reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic  capitalism, the Communist Party of China established the state  power of the people's democratic dictatorship which was led by  the working class and based on the alliance of workers and  peasants. Relying on this state power, it extensively  transformed social and economic relationships, and carried out  economic and cultural construction in a comprehensive manner.  During this process, it created many things, with the people's  democratic dictatorship being just a creation based on  integrating the Marxist theory of proletarian dictatorship with  the concrete realities in China; and it also followed and  referred to Soviet experience in many areas.    In 1956 and 1957 new situations and changes occurred at home  and in the international environment, thereby prompting Mao  Zedong to also think about new approaches to handling society,  politics, science and education, and cultural construction.    The first was the change in the domestic situation. By 1956,  through a series of social transformation movements, not only  had such remaining tasks of democratic revolution as land  reform, suppressing counterrevolutionaries, and restoring the  economy been completed, but with regard to the economic system,  the socialist transformation of the relations of production,  mainly the ownership system, had also been completed. Because of  six or seven consecutive years of social transformation  movements involving all the people, the social structure had  undergone tremendous changes. The exploiting classes either had  been basically eliminated as classes (the feudal landlord class  and compradore bourgeoisie) or were in the process of being  eliminated (the national bourgeoisie); workers, peasants, and  intellectuals at large had been emancipated both politically and  economically; the productive forces of society had been  liberated; the state power of the people's democracy had been  consolidated; and China had achieved such national unity,  solidarity among the people, and social stability as had not  been seen for over 100 years. This indicated that the many years  of large scale and tempestuous class struggle between  antagonistic classes had basically ended, and that class  struggle was no longer the main contradiction in our society. At  the same time, because the task of social transformation had not  been entirely accomplished, because the old society had left  behind various things still producing influences, and especially  because China had a large population and was backward  economically and culturally, various nonantagonistic  contradictions among the people not only existed and emerged in  large quantities, but had become even more prominent under the  new situation. At that time there were such problems as the  problem of different views on the campaign to eliminate  counterrevolutionaries, land reform, and the socialist  transformation of industry and commerce, the problem of  different assessments of intellectuals' thought reform, the  problem of attitude toward agricultural cooperatives, the  problems of students' enrolling in schools of higher levels and  the placement of graduates, the problem of workers' wages and  benefits, the problem of differences in the lives of workers and  peasants, and the problem of party and government workers'  growing tendency to seek personal fame and interests, being  divorced from the masses, and committing the mistake of having a  bureaucratic way of doing things. In serious cases, there were  such manifestations as peasants' withdrawing from cooperatives,  workers' strikes, and students' strikes; many places saw  marches, demonstrations, and "disturbances," and the democratic  parties and nonparty figures had also expressed various views.  All those problems manifested themselves directly or indirectly  in the form of contradictions between the leader and the led,  that is, contradictions between the ruling Communist Party and  its cadres on the one hand and the masses of the people of all  sectors and strata who were being led on the other. Such a  situation shattered people's previously held simplistic  understanding of socialism--the naive illusions based on a  belief that all difficulties would be resolved as soon as the  social system was changed and that socialist society would be an  ideal realm with no contradictions, thereby confronting people  with the question of how to understand the new situations and  state of affairs.    The contradictions discussed above were mostly  contradictions  about economic interests of various groups of people amidst  social change. At the same time such social changes and changes  in interest relationships also manifested themselves in people's  thinking and ideology, mainly in the form of different views  held by young students, intellectuals, party member cadres, and  nonparty figures on various theoretical and practical issues;  such different views in turn manifested themselves in the form  of differences, discussions, and debates concerning political  views, academic views, and artistic styles in the scientific,  educational, and cultural spheres.    The second was the impact of the international environment,  mainly the impact of the changes in the Soviet Union. The 20th  CPSU Congress revealed a great deal of problems in the history  of several decades of proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet  Union. Firstly, there had been abnormal phenomena in inner-party  and social struggles, highly developed practices of personality  cult and autocratic and arbitrary rule, cruel factional  fighting, and the excessive expansion of the campaign to  eliminate counterrevolutionaries; secondly, there had been  ideological and theoretical dogmatism, arbitrary decisionmaking  in, and the dogmatic control of the scientific, cultural, art,  and other ideological spheres, and the practice of using  administrative or even dictatorial means to suppress debates  among different views and to inhibit the expression of different  schools and styles. All those policies and measures had been  adopted under the cover of the pseudo theoretical principles  that in socialist society the relations of production had been  in "complete congruence" with the productive forces and that the  "political and moral unanimity" of Soviet society had been the  motive force for social development. While the words of  congruence and unanimity had been used publicly in an extensive  way and while the idea that society had been full of  contradictions, mostly among the people, under the new situation  of socialism had been rejected, in practice very crude methods  had been used to resolve those contradictions. As a result,  various social contradictions had become ever more serious and  numerous, and exploded in a powerful manner at the opportunity  provided by the vigorous effort to expose Stalin at the 20th  CPSU Congress. In addition, there were contradictions among the  people as well as contradictions between ourselves and the  enemy, contradictions within and between the Soviet Union and  East European countries, internal contradictions in those  countries, and the impact of Western countries' infiltration  efforts. All those things stimulated and promoted each other,  resulting in very chaotic, complex, and tempestuous situations.  The concentrated manifestations were the Polish and Hungarian  incidents in 1956. Previously it had been believed that there  had been no contradictions, and then all kinds of contradictions  exploded together; consequently, many people in socialist  countries, including many leaders of Communist parties, were  stupefied and at a loss what to do. This showed that people  still lacked an understanding of the new social system,  socialism, and that especially in the Soviet Union Stalin's  metaphysics still had profound influence. At the same time, it  also reminded and prompted the Chinese Communists, first of all  Mao Zedong, who had just won the victory of socialist  transformation, to think about the relevant issues in a profound  manner.    How to understand the new domestic situation after the  establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary manner,  how to summarize the experience and lessons of the Soviet Union  accumulated over several decades, and how to analyze the various  international and domestic currents of thought after the 20th  CPSU Congress were issues about which Mao Zedong thought  repeatedly in 1956-1957. The overall theme of those issues was  the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship, and the  basic line of thought was to rely on and mobilize the force of  the masses of the people, to enhance the construction of  socialist democracy in the political, social, cultural, and  other spheres, and to consolidate the state power of the  people's democracy led by the working class, so as to promote  the development of socialist economic construction. In this  process, through mutual enlightening among, and repeated  considerations by leaders of the party, Mao Zedong gradually  formed two important ideas: The double-hundred policy and  contradictions among the people.    This issue and the issue of China's approach to socialist  construction were considered almost at the same time. When  delivering the speech, "On the Ten Major Relationships," Mao  Zedong also expressed many thoughts on political, social,  ideological, cultural, and other issues, in addition to issues  relating to economic construction. The many discussions of the  relationship between revolution and counterrevolution, the  relationship between right and wrong, and the relationship  between the party and those outside the party as well as the  discussions of learning from all nationalities and countries and  of the need to adopt an analytical attitude toward the Soviet  experience and Stalin's mistakes conducted under the topic of  the relationship between China and foreign countries all  involved the double-hundred policy and the issue of  contradictions among the people. Although no clear and concise  principles had been worked out, it could be seen that those  important ideas were in the process of being considered and  formed. When the center discussed "On the Ten Major  Relationships," Mao Zedong proposed that "letting a hundred  flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools contend" be made our  policy. Not only was this policy put forward, but lively  explanations of the policy were also made in view of the state  of affairs in the academic and cultural communities, especially  in view of the impact of dogmatic Soviet practices in our  country. Also, the policy was expounded systematically through  the article by Lu Dingyi, director of the CPC Central Propaganda  Department. In view of the mistakes of "Left" dogmatism which  suppressed the freedom of thought in the scientific and cultural  spheres, the idea of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and  letting a hundred schools contend" advocated the freedom of  independent thinking, the freedom of debate, the freedoms of  creation and criticism, and the freedoms to express one's own  views and to hold on to and maintain one's own views, and so on.  Thus, as soon as it was proposed, it was inevitably linked  inseparably to the concept of contradictions among the people  and to the idea of differentiating between two types of  contradictions. Whether at that time or at present, people  should not expect a proletarian statesman to allow absolute  freedom for all without any distinctions and limitations. We  ourselves and the enemy must be clearly differentiated from each  other politically, and there must be freedom among the people;  this proposition should be the inevitable conclusion. In the  second half of 1956, the Polish and Hungarian incidents took  place in succession; such complex situations occurring under the  socialist system prompted Mao Zedong to give more attention to  the issues of contradictions among the people and of  differentiating between the two types of contradictions. His  "Letter to Huang Yanpei," and the article "More on the  Historical Experience of Proletarian Dictatorship," written  under his guidance, both clearly put forward the concept of  contradictions among the people, asserting the need to clearly  differentiate between the nature of contradictions between  ourselves and the enemy and the nature of contradictions among  the people as well as the need to use different methods to  resolve the different contradictions. In February 1957, Mao  Zedong made the important speech, "On the Correct Handling of  Contradictions Among the People," at the Supreme Conference on  State Affairs, systematically expounding a series of theoretical  and policy issues concerning contradictions among the people and  the differentiation between the two types of social  contradictions, while putting the "double-hundred policy" in the  category of things involving the correct handling of  contradictions among the people.    As should be pointed out, despite the serious mistakes and  detours later in the process of implementation, the putting  forward of the two ideas of the "double-hundred policy" and of  contradictions among the people has had long-term significance  to shattering the traditional rigid understanding of socialist  society and to the establishment of scientific theory and  guiding policy based on realities with regard to the issue of  how the political, ideological, and cultural spheres should  promote socialist construction.    There has been a great deal of summarizing and expounding of  the ideas of the double-hundred policy and contradictions among  the people proposed by Mao Zedong. As far as the scientific  understanding of socialist society is concerned, as least the  following several points are creative and of strategic  significance.    First, the concept of contradictions among the people and  the  correct handling of contradictions among the people have become  the main themes of political life in the country. Mao Zedong  said that contradictions among the people were not a new issue,  but had been given less attention than now because of the  acuteness of the struggle between ourselves and the enemy in the  past. He based his views on historical development, changes in  the situation, and the Marxist principle that the cause of the  proletariat must rely on the broad masses of the people and must  practice democracy. Actually the putting forward of this concept  represented a new understanding of socialist society and further  development of the theory of proletarian dictatorship (assuming  the form of the people's democratic dictatorship in our  country). On the one hand, he not only analyzed the various  manifestations of contradictions among the people after the  establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary manner in  our country, but also made analyses based on principles of  dialectical materialism and historical materialism; that is, the  law of the unity of opposites and principles on basic  contradictions in society, to support the argument about the  root cause of the inevitably prolonged existence of such  nonantagonistic contradictions among the people, thereby  revealing the fundamental method for observing socialism (and  even communism in the future). On the other hand, he further  developed the ideas contained in the article, "On the People's  Democratic Dictatorship," that is, holding that the people's  democratic dictatorship was the combination of democracy for the  people and dictatorship over the reactionaries; especially,  drawing on lessons of the Soviet Union, he emphasized that  practicing democracy for the people had become an increasingly  widespread and prominent problem confronting the people's  democratic dictatorship, and the main theme of the country's  political life. This idea and another very important idea  emerged and were formed at the same time. That is, after the  establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary way, our  country faced the transitions from class struggle to the  struggle against nature, from revolution to construction, and  from the revolutions in the past to technological and cultural  revolutions. Since class struggle was no longer the main  contradiction and since economic construction had become the  focus of the party's and the state's work, functions relating to  democracy, such as using democratic means to resolve various  contradictions among the people as well as unifying the people's  interest and will, consolidating the unity among the people and  the unity of the country, and arousing the entire people's  enthusiasm for working hard to build socialism through the  system of democratic centralism had naturally become the main  functions of the state power of the people's democratic  dictatorship.    The second concerned the method for correctly handling  contradictions among the people, the method of  unity-criticism-unity. This was the natural extension of the  preceding issue. As the nature of contradictions among the  people and the nature of contradictions between ourselves and  the enemy were different, the methods of handling were also  different. In the process of exercising leadership over  revolutionary wars and revolutionary base areas, the Communist  Party of China not only accumulated rich experience with respect  to the struggle against the enemy, but also accumulated rich  experience with respect to the handling of inner-party  contradictions, internal contradictions within the revolutionary  army and ranks, and contradictions between groups of people in  the base areas, thereby producing the method of  unity-criticism-unity. After the nationwide victory, the use of  the method had been spread across society so as to handle  contradictions among the people at large. After putting forward  the concept of contradictions among the people, Mao Zedong  systematically summarized and explained the method in view of  the new situations and experience (including foreign experience  and lessons).    The third concerned the "double-hundred policy" in the  ideological and cultural spheres. The policy of "letting a  hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools contend" was  proposed earlier than the issue of contradictions among the  people was raised, and was later included in the general subject  of correctly handling contradictions among the people, becoming  an important component of the subject. Specifically, this policy  advocated letting a hundred flowers bloom in the sphere of arts  and letting a hundred schools contend in the scientific sphere,  and was a policy of promoting socialist scientific and cultural  prosperity. But its significance was more extensive and  profound, involving the issue of how the ruling Communist Party  should give play to Marxism's guiding role so as to exercise  leadership over the ideological sphere and even involving the  issue of what methods the Communist Party should use to lead the  country. This policy included allowing and guaranteeing  ideological and political freedoms and rights enjoyed by the  people at large, advocating independent thinking, free  expression, the freedoms to engage in scientific, literary, and  artistic creation and in criticism, discussion, and debate.  Thus, people could pursue the truth and develop science and  culture amid contending and competition, thereby continuously  forming ideological unity based on socialist and Marxist  principles. This policy also included the adoption of the method  of developing Marxism, defeating erroneous things, and  overcoming the impact of various erroneous and reactionary ideas  on the people through comparisons, competitions, and struggles  between the true, good, and beautiful and the false, evil, and  ugly as well as through discussion, criticism, and reasoning.  This policy was different from Stalin's crude dogmatic policy,  practiced in the Soviet Union, of exercising ideological and  political control through administrative coercive means. That  method not only could not improve and unify the people's  thinking, but would also inevitably lead to the gradual loss of  the right over leadership amid the superficial strengthening of  control; as a result, hidden behind the facade of formal  unanimity would be markets where various fallacious ideas would  spread. Thus, Mao Zedong believed that the "double-hundred  policy" should be a fundamental as well as long-term policy, but  not a temporary policy. He reduced the issue of whether to  adhere to the "double-hundred policy" to the issue of whether to  have "loosening" or "tightening." He said that there could be  two different methods, or policies, for leading our country,  that is, loosening and tightening. One of the two policies,  loosening and tightening, must be selected. We adopted the  policy of loosening because that was a policy conducive to the  consolidation and cultural development of our country. Of  course, compared with the past situation in the Soviet Union  when the crude and simplistic method was used, the use of the  policy of loosening would make it more difficult and complicated  to exercise the leadership of the Communist Party, to carry out  guidance based on Marxism, and to manage the state, but would be  an effective way to resolve contradictions and enhance  leadership.    The fourth concerned the matter of long-term coexistence and  mutual supervision. This policy was proposed, under the new  situation, to handle the relationships between the parties  formed in the history of our country. This policy was also put  forward earlier than the idea of contradictions among the  people, and can be said to have represented an important aspect  of the process of considering and forming the concept of  contradictions among the people. For, the relationships between  the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties as well  as the relationships between the different classes and strata  that they represented respectively were all in the category of  things involving contradictions among the people. In 1956, after  the basic completion of socialist transformation, there occurred  the issue of whether there should be the continued existence of  the many democratic parties which, formed during the War of  Resistance Against Japan and the struggle against Chiang  Kai-shek and composed of mainly members of the national  bourgeoisie and intellectuals of the national bourgeoisie, had  cooperated with the CPC for a long time. At that moment, on  behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Mao Zedong put forward the  policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." In "On  the Ten Major Relationships," he said: Is it better to have one  party or several parties? It now seems that it is better to have  several parties. Not only was such the case in the past, but  such can also be the case in the future, that is, long-term  coexistence and mutual supervision. In the 1957 speech on  contradictions among the people, he further explained that like  a person a party needed to hear different opinions. In addition  to accepting the supervision by the working people and the  masses of party members on the basis of considering those people  to be the main source of supervision, the Communist Party of  China, as the leadership force of our country, should also be  supervised by the democratic parties. Of course, such  supervision should be mutual supervision, that is, that parties  should make suggestions to each other and criticize each other  and should use the method of combining unity and struggle, the  method of unity-criticism-unity, to resolve contradictions  between them, so as to achieve unity based on socialism and to  arouse enthusiasm on the part of all sectors, thereby serving  socialism. The putting forward of this policy marked the  beginning of the forming of a party system with Chinese  characteristics. This policy was also different from the Soviet  Union's policy, and has been proven to be better for the party,  the people, and socialism in later years.    The final, and also the most important point concerned the  goals and ideas with regard to the political scene in socialist  society. In proposing such theories and policies as those  concerning contradictions among the people and the  double-hundred policy, Mao Zedong paid great attention to  dialectics. He once said that China should be a country where  dialectics would develop. The series of policies proposed by him  at that time were proposed mainly in view of Stalin's erroneous  practices which had been exposed in a preliminary way and in  view of the Soviet Union's ideological and cultural policies and  political system which had been highly centralized, rigid,  despotic, and lacking in democracy and freedom. Consequently the  focus was put on emphasizing handling well contradictions among  the people, emphasizing the development of the people's  democracy, protecting the people's freedoms and rights, and  making the party and state lively and vibrant. He hoped that  China's socialism would not be rigid, inflexible, and  frightening as in the case of the Soviet Union, and hoped that  through the implementation of the series of policies mentioned  above, literature and art as well as science and technology  would be prosperous and developed, that the party would always  maintain its vitality, and that the people's cause would be  prosperous. But he did not forget the other side of the matter.  Although contradictions among the people had emerged in large  quantities and had become the main theme of the country's  political life, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy  still existed, ideas and forces opposed to the CPC's leadership  and socialism still existed, and thus the dictatorship function  of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship had  not lost its role, as the new China had been established not  long ago. Although it was necessary to advocate and protect the  people's ideological and political freedoms and to develop  democracy among the people, China which was so large could not  exist without discipline or without centralization and unity.  Although various ideas and political views and various academic  schools and artistic styles could all manifest themselves and  could all "bloom" and "contend," Marxist guidance and education  should not be relaxed and the leadership role of Marxism must be  maintained. There were many such discussions. The most  concentrated discussion was his following statement made in July  1957: "Our goal is to build a lively political situation where  there are both centralization and democracy, both discipline and  freedom, and both unified wills and the ease of mind on the part  of individuals, so as to facilitate socialist revolution and  socialist construction, to make it easier to overcome  difficulties, to build up China's modern industry and modern  agriculture more quickly, and to make the party and state  strengthened and more able to stand turbulence and storms."    All this, from the relevant theories and general and  specific  policies to the political situation which would be created  through the implementation of those theories and general and  specific policies, that is, the target states of affairs of the  social, political, ideological, cultural, and other spheres of  the new socialist society that we wanted to build, provided an  encouraging direction and blueprint.</p>

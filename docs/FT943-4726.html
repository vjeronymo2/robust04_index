			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vodafone's 20% in Astec Vodafone Group, the mobile phone operator, has bought a 20 per cent share in Astec, an independent provider of mobile telephone services. Vodafone's shares were unaffected by the news, remaining at 200p. The total consideration is Pounds 16m, including loan capital advanced to Astec. Based in Cheltenham with 150 staff, Astec has some 50,000 subscribers nationwide which use both the Vodafone and Cellnet works. Vodafone and Cellnet, in which British Telecom has a stake, are the main players in the UK cellular telephone market. They are facing sharply increased competition following the launch of Mercury's One-to-One cellular network and Hutchison Telecom's Orange service. Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said the reason for the investment lay in Astec's skills in the provision of cellular telephone services. He said: 'We have always regarded service provision as one of the cornerstones of the UK mobile telephone market.' Mobile telephony is proving increasingly popular in the UK, with cellular telephone connections moving ahead of traditional fixed telephone links.</p>

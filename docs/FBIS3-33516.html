			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last year, after three years of recession, the  country's GDP reached the highest level in history. The accrued  total of goods and services produced by the country during that  year reached $446 billion, indicating a growth of 4.96 percent  compared to 1992. The expansion represents a real growth of  23.54 percent compared to the GDP of 1980, which closed the  expansionist cycle registered throughout the 1970's. During the  same period, however, the population increased 28.2 percent,  which means that per capita income fell 3.7 percent despite the  improvement of 2.97 percent registered last year compared with  1992. The growth of the 1993 GDP, compared with 1992, was  attributed to the recovery of the mean real productivity index,  which grew nearly 10 percent, the stability of employment  levels, and a 9-percent increase in industrial production.</p>

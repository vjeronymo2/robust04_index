			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (19): 'Our economy has tremendous potential' / Interview - Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto talks to Stefan Wagstyl and Farhan Bokhari Question from the Financial Times: Pakistan's economic policies have been praised by many observers, including foreign businessmen. But there is concern about the country's political stability. What assurances can you give? Benazir Bhutto: Pakistan went through a transition period in which there was tussle between democracy and dictatorship. That tussle ended last year in July 1993 when the military said they were not interested in intervening. Today in Pakistan we don't have a constitution in name, we have a constitution in fact, we don't have a democracy in name, we have a democracy in fact. The military is totally neutral now. It's not doing political work for the government, and its not doing political work for the opposition. Its doing military work, and military work is defending the frontiers of Pakistan. In the past, many (economic and social) schemes have come on paper but they have not been implemented, but that has been because there has been no popular base in the government. Now there's a government in Pakistan with a popular base. When there's a government with a popular base and grass roots support, it's in a better position to implement its programmes. There is also concern about law and order in Pakistan. We are addressing the problems of crime. We have inherited a very bitter legacy of sectarianism and of ethnic violence. We have introduced a socio-economic package for Karachi in an attempt to go to the genesis of the causes of resentment among the people of Karachi - that is the lack of transport and the lack of water and lack of sewerage. The government is continuing discussions with the MQM (the radical ethnic political movement in Karachi). But it's a problem that some people are involved in heinous crimes, such as kidnapping and murder. FT: What can be done about corruption in Pakistani politics? BB: We are committed to the elimination of corruption. That's why we have reduced through institutional means the scope for corruption. For example, we have tightened up our banking laws. In fact, we have declared a morale crusade to cleanse our society from this evil. FT: What are your economic aims and achievements? BB: We are a role model for the IMF . . . we have been able to provide very competent management for Pakistan's economic problems. We aimed at macro-economic stability because we believe that without macro-economic stability, micro-economic activity cannot take place at its full potential. We cut the fiscal deficit to 5.8 per cent of GDP last year and we aim for a 4 per cent deficit next year. Now if this deficit (cut) takes place, we can address the problem of inflation which is the most common problem which ordinary people in Pakistan complain about. We have also, in keeping with our IMF commitments, begun lowering peak import tariff rates, which will be lowered further as the years pass by . . . also we have sought to improve the taxation collection system. Much depends now on weather and crops but given good weather and good crops I think Pakistan will be in a good position by next year. So, if within 18 months (of taking office) we can bring real economic stability, we would feel proud of that achievement. It would allow Pakistan's economy to take off. I think Pakistan's economy has tremendous potential which needs to be realised. Agriculture is also an important concern as it employs 70 per cent of the people. We have increased the wheat support price to promote the growing of wheat and we are expanding edible oil cultivation to cut dependence on imports. We have imposed an agricultural tax on rich landlords. It was with much trepidation that we introduced the bill to be passed by the National Assembly, because our assembly is traditionally dominated by people from the feudal class. But by the grace of God it was passed. In the energy field we have suffered a tremendous electricity shortfall. . . so we announced an incentive package for foreign investors interested in setting up thermal plants. We have had tremendous response from the world over - and we hope that within five years we will have increased our energy output at least by 50 per cent if not more. The massive investment of USDollars 12bn, which we have attracted to Pakistan, will trickle down to the people in about two years. Some Pakistanis are very sceptical about foreign investment in Pakistan, but I think it is because they are not aware that the world has changed so dramatically. And in the 21st century we are going to be witnessing a global economy. FT: How will you deal with Pakistan's urgent social needs? BB: Well, I think that if one had to talk about a theme for the government that theme must surely be social revolution, because unlike past governments we have really concentrated on the social sector. This is also evident from the budgetary allocations made by my predecessors and by our government on sectors such as women's development, population planning minority affairs and other development works. We have set up a human rights cell in the ministry of the interior. . . we have also set up an elite anti-narcotics force which is headed by a serving general. . . we want to send a message that nobody is above the law. The government is committed to upholding the law irrespective of how high or influential any individual may be. Once we stabilise the economy and give a sound socio-economic basis to the society we hope to continue on to the larger political problems of how narcotics barons run mafias, how certain tribal chiefs run their own mafias with their own guards and their own laws, how sectarian groups, funded from God knows where, preach the politics of hatred and violence, and how ethnic parties preach hate at one another. FT: What are you doing to improve the lot of women? BB: I've seen myself that without economic independence, a woman cannot do anything. If my father had not left me with independent means, there's no way that the male members of my family would have permitted me to enter politics. They would have made sure that I didn't have funds or a home or space or a telephone to do a thing. So that's why I've always believed that the key to a woman's independence is economic independence. We have tried to make Pakistan a role model for other Moslem countries by introducing a system for women's rights in a Moslem society. We have done that by lifting the ban on women taking part in international sports, by setting up a women's development bank which has allowed a mushrooming of women-oriented small industries like garments, slimming boutiques, and beauty salons, in the urban areas of Pakistan. We have also done that by setting up women's police stations. In some Moslem societies, women are kept behind locked doors. Here in Pakistan women go knocking on doors investigating crimes. So it's a totally different society  -it's a society on the move and on the march. FT: There is international concern about Pakistan's nuclear programme and about its dispute with India over Kashmir. BB: As far as Pakistan's nuclear programme is concerned, it is a peaceful programme, but we have shown tremendous restraint in not exporting the technology, in not detonating a device and we feel that this restraint ought to be recognised. After all, if this restraint is not recognised then what is the use of restraint, especially when I took an opinion poll and 99 per cent people in Pakistan said that we should detonate, so I think it must be recognised that there are tremendous domestic pressures on the government. And if we have an international concern on non-proliferation, we must all work together to strengthen the goal of non-proliferation and not take a myopic view that results in something opposite taking place. I feel that root cause of tension in the sub-continent ought to be addressed, and that root cause is the political dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, a dispute which is recognised by international law.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lower yen rate right for growth Sir, Recent portfolio flows have highlighted the Japanese savings surplus and the savings deficit elsewhere in the world. If rising long bond yields are not to jeopardise western growth, Japanese capital outflows need to be resuscitated. Lower Japanese interest rates would have this effect, particularly if they also gave rise to the perception that the yen had peaked. Lower rates would not necessarily be inflationary because some indices show prices are still falling in Japan. Lower rates could also re-liquefy the banking system in the same way that they did in the US in the early 1990s. Together with a weaker currency, lower interest rates would stimulate growth and demand for US exports. Why, then, doesn't Japan cut interest rates and the US ameliorate demands for managed trade?

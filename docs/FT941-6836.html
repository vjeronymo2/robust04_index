			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Italy heads for the unknown Italy's general election on March 27 looks less like a poll in a member of the Group of Seven industrial countries than an electoral contest in one of the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. The end of the cold war has broken the mould of Italian politics and removed one of the buttresses that has sustained the Christian Democrats' continuous hold on power since 1948. The corruption scandals of the past two years have discredited the former political establishment. Italy's fresh start is, of necessity, a journey into the unknown. In the first election under an untried voting system, Italians are being asked to choose from a collection of new or renamed political parties grouped in uncertain alliances offering policies that are vague, opportunistic or both. Three main groups are bidding for votes. On the right, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, has linked his new Forza Italia movement with the populist Northern League and the renamed neo-fascists in the south. Attempting to hold the centre ground is the Popular Party, previously the Christian Democrats, in a tenuous pact with Mr Mario Segni, the champion of electoral reform. The linchpin of an alliance of eight left-wing parties (including residual die-hard Marxists) is the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the main victor of last autumn's local elections. Economic miracle Left and centre have shown alarm at last week's opinion poll giving Mr Berlusconi a clear lead. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, is trying to persuade the centre to join him in a 'stop Berlusconi' campaign. However, since the PDS and the centre do not trust each other sufficiently to put up joint candidates, the tactic may not be very effective. Profiting from his hold over an important section of the Italian media, as well as from his popular image as a self-made entrepreneur, Mr Berlusconi has sprayed the electoral battlefield with promises of an economic miracle. He has not, however, spelled out the evident reality that recovery will be conditional on further painful cuts in the budget deficit. Additionally, this Italianised Ross Perot has not resolved the contradiction of advocating radical free market policies in partnership with southern allies who urge continued generous subsidies to Italy's poorest regions. Strong continuity Mr Occhetto has the most detailed economic platform, pledging strong continuity with the 10-month-old administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy. If it gains power, however, the PDS's chances of enacting this responsible-sounding programme will be constrained by the need to maintain support from its far-left partners. Mr Occhetto knows that his party's past is a source of uncertainty both for right-wing voters and for the capital markets. The PDS leader spent last Friday in London telling bankers that a PDS win should not be a signal to sell the lira. The new electoral system, combining a mix of majority and proportional voting, has been designed to give Italy more stable coalitions and more cohesive government. In fact, in view of the low probability that any one of the competing alliances will gain an absolute majority, a clear-cut election result is unlikely. If the PDS alliance emerges as the strongest grouping, Mr Occhetto says he would favour Mr Ciampi staying on, either as prime minister or as a super-minister for economics. Evidently, a post-election period of political muddle may occur. This would greatly complicate the next government's task of pressing ahead with administrative reforms and wrestling with public debt of 114 per cent of GDP at a time of low growth and, possibly, rising international interest rates. Mr Ciampi certainly has the qualities to deal with these circumstances. From other candidates, Italians must hope for greater clarity as the campaign heats up.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HITTING AGAINST THE WIND;  </P> <P> TOROS' DARRELL CONNER POSTED RECORD STREAK IN UNFRIENDLY PARK  </P> <P> As his Cal State Dominguez Hills teammates took turns in the batting cage  before Thursday afternoon's game with visiting Cal State Los Angeles, Darrell  Conner toiled behind the Toro baseball dugout at a batting tee. In the distance  the clinks of aluminum bats hitting rawhide baseballs could be heard as the  overcast gave way to hazy sunshine.  </P> <P> On the Carson field, which is not kind to hitters, Conner had long since taken  his practice swings in the cage. Now he stood in front of a giant net and swung  his black aluminum bat at tennis ball after tennis ball.  </P> <P> "You can't ever get enough hitting," he said.  </P> <P> As the contact-hitting junior first baseman almost always does, he had arrived  early to get a little more practice. The tee, he said, "helps me get loose." It  is one of many devices, including vision training, that were instrumental in  his school-record, 19-game hitting streak earlier this season.  </P> <P> "I'm seeing the ball real well," he explained.  </P> <P> Conner's batting average, which has hovered around the .375 mark all season, is  exceptional for a hitter in this wind-whipped park, where right-handed batters  also fight the late-afternoon sun as it sinks into their eyes behind center  field.  </P> <P> "If Darrell played somewhere else, I would say he might be hitting .430 or  .450," said Toro Coach George Wing.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-3 Conner, who has hit only five home runs in his collegiate career,  agreed.  </P> <P> "This is a different kind of park. It's not a hitter's dream. It's a pitcher's  dream," he said. "I've hit balls in the gaps that I thought would get in, and  they didn't. You can't do too much in this park."  </P> <P> What does a line-drive hitter like Conner, who has struck out less than once in  each 10 at-bats, miss most when he plays here?  </P> <P> "Dongs," he said. "A few more dongs (home runs)."  </P> <P> Conner has just two home runs this year, but he is closing in on the school  record for most doubles in a single season.  </P> <P> Hitting, by itself, not just on the Toro field, "is the toughest thing to do,"  Conner said.  </P> <P> "You face a different guy each day. Each throws the ball differently. Some of  them have balls that move; others throw more straight. Another guy will have a  better deuce (curve ball)."  </P> <P> A native of Riverside, Conner transferred to Dominguez Hills from Orange Coast  College in Costa Mesa not because he loved the playing facilities, but because  he fell in love with the program and the social climate at the university.  </P> <P> Ironically, he was heavily recruited by UC Riverside, currently in a three-way  race for the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. Dominguez Hills, on  the other hand, entered this weekend's three-game set with Cal State Los  Angeles with a disappointing 13-19-2 mark and is likely to finish with the  school's third consecutive losing record.  </P> <P> Still, Conner insists he made the right choice.  </P> <P> "This was definitely the place to go for me," he said. "I could have gone to UC  Riverside and been playing for a championship. But I like it here. I have a lot  of confidence here."  </P> <P> This has been a frustrating season for Wing, the Toros' second-year coach, who  once was an assistant at Riverside. When the year began, he thought he had a  team, stacked with junior college transfers such as Conner, that would  challenge for the CCAA title. But entering the Cal State L.A. series, the Toros  were in a tailspin, having lost 10 straight conference games.  </P> <P> "It's been a matter of no consistency on this team," Conner said. "You hear a  lot about our lack of pitching, but the fact is, when the pitchers went out and  did well, the hitting let this team down."  </P> <P> Conner's record-setting performance, which ended a week ago when he lined out  three times at Cal State Northridge, has stood out despite the losing streak,  Wing said. The streak might have been even longer had Conner not missed four  games with a chipped bone in his left wrist, sustained in a rundown in a game  against Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> "I'm still not quite there yet," Conner said of his recovery, which included a  week wearing a cast. "Before the injury, I felt like no pitcher could get me  out. Now I miss some (pitches)."  </P> <P> Wing said Conner has still been a force at the plate.  </P> <P> "To be honest, he's only half what he was before," the coach said. "He may not  be driving the ball like he was, but he still hits the ball with pop to all  fields."  </P> <P> Wing has been a bit irritated lately by some of the things he has read and  heard about his team's performance.  </P> <P> "Darrell's performance has been overlooked and neglected," Wing said.  "Everybody -- the media, fans, and everyone else -- has harped on our won-loss  record. We have not won on a consistent basis, and because of that he has been  overlooked."  </P> <P> Unlike the rest of the team, Conner has been consistent.  </P> <P> "What I like about Darrell is his stable personality," Wing said. "He is  consistent in everything he does. He comes to practice with the same attitude  that he comes to play with."  </P> <P> Added assistant coach Eric Mihkelson, who calls the offensive signals for the  Toros: "He has such good work habits. I wish I had a lot more players like  him."  </P> <P> Conner was an outfielder at Orange Coast and at Riverside Poly High School,  where he was named most valuable player in the Citrus Belt League three  consecutive years.  </P> <P> Wing recruited him to play first base because he thought Conner was too slow to  be a college outfielder. In addition, the Toros were well fixed in the  outfield.  </P> <P> Conner didn't mind the switch, but during winter ball the Toros lost their  projected third baseman when he quit following a run-in with Wing. Conner moved  across the diamond to third as the season began, but he never got comfortable  there. After about a dozen starts at the corner, and nine errors, it became  clear to both Conner and Wing that the switch wasn't working.  </P> <P> "I would get my hits and my runs batted in, but then I was giving up a lot of  runs at third base," Conner said.  </P> <P> Since moving to first base, Conner has committed only two errors.  </P> <P> As for the team's poor showing, Conner isn't defensive.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating to all of us," he said. "Every guy out there is busting his  butt to win."  </P> <P> Conner would like to play in the Cape Cod League this summer, where aluminum  bats are forbidden. The clinks, then, would be replaced by cracks of bat on  ball.  </P> <P> A hit is a hit to Conner, no matter what the sound.  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: American songfest When does a British orchestra sound like an American orchestra? Hardly ever  -except when Leonard Slatkin conducts it; as he did the Philharmonia on Wednesday in an all-American programme, the first of their three contributions to the Festival of American Music on the South Bank. An immensely professional conductor with a sharp ear, Slatkin knows exactly how to obtain the sound he wants for this repertoire. William Schuman's unadvertised American Festival Overture, expertly rackety and hard-edged, made a rousing start, though it took the concert well beyond its advertised length. Its title must be a homage to Brahms, whose Academic Festival Overture was equally an unbuttoned exercise by a conservative craftsman, not unlike Sir William Walton. In fact, the Schuman rather shaded the Four Dance Episodes from Copland's Rodeo. Though the final Hoe-Down is a Copland evergreen, his lively ideas in the rest of the suite seem pasted together with routine crudity, as in most ballet suites. Next week the Third Symphony should represent him better. In Barber's Cello Concerto, Ralph Kirshbaum replaced the originally advertised soloist - and very well, with much flair and feeling. It was not his fault that Barber's romantic, sedulously neo-European idiom sounds more and more like a historical sport. Its expansive, 'heartfelt' melodic gestures sit badly with its short-breathed 'symphonic' workings-out: one is disinclined to believe any of them. Something analogous may eventually prove true of Leonard Bernstein's 1977 Songfesttoo, a mixed bag of songs for six singers that lurches wildly in different directions ' all of them familiar, from his own earlier music and/or from his favourite models. While the huge impact of Lenny-the-unbridled-musical-personality still reverberates, however, a personal work such as Songfest is infernally interesting. For a start, he chose his texts with the male lover for whom he briefly abandoned his wife. Thus we get not only mordant reflections on marriage and passion from Mistress Anne Bradstreet, Edna St Vincent Millay, Gertrude Stein and the respectable Beats - Ferlinghetti, Corso  - but also Langston Hughes - black, gay and narcissistic - and Walt Whitman in 'rough male kiss of blankets' mood. Here that song went to the baritone Thomas Hampson, eloquently straight, instead of the prescribed bass: presumably because Brian Bannatyne-Scott was one of two last-minute stand-ins of the solo sextet. In the Stein duet, however, B-S. and Faye Robinson made cleverly wry partners. Cynthia Clarey struck bright character in her every number; Jean Rigby and young Salvatore Champagne, respectively the lowest and highest voices among their sexes here, seized their opportunities to good effect. How much Songfest amounts to is still unassessable, until Bernstein's own psychodramas have become dry archive material. Now, we seem to hear Lenny everywhere: in the West Side Story offshoots, in the sentimental Mahlerian devices of his Whitman setting, even in the opening mock-chorale a la Stravinsky.

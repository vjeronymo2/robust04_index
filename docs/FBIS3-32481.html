During his meeting with Amorim, the prospects of  strengthening bilateral ties between both nations were discussed.    Lage had lunch immediately afterward with Amorim and  personalities from the Brazilian political and economic arena,  among which were Inocencio Oliveira, president of the Chamber of  Deputies and Alexis Stepanenko, planning minister.    This was the second day of the Cuban guest's official visit  to Brazil. After arriving at the capital from Sao Paulo, he met  with a group of parliamentarians, and friends of Cuba, chaired  by Deputy Waldir Pires.    The conversations with the group were deemed fraternal, and  during these talks information was given to the parliamentarians  on Cuba's economic situation "and the efforts of the Cuban  people and government to resolve the difficulties imposed from  abroad," according to a source close to the visiting delegation.    During the afternoon of 3 February, the delegation met with  Treasury Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, with whom matters  of bilateral interest were broached.    Lage's agenda concluded tonight with a reception given by  the  Cuban Embassy which was attended by ministers, Latin American  ambassadors, businessmen, and political party leaders.    Lage is scheduled to meet with Brazilian President Itamar  Franco on 4 February.</p>

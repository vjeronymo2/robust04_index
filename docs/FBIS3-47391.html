			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] THE Board of Investment (BOI) is willing to  help Cambodia screen Thais wanting to invest in Cambodia,  secretary-general Sataphon Kawitanon said yesterday.    Mr Sataphon made the offer on the eve of Prime Minister  Chuan  Likphai's visit to Cambodia this week.    The 56 Thai businessmen who will accompany the Premier on  the  three-day visit will participate in a seminar on regulations and  prospects for trade and investment in Cambodia.    During the visit, the Foreign Ministry will sign an  agreement  to set up a joint commission on bilateral relations.    Mr Sataphon said the seminar is being held by the Cambodian  Government in cooperation with the Thai Embassy and the BOI to  attract Thai investors to Cambodia. The Government was formed  in November last year.    It will give Thai investors "who have good intentions" an  opportunity to learn more about new investment regulations in  Cambodia.    He said he hoped the Prime Minister's visit would strengthen  relations between Thailand and Cambodia and result in more  investment cooperation.    He said the BOI is aware of Cambodia's concern about "Thai  opportunists" who are taking advantage of Cambodians. He hoped  that a new group of Thai investors will replace the bad ones.  [passage omitted]    According to the Thai Commercial Counsellor's Office in  Phnom  Penh Thais had invested in 617 projects in Cambodia as of  October last year. Hotels accounted for most of the projects,  71, followed by 64 banking projects.    In the first quarter of last year, there were 589 foreign  projects, of which Thais had 21.4 percent, Cambodians 16.1  percent, Singaporeans 13 percent, Hong Kong people 11.9 percent,  and joint ventures between foreigners and Khmer accounted for  1.4 percent.    Mr Sataphon said the BOI has not yet signed agreements with  the new National Investment Committee on investment cooperation  because the Cambodian Government is improving its investment law  and restructuring.    He said that if the Cambodian Government wants the BOI to  help screen Thai investors, it is willing to do so.    Thai businessmen should explore partnerships with Cambodians  and long-term investments to benefit both sides, he said.    The BOI and Cambodia's investment agencies have closely  cooperated on investment for a long time. Cambodia sent  officials to study the management and investment law of the BOI  last year, and Phnom Penh is planning to offer investment  privileges through a similar agency to Thailand's BOI.    The 56 businessmen who will accompany Mr Chuan include  Ital-Thai Development Corp chairman Chaiyut Kanasut, C. Thong  Phanit Ltd Part &amp; Group chairman Dilok Mahadamrongkun, Samat  Corporation Plc managing director Thawatchai Wilailak, Chinnawat  International Co chairman Phaibun Limpaphayom, and executives of  Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Saha Phattana Phibun, PTT  Exploration and Production Plc, 3M Thailand and Seagate  Technology Thailand.    The BOI said the businessmen are interested in construction,  hotels and tourism, cold storage and fisheries, furniture and  wood products, telecommunications, jewellery cosmetics, real  estate, rubber, steel, trading companies, automobiles, finance,  household goods and electronics.</p>

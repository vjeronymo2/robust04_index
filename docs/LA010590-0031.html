			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RIVAL SPRAY PAINT ARTISTS PLAN LEGAL WALL-TO-WALL SHOWDOWN;  </P> <P> GRAFFITI: LIKE '60S FLOWER POWER AND '70S PUNK, HIP-HOP IS BOPPING RIGHT INTO  MAINSTREAM CULTURE. ITS AEROSOL MURALISTS EDGE TOWARD THE CENTER.  </P> <P> Michelangelo had the Sistine Chapel. On this early Sunday morning, "Slick," a  22-year-old graffiti artist from Baldwin Park, has the back wall of the Levitz  furniture warehouse.  </P> <P> He also has an aluminum ladder for those hard-to-reach spots, a plastic milk  crate stuffed with cans of spray paint and an artistic vision.  </P> <P> "The can is my brush," Slick says, standing knee-deep in weeds on a desolate  strip of land between the Levitz warehouse and the Los Angeles River. "The wall  is my easel and canvas."  </P> <P> His latest work-in-progress is an enormous Superman in vivid reds, blues and  flesh tones. Cape flying, Superman clutches a goofy-looking human figure with  one hand while winding up for a punch (kazow!) with the other.  </P> <P> But more than artistic expression is at stake here.  </P> <P> Slick is warming up to challenge "Hex," another graffiti artist who has been up  on Melrose Avenue, flaunting his talents by spray-painting a huge Batman. Slick  has vowed to "take out" the archrival he calls "Hoax." This weekend, starting  today, the two plan to battle for the title of graffiti king, dueling with cans  of spray paint at this industrial site.  </P> <P> "I'm going to make a Super-Slick, dedicated to dissing him, crushing his bat,"  Slick says. "Ever since he came to town he's been irritating me."  </P> <P> Spray-painting a wall without permission is still illegal, of course. Those  convicted face fines of up to $50,000 and a maximum prison term of one year.  And property owners must clean up graffiti or face fines of up to $1,000 and a  maximum jail term of six months.  </P> <P> But some authorities are beginning to draw a sharp distinction between the  growing number of "aerosol artists" who paint graffiti-inspired murals and the  street gang members who write their names -- in a practice called "tagging" --  on everything from RTD buses to schoolyard walls.  </P> <P> "We're seeing more and more of those big, nice-looking ones in 3-D and  different colors. They're different from our gang graffiti," said Detective  Robert Contreras, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department gang  information section.  </P> <P> In some cases, public agencies and private firms are even considering setting  aside wall space for the aerosol artists, providing they agree to pressure  others to stop tagging -- which more sophisticated artists consider unsightly.  </P> <P> The dilemma is that, although some authorities believe the young artists need a  place to paint, "If they don't get permission, it's still against the law,"  Contreras warns.  </P> <P> Welcome to the world of graffiti art. With one foot in the police station and  the other in the art gallery, the phenomenon, which started in New York in the  1970s, is hot today in Los Angeles, where the city's horizontal sprawl and  abandoned industrial spaces provide countless opportunities to leave one's  mark.  </P> <P> It's all part of "hip-hop," a subculture that blends elements of rap music,  skateboarding, underground dance clubs and graffiti art. In the past year, Los  Angeles has become the acknowledged center of hip-hop. There is even "Ghetto  Art," a publication that is subtitled "Los Angeles' Only Aerosol Newspaper."  </P> <P> Aerosol artists say they are motivated by a desire to create, not destroy.  Their crews -- groups that spray-paint together -- are highly organized, with  their own codes and styles. Whereas a few admit to being current or former gang  members, most see graffiti as a positive way to channel pent-up energy.  </P> <P> "We make a real point of saying we're not affiliated with any gang," says  "Frame," a friend of Slick, who sometimes "bombs" -- paints -- with him. Frame  says up to 90% of the estimated 500 or more local graffiti artists are just  creative kids.  </P> <P> The police, however, say up to 80% of the city's graffiti are still scrawled by  gang members and delinquents.  </P> <P> Whatever its motives, hip-hop, like '60s flower power and '70s punk, is bopping  right into the mainstream culture. Its influence has already seeped into  fashion, design, film, music, dance and billboard advertising.  </P> <P> "You look at some of the lettering used in advertising today, and you see it  came directly from graffiti art," said Jim Prigoff, a self-styled graffiti  expert whose book "Spray Can Art" has sold 55,000 copies.  </P> <P> If L.A. is the center of hip-hop, Slick is one of the key players.  </P> <P> Last May, he and his partner "Risk" walked away with first prize at "Street  '89," an International Street Art Festival held in East Yorkshire, England. The  duo, who call themselves The Aerosolics, were asked by New York graffiti artist  "Vulcan" to represent the United States. Their 20-by-6-foot mural beat out  graffiti art from Denmark, Italy and nine other countries.  </P> <P> The dynamic duo aren't given to modesty. "Risk rules the lettering, and no one  can burn my characters," says Slick, whose given name is Richard Wyrgatscht. He  stands more than six feet tall. His head is shaved, except for one long black  strand that hangs down over his forehead. He keeps a large, black scorpion  named Bertha.  </P> <P> But far from being a gang member, Slick is a middle-class guy whose father is a  policeman in Hawaii. His partner, Risk, lives in an upper middle-class Westside  suburb. Graffiti art has definitely gone uptown since primitive man first  scrawled on a cave wall. Today's subculture heroes, including The Aerosolics,  come equipped with faxes, pagers and Day-Glo business cards to promote  themselves.  </P> <P> What puts Slick ahead of the pack is his talent at " 'piecing" -- short for  creating masterpieces. Unlike most other youths painting the town, Slick is a  trained artist who could parlay his graffiti art into a career, say those  familiar with his work.  </P> <P> At Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, where he once studied illustration,  Slick showed "tremendous potential," said Philip Hays, chairman of Art Center's  illustration department. "The guy can draw beautifully in a traditional sense.  He's a really good draftsman."  </P> <P> Hays sees a parallel between Slick's work and that of Keith Haring, the New  York East Village graffiti artist who spray-painted his way to fame in the  1970s on the city's subways. Slick is part of the second generation, and his  3-D figures have spawned a host of copycat artists, Hays said.  </P> <P> Slick got his start in Hawaii, painting petroglyph-inspired figures while in  high school. But after seeing "Wild Style," a movie about New York rap and  graffiti artists, he traded in his paintbrush for a can and began to spray.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he moved to Los Angeles to attend the Art Center. In between  drawing Michelangelo-inspired nudes, he honed his cartoon characters on the  walls of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He dropped out of Art Center in late 1989. Now, primarily supported by his  parents and friends, he weighs whether he should go back. There are so many  options. He hears that the Japanese might pay up to $4,000 for hand-painted  leather jackets emblazoned with his characters.  </P> <P> Unlike walls, which get painted over, jackets are permanent. And Slick is  enough of an artist to be attracted to the idea of permanence.  </P> <P> He won't even call his work graffiti. "We don't use the G word," Slick said  solemnly. "That confuses people."  </P> <P> And he is giving legitimate art galleries a try.  </P> <P> His first big break came this fall, when the Pico House Galleria in downtown  Los Angeles included one of his works in a graffiti art exhibition. Although  Slick didn't sell anything, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for the  first time signaled an interest in Los Angeles graffiti art when it picked up a  work by an artist named "Mondoe," said museum spokeswoman Angela Escobar.  </P> <P> But Slick worries about the future and that "there's so much negativity  associated with a can."  </P> <P> To squelch some of those bad feelings, Slick and his friends sometimes get  permission now before they whip out their spray cans.  </P> <P> On this recent Sunday, Slick and Frame had gotten the thumbs up from Levitz,  which has long fought a losing battle with "the ugly kind of graffiti," said  Anita Tellez, operations manager for the store, located on the Los  Angeles-Glendale city line.  </P> <P> "So far, we've been pretty pleased; they've put up some interesting artwork,"  Tellez said of the building's rear walls, which are covered with 'pieces and  great big swirling 3-D names with characters or skylines sprouting from them.  </P> <P> In between slugs from a bottle of mineral water, Slick wields his spray can  like a paintbrush. His arm makes large arcs as he shades in five different  colors to show Superman's muscle tone. A few more deft strokes and a torso  emerges, twisted and tortured, reminiscent of the German Expressionism of Egon  Schiele.  </P> <P> Slick and Frame are putting up a message as well. In big, bold letters it says:  "PLEASE RESPECT. NO TAGGING."  </P> <P> Tagging "makes the rest of the neighborhood look all thrashed," Slick said,  sounding for a moment like a peevish burgher. "Most property owners, they don't  mind the mural art, but when kids write their names they get mad."  </P> <P> Still, even artistic graffiti frequently is on the wrong side of the law. Many  artists admit they steal their paint, which runs $4 a can over the counter.  </P> <P> And not everybody draws distinctions between tagging and mural art. "It's all  graffiti to us," says Detective Roger Mora, a spokesman for the Los Angeles  Police Department. "If it goes up on a privately owned wall, it's going down."  </P> <P> Graffiti artists concede that what they do is illegal. But they see themselves  as outlaws, taking risks to make an artistic statement.  </P> <P> "Part of graffiti art is getting up, getting fame in the most outrageous places  possible, places that are illegal," Frame said. "Whether people accept it or  not, to become kings on the street, to get fame, not with the media or the art  world, but with the street, with our peers."  </P> <P> But these young people also know that a dead end often lies at the bottom of a  can of spray paint. Only one in a million of them will make it into the  mainstream art world.  </P> <P> "You should stay in school," one onlooker tells Slick. "Yeah," he responds.  "Knowledge is king."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT IT MEANS  </P> <P> A brief dictionary of "hip-hop" and graffiti art slang  </P> <P> Writer -- One who practices graffiti art.  </P> <P> Crew -- A loosely organized group of writers.  </P> <P> Tag -- The signature of a writer, crew or gang, done in marker or spray paint.

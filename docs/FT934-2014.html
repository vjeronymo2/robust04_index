			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: US policy albatross turns into an eagle - Clinton keeps eye on broader goal / United States For their staff, all presidents mostly walk on water. Thus it was not surprising to hear Mr Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser, portray both the successful resolution of the Uruguay Round and the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement a month earlier as the vindication of President Bill Clinton's determination to change some of the underlying principles of the way the US looks at the world outside. First, he said, both demonstrated that 'economic security is now on the front burner of American foreign policy'. Second, they proved what Mr Clinton had been preaching in last year's campaign, that the walls between US domestic and foreign policy were going to be broken down. Six short weeks ago there appeared the measurable risk that trade policy would be the albatross around the neck of US foreign relations, not the eagle leading it upwards. The dark scenario had, in order: Nafta falling to defeat in Congress, leading to an embarrassing Asian summit, followed by an inability to break the Uruguay Round impasse mostly because of disagreements with the European Union, spilling over into an acrimonious Nato summit next month - a sequence in which the absence of US leadership would be widely condemned. None of this has come to pass because the Clinton administration has shown itself, in the crunch, willing to cut a deal, even when it said it would not, in the pursuit of the broader goal. It was true of Nafta, which 60 per cent of the Democratic party opposed, and of the Round. Much of the individual credit on the US side must lie with Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative and negotiator extraordinaire, who can never again be accused by sniffy Europeans and Washington trade experts of not knowing his brief. But he takes his instructions from his president - and, on both Nafta and the Round, Bill Clinton was intimately involved in much of the fine print. This produces something of a paradox. A Democratic president, a suspected mercantilist who is the titular head of a party with protectionist inclinations, can claim credit for completing the Round where his two Republican free trading predecessors failed. He still has to get the Round approved by Congress, probably next spring, but the lessons of the uphill Nafta campaign have been well learned and the selling has already started. Opposition can be expected from the anti-Nafta coalition, led by unions and environmentalists, and from some industries dissatisfied with the Round, but the political prognosis at this stage is generally favourable, especially now Congressman Richard Gephardt, Democratic majority leader, has been reassured by the anti-dumping agreement. Yet, equally paradoxically, success does not resolve many of the doubts about the direction of US trade policy. Indeed, it may even increase them. If France has been able to claim success for its insistence on degrees of protection, then the tight Clinton trade team, also now riding high, is unlikely to be susceptible to theoretical arguments that its pursuit of what it considers to be 'fair' or 'managed' or 'results-oriented' trade is wrong-headed. Whatever was ceded for good tactical reasons in the final negotiations - reformulating Blair House, agreeing to disagree on audio-visual trade and financial services - does not mean the US intends to be less muscular in its approach. Nor has it surrendered many of the tools, in the shape of US laws, to make its goals stick. It will continue to press, after the agreed interval, for greater access for its banks and brokers, especially in Japan and other Asian countries. Having raised the stakes so high, it cannot again disappoint its Hollywood backers by not seeking a better arrangement with the European Union in audio-visual trade. It will still lean heavily on countries such as Japan to obtain bigger market-opening initiatives for a wide range of goods and services, and only partly because there are lobbies in Washington with reservations about what was achieved in the Round. To be fair, Mr Clinton has never deviated from his promise to pry open foreign markets for US exporters. It was the subject of one of his earliest campaign speeches and he has consistently expressed the same view ever since. As he has frequently put it, the choice is simple - either 'compete or retreat.' Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, repeatedly says that he considers himself and the US diplomatic service to be representatives of US commercial interest. It may be ironic that trade policy, which featured, against some expectations, so little in last year's presidential elections, should be the area in which President Clinton has achieved so much in his first year. He is unlikely to rest on these laurels, above all not now that the Japanese trade surplus is showing signs of declining for the first time in three years.</p>

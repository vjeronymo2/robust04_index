			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Emergency powers hint by Yeltsin PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday gave the strongest hint yet he was considering some form of emergency rule in an effort to break the impasse with conservative forces over Russian political and economic reform. If he could get no agreement on a division of powers during a special Congress of People's Deputies likely to be held in a week's time he would call his own plebiscite to establish whether the president or parliament had supremacy . At a meeting of the group 'Democratic Choice' he appeared to accept that a constitutional referendum, which requires the agreement of parliament, would not be possible. Parliament appears set to repudiate the agreement it made with him in December to hold such a referendum in April. He admitted that, 'constitutionally, (the plebiscite) would not carry great weight but at least it would clarify for everyone whom the people support and which way we should go'. Then, in a heavy hint of authoritarian action, he said that should no agreement be forthcoming even after the plebiscite, 'there is a final option which I don't want to talk about. I don't think things will go that far and I hope that they don't. We should respect the constitution, but if conservatives use extreme measures to destroy Russia, we must use other ways to save democracy and reform'. The president ended his speech at that point without spelling out the meaning of 'other paths'. Mr Lev Ponomarev, a leader of the Democratic Russia movement, said after the meeting that he and his colleagues supported Mr Yeltsin's intention to 'act decisively' and said that 'it is his duty to act to safeguard order in a pre-putsch situation'. As proof of his 'pre-putsch' assertion, Mr Ponomarev pointed to appeals to army officers in the weekly Den - an influentail organ of the hard right opposition forces - to create 'underground organisations', and to the calls by hard left and right deputies for direct confrontation with the constitutional power. 'If an emergency situation is declared, then Democratic Russia would want to influence the government to preserve democratic procedures during that period and for elections as soon as possible after it,' he said. Hard-line deputies are considering mounting yet another attempt to impeach Mr Yeltsin at the special congress. Mr Yona Andronov, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on international Affairs, said yesterday the move would gather more support than a similar effort last December, when more than 300 deputies registered their approval. Although Mr Yeltsin's comments were veiled, his speech suggests he now sees decreasing room for agreement, and increasing necessity for a swift severing of the noose. A further indication of this tension was the adoption by the Praesidium of the parliament on Monday of a motion which laid out the procedure for parliament declaring emeregncy rule - a procedure which would strip the President of all effective powers. The draft motion still has to be carried by parliament, but indicates the mood of the parliamentary leadership. Mr Yeltsin's speech was accompanied by the publication of an interview in the Communist daily Pravda, showing a rather tetchy president grudgingly conceding that some communists could be pro-reform and saying he would talk to their leaders, as to all other party leaders, in a bid to get a general agreement on reform and constitutional change. That he gave an interview at all may be a recognition of the fact that the Party now claims 500,000 members.</p>

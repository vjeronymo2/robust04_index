			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Poland puts off pensions move The Polish government is putting off until 1996 the indexing of pensions to inflation rather than wages growth. The unpopular move, planned for next year, would have cut pensions for affected 7m Poles before next autumn's presidential elections. The decision upsets the budget projections of Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, finance minister, and the government's promise to the International Monetary Fund. The country's central bank yesterday reported high money supply figures in August, for the second month running. Taken with higher than expected inflation this summer, said Mr Witold Kozinski, the bank's deputy head, they ruled out interest rate cuts. The finance ministry is pressing for a 1 per cent cut in annual interest rates to reduce the debt service burden on the budget.</p>

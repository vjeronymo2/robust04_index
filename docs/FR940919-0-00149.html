			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A 36-hectare (14 acre) vernal pool located at Skunk Hollow in Riverside County containing a population of the vernal pool fairy shrimp likely will be adversely affected by urban development and possibly agricultural conversion (Art Davenport, Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1994; Joseph Jolliffe, Riverside County Planning Department,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). The Rancho Bella Vista residential project would impact this vernal pool and, along with other major roadways, also impact the surrounding watershed (Joseph Jolliffe,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). Skunk Hollow also contains a population of the Riverside fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Streptocephalus woottoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), an endangered species (58 FR 41384). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of rapid urbanization, several highway projects are proposed that may affect the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Vernal pools in the Sacramento area inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp would be affected adversely by the proposed widening of State Highway 16 in Sacramento County. The State of California has proposed to extend State Highway 505 from Vacaville to Collinsville in Solano County; this project directly and/or indirectly would impact vernal pools inhabited by the Conservancy fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (C. Goude, pers. comm., 1993). Vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp may be affected by improvements to Highway 70 near Gridley in Butte County (Chris Collison, California Department of Transportation, pers. comm., 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agricultural conversion poses a widespread threat to remaining vernal pools in the Central Valley. Sites containing fairy shrimp near Pixley in Tulare County and Haystack Mountain in Merced County are pockets of privately owned habitat remnants threatened by surrounding agricultural operations (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). A 148-hectare (365 acres) site with vernal pools adjacent to State Highway 41 north of Fresno in Fresno County that likely contained the vernal pool fairy shrimp was disced and graded in 1992 (Dames and Moore 1992). Two sites with vernal pools in the Sacramento Valley recently were plowed or disced and seeded with winter wheat, apparently in preparation for future urban development (C. Goude, pers. comm., 1993). Almond and fruit orchards in Stanislaus, Madera, and Fresno Counties continued to be planted in habitat suitable for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (J. King pers. comm. 1993; K. Geer and J. Browning, U.S.F.W.S., pers. obs. 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water supply/flood control activities also generally present a degree of disturbance to affected pools that would preclude survival of any substantial fraction of the populations. The timing, frequency, and length of inundation of the vernal pool habitat are critical to the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp; any substantial hydrologic change in these factors adversely affect the four species. Diversion of watershed runoff feeding the pools can result in premature pool dry-down before the life cycle of these animals is completed. The three species of fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp also are intolerant of flowing water that washes away the egg bank. Supplemental water from outside the natural watershed into vernal pools can change the habitat into a marsh-dominated or a permanent aquatic community that is unsuitable for the four species of vernal pool shrimps. The modification of vernal pool areas to create artificial reservoirs, such as the Modesto Reservoir and Turlock Lake in Stanislaus County, have led to the extirpation of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp population that was known to occur in the vernal pools where these reservoirs now lie (J. King, pers. comm., 1993). Vernal pool watershed areas have been reduced by conversion of uplands to paved or grass-turf surfaces, by damming of swales caused by road construction, or other construction activities. Physical barriers, such as roads and canals, unsuitably deepen a vernal pool upstream of a barrier, and can isolate a fairy shrimp or vernal pool tadpole shrimp population from a portion of its aquatic habitat. Surface runoff, including non-point runoff, is altered by disturbance from trenching, grading, scraping, off-road vehicles, intensive livestock grazing, or other activities that change amounts, patterns, and direction of surface runoff to ephemeral drainages. Presence of summer water also affects the hydrologic pattern. Introduction of water during the summer disrupts the life cycles of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp by subjecting them to greater levels of predation by animals requiring more permanent sources of water. Increased water also converts vernal pools to unsuitable marsh habitat dominated by emergent vegetation (e.g., cattails). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct and associated indirect impacts from the proposed Los Vaqueros Project, a water-storage project in the Kellogg Creek watershed of eastern Contra Costa County, would adversely impact two vernal pool complexes that support the highest diversity of fairy shrimp in the State (California Department of Fish and Game 1983). The rock pools in this area are inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the longhorn fairy shrimp (John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). Proposed construction of a major roadway, high-pressure natural gas and petroleum pipelines, and 230,000 kV electrical transmission lines at the Los Vaqueros Reservoir site would adversely affect these species (Jones and Stokes Associates 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several proposed utility projects have the potential to affect all of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. For example, the Pacific Gas Transmission Company_Pacific Gas and Electric natural gas pipeline project extending from the Canadian border along the west side of the Sacramento Valley to Fresno County has adversely impacted a number of vernal pools containing the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpool shrimp (Federal Regulatory Energy Commission 1991; Arnold 1990; C. Nagano, pers. obs., 1992 and 1993). The Service has issued a conference opinion to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on a portion of this project that will adversely impact the vernal pool fairy shrimp; however, the applicant has indicated the mitigation measures will not be implemented if the species is not listed (John Cassady, PGT&hyph;PG&amp;E Pipeline Expansion Project,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Off-road vehicle (ORV) use also imperils fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp inhabiting vernal pools (Bauder 1986, 1987). ORVs cut deep ruts, compact soil, destroy native vegetation, and alter pool hydrology. Fire fighting, security patrols, military maneuvers, and recreational activities cumulatively have damaged vernal pool habitats in many areas (Bauder 1986, 1987). In Solano County, an off-road vehicle park adjacent to the Jepson Prairie Reserve owned by the Nature Conservancy could adversely impact populations of the Conservancy fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other secondary impacts associated with urbanization include disposal of waste materials into habitat for the four species included in this final rule (Bauder 1986, 1987). Disposal of concrete, tires, refrigerators, sofas, and other trash adversely affects these animals by eliminating habitat, disrupting pool hydrology or, in some cases, through release of toxic substances. Dust and other forms of air or water pollution from commercial development or agriculture projects also may be deleterious to these animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Filling of vernal pool wetlands without authorization from the Corps also poses a threat to these species (Tricia Richards, Sacramento County Planning and Community Development Department,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1991: D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). In Stanislaus County, a site with 61 hectares (150 acres) of vernal pool habitat that was potentially inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp was converted to irrigated pasture in 1990 (Martha Naley, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1991). A 112 hectare (275 acre) site containing vernal pool and swale habitat for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the Jepson Prairie area in Solano County was destroyed by discing in October 1992 (C. Nagano and J. Knight, pers. obs., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

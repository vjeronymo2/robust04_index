			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk, 9 Apr -- An ITAR-TASS correspondent has  just been informed at the Northern Fleet's press center about an  incident that is terrible in terms of its cruelty and  pointlessness. A serviceman who is serving in a military  counter-intelligence subunit of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service, killed four Northern Fleet sailors and wounded three  last night. The criminal has taken four crew members of a  vessel hostage and is now on board the vessel. Representatives  of the Fleet's command and of the Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service are negotiating with him.</p>

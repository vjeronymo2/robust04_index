			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, presidential special </F> representative and deputy foreign minister, by correspondent  Boris Kalyagin; place and date not given; program entitled: "The  Bosnian Knot" -- recorded]    [Kalyagin] President Yeltsin's message has helped to change  the situation for the better. The Bosnian Serbs have started  the mass withdrawal of their heavy equipment from Sarajevo. In  exchange the Russian command must transfer to Sarajevo 400  paratroopers from its battalion, which is part of the  international peacekeeping forces in Croatia. Russia's  initiative has already been welcomed by France and Italy.    The agreement with the Serbs was achieved by Vitaliy  Churkin,  special representative of the Russian president and deputy  foreign minister, who in these past few days has been plying  continuously between Geneva, Sarajevo, Belgrade, Pale, and who  today at last arrived in Moscow by plane.    [Churkin] Zagreb and Skopje also need mentioning in order to  attain a full picture.    [Kalyagin] Zagreb and Skopje. So this is your first  interview back on Russian soil. Vitaliy Ivanovich, what has  been achieved is a real breakthrough. How, after all, did you  manage to achieve this?    [Churkin] Three elements of our proposal undoubtedly brought  a decisive influence to bear on the Serbs. First, the fact that  Russia made a request to them. The words, request by Russia,  made a literally stunning impression on them. Second, the fact  that the letter which I took with me to Belgrade and Pale was  signed by President Yeltsin. And third, the fact that this  letter contained an obligation by the Russian side, by the  Russian Federation, to send to Sarajevo its contingent which is  part of the UN peacekeeping forces, so that the Serbs could have  some guarantee for their peace of mind, and the fact that the  new balance which is being created in the area of the city as a  result of the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from Sarajevo, which  the Serbs have now promised, is not upset by the actions of the  other side.    [Kalyagin] Have you any misgivings that this agreement could  all the same be violated by some provocation?    [Churkin] There could of course be a provocation,  provocations. There could be some ill-considered actions on the  part of the Army of the Bosnian Government. However, for this  it is necessary to monitor the situation very closely. At  present global attention is already riveted to Sarajevo. Of  course a fairly considerable UN contingent is already there. So  that it seems to me that this danger is nevertheless not all  that great. Our country is ensuring that the Serbs fulfill  their obligations. The kind of obligations we received in  essence signify a resolution of the crisis, the crisis  concerning Sarajevo, which in the past week has disturbed the  entire world. Our Western partners now must do some work with  the Bosnian Government so that it also fully observes the  requirements which ensue from the idea of demilitarizing  Sarajevo, which we have put forward very powerfully.    [Kalyagin] Could NATO strikes still take place?    [Churkin] I think not. However, I know that certain NATO  officials stand by the concept, which in my view is extremely  dangerous, of carrying out air strikes and holding talks; that  is, they believe that air strikes must be carried out without  fail under whatever pretext, and that this will somehow  stimulate the talks. This is a completely absurd concept, which  is detached from the realities of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Actions  of this kind are certain to wreck the whole talks process. I  think that in the present conditions, when the Russian  initiative has not only been accepted by the Serbs, but has it  must be said received a very good response from many  international leaders and from many parts of the world, I think  that the chances of such reckless actions are not very great.    I am very glad that the United States has now said it is  raising its profile in the Bosnian settlement. In this way the  prestige of the United States is now also at stake, and if a  Bosnian settlement once again slips out of our grip, then it  will also mean a loss of prestige for the United States. That  leads me to think that the Americans will indeed act positively  here.    [Kalyagin] So a truce has been reached: What about the next  step? Should we not strike while the iron is hot?    [Churkin] The next step will be this. First, as far as  Sarajevo is concerned, we will propose that the Security Council  examine the problem of Sarajevo as a whole -- that is, we press  ahead with implementing the UN administration of Sarajevo. In  the package for a Bosnian political settlement, the sides have  already agreed with this idea in principle. It remains for us  to work out the details and to carry out UN administration for  two years, as envisaged by the peace accords. Second, from the  viewpoint of a general Bosnian settlement; an extremely good  opportunity has now emerged to press ahead quickly toward a  comprehensive political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In  the last few days and hours we have been in contact at the very  highest levels with representatives of a host of key countries.  In this respect Russia now plays a central role in this whole  process, and I think that in the coming days and weeks one can  expect some very important meetings and decisions in this  sphere.</p>

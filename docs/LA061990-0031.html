			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY REQUESTS STAY OF REDISTRICTING  RULING  </P> <P> Attorneys for Los Angeles County on Monday petitioned the U.S. 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals to stay a federal judge's order requiring the Board of  Supervisors to redraw district lines. They also asked the court to consider  immediately an appeal of the historic ruling that the boundaries discriminate  against Latinos.  </P> <P> However, county lawyers have acknowledged that there is little chance the  appeals court will grant their request. If the petition is denied, the county  will appeal again when U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's final order is  signed, possibly in July, county attorneys said.  </P> <P> On Friday, Kenyon refused to stay his order and allow the county to immediately  appeal the case, saying it is "more appropriate for the county to simply let  this court finish its duties."  </P> <P> The judge earlier this month ruled that supervisors in 1981 drafted a  redistricting plan that diluted the voting strength of the county's 3 million  Latinos.  </P></p>

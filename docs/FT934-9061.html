			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Clarke faces some hard lobbying at Harrogate - Howard Davies believes there is still time to influence the chancellor when he attends the CBI conference next week 'IT IS never too late to influence a chancellor. The decision to knock 1p off the standard rate of income tax in the 1986 budget was only taken the weekend before,' recalls Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Davies, a Treasury adviser when the former Mr Nigel Lawson was chancellor, is trying to influence the Budget on behalf of a CBI membership employing more than half the nation's workforce. The CBI offered what it regarded as a modest shopping list to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present chancellor, in September. Its members will have a final chance for some hard lobbying when Mr Clarke goes to Harrogate next week to address the organisation's annual conference, two weeks before his Budget statement to the Commons. 'It will not be too late for Mr Clarke to consider interest rates, to adjust his overall tax judgment or to change his views on issues like investment incentives. We could yet make a difference,' Mr Davies adds. CBI conferences have long been criticised as cosy, self-congratulatory affairs more intent on promoting the commercial interests of delegates than stirring the national policy debate. But the CBI chief hopes changes in the format of this year's meeting will make it more valuable. Debates will centre on CBI position papers and at the end of the three-day meeting Mr Davies will summarise conference opinions and present a statement setting out CBI priorities for the year ahead. A succession of high-profile speakers will listen to and respond to debates. Several ministers and M Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, will be there and Mr John Smith will be the first Labour leader to address a CBI conference. The CBI wants to see investment incentives as the main Budget theme, as investment in manufacturing has continued to be poor. The organisation was once sceptical about the value of investment allowances but now believes the temporary boost given to them in the last autumn statement has helped stimulate business investment. Even so, it remains at its lowest level for 34 years as a proportion of gross domestic product. The CBI believes removal of allowances now would be damaging and wants help tilted further towards smaller businesses, which can do most to help create jobs. The Treasury remains unconvinced. Mr Davies said: 'There must be no significant tax increases beyond those announced by Mr Norman Lamont. We might not have chosen VAT on domestic fuel but the present chancellor has to get it through. There is a real danger that if he fails, confidence in his ability to deliver on anything will be seriously undermined. It could have a damaging impact on the gilt and foreign exchange markets.' Also on the list is the CBI's wish, given the demise of the business expansion scheme, to see the establishment of a 'business angel' financing system designed to unlock available wealth by offering tax incentives, preferably involving capital gains rather than income tax. The CBI wants to see another 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates by the end of the year, but Mr Davies does not expect any announcement to form part of the Budget package. The CBI is demanding that the government should set out clearer policies on which to base a successful partnership with industry and hopes the Budget will show the message is getting across. Mr Davies added: 'If the spending programme, for example, demonstrates that ministers are ready to see the pain taken other than in areas like training and transport infrastructure, we will be able to detect a more strategic approach.' No one at Harrogate will expect Mr Clarke to give much away on the day. Neither will they expect his Budget to have them applauding. Mr Davies said: 'If he does nothing for small businesses or investment and raises taxes further, he can expect a great big raspberry.'</p>

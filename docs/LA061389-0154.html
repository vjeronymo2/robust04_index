			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOHNSON BEGS FOR 2ND CHANCE TO COMPETE;  </P> <P> ADMITS HE TOOK STEROIDS BEFORE SETTING 100-METER DASH RECORD IN '87  </P> <P> Ben Johnson today begged for a second chance to compete for Canada and admitted  that he took steroids in 1987 before setting a world record in the 100-meter  dash that still stands.  </P> <P> The sprinter told an inquiry into drugs and athletics that he wants to compete  for Canada in the 1992 Olympics. Asked if he could be the fastest without  drugs, he replied: "I know I can be."  </P> <P> Johnson also said he wants to send a message to youth.  </P> <P> "I want to tell them to be honest, don't take drugs. I've been there. I know  what it's like to cheat," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson said he lied about cheating at the Seoul Olympics until now because "I  was ashamed for my family and friends. I was just in a mess."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Review Expected  </P> <P> Johnson, who lost his gold medal in Seoul because of steroids, also  acknowledged using them before setting a world record in the 100-meter dash at  the 1987 World Track and Field Championships in Rome.  </P> <P> The sprinter said he was given steroid injections for two weeks at the end of  June and early July before the August, 1987, meet at which he set the  still-standing world record of 9.83 seconds.  </P> <P> Despite the scandal over Johnson's steroid use, the record has been allowed to  stand, but athletics officials have said they would review the situation if  there was evidence that the sprinter had taken banned performance-enhancing  substances before the event.  </P> <P> The sprinter confirmed that he was given steroid injections by his coach,  Charlie Francis, last Aug. 24, and by personal physician Dr. Jamie Astaphan  last Aug. 25 and 28 before the Olympics.  </P> <P> Johnson said he took no substances on his own between that time and the  100-meter race at Seoul on Sept. 24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Honey-Vinegar Drink  </P> <P> He forfeited the 9.79-second performance that bested his own world record and  the Olympic gold medal because of a positive test for the anabolic steroid  stanozolol.  </P> <P> Johnson also said that he did not drink a honey-and-vinegar beverage that  Astaphan sent to him the day of the race.  </P> <P> Although there had been speculation Astaphan was trying to mask the most recent  steroid injections, the doctor testified that it was nothing but an energy  drink.  </P> <P> Johnson said he returned to Canada immediately from Seoul after returning his  gold medal because he was concerned about the security of his family.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get them out of there quickly," he said.  </P> <P> The inquiry panel appears to be headed toward a conclusion that Johnson's coach  and physician rushed in a last-minute steroid program before the Olympics  because of Johnson's disappointing August European tour and failed to leave  enough clearance time.  </P> <P> Asked if he wondered about the change from the usual routine of steroid  treatments in fall, spring and early summer, the athlete answered: "No, sir."  </P></p>

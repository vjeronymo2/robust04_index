			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Gas price rise may broaden market INDEPENDENT gas companies say British Gas's decision last week to raise prices by as much as 12.5 per cent to some large industrial customers could open up limited opportunities in the interruptible market, which until now has failed to attract competitors, Robert Corzine writes. Interruptible consumers, which typically use gas for power generation at large industrial sites, pay low prices but risk being cut off during periods of peak demand, when many are able temporarily to use oil or other fuels. Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen and Conoco, said it 'sees some value in the interruptible market', while United Gas, the UK arm of Utilicorp of the US, believes 'a handful of opportunities could arise'. The British Gas price rises range from 2.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, depending on the volume of gas purchased, and cover three-year to 10-year contracts signed on or after November 2. Existing contracts or companies seeking shorter-term arrangements will not be affected. The independent gas companies contend that true competition in the interruptible segment will not occur until the full domestic market is opened up. They will need to use it as British Gas does, as a way to shift supplies quickly to smaller commercial and residential consumers at times of peak demand.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT . . . : THE PAVLOVA PREDICAMENT  </P> <P> Question: Every time I bake Pavlova in my springform pan I have sugar syrup  leak out onto the bottom of my oven. Would appreciate learning how I might  alleviate this problem.  </P> <P> Answer: Are you lining the pan with wax paper? First cut a circle to fit the  bottom, then cut a strip about two inches wider than the pan is deep and use it  to line the sides of the pan. Grease the wax paper well, dip your hand into  cold water and shake over the prepared pan.  </P> <P> Another cause could be improper beating of the egg whites. The mixture must be  glossy and stand in stiff peaks.  </P> <P> Oven temperature is a third critical factor in making Pavlova. It should puff  up by the end of the first 15 minutes of baking at 350 degrees. If it doesn't,  bake 10 to 15 minutes longer and then, if your oven holds heat well, turn it  off and let the Pavlova stand in the oven for an hour. If your oven doesn't  hold the heat, lower the temperature to 175 degrees and let the Pavlova bake  another hour.  </P> <P> Q: I attended a church social where the punch bowl literally "smoked." One of  the women told me it was done with "hot ice," but she could not tell me how.  Can you?  </P> <P> A: We suspect the trick was done with "dry," rather than "hot" ice. Dry ice is  carbon dioxide that is solidified and compressed into snowlike cakes and used  primarily as a refrigerant.  </P> <P> According to Dee Gramlich, a spokesperson for the Union Ice Company, dry ice  should not be placed directly in a punch bowl. If a piece breaks off and is  accidentally swallowed along with the punch, it might become lodged and freeze  the throat or can cause a severe burn to the throat or stomach.  </P> <P> You may, however, produce the smoke effect by placing the punch bowl in a  larger bowl containing dry ice, then pour hot water over the dry ice. The  hotter the water the better, said Gramlich, and add water as frequently as  needed.  </P> <P> Two other precautions to keep in mind when using dry ice: handle it with gloves  or protective paper, not bare hands, and never use it to chill punch in a  closed container; it could cause an explosion.  </P> <P> Q: I'm making a mid-life career change -- from financial accountant to  (hopefully) chef. Have been unable to find addresses for culinary schools.  Would appreciate your assistance in locating some directories with listings.  Location is no barrier, but English speaking is preferred.  </P> <P> A: Two sources may be of assistance: "The Food Yellow Pages," 1988 Los Angeles  Edition, and "The Guide to Cooking Schools," 1990 Edition. Both are available  at Cook's Library, 8373 W. 3rd Street, Los Angeles, (213) 655-3141. The store  is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.  </P></p>

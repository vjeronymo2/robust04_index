			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> MUSEUM COAXES NOVICES WITH NOVEL EXPERIMENT  </P> <P> What do you think of when you stand in front of your favorite work of art? Does  it remind you of somewhere you've been or someone you've known? Is it just,  somehow, "beautiful"?  </P> <P> Are you impressed by how much someone paid for it? Do you enjoy the formal  qualities (line, mass, color, brush stroke) of the work? Are you captivated by  the ideas the piece seems to convey?  </P> <P> Some of these ways of looking are typical of the so-called "naive viewer";  others are more typical of people with some background in art. But surely  everyone would agree that looking at a work of art is a peculiarly specialized  activity.  </P> <P> There are few things in life -- other than "views" in nature -- that we are  expected simply to look at for any space of time. For people lacking formal  training in art, this activity often seems to be nothing short of mystical.  What the devil are you supposed to think about, anyway, while you're doing all  this looking?  </P> <P> The closest I've been able to come to "listening in" to people's thoughts about  art is eavesdropping in local museums. Here's one conversation I jotted down:  </P> <P> "Now that's what I think of as modern art," said a middle-aged man to the  jolly-sounding middle-aged couple with whom he was touring the galleries.  </P> <P> "It's got texture to it," agreed the woman.  </P> <P> "The person who drew this had artistic ability," declared the other man.  </P> <P> The group moved to another painting.  </P> <P> "That's a pretty piece," said the woman.  </P> <P> "Color-wise," added the first man, whose voice held a trace of doubt.  </P> <P> "Well, in contemporary art, that's all it has to be, well-colored," maintained  the woman.  </P> <P> Clearly, these people had encountered abstract art before, but they seemed to  lack a frame of reference in which to discuss it. We're all faced with this  problem when the conversation turns to a subject we don't know much about,  whether it's the stock market, the national defense budget or the breeding of  Doberman pinschers.  </P> <P> So how do people become more fluent about the art they see? Most museums  publish catalogues about their exhibits, but they tend to be written in a  specialized language that shuts out all but the most patient general reader.  Museums also organize docent tours of their exhibitions and lectures by  experts, but these may not be in progress at the moment you've chosen to drop  in.  </P> <P> It seems logical that information about works of art in museums comes largely  from the one source that's always standing by: the labels and didactic panels  on the walls. But exactly what ought to go on those labels is a matter of  widespread disagreement. Some museum professionals put stock in panels that go  into detail. Other professionals believe in giving only minimal information so  as not to spoil the viewer's immediate aesthetic experience.  </P> <P> Long or short, however, labels frequently seem pitched to people who already  know a lot about art. Where does that leave the intelligent viewer who has  ventured into alien territory?  </P> <P> An article in a recent issue of Museum News magazine discusses the way one  museum tried to make labels more viewer-friendly. Funded by grants from the  Getty Grant Program and the National Endowment for the Arts, the Denver Art  Museum set out to rethink the way viewers absorb information in gallery labels.  </P> <P> The staff realized that, to quote museum publications director Marlene  Chambers, the usual thinking behind labels "encourages an outpouring of art  historical, biographical and cultural information in a setting little suited to  the acquisition of an organized body of knowledge -- knowledge that's more  easily acquired in classrooms and libraries.  </P> <P> "This traditional approach also ignored the unique experience an art museum has  to offer -- an immediate experience with art objects," Chambers continues. "By  handing down all the answers, it sends the implied message that these answers  can only be discovered by experts. And it cares nothing for motivating what it  wrongly assumes to be a captive audience."  </P> <P> Chambers and an education department intern decided to experiment with new  labels for a sentimental painting by 19th-Century artist Adolphe William  Bouguereau that was apparently a big favorite, based on viewer interviews and  the number of post card reproductions sold in the museum's bookstore.  </P> <P> The label texts were arranged in two columns: "If you like this painting, it is  because . . . " and "If you don't like this painting, it is because. . . . "  Underneath were supporting statements.  </P> <P> On the pro side, for example: "You are charmed by the artist's portrayal of  youth and innocence." On the con side: "Although you find the subject pleasant,  it seems trite and uninspired." And so on.  </P> <P> At the bottom of the statements, hidden under a sliding door, a label read: "Is  your reaction to this painting influenced more by the personal associations you  bring to it or by the painting itself?"  </P> <P> The third component of the experiment was a brochure comparing the Bouguereau  painting with a pastel drawing by 19th-Century master Edgar Degas "that most  visitors barely glance at."  </P> <P> One viewer said the label "made him want to take another look at a contemporary  painting he had hated on sight." Another viewer said, "Even if I stare at a  painting for a long time and try to think about it, I never really think about  position and shape. . . . (That) adds another dimension to the painting."  </P> <P> Surely, much the same type of educational tool -- involving personal discovery  rather than irrelevant or undigestible masses of facts -- could be devised for  abstract work and other media. While no museum is likely to want to pursue this  approach for an entire exhibition, it might be a welcome guide to major pieces  or especially popular works.  </P> <P> Anyone out there want to give it a whirl?  </P></p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Debate by Labour to focus on structure MORE THAN a third of the 459 resolutions tabled for Labour's annual conference focus on the party's organisation and administration, it emerged yesterday. The concentration on internal affairs, taking up 154 resolutions, is a direct consequence of the post mortem now under way on why the party suffered such a heavy defeat in the general election. Policy issues are less heavily discussed. But the resolution document, published yesterday, also shows evidence of the predominance of advocates of party modernisation and their determination to push ahead with further changes. As promised, the AEEU, the union formed by the merger of the EETPU electricians' union with the AEU engineering union, has tabled a motion demanding the immediate introduction of a one-member, one-vote system for the selection of party candidates. Other features of the document are a newly emphatic stress on the importance of 'green' issues and a lengthy section on the media, with many resolutions urging the party to adopt new techniques such as telephone canvassing aimed at 'bypassing' Conservative-dominated newspapers. While there are still many clearly leftwing motions, there are also several suggesting that Labour must move further towards the Conservatives, with one suggesting that opposition to compulsory competitive tendering must be dropped.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 20,000 FARMERS TO RECEIVE NOTICES TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS OR LOSE LAND  </P> <P> The government's main agricultural lender is about to tell 20,000 farmers that  they must act quickly to avoid foreclosure on delinquent loans, an Agriculture  Department official said today.  </P> <P> The notices to be mailed in four to six weeks are a sign that many farmers are  still hurting from financial woes that have dragged under tens of thousands  during the 1980s.  </P> <P> "Certainly the problems in agriculture have not been corrected," said Keith  Smalley, a program official for the department's Farmers Home Administration,  which is known as the farm lender of last resort.  </P> <P> Farmers who receive the notices will be given 45 days to declare their interest  in restructuring their delinquent loans. If they do not respond, they face  foreclosure.  </P> <P> The lending agency sent similar notices in November to 66,426 farmers whose  delinquent loans had accumulated over several years. During that time the  agency was barred by a court order from foreclosing.  </P></p>

They are called security  services, but their area of expertise is somewhat unusual.  Apart from protecting shipments, people, and installations,  they are called upon to fight terrorism at gas production  facilities. They also guard the pipeline that pumps gas abroad.  The bulk of the group is made up of former KGB and Internal  Affairs Ministry staffers. They all are authorized to carry  firearms, which, however, have never been used. Those who do  not have the right to carry guns are now completing a crash  course to receive a certificate required by the Internal Affairs  Ministry authorization department.</p>

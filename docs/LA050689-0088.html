			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKS TO BISHOPS IN MALAWI;  </P> <P> POPE TELLS MUSLIMS, CATHOLICS TO AVOID BATTLING FOR CONVERTS  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II, reflecting the church's concern about the spread of Islamic  fundamentalism in Africa, urged Roman Catholics and Muslims on Friday to avoid  aggressive tactics in the battle for converts.  </P> <P> In a speech to Malawi's Catholic bishops on the last full day of his nine-day  African tour, the Pope raised the issue of the church's tense relations with  Muslims in this southern African nation.  </P> <P> "What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual recognition of those  things that we share in common," the Pope said.  </P> <P> "Both among Christians working for unity in obedience to Christ and among  believers of different religions, there is no place for aggressive proselytism  which disturbs and hurts, still less for the use of unworthy methods," he  added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refers to 1985 Speech  </P> <P> The Pope quoted from his speech to Muslims in Morocco in 1985:  </P> <P> "Christians and Muslims . . . have badly understood each other, and sometimes,  in the past, have opposed and even exhausted each in polemics and in wars. I  believe that today God invites us to change our old practices."  </P> <P> There are 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Muslims in this country of 8  million people. The rest of the population is made up mostly of Protestants and  animists.  </P> <P> Islam has been growing rapidly in Malawi since the early 1970s. Financed in  part by Arab oil money, Muslims have built hundreds of mosques across the  country.  </P> <P> Tensions grew after Muslim extremists set fire to several Catholic churches in  Malawi in 1983-84. Last August, several Catholic youths and an elderly religion  teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of Blantyre by Muslim  fundamentalists, church officials said.  </P> <P> Some Muslim leaders here have said they are upset that the Pope's visit to  Malawi came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  </P> <P> The Pope also celebrated a morning Mass for more than 100,000 people at  Blantyre's Kwacha (Freedom) Park, addressed at least 60,000 youths at the  Kamuzu sports stadium and met with the Catholic laity and representatives of  other Christian faiths and other religions.  </P> <P> In his homily, he urged his flock to treat victims of acquired immune  deficiency syndrome as "we would treat Christ himself."  </P> <P> Malawi has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Africa. According to local  health officials, as many as 20% of newborn children are infected with the AIDS  virus.  </P> <P> The Pope travels today to Lilongwe, Malawi's administrative capital, to  celebrate the final Mass of his voyage before returning to Rome.  </P></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends lower in choppy trade after jobs data Wall Street US STOCK prices closed lower in choppy markets yesterday while bond prices ended the day higher after volatile trading following the release of unexpectedly strong employment statistics, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3221.6, down 19.9, while the broader Standard and Poors 500 index was at 404.43, down 2.08. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the- counter stocks ended at 615.95, down 6.02. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks led advances by 1093 to 599 on volume of 186m shares. Market sentiment was set by the much-awaited figures for February employment, released early in the morning, which showed non-farm payrolls rising by 164,000 - far greater than Wall Street had been expecting. The concensus was for a rise of just 10,000. There was also an impressive gain in hours worked. Analysts said the news suggested a significant pick-up in the economy and pretty much ruled out the chances of a further easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve over the next few weeks. The figures prompted a sharp drop in Treasury bonds, the benchmark 30-year issue hitting a low of 99 25/32 in morning trading. However, bond market anxiety about a pick-up in the economy was tempered by the statisticians' revision to January employment figures, showing a decline of 149,000 rather than 91,000. Treasuries also encountered buying when the yield on the long bond passed through 8 per cent. In late trading the benchmark issue was quoted at 100 7/8 , up 16, to yield 7.916. Most actively traded stocks included International Business Machines, down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 86 3/8 , USX-Marathon, Dollars 22 5/8 , up Dollars 3/8 , Limited Inc at Dollars 27 1/8 , down Dollars  3/4 , and Exxon at Dollars 55 5/8 , unchanged. Bank stocks fell for the second day on market concern over the finances of Olympia &amp; York, the property developer owned by Canada's Reichmann family, which has redeemed part of a commercial paper programme after a downgrading. Chemical Banking, one of the most actively traded issues, was down Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 31 1/8 , Citicorp down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 16 1/8 and BankAmerica dwon Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43 1/4 . JP Morgan was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 57 5/8 . ITT, the conglomerate, which earlier this week agreed to sell its 30 per cent stake in telecommunications group Alcatel, dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 following a meeting with Wall Street analysts on Thursday afternoon. Yesterday PaineWebber cut its forecast for ITT's estimated earnings. In the pharmaceuticals sector, American Home Products initially rose, following a favourable press article and news that a broker had improved its rating, yet ended the day down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 75 1/2 . Canada TORONTO STOCKS finished lower, but regained some losses in late trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index lost 14.71 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 3,530.84, but climbed in late trading from a low of about 3,524. The index was down about 51 points, or 1.4 per cent, on the week. Declining issues led advances 334 to 248. Volume was 27.168m shares and trading value was CDollars 242.5m. The pipeline sub-group led the fall with a 1.62 per cent drop on index. Management lost 1.16 per cent, golds 1.01 per cent, and mining, financial services, industrial products, energy and consumer products were moderately lower.</p>

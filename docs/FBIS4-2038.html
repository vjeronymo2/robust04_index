			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of Heilongjiang Provincial </F> Party Committee, at the provincial experience-exchange meeting  on ideological and work style of leading bodies: "Leading Bodies  Should Take the Lead in Working Hard" on 28 February]    [Text] Working hard is our party's glorious tradition and  the magic weapon for vanquishing the enemy. Each and every  major success we made during the war period and the large-scale  economic construction period was the result of hard work. At  present, reform, opening up, and modernization have entered a  new stage. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding  opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are  the overall tasks of the whole party during these periods.  Based on this topic, we successively held the second plenary  session of the seventh provincial party committee, the  provincial economic work conference, and the second session of  the eighth provincial people's congress around the Spring  Festival period to clearly define the tasks for the province's  reform, development, and stability during 1994. To fulfill  these tasks, we have to overcome many difficulties and to  resolve many new contradictions and new problems. This requires  leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in working hard  and to strive to form a situation of working hard to become  pioneers in great undertakings in the whole province. To  promote the hardworking spirit during the new stage of reform,  opening up, and modernization, we must unswervingly implement  the party's basic line, pay simultaneous attention to hard work  and creative work, and strive to seek realistic work  achievements; concentrate energy on economic construction, try  by all possible means to overcome difficult problems in the  course of development, and strive to gain a fairly rapid  development rate; uphold the mass line, share the comforts and  hardships of the masses, do more practical things for them, and  maintain flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of  people; and persist in resisting the corrosive influence of the  bourgeois ideology, perform official work honestly and  diligently, stress frugality, and promote the formation of a  healthy, progressive, civilized, and open social atmosphere.    A. Our province has very complicated economic tasks and many  difficulties which require our leading cadres at all levels to  enhance spirit and immerse themselves in hard work. Through  10-odd years of effort in reform and opening up, our province  has made considerable progress and noticeably enhanced its  comprehensive economic strength and the people's living  standards. However, owing to the various kinds of  contradictions and problems accumulated under the traditional  systems over a long time, there are some prominent difficulties  at present: The long shortage of investment, the lack of major  projects to stimulate economic development, and the outdated  equipment in key enterprises have mingled together to make  industries lack ability to make progress and to make the number  of unmarketable products increase; the resources of petroleum  and timber have declined, the mining and excavation industry  which accounts for one-third of the entire industry has  continued to decline, thus increasing the number of "unleavened  dough" in economic development and financial revenue; restricted  by natural conditions, the per-unit construction cost of capital  construction projects and the comprehensive energy consumption  for producing every 10,000 yuan worth of products are higher  than the national average, and the production cost has  restricted the competitive ability of products on the market;  the precision and intensive processing industry is undeveloped,  the proportion of the processed coal, timber, oil, and grain is  much lower than the national average which has resulted in a  disconnection in various industries and a short processing  chain; the development of the nonstate sector of the economy is  not developed, and the township enterprises, and foreign-funded,  individual, and private sectors of the economy have failed to  give an impetus to promoting economic growth; while greatly  increasing the total supply of grain and sideline products, the  comparative returns of agriculture is low, and the more we have  produced and stored grain, the heavier the burdens have become,  making the progress of rural industrialization very slow. To  overcome these difficulties in economic development, we must  make progress actively and strive for greater state support. The  most important is to rely on our own efforts to improve  ourselves and work hard. First, we must enhance spirit. While  facing many difficulties in the economy, Heilongjiang Province  also has many favorable conditions. For example, the central  authorities have decided to comprehensively establish the  socialist market economic structure which will help us solve  contradictions caused by inappropriate systems and difficulties  in economic development and create an unprecedented opportunity;  through many years of practice and explorations, we have formed  a development idea that conforms to the state industrial policy  and the basic provincial conditions, which will effect a better  turn for the better in the whole province's economy if we uphold  it; the development of new economic growing points, such as  township enterprises, has been accelerated, and the preferential  policies we have implemented will surely play a role in  promoting economic growth in the whole province. Therefore, we  must correctly grasp the economic situation, and in addition to  recognizing and facing difficulties squarely, we must boost our  courage to overcome difficulties. Only by urging leading bodies  and leading cadres at all levels to first overcome the passive  and pessimistic ideology of attempting nothing and accomplishing  nothing, can we enhance the spirit of the higher and the lower  levels across the province, fully mobilize the hidden enthusiasm  of the masses of cadres, make concerted efforts to overcome  difficulties, and accelerate the pace of economic development.  Second, we should immerse ourselves in hard work. All  difficult things on earth can be handled easily if we try it,  and all easy things may seem difficult to handle if we do not  try it. In face of the issues in economic development, leading  cadres at all levels must cultivate a practical and hardworking  spirit. With this spirit, we can solve overall difficulties  and seek development. For example, with the similar natural and  economic conditions, some places can maintain a healthy and  vigorous development trend, and some are in a poverty-stricken  state; likewise, some state-owned enterprises have gained vigor  and vitality through reform and transformation and some have  witnessed an increase in their difficulties. The crucial issue  involved here is whether we can emancipate ideology and make  earnest efforts to do practical things. Therefore, to  strengthen the leading bodies, we must establish the mechanism  of encouraging more practical work and paying attention to  actual results, and resolutely overcome the problem of striving  for undeserved reputation and practicing formalism; cultivate  the habit of performing one's duty faithfully, working without  complaints, and daring to undertake heavy tasks and to  resolutely overcome the work style of paying lip service without  doing anything or taking any responsibility, seeking comforts,  and dodging contradictions. Third, we should work hard to make  progress. The more difficulties we face, the easier the mental  state of doing sloppy work will occur. At present, the ideology  and feeling of being content with the present situation, seeking  stability and fearing chaos, willing to stay in the middling  state, and regarding backwardness reasonable have existed among  some leading cadres in varying degrees. This is not the  ambition and pursuit which our communist party people should  have. The party and the people have entrusted us with the  undertakings of one place or one department, we should cultivate  a sense of political responsibility of "bringing benefits to a  place when one is in office there," and exert utmost efforts and  wisdom to manage well the work of that place and that  department; have boldness and vigor to seize the opportunity,  boldly carry out things which we think right, and resolutely do  well things we should do; and cultivate the will of doing  first-grade work and creating top-grade achievements, make  vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, and try by all  possible means to make greater achievements.    B. Establishing the socialist market economic new structure  is a brand-new and arduous task that requires leading cadres at  all levels to blaze new trials and to make progress with a  pioneering spirit. The implementation of the planned economic  system over scores of years has left us many long-standing big  and difficult problems. At present, our province's proportion  of state-owned industrial units is as high as 80.2 percent (the  national proportion is 48.1 percent), that of state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises, 60.87 percent (national proportion  is 36.4 percent, that of mandatory plans, 23 percent (the  national proportion is less that 5 percent), and that of  enterprises directly under the central government, 42 percent,  (national proportion is 20 percent), and these four proportions  all rank first in the country. It is rarely seen in China that  the factors of having enterprises of larger size and having a  high degree of public ownership and the system of centralized  and decentralized management are concentrated in one province.  Therefore, it is not an easy task to establish the socialist  market economic structure in Heilongjiang Province. We must  exert painstaking efforts to achieve this. At present, we have  entered the stage of tackling difficult problems and carrying  out package reform with breakthrough thoughts in key areas.    We should give priority to reforming the property right of  state-owned enterprises and accelerate the establishment of the  modern enterprise system; regard cultivating markets of the  essential production factors as the emphasis and accelerate the  establishment of an integrated, open, competitive, and orderly  market system; give priority to changing government functions,  and establish and improve the economic regulation and control  system; regard the unemployment and old-age insurance of  enterprise workers as the priorities, and establish and improve  the social security system; regard the shareholding cooperative  system as the emphasis, further improve the rural operational  system, and give priority to deepening foreign trade system to  promote the escalation of the strategy of opening to the outside  world; and attach importance to commercializing and  industrializing the scientific and technological findings, and  accelerate the process of integrating science with technology,  education, and economy. To fulfill these reform tasks, we must  have courage to blaze new trials and always regard emancipating  the mind and deepening reform as the primary task. We must  uphold the three essential criteria and never mechanically copy  and follow plans from the higher levels, but work creatively in  line with reality; never adopt the attitude of avoiding knotty  problems or shifting the responsibility on to other people, but  promote the spirit of daring to blaze new trials, to try, and to  take risks advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; never stick to  old ways or manage things with old experience while dealing with  the new situation and new problems in reform, but think of new  ideas, and be good at opening up a new working sphere and  creating new achievements in work. We must advance despite  difficulty, and take active and reliable steps to handle the  difficult problems in reform. In deepening enterprise reform,  we must withstand the strains of the employment problem of  workers in enterprises which are ordered to shut down, suspend  operation, amalgamate with other enterprises or switch to the  manufacture of other products, and the arrangements for their  living; in deepening reform of the price system, we must see  whether the masses of people can stand the strain. In the face  of the coexistence of these advantages and disadvantages, we  must not adopt a hesitative and wait-and-see attitude because  this cannot help us solve problems. Stagnation in reform will  make us lose the future development opportunity. We must choose  advantages, eliminate disadvantages, and advance in a pioneering  spirit. Of course, while unswervingly promoting reform of the  economic structure, we must properly handle the relations of  reform, development, and stability, use our brain and think of a  way to make breakthroughs in tackling difficult points in  reform, persist in giving consideration to the overall  situation, handle things in the order of priority, carry out  reform in a coordinated manner, and ensure that reform of the  socialist market economic structure will be carried out in a  sound and orderly manner.    C. In the practice of reform and development, the number of  social contradictions caused by readjustment of the relations of  interests and destablishing factors will increase, and this  requires leading cadres at all levels to show greater concerns  for the people's living and do more practical things for them.  Reform cannot be separated from the people's understanding,  support, and participation. In the course of deepening reform,  leading cadres at all levels should pay particular attention to  the people's difficulties of one sort or another caused by the  readjustment of the pattern of interests. At present, some  cadres have enjoyed a certain power vested by the people but  have failed to hold responsibility to the people and to perform  their obligation. They have paid no attention to the hardships  or the voice of the people, made suppositions subjectively while  considering or resolving issues, and deviated themselves from  reality and the masses. Some people have even sought personal  "achievements in their career" at the cost of sacrificing the  interests of the people. We must conscientiously resolve these  problems. It is necessary to educate cadres at all levels to  cultivate a viewpoint of giving first thought to the people and  regard seeking benefits for the masses of people as the starting  and resting points. We should take the lead in working hard and  use this to cement the hearts of the masses, maintain close ties  between the party and the masses by realistically resolving the  problems which people have complained about strongly, and win  the people's trust and support with our actual deeds of working  our official work diligently. In policymaking, we must  consider people's opinions and voice as the first signal. In  formulating a policy or a decision, we must deeply conduct  investigation and study, extensively listen to the people's  opinions, and while formulating major reform measures, in  particular, we must uphold and pay attention to the principle of  letting all the people enjoy benefits and making all people  withstand the strains, and enable policymaking and the  implementation of policy decisions to become more in line with  the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people. In  work, we should regard doing practical and good things for the  masses as the first duty of the leading bodies. We should go  deeply to the grass roots regularly, help the masses eliminate  misgivings and solve problems, realistically solve the issue of  enabling workers of difficult enterprises to have work to do and  food to eat and the issue on production and living of  poverty-stricken households in the rural areas. It is necessary  to do public welfare undertakings that may bring common benefits  to the masses within our ability. In promoting the development  of all undertakings, we should regard the masses of people as  the first force on which we can rely. The mass line of "doing  all things for the sake of the people, relying on the masses  while doing every thing, getting the opinions of the masses and  referring them back to the masses" must be upheld at any time,  the pioneering spirit of the masses must be fully respected, and  their enthusiasm must be protected and mobilized. We should  urge the masses of people to work with us with one heart and one  mind, to overcome difficult in the course of advance, and to  make concerted efforts to successfully carry out reform and  modernization by mobilizing them ideologically, showing them  typical examples, and attracting them with policies.    D. With the enhancement of the degree of opening to the  outside world, the task of resisting the corrosive influence of  decadent ideology has become more urgent. This requires the  leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in performing  their official work honestly and paying attention to frugality.  With the unceasing deepening of reform and opening up, the  people's ideology and concept, and the social habits are being  actively changed to meet the demand of social progress.  However, we must recognize that some passive and backward  phenomena running counter to the essence of socialism and the  traditional virtue of the Chinese nation have really existed and  grown. Particularly, money worshipping, out-and-out egotism, and  the trend of extravagance have run rampant. What merits our  attention is that these phenomena have also existed among some  leading cadres. Some people have abused the powers in their  hands as a means to seek personal gain, traded power for money,  and sought benefits for the individuals and their family  members and friends; some have sought personal comforts, dined  and wined luxuriously, worn expensive clothes, sought inordinate  consumption in living, and even compared their wealth with "rich  people" in society. If we let such a situation to spread  unchecked, the prestige of the party and the government will be  seriously harmed and the achievements in reform, opening up, and  construction will be buried. We must adopt resolute measures  to correct this. The advanced nature of the communist party is  to wholeheartedly serve the people and not to seek personal  gain. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said: "Why did our party have  great power in the past? During the war, we always said that if  30 percent of the soldiers in the company are communist members,  this company must be good and have strong fighting capacity.  Why? This is because communist party members are always the  first to fight on the frontline and the last to retreat and the  first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts." Today,  when we conduct reform, opening up, and modernization, we should  also demand leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses of  communist party members to show the broad mind of being "the  first to worry about what the people have worried and the last  to enjoy comforts," pay more attention to the success and  failure of their work and less attention to their own gain or  loss, and have courage to sacrifice their personal interests for  the party's cause and the people's undertakings. Leading cadres  at all levels should take the lead in performing official duties  honestly, enhance the training of party spirit, cultivate a  correct concept of value, power, hardships, and happiness, and  strengthen ability to oppose corruption and guard against  evolution; leading bodies at all levels should regard party  style and administrative honesty as the important aspect of  building leading bodies, persist in unswervingly conducting  anticorruption struggle, and form a strong political atmosphere  of opposing corruption and promoting honesty. We should also  actively promote the trend of practicing economy. "Looking back  at the prominent personages of the past, those who worked  diligently became successful persons and those who spent  extravagantly suffered failure." This old saying is still a  famous dictum to date. During the new period in which  Heilongjiang is taking steps to change the system and to blaze  new trials in industry, and, in particular, under the situation  in which some enterprises have difficulties in production and  management and the living standards of some people have remained  low, we should all the more uphold the principle of working  hard, practicing economy, and building the country through hard  work. All localities and departments should cultivate the idea  of leading an austere life, appropriately conduct etiquette  activities, improve working conditions, practice economy, and  use the limited amount of money and material resources to  effectively develop production. Party committees at all levels  and discipline inspection commissions at all levels should  strengthen supervision over leading cadres, promptly reorganize  and reshuffle cadres who go in for ostentation and extravagance  and spend public funds lavishly, and give party and  administrative sanctions to those whose cases are serious in an  effort to safeguard the advanced nature and purity of the party,  to successfully build our leading bodies at all levels, and to  provide a solid organizational basis and an effective leadership  guarantee for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization.</p>

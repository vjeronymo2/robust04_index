			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Leading Article: New doctrine for the G7 THE REGULAR meetings of the leaders or finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries have promised much in recent years: co-ordinated growth strategies, exchange rate stability, debt relief or a Uruguay Round agreement. They have delivered almost nothing of value. Little wonder that seasoned observers argue that the G7 conforms to the Sinatra doctrine - they meet, talk and then do it their way. Some argue that disbanding the whole charade - the 'strangers in the night' alternative - would make more sense. G7 finance ministers are once again gathering in Washington this weekend. They do so at a time of great insecurity in the world economy, and not just because of Russia's present difficulties. Growth across the developed world is slow and expected to remain sluggish, while unemployment is very high and rising. The spectre of low-wage competition from east Asia and Latin America is feeding protectionist sentiments, while both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation are under threat. Now, more than ever, the world needs the G7 to address these challenges, not simply meet and talk and hope they will go away. But first, the G7 must decide what it exists for. To do so, it must recognise that its error has been to believe macroeconomic co-ordination was its primary task, a role at which G7 summits have proved singularly ineffective. Neither the US nor the rest of Europe has managed to persuade Germany to tighten fiscal policy over the past two years and thus allow its interest rates to fall. Nor do the US and the IMF look likely to persuade the rest of continental Europe to cut their interest rates to more sensible levels. Meanwhile, sluggish growth in both the US and Japan results, in part, from past co-ordination failures - the ill-fated attempt to manage the yen-dollar exchange rate in the late 1980s, and the failure of the rest of the G7 to persuade the US to bring its fiscal deficit under control earlier. Developing world Macroeconomics is not the G7's forte. Unless fiscal policy is also co-ordinated, monetary policy is best left to national governments. But this does not mean that the summits can serve no useful purpose. Far from it. If only G7 governments could persuade each other, and their electorates, to lift their eyes above short-term difficulties, they would see that the medium-term outlook for the world economy is far from discouraging. For, while developed countries have foundered in recent years, growth across the developing world is accelerating. Latin America has recovered from its 1980s debt crisis, economic recovery is under way in Poland and imminent across the rest of central Europe, while even Russia may now be closer to reform than at any time in the past two years. Most important, China and India - together accounting for half the world's population - are now embracing market reforms. The IMF expects developing country growth to average 6 per cent a year between next year and 1998, faster than at any time in the past 20 years. Only crisis-ridden Africa is still out in the cold. 'My way' doctrine This outlook is not assured. It depends on whether G7 governments, and their electorates, can adapt to a new economic order in which increasingly global markets in goods, foreign direct investment and information are gradually shifting the focus of energy and growth in the world economy towards the developing world. The G7 must celebrate this change. It must make clear to developed country electorates that a vibrant and growing developing world is good for richer countries too. Trade is not a zero sum game from which high-wage developed countries inevitably lose. Open and growing economies in eastern Europe, China or Mexico are as much a source of new markets and prosperity for workers in Europe and America as sources of cheaper goods. That is why the G7 must ensure that the December deadline for a Uruguay Round trade agreement is met and that trade barriers continue to fall. Of course, there will be a minority of losers: unskilled workers, whose relative wages will inevitably fall as developing countries grow and labour-saving technological change continues to develop. G7 governments must find ways now to help upgrade the skills of the poorly educated. Meanwhile, they must use growth-friendly polices to cut unemployment and thus combat short-term pressures for creeping protectionism. In short, the G7 needs to replace the Sinatra 'my way' doctrine. Its primary task is to find collective ways to tackle the medium-term structural and policy challenges that a growing and more egalitarian world economy throw up. In the words of the Johnny Mercer song, sung by Bing Crosby at the end of the second world war, the G7's gotta: Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive, E-lim-my-nate the negative, Latch on to the af-firm-a-tive, Don't mess with Mister In-between. So roll over 'ol' blue eyes'. The Crosby doctrine's time has come.</p>

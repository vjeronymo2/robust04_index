			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Saudis flock to work in the private sector: They are leaving the traditional career path for higher-pressure jobs Mr Yousef Salman, Saudi plant manager at the Zoujaj bottling factory outside Riyadh, cuts a distinctive profile behind his desk. He sports a polo shirt and khaki jeans, rather than the otherwise universal Saudi uniform of white thobe (robe) and ghuttra (headdress). 'Because of my dress people don't think I'm a Saudi,' he says. 'People address me in Urdu or Hindi.' Urdu or Hindi, because the more usual denizens of the factories of Saudi Arabia's fast-growing light industrial sector are Indians, Pakistanis, or perhaps Bangladeshis and Filipinos. Until lately, Saudi citizens have been a rare sight on the shop floor. Cheap, contracted labour from the sub-continent and East Asia still overwhelmingly predominates in the dozens of furniture, cable, glass, electrical and other factories in Riyadh's industrial zones. But Mr Salman is among a growing number of Saudis departing from the traditional career path of most of their countrymen - a secure job with the government - for the higher-pressure work of the private sector. Zoujaj, which produces 700,000 bottles a day for clients including Coca Cola and Pepsi, counts 37 Saudis on its 244-strong payroll. Across the road at the Saudi Lighting Company, a fast-growing light fittings group, 50 Saudis are on the 600-strong staff and, says Mr Mohammed Mustafa, finance director: 'They're picking up. We are now getting Saudis knocking at our door for jobs: once you had to go and look for them.' Bankers and hoteliers say there has been a clear rise over the past three years in the number of Saudis willing to accept private-sector jobs at rates of pay they would previously have spurned. 'We have little trouble these days finding Saudis for some jobs at about Saudi Riyals 3,500 (Pounds 583) a month,' one Riyadh banker says. Accurate labour statistics are not published in Saudi Arabia. But it is a fair estimate that more than 90 per cent of Saudis either work directly for the government or for parastatal groups, a proportion replicated in most other Gulf states. Hours tend to be undemanding, working conditions comfortable, salaries start at about SR5,000 a month for a graduate entrant; government jobs offer virtual tenure. However, with the government in the clutches of a two-year-old cash flow problem and ministries this year cutting budgets by 19 per cent, state bodies have imposed an informal hiring freeze. Most bureaucracies were overstaffed in any case, according to local economists. At the same time, the Saudi private sector has continued growing over the past two years, bolstered by an array of state incentives, including cheap permits on industrial zones and concessionary lending from organisations such as the Saudi Industrial Development Fund. According to the commerce ministry, the number of licences for private concerns rose 28 per cent between 1991 and 1993, to a total of 423,800. More private companies are producing more job opportunities for young Saudis. The population is growing at about 3.7 per cent a year, pouring 90,000-100,000 prospective workers onto the job market annually - numbers the bloated state bureaucracy cannot swallow. Such market pressure is forcing young Saudis to consider working in the private sector, although such movement is a growing trend rather than a tidal wave at present. But there have been recent signals from the government that it might be preparing to give this trend a bigger push. The government has for years tried to encourage Saudis to join the private sector: the present five-year plan, penned in 1990, said it expected 96 per cent of new jobs in the kingdom to come from private enterprise, and state plans since 1970 have consistently advocated 'Saudi-isation' of the private sector. However, while Saudi labour law formally decrees that 75 per cent of all companies' workforces should be Saudi, Mr Hussein Sijini, deputy minister of planning, says the government has never enforced this for fear of impeding the private-sector growth which it sees as vital to the kingdom's policy of diversification away from oil. Saudi workers are expensive. Where a young Saudi technician might come at SR3,500 a month, Indians or Filipinos are usually paid SR1,400 a month, plus a package of board and lodging. A recent visit to Riyadh by a team from the UK Inland Revenue has prompted local bankers and businessmen to wonder if the government is considering fiscal incentives to companies which hire Saudi workers. Such measures may be contained in the forthcoming January 1 budget. Hpwever, for some Saudis, such incentives are unnecessary. 'A lot of us just had enough of the government system,' says Mr Omar al-Shuwaier, who left a government department two years ago to form and manage Rowad National Plastic, Saudi Arabia's first plastic sheeting company. 'We don't want to work for the government system with its routines, or for the old-style private companies where it's all on a personal basis; if the owners don't like you, they kick you out.' Instead, Mr al-Shuwaier says, he and some Saudi colleagues prefer the more ordered and formal board of directors and western-style management structure. 'I see more people like me in industry,' he adds. 'Our financial and administrative manager used to work with the government, but since he's been with us, he no longer has the time to drink tea and read the newspapers. 'The challenge he has is new, the experience - it's huge. We're not the highest paid here, but there's a system here - a more reliable system.'</p>

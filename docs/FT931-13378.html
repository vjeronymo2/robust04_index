			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: Retailers miss that festive fun - The Bottom Line THE FESTIVE season for retailers lasted little longer than the traditional 12 days of Christmas, if this week's official sales figures are anything to go by, but that does not mean investors should abandon the sector. The prospect of chancellor Norman Lamont's hoped-for consumer-led recovery - from which retailers, naturally, would be the first to benefit - still seems distant. Most retailers believe consumers will not start spending any extra money they have acquired as a result of lower interest rates until they can be more certain of keeping their jobs, and the value of homes stops falling. There is further anxiety about the possibility of an increase in VAT or national insurance contributions in the Budget in March. Recovery could also be slowed by an increase in retail prices, which many retailers are warning is imminent. They say they can no longer afford to carry the increased cost of imports after sterling's devaluation. But while the sector is likely to continue to underperform the stock market by between 12 and 20 per cent, it is unlikely to collapse. The earnings quality of some of the heavyweight stocks tends to support the sector at the bottom of this range. For the cautious, stocks such as Marks and Spencer and Great Universal Stores offer the prospect of safe, steady growth. Some would include Kingfisher, W H Smith and Boots in this category. However, analysts say there are other shares which could show greater growth potential, even if the economy does not recover, or picks up only slowly. Investors prepared to take some risks might decide to take profits on stocks like M and S and GUS and invest in some with more exciting prospects. The stock widely seen as the hottest in the sector is Storehouse, owner of the BhS and Mothercare chains. 'Storehouse has a momentum all of its own in terms of recovery,' says Kimlan Cook, stores analyst at County NatWest. She adds that the new management, led by the American David Dworkin, has sorted out Storehouse's balance sheet, disposing of the Habitat and Richards chains, and begun to transform the company into a clearly-focused retailer. Moreover, Dworkin's reform process has just started in BhS, and could unlock huge untapped potential in Mothercare. Feelings are more mixed about Burton, the fashion retailing group, which is also being shaken up by new management. Some believe this is another stock that could blossom whether or not the economy improves - although over a longer period than at Storehouse. John Hoerner, chief executive, this month announced the loss of 2,000 full-time jobs but the creation of up to 3,000 part-time ones, in a wide-ranging rationalisation and cost-cutting programme. Observers are divided about whether even the experienced and tough-talking Hoerner can turn around a company with 10 different trading formats - some of which are looking distinctly tired. But with about Pounds 2bn turnover and among the lowest margins in the sector, the scope for growth is huge. Other interesting prospects are offered by the 'quality cyclicals', well-run companies whose fortunes tend to mirror very closely the general state of the economy. MFI, as a furniture retailer and maker, is heavily dependent on a pick-up in the housing market. But with the highest operating margins in the sector, about 60 per cent, any signs of such a pick-up will have a sharp impact on its profits. Argos, essentially a consumer durables retailer, also stands to gain strongly from any recovery in spending. Analysts say it is a well-managed company - one of the retailers best- equipped to prosper. Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, continues to trade well in the UK. White goods could see a big upturn if the housing market improves. Concern over continuing losses at its Silo chain in the US deters some analysts from recommending it. In the meantime, retailers will continue to pray for that recovery, and that next year's Christmas lasts longer than the last. There are, after all, only 280 shopping days to go.</p>

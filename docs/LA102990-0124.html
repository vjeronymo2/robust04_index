			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SITUATION IN GULF WORSENS PROBLEMS FACING AIRLINES  </P> <P> The world's airlines face increasing turbulence because of rising fuel costs  caused by the Persian Gulf situation, the head of the International Air  Transport Assn. said today.  </P> <P> Director General Gunter Eser said in the IATA's annual report that the  financial outlook for airlines, already not very good in the first half of  1990, had been worsened by the crisis.  </P> <P> "Fuel prices have been even more volatile than before and there have been sharp  increases in hull insurance costs for operations in the Middle East," he told  airline heads at their two-day annual gathering.  </P> <P> Fuel costs generally range from 10% to 25% of total operating costs, so any  movement in the price of fuel has a serious effect on the financial health of  airlines.  </P> <P> The price of oil has roughly doubled on world markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait  on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Referring to the Persian Gulf crisis, Eser said: "That is now the biggest cloud  in the sky, creating business uncertainty but also actual hardship."  </P> <P> IATA members agreed in September to raise passenger fares by between 5% and 8%  and cargo rates by 7% to offset higher fuel costs.  </P> <P> The 1990 IATA report showed that the Persian Gulf crisis compounded a two-year  decline in profitability despite gains in both passenger and cargo transport in  1989. This was because interest charges rose by 27% while airlines competed for  increasingly scarce capital to finance their fleets. As a result, net profits  fell 80% to $300 million in 1989, the report said.  </P></p>

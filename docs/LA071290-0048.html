			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOR THOSE WHO FEAR FRIDAY;  </P> <P> SUPERSTITION: FRIDAY THE 13TH IS TOMORROW, BUT FEAR NOT. A NORTHRIDGE CLASS  TEACHES THAT 13'S BAD REPUTATION IS UNFOUNDED.  </P> <P> Thirteen is one of the scariest numbers, but when it lands on a Friday it is  considered the unluckiest of days and is enough to keep people home. But a  Northridge numerologist is trying to ease fears about the odd number by  teaching a class just after this month's Friday the 13th.  </P> <P> "The number 13 is my favorite number," said Freda Amsel, wearing a necklace  with the number 13. "It always turns up in my life and has always meant good  things for me."  </P> <P> She was born on the 13th, and often flies on that date, requesting row 13 on  the plane. The names of her three sons -- whom she had well before she  discovered numerology -- all add up to 13 when translated into numerological  terms. The addresses of homes significant in her life -- her house of birth,  first homes in New York and California, the home of her divorce and her present  home -- all add up to 13. And this year is significant because Amsel turns 58  (5 + 8 = 13).  </P> <P> "Even if the 13 denotes a negative connotation I hope people will see its  positive side," Amsel said.  </P> <P> But the superstitious may be delighted to know that this month's Friday the  13th is the last one until September, 1991.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge professor Eloise Klein Healy, an expert and author about  mythology and legends, said the fear of 13 has always been associated with the  unknown.  </P> <P> "Historically, it has been considered an extremely dangerous number," said  Healy, an English professor. "There are 13 witches in a coven, so it is  associated with witches. It is affiliated with an outside religion and the  magic of numbers. In history, people were afraid of the number 13 because they  feared anything magical -- like black magic. Look was happened to witches."  </P> <P> Numerology is the study of positive and negative vibrations of numbers, made up  by names and birth dates; a person choses to follow the vibrations for good or  evil, Amsel said.  </P> <P> Amsel teaches her class at the Cosmic Connection Metaphysical Bookstore and  Academy in Northridge, where owner Charlene Whitaker has read Tarot cards and  astrology charts for nine years.  </P> <P> "The number 13 got a bad reputation because of this," Whitaker said, flipping  out the "Death Card" from her Tarot deck -- cards used as an ancient form of  fortune telling. The number 13 is on the card with a grotesque skeleton and a  rising sun in the background. "This was never meant to be death as we know it,  but transformation. It's about destroying the old and making room for the new."  That, coupled with the death of Jesus Christ on a Friday made the combination  ominous. He was the 13th one at the dinner table, Amsel pointed out.  </P> <P> "If we wake up thinking it is Friday the 13th and bad things are going to  happen, then we look for bad things to happen," Whitaker said. "Thought creates  form."  </P> <P> But 13 was very lucky for 13 bank employees in Clearwater, Fla., who bet $13 in  the lottery on the Friday the 13th in April and won $9.3 million.  </P> <P> Other significant 13s:  </P> <P> * The "baker's dozen" in Europe means if you order a dozen, you get 13.  Historically, it relates to 12 months of growing and harvesting crops and the  13th is a new beginning of sharing.  </P> <P> * The New York Stock Exchange and many hotels and office buildings have no 13th  floor.  </P> <P> * At 13, Jewish children become adults in bar mitzvahs or bas mitzvahs, another  transformation, Amsel said.  </P> <P> "There are many misconceptions about 13 and the fears are passed on from  generation to generation," Whitaker said. "People consider it fatalistic, until  they learn more about it."  </P> <P> The New Age philosophy of the late 1980s has peaked and people put the  metaphysical stuff they learned to everyday practice, said Whitaker, who has  classes at her bookstore in tea-leaf readings, crystals, self-healing,  spiritual development and meditation. Her brightly lighted, incense-scented  store doesn't carry materials about voodoo, black magic, satanism or  witchcraft.  </P> <P> "A good psychic reminds you of who you are and what your values and priorities  should be, thereby releasing you of fear and worry," Amsel said. "Freed from  your anxieties, you will be open-minded to directing your own course of  action."  </P> <P> Her classes are a bit of a history lesson. "In my class everyone is curious  about the number 13 and even the most skeptical is fascinated by the  information on the dollar bill," Amsel said.  </P> <P> She pulls out a dollar bill and points to the 13 rows of bricks on the pyramid,  a symbol from the secret group of Freemasons that included George Washington,  Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, as cited in "The Seal of the United  States" by Paul Foster Case. The phrases "Annuit Coeptis" (He favors our  undertaking) and "E pluribus unum" (From many, one) have 13 letters, the eagle  carries 13 arrows in his left talon and the peace branch has 13 leaves and 13  olives, according to Case's book. Although the country had 13 colonies to begin  with, Amsel said the symbols are for a more spiritual purpose.  </P> <P> (Amsel's next class on "The Mystery of Numbers" is scheduled at 7 p.m. July 25  at the Cosmic Connection, 9250 Reseda Blvd. Admission is $10.)  </P> <P> "The number is all or nothing at all," Amsel said. "You can make it have  enormous potential for attainment or complete destruction, but it is up to  you."  </P> <P> "Friday the 13th should be thought of like any other day," Whitaker added.  </P></p>

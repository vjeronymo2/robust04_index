			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Observer: Tax tangle The drift and indecision afflicting German government makes itself felt in ever-widening circles. Take the annual conference of German tax accountants in Wurzburg this week. Wilfried Dann, president of the accountants' professional association, has been railing at the growing legal uncertainty plaguing his industry. He has totted up that it is now 16 months since an income tax directive had been classed as a 'final decision'. Instead, the relevant authorities have taken to pushing out directives invariably qualified as 'provisional'. The problem, he concedes, starts with the Karlsruhe constitutional court, which has a backlog of two years or more on key tax decisions. This encourages the accountants to lodge appeals on related cases, which might one day qualify for tax relief. So the tax inspectors attempt to stem the flood of appeals by issuing a counter-flood of provisional memoranda to clarify existing law. Worse and worse, the authorities in the various German Lander issue conflicting 'clarifications'. The result is an appalling cat's cradle for the accountants to sort out. One almost feels sorry for them.</p>

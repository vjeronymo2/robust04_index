			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faustin Twangiramungu, chosen by the Arusha </F> Conference to become transitional prime minister, by Robin  White, in a "neighboring country"; date not given -- first  paragraph is announcer's introduction]    [Text] One of the survivors of the atrocities that  followed the death of President Habyarimana, in which  presidential guardsmen and militias apparently sought out and  slaughtered ministers close to the president, was the man chosen  by the Arusha Conference to become transitional prime minister,  Faustin Twangiramungu. He is in hiding in neighboring country.  Robin White got in touch with him, and asked him if he thought  he had a role in sorting out the mess that Rwandans are in:    [Begin recording] [Twangiramungu] Of course yes. Well, as  far as Rwandans are concerned, most of them have respected the  peace agreement. Therefore, I think I still have a role to  play. Our intention was to have this broad-based transitional  government set in place. But as you are probably informed, we  had some delay tactics initiated mainly by the political party  called the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development] which is the political party of the late president.  What they really wanted was to wage another war against the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and probably win it. But it  appeared that they are not going to win this war.    Secondly, they did not want what we call and what is  contained in this peace aagreement, the power sharing. And we  believe that this power sharing is the only solution to the  situation we have in Rwanda.    [White] So, what you yourself propose should happen now?    [Twangiramungu] Well, what I do propose, is not a military  solution. What I propose is of course a political solution.  And a political solution requires that RPF meets these military  officers and decides the cease-fire. But to get to this  cease-fire, of course, there are some preconditions. In certain  place, they have to accept that... [pauses] to denounce this  government which is self-proclaimed. Second, they have to  (?disband) the Presidential Guard.    [White] It sounds to me as if you have rather more in common  with the rebel RPF than you do with the other side now?    [Twangiramungu] Well, it is not to having common views. I  believe it is a question of being practical and being pragmatic  with regard to the situation which prevails. After all, who  started these incidents which have cost us a lot? This is the  Presidential Guards.    [White] Will you be going to the Arusha peace meeting?    [Twangiramungu] Well, if I am invited, yes I will. And I  think it would be better for me to go there and give my views on  this particular issue. And I am still insisting that I be  invited to go to Arusha. [end recording]</p>

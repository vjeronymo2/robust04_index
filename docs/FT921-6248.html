			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: San Miguel posts 57% advance in profits SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, yesterday reported consolidated net profits for 1991 of 2.81bn pesos (Dollars 116m), an increase of 57 per cent from the previous year. Turnover expanded by 22 per cent in value to 53.3bn pesos despite a decline in sales of many of the beer-and-food company's products. Sales of beer, which usually account for about 60 per cent of San Miguel's annual turnover, declined in line with consumer demand in the general economic slowdown in the country. Earnings per share rose to 5.20 pesos from 3.32 pesos in 1990. The board of directors yesterday proposed a 10 per cent dividend, to be presented for approval at the annual shareholders' meeting on April 21. The company views 1992 with 'cautious optimism'. Its expansion programme has put on stream additional capacity in its beer, ice cream and soft drinks production. The 1991 profits growth reversed a 26 per cent decline in 1990 owing to a sharp increase in operating costs, particularly interest payments. The 1991 profits growth rate was also the highest since 1987. However, non-recurring income contributed substantially to the big rise in profits. The bulk came from the swap of the company's shares in San Miguel Brewery in Hong Kong with new shares, corresponding to a 12 per cent interest, in SHK Hong Kong Industries, which specialises in investing in leading industrial corporations in Hong Kong and Macao. The higher profits were also the result of improved margins and operating efficiency. Since 1990, the company has been undertaking cost-cutting initiatives, including reducing staff and making prepayments of foreign currency loans to take advantage of discounts.</p>

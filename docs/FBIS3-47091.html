			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea, which had a working-level  contact Friday, will need several more meetings to reach an  accord on full-scope inspections of North Korea's seven declared  nuclear sites.    One of these meetings will be early this week, possibly on  Monday, an IAEA official said Sunday on condition of anonymity.    In Friday's meeting, North Korea said it would open just  five  of its nuclear facilities to IAEA inspectors. This was a  reversal of the agreement reached in principle late last year  with the United States on full inspections of all seven declared  sites.    It is also a far cry from the IAEA demand for inclusion in  the full-scope inspections of what are seen by the IAEA as two  key facilities, a radiochemical laboratory (virtually a nuclear  fuel reprocessing facility) and a 5-megawatt reactor, the  official said.    The difference will be discussed in future meetings, in  which  inspection of the two key facilities will be a key issue along  with the timing of the inspections and strength of the  inspection team.</p>

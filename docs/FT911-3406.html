			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (6): Out go curbs, out go funds? - Banking BANK OF Greece officials are professing confidence that when restrictions on long-term capital outflows are finally lifted next month, there will be no large-scale flight of funds. But if a note of trepidation creeps into their voices, it is hardly surprising. The liberalisation, which will bring Greece into line with its European Community partners by permitting individual Greek investors to buy property and securities abroad, is already more than a year overdue. Successive governments obtained an extension, citing a steadily worsening current account deficit that reached Dollars 3.6bn last year, over 5 per cent of GDP. The deficit is shrinking only slowly, but a commitment was made to freeing outward capital movement this spring under the terms of the EC emergency balance of payments loan to Greece. Mr Dimitris Chalikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, belives the benefits of liberalisation will quickly outweigh any adverse effects on the balance of payments. 'We're not very worried about the effect on the current account deficit. It won't be so large. The important factor is the confidence it brings, which will encourage capital inflows as well.' There are no longer any restrictions on inward capital movement, or on direct investment abroad. Greek companies are already allowed to borrow from foreign banks, in foreign currency if they wish. But until last year, total Greek purchases of foreign securities were limited to Ecu50m (Dollars 60m) yearly in EC and European Investment Bank issues. At present, Greek mutual funds can place no more than 25 per cent of their portfolios in foreign stocks. The average Greek businessman still aspires to owning property in England or Switzerland and a portfolio of Wall Street stocks, though the flourishing equity and property markets in Athens mean such investments may be as much a status symbol as a hedge against the spectre of political or economic turmoil at home. The Bank of Greece view is that the serious money has already left because wealthy Greeks have little difficulty in bypassing regulations in order to transfer capital abroad. Mr Chalikias says: 'If we consider the structure of foreign exchange receipts, invisibles are the most important item and private capital inflow is a very large item. This structure makes it relatively easy for capital to be exported unofficially.' Nonetheless, a steady trickle of funds abroad can be expected as smaller Greek investors experiment with purchases of foreign securities or buy second homes in parts of western Europe where prices compare favourably with those in Greece. On a lesser scale, lifting the current yearly ceiling of Dollars 300 on credit card purchases abroad, also included in the liberalisation, will add to the outflow. Once the initial shock is absorbed, 'this move will prove a catalyst for changing the entire Greek financial landscape,' according to Mr George Zavvos, European Parliament member who chairs the recently established committee for the reform of the Greek financial system. The committee's aim is to implement EC policy on banking and securities as swiftly as possible. This involves preparing a considerable amount of new legislation. While the Bank of Greece has been steadily deregulating the banking system over the past five years, little has been done to overhaul its legal framework. Mr Zavvos, who used to work for the European Commission, should be the ideal person for the job: he was responsible for drafting the Community's Second Banking Directive. 'We have one of the most antiquated banking systems in Europe, so we needed a mechanism for change. The image of Greek regulatory institutions needs to be reformed. Integrity and efficiency are terribly necessary if we are to start competing with the rest of the Community.' The committee has already prepared legislative decrees on solvency ratios and capital adequacy arrangements that will bring Greece into line with standards worldwide. A law is being drafted on banks' accounting plans; a much-delayed scheme for guaranteeing deposits is nearly complete. Improvements in prudential supervision are also high on the agenda. Testimony in recent weeks by Mr Chalikias and other Bank of Greece officials at the trial of several former cabinet ministers accused of involvement in a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the privately owned Bank of Crete revealed that, without government support, the central bank was unable to mount an effective investigation of its own. Once the new legislation is in place, the state-owned Greek banks, which still control more than 70 per cent of deposits but have largely failed to grasp the opportunities offered by deregulation, will come under much stronger pressure to modernise, Mr Zavvos says. 'The state banks have a competitive advantage in their proximity to the client plus their networks all over Greece. Their unions are weaker than they used to be, so there is a chance to improve efficiency. But they need up-to-date technology and management.' For the 22 foreign banks, the reforms will mean 'a more level playing field,' according to one foreign manager. Though the foreign banks complain about the vagueness of existing legislation, it has not deterred them from expanding their retail banking operations or from becoming the leading players in handling mergers and acquisitions. The revised framework will also reinforce the position of the two leading private Greek banks, which between them hold 14 per cent of deposits. Both have carved out profitable niches, expanding into leasing and brokerage activities in recent years, while avoiding involvement with the loss-making public sector corporations. 'The private banks have already done well out of deregulation. We're more flexible. It's a question of quality of services. Our bank is modelled on the kind of helpful high street bank that doesn't exist any more,' says Mr Constantine Capsaskis, chairman of Ergobank, which looks after small businessmen and is one of the most profitable banks in Europe.</p>

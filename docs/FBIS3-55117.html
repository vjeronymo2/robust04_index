According  to a recent statement by a majlis leader, the majlis has  indisputable influence over an absolute majority of voters among  the Crimean-Tatars.    On the other hand, Vashtiy Abdurayimov, the leader of the  National Movement of Crimean Tatars, who became head of the  organization after the death of its founder and leader Yuriy  Osmanov, stressed that the majlis was in fact betraying the  national interests of the Crimean Tatars. In Abdurayimov's  opinion, the Crimean Tatars must by all means vote in the  Crimean presidential elections in order to elect a president who  would more or less suit the Crimean-Tatar people. According to  some sources, Abdurayimov is inclined to support the candidacy  of Ivan Yermakov, Ukraine's presidential representative in  Sevastopol, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council [as  received].    Majlis leader Mustafa Dzhamilev is known to have recently  met  President Kravchuk. Although the results of the talks are not  known, local observers believe they reached a certain, if not  full understanding.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition parties today boycotted Fiji's  parliament after Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka warned that  there might be another coup against the government and that it  might involve bloodshed. Mr. Rabuka, who led the two coups in  1987, told parliament during a debate on crime and punishment,  there could be no guarantee Fiji would not have another coup nor  that it would be bloodless as was the case in 1987. The prime  minister said some people blamed present lawlessness in Fiji on  the 1987 coups but he would not apologize for having overthrown  the elected government of the late Dr. Timoci Bavandra.    Mr. Rabuka pointed to a recent speech in which President  Ratu  Sir Kamisese Mara warned that poor urban Fijians could become a  destabilizing force if their situation was not improved.  Referring to the fact that Fiji's Indian population represent  the bulk of the business class, Mr. Rabuka said indigenous  Fijians felt disadvantaged and that their (?souls) were  starving. With new circumstances he said no one could guarantee  there would not be another coup. Following Mr. Rabuka's remark,  members of the opposition National Federation Party and the Fiji  Labor Party walked out and refused to return causing the House  of Representatives to adjourn its proceedings until tomorrow.</p>

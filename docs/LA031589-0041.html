			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL MAY HAVE TO TALK TO PLO, BAKER DECLARES  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, hinting at a dramatic reversal of  American policy, said Tuesday that there may be no realistic way to make peace  in the Middle East unless Israel negotiates directly with the Palestine  Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> In an appearance before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Baker said that  the Bush Administration ultimately may conclude that the PLO is so popular  among Palestinian residents of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip  that peace talks would be impossible without including the organization. Israel  steadfastly refuses to recognize the PLO.  </P> <P> Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is visiting Washington, immediately  reaffirmed Israel's refusal to deal in any way with the PLO, an organization  that he said is guilty of the "worst atrocities we've ever seen since World War  II."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It May Be That You Can't'  </P> <P> But, declared Baker: "If you can't have direct negotiations that are meaningful  that do not involve negotiations with the PLO . . . we would then have to see  negotiations between Israelis and representatives of the PLO. It may be that  you can have meaningful negotiations that don't involve the PLO; it may be that  you can't."  </P> <P> For more than a decade, the U.S. government has joined Israel in excluding the  PLO from the Middle East peace process. For instance, former Secretary of State  George P. Shultz maintained that Palestinians could be represented in  negotiations only as part of a joint delegation led by Jordan. Although Shultz  agreed late last year to launch an unprecedented U.S. dialogue with the PLO --  after its chairman, Yasser Arafat, renounced the use of terrorism -- he never  suggested that Israel might have to deal with the organization directly.  </P> <P> For its part, the PLO for many years refused even to consider peaceful  negotiations with Israel. However, Arafat said recently that his organization  is ready for such talks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Follow Arens-Bush Talks  </P> <P> Baker's comments, apparently intended both to warn Israeli hard-liners that  they can no longer take for granted U.S. support for their policy of isolating  the PLO and to strengthen moderation among Palestinians, came less than 24  hours after Arens conferred with President Bush, Baker, Vice President Dan  Quayle and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. The Israeli foreign  minister said that the U.S. officials made no such suggestion in their  face-to-face meetings.  </P> <P> "None of them urged Israel to talk to the PLO," Arens said Tuesday in answer to  a question after a speech to the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East  Policy. "We need peace more than anybody else and we don't need to be urged,"  Arens said. "But we need (negotiating) partners."  </P> <P> He said that Israel is following a three-track approach to negotiations that  calls for encouraging Jordan's King Hussein to come to the table, identifying  "legitimate interlocutors" among Palestinian residents of the West Bank and  Gaza Strip and bringing any other Arab state into the process.  </P> <P> He conceded that Hussein and virtually all prominent Palestinians refuse to  enter negotiations with Israel and argue that Israel should, instead, talk to  the PLO. But he said that this is because of PLO intimidation.  </P> <P> "The PLO wants to impose itself as a negotiating partner," Arens said. But he  said the Israeli government is determined not to "give the PLO that  recognition" because to do so would be to encourage terrorism, undermine  Hussein's rule in Jordan and cause dissension in the Arab population of Israel  proper.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Arens obliquely conceded the PLO's popularity with West Bank  residents when he said of municipal elections in the West Bank in 1976 that  "nobody ever maintained that they were not free or fair." PLO-backed candidates  won almost every contest in 1976. The Israeli military government canceled  subsequent elections because, Israeli officers said, the PLO was certain to win  again.  </P> <P> Rep. Matthew F. McHugh (D-N.Y.) told Baker during the House subcommittee  hearing that although he wished it were not so, he knows of no legitimate  Palestinian leadership outside the PLO.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We May Conclude That'  </P> <P> "We may ultimately conclude that," Baker said.  </P> <P> For the time being, he added, the Administration supports negotiations between  Israel and Palestinians without specifying who those Palestinians should be. If  representative Palestinians can be found outside of the PLO, Baker indicated,  that would be the best result; but, if not, Israel would have to consider  talking to the PLO.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Trust  </P> <P> Yair Tsaban, a member of the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) from the leftist  Mapam Party, told a seminar at the Brookings Institution in Washington that  Israelis may not trust the PLO but that a growing number of them have concluded  that some form of recognition is inevitable.  </P> <P> "The only way to examine the intentions (of the PLO) is around the negotiating  table," Tsaban said.  </P> <P> Tsaban was in the United States for a just-concluded meeting at Columbia  University in New York that was attended by Israeli leftists and  representatives of the PLO.  </P></p>

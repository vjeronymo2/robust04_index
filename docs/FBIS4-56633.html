			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santiago, 4 May (EFE) -- Today, some Chilean  officials and congressmen predicted that complex negotiations  are required if we are to either sign a free trade agreement  with the United States or join NAFTA. They all, however, lauded  the steps taken.    On 3 May, Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and U.S.  Trade Representative Michael Kantor agreed in Washington to hold  preliminary talks by late May and formal negotiations  tentatively by mid-September. [passage omitted]    Senator Sebastian Pinera of the rightist National Renewal  Party (RN) said the step taken is positive, "and we now expect  the United States to sit at the negotiating table and make it  come true." Pinera noted: "There have been many words but few  accomplishments," adding that "four years have passed since  (former) President George Bush promised Chile would follow  Mexico."    Juan Salazar, director of economic relations at the Foreign  Ministry, expressed greater optimism, stating that "Chile is  prepared" to start negotiations because it meets the  requirements set by the U.S. Government concerning trade  agreements. Salazar added that he believes there is a somewhat  unjustified alarm in Chile about the U.S. requirements because  the two countries already engaged in consultations and exchanged  views on legislation, trade procedures, and the degree of  economic opening. In remarks to the newspaper LA NACION,  Salazar said: "Chile is at quite an advanced stage in these  areas. This is why the United States puts us in first place."</p>

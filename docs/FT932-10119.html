			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Professionals who want manufacturing taken seriously: Proposals to improve the image and status of engineers THE board of a much-criticised Pounds 100m business will meet today to hear how a new relationship between head office and 42 diverse affiliates - leading ultimately, perhaps, to a full-blown merger - could sharpen its image and improve its products. Another troubled British manufacturing company looking for a fresh start? Up to a point, yes. The business is the UK professional engineering structure, the 'board' is the Engineering Council, and the affiliates are the 42 professional institutions, big and small. Collectively, the institutions and the council have a turnover of Pounds 100m, and their most important product is their engineers. But the affiliates are not happy. Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of Rolls-Royce and a council member, said: 'Why is manufacturing industry so undervalued in this country? It is more than a coincidence that the engineering profession is also under-rated and undervalued by the government and by the general public. The engineer is seen as the guy who has come to mend the gas cooker.' Mr Harrison and other industrialists on the council, including Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, and Sir Anthony Gill, chairman of Lucas Industries, are due to attend today's meeting. The professions and the council, which acts as an umbrella body, have a key role in attracting young people into engineering, developing the skills of professional engineers, and setting standards. A key to that is to raise the status of engineers among the general public, the City, and the government. Companies that employ engineers are watching the negotiations. Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'The long-term success of the engineering industry and the profession are interdependent.' At today's meeting Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council, will outline proposals from a steering group for a 'new relationship' of co-operation between the council and the institutions. This could lead to the creation of a single body in which the institutions are grouped into six divisions. The meeting foreshadows the start of a nationwide exercise designed to stimulate debate of the reform proposals, which were creating controversy even before the ink was dry. Sir John sees two important industrial dimensions to the plans. The first is the importance of a strong single body for setting standards of knowledge and skills on which industry can depend. The second is to develop engineering as a platform for a career in management. 'We need to create an environment where engineers are more able to reach the boardroom than under the present arrangements,' he said. 'There are too many accountants in the boardroom, but that is the fault of the engineering profession.' Achieving this would require a more flexible system, producing engineers with more 'interdisciplinary' abilities than are produced by the present system, where each institution retains its right to accredit courses. 'All industrialists are asking for this,' Sir John said. The four big institutions have already said they believe the case for a single body has not yet been made, and Sir John admits it will not be possible to decide on that until the new relationship has been established. But industry has welcomed the proposals in full. Sir Colin, who chairs the council's standing committee on industry, said issues such as standard-setting and developing engineering in the education system were much better handled by a single body.</p>

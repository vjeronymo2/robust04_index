			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: 700 TO BREAKFAST WITH BUSH, BREN  </P> <P> "Wish you were here!" chirp telephone operators at the  Irvine-Hilton-turned-Hyatt-Regency.  </P> <P> Tonight, President George Bush is going to take them up on it. He plans to  arrive about 9 at the inn owned by GOP big spender, billionaire Donald Bren.  </P> <P> The President, who will spend the night, is coming to Orange County to attend a  fund-raising breakfast Friday for the California Republican Party. Afterward,  say insiders, Bush is off to Los Angeles for lunch and then to Hawaii for a  Pacific Rim mini-summit. (Rumors are flying that Bush will return to Orange  County on Nov. 3 to help get the vote out for Republican gubernatorial  candidate Sen. Pete Wilson. The White House will only confirm that he will  return to California.)  </P> <P> The price tag for the early-bird special? An eye-opening $500 per person.  Seven-hundred guests are expected to crowd the Hyatt ballroom at 7:30. The  breakfast, which begins at 8, will feature California fruit plate, orange  juice, Danish pastries and croissants. (You never see mouthwatering items like  eggs Benedict at these early-morning political powwows. Trims the profit.)  </P> <P> Parties Plus of Los Angeles is whipping up the decor: red, white and blue  balloon columns (flanking the dais where Bush is expected to hold court with  event co-sponsors Bren and George Argyros) and Old Glory-themed centerpieces.  </P> <P> Should you be thinking about spending the night in the same hotel as the  President, forget it. Eighty-nine rooms are already reserved for the White  House press alone.  </P> <P> An afternoon with Helmut: Restaurateur Helmut Reiss threw open the carved door  of his Munich-inspired Laguna Beach manse on Sunday to supporters of the Laguna  Art Museum.  </P> <P> Up for sampling: the fine wines and continental kind of fare that has made his  Rothschild's restaurant in Corona del Mar a favorite of Orange County's smart  set. (Just last weekend, Reiss catered a very posh sit-down affair for  developer William Lyon at his Coto de Caza mansion.)  </P> <P> Up for viewing: Reiss' vintage Mercedes-Benz automobile collection. "I thought  this would be a fun party for the guys," said Dolores Milhous. Milhous -- the  new president of the museum board -- and Marla Bird were co-chairwomen of the  bash, the last hurrah in the "Perspectives" party series that poured about  $40,000 into museum coffers.  </P> <P> Next up for museum buffs: "Novel Ideas," a benefit auction where party-goers  get to bid on paperback novels that have been incorporated into works of art by  125 artists, including Laddie John Dill, Sam Francis and Jorg Dubin. The  artworks will be previewed at the museum the week before the Nov. 17 auction.  </P> <P> Encore: Watch for the Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center to  stage a video party in the Black Box Theatre of the Center on Nov. 9. Models  who performed in the Guilds' recent fashion parade at the Center will finally  get to see the show, which was filmed by professionals. The Guilds have already  set the date for next year's "The Center of Fashion." Mark your calendar for  Sept. 20. The gala will kick off the Center's fifth anniversary celebration.  Carlton Burnett will produce and direct.  </P></p>

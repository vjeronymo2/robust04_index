			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Companies stuck on the rocky road to recovery: Andrew Bolger hears the very grim message coming from British boardrooms STERLING's devaluation and the consequent stock market rally have tended to obscure the grim message emerging from Britain's boardrooms: UK companies have just endured a very bleak summer. Managers, who had seen their hopes for a rapid post-election recovery fizzle out by June, said trading continued to be tough in the third quarter of the year. Although devaluation and lower interest rates do hold out the prospect of some longer-term relief, the impact is unlikely to feed through for some time. Imperial Chemical Industries told Hoare Govett, one of its brokers, that demand was slow in July and very weak in August. Anecdotal evidence from September suggested little improvement. Hoare Govett duly downgraded its forecast of the chemicals and pharmaceutical group's third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 196m for the same period last year. Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at the broker, said there was limited room for improvement next year. He downgraded ICI's full-year profits for 1992 from Pounds 780m to Pounds 620m because of poor demand. Stockbrokers last week cut forecasts of next year's profits from Hanson, the UK conglomerate, after meeting the company. Just before sterling's devaluation, Courtaulds Textiles, the UK's second biggest textiles and clothing manufacturer, issued a stark warning on prospects for recovery, saying that 'there are no signs of improvement in trading conditions'. Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said his main concern had been the pressures his company would have faced next year, had the pound continued to trade near the Dollars 2 level. He said: 'There really was the most enormous squeeze looming over the hill. Obviously we are very relieved that prospect has been removed.' Retailers have also had a difficult time, with the short-lived boost in sales immediately after the election rapidly being overtaken by a plunge in consumer confidence as the unemployment outlook continued to darken over the summer months. Britain's unemployment total rose in August to a five-year high of 2.8m. The increase in the month - at more than 47,000 - was much higher than expected. The seasonally adjusted increase was the 28th consecutive monthly rise and the largest in one month since January. Manufacturing output was flat in July month-on-month and showed no growth in the three months to the end of July. Kingfisher, one of the UK's biggest retailing groups, said: 'A good month has been followed by a bad one. Some of our markets have looked stronger only to fade away again. It is a tough world out there for retailers and it is not going to get any easier.' Mr Geoff Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman and chief executive, added: 'If your house price has fallen, you are afraid of losing your job, and you have high levels of personal debt you are bloody well not going to go out and spend money no matter where interest rates are.' Sales of new cars in August rose by only 1.7 per cent compared with the same month last year, dashing hopes that this year would mark the end to the three-year decline in demand for new vehicles. Ford UK and Rolls-Royce Motors Cars have announced a total of 2,500 redundancies, following other big reductions announced by Jaguar, Aston Martin and Group Lotus. The chain reaction caused by reductions in orders from big companies was blamed for the 53 per cent increase in business failures in the third quarter of the year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, said the 46,545 failures in the first nine months of this year had already surpassed the figure for the whole of last year. The 457-point fall in the FT-SE 100 between May and its pre-devaluation trough in August was largely fuelled by a string of negative messages from companies to analysts. The proportion of resulting changes in analysts' forecasts which were downgrades rose to 80 per cent in the late summer, according to BZW. In spite of all these downgrades, most analysts continued to take an over-optimistic view of companies' likely performance. Even if companies will not see much benefit from a lower pound and interest rates before next year, devaluation has certainly come to the rescue of analysts, who would have otherwise had to continue downgrading. Mr Mark Brown, market strategist for UBS Philips &amp; Drew, said his house had persistently highlighted the inevitability of sterling devaluation, but had still been caught out by the speed and manner in which it came about. He said: 'The effect of early devaluation has broadly been to offset downgrades that were already in train.' Devaluation caused Mr Brown to increase his forecast of industrial profits from 10 to 14 per cent next year, following a 4 per cent average rise this year. He has left his dividend growth number unchanged at 2 per cent for this year and 6 per cent next year. UBS Philips &amp; Drew stands by its market targets of 2,700 on the FT-SE at the end of this year and 3,000 by the middle of next year. But Mr Brown admits: 'Our existing market targets were looking increasingly bold before devaluation occurred and have really only been salvaged by recent events. We would not choose to pour cold water on the market at this level, but the road to economic recovery is still an extraordinarily rocky one.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      INTERIM PROFIT RESULTS TO DATE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Proporation Pre-tax profits                    1992         of results     1992 (percent year       1991      interim results    to date     full-year on year)          full year       to date        (percent)    forecast  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital            -34.1           -2.2             65          +5.6 Consumer            -0.6           +2.3             28          +6.5 Industrial          -5.9           -4.2             25          +5.4 All-Share          -12.5           -0.4             34          +9.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UBS Phillips &amp; Drew  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

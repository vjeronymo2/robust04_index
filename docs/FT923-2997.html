			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Door to dialogue still open THE Liberal Democrats are set to leave open the door to a dialogue with the Labour party on issues such as electoral reform and social policy in spite of the clear opposition at this week's conference to any form of electoral pact, Philip Stephens writes. Senior party strategists said that a formal motion on the issue of co-operation with other political parties would bow to the fierce antagonism among grassroots activists to a deal with Labour. Mr Paddy Ashdown and his colleagues in the leadership acknowledge that any attempt in the short term to open up formal discussions with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, would prompt a backlash among large sections of the party. So the motion, due for debate by the conference tomorrow, will explicitly rule out pacts. It is understood, however, that Mr Ashdown is confident that the motion will be sufficiently ambiguous to provide scope for informal contacts. The Liberal Democrat leader has little expectation that Mr Smith will move in the immediate future to explore the scope for an anti-government coalition. But Mr Ashdown remains convinced that a loose alliance - probably short of an electoral pact - is likely to provide the only convincing option for the two opposition parties up to the general election due by mid 1997. One suggestion is that the conclusions next year of Labour's commission on electoral reform - which may recommend PR-based elections to the House of Commons - may provide the catalyst for talks. The judgment being made of the Labour leader's likely response is that for the moment his preoccupation with internal reforms will preclude any public nods in the direction of co-operation with the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Ashdown expects Labour, like the Liberal Democrats, to keep its options open.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: More state cash expected for Christiania Bank NORWAY is expected to announce today a further cash transfer to Christiania Bank and demand that the bank implement tougher measures to improve margins and efficiency. The announcement will coincide with the publication of Christiania's accounts for 1991 which, according to local analysts, will show a pre-tax loss in the region of NKr6bn (Dollars 932m) following credit losses of around NKr10bn. Last December, the government took control of Christiania after the bank's equity had been wiped out by huge trading losses. The government has already transferred NKr7.6bn to Christiania. Sources close to the bank said it has not yet been decided how big the new state cash transfer would be. Christiania earlier warned that it would need fresh state support of at least NKr2bn to meet new equity capital requirements. The government is understood to have warned the bank to improve income - such as raising charges - cut costs and improve the performance of its loss-making loan portfolio. Also, the bank will have to come up with an improved organisational structure. Last autumn, under the leadership of Mr Borger Lenth, Christiania was reorganised into two divisions. At that time, the bank announced its intention to cut costs by NKr580m during 1992. For the nine months ended September 1991, the bank plunged into net losses of NKr7.3bn, against a 1990 loss of NKr555m. Credit losses rose to NKr3.79bn from NKr1.66bn. The state-backed Bank Insurance Fund, established with capital of NKr5bn, and boosted late last year to NKr11bn, has been drained to around NKr550m by heavy claims for cash. It is widely expected that Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, the finance minister, will have to call on parliament as soon as April for additional funds to prop up the country's ailing banking system.</p>

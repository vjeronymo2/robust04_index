			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press Center of the Naval Forces of Ukraine: "The Command </F> of the Black Sea Fleet Is Violating Existing Agreements"]    [Text] In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Vice  Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, chief of staff and first deputy  commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine [Viyskovo-Morski Syly  Ukrayiny], stated that the command of the Black Sea Fleet, which  de jure remains subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and  Russia, has lately committed a series of violations of existing  agreements with respect to the Fleet. He reported that in fact  the Black Sea Fleet command does its best to ignore the  Ukrainian side and is directly subordinated to the command of  the Navy of the Russian Federation. The recent unannounced  training exercises conducted by a large group of ships of the  Black Sea Fleet, which were not approved by the appropriate  structures, serve as further evidence of this. Temporary  regulations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are  being introduced in the formations [zyednannya] and units of the  Fleet. An earnest effort is under way to educate Black Sea Fleet  personnel exclusively in the traditions of the Russian Army and  Navy, despite the fact that more than 50 percent of the men  serving in the Fleet are conscripts from Ukraine.    This is particularly evident in the case of the naval  infantry brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. In violation of the  existing agreement regarding manning the Fleet with equal  numbers of conscripts from Ukraine and Russia, brigade personnel  who have been discharged into the reserves are being replaced  exclusively by conscripts from the Russian Federation. The men  in this formation are being told that they are serving in a  naval infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Russia. This is  eloquently confirmed by the fact that the members of the brigade  wear Russian insignia on their uniforms, that the St. Andrew's  flag flies over the staff headquarters, and by certain other  facts. In addition, there has recently been a marked increase in  office facilities and equipment [orhtekhnika] provided for the  subunits of this formation, and the number of personnel in the  brigade has more than doubled.    It is Oleksiy Ryzhenko's view that in order to prevent a  rise  in tensions in the Crimean region, the commander of the Black  Sea Fleet must do everything in his power to ensure that no  actions are taken in violation of existing agreements and the  principles of equality and brotherhood established in the  relations between the people of Ukraine and Russia and the Armed  Forces of our two states.</p>

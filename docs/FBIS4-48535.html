			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tollys Bebo: "An Unduly Custom-Tailored Law" -- </F> first paragraph NOTRE TEMPS introduction; quotation marks as  published]    [Text] A bill concerning the electoral code, which is  being drafted for the government by the Interior Ministry,  should be submitted to the National Assembly soon for discussion  and approval. Although there is nothing to criticize about the  initiative, which meets the wishes of almost the entire  political class, the same cannot be said of certain  repercussions which, in some cases, are rather confusing.    The need in this new political context to clean up or even  remodel the Ivorian electoral code in its present form is  unanimously accepted by almost all the leading electoral  partners. This has been the case for ages. Back in November  1992, Mr. Henri Konan Bedie, then the speaker of the National  Assembly, publicly called for a new electoral code, while in  Ouragahio. A few months later, in March 1993, his party, the  Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], stated during its  conclave that the Ivorian electoral code "must be judiciously  and moderately reviewed...." Mr. Bernard Zadi Zaourou of the  Union of Social Democrats has made this one of his conditions  for remaining in the government. "The 1990 Electoral Code must  not be functioning in 1995.... (otherwise) I will leave  government and give the reasons for my action." Leaders from the  Union of Democratic Forces, which is composed of six political  parties -- the Ivorian Workers Party, the Liberal Party of Cote  d'Ivoire, the UND [expansion unknown], the Democratic and Social  Movement, the PPS [expansion unknown], and the African Party for  Ivorian Rebirth -- are calling for a new electoral code. It  also known that the Ivorian Popular Front [FPI] has made the  drafting of a new code one of the highlights of its program,  stating that it constitutes one base for a free and open  election. It even presented a list of proposals to former Prime  Minister Alassane Dramane Ouattara -- a gesture which it  reiterated with his successor, Daniel Kablan Duncan.    All this goes to show that the leading political  protagonists  on the national political scene, who are the first concerned by,  or at least the most attentive to, the electoral code, want  something new. People believe in the advent of this new system,  because the government office in charge of the elections let the  people have a glimmer of hope. Reporting the remarks of one of  Mr. Emile Constant Bombet's advisers in December 1992, which at  the time we attributed to leaks, we published the following:  "Leaks coming from the Interior Ministry say that by 1993, or by  1994 at the latest, a roundtable conference made up of all the  political parties will be held, in order to reach a minimum  consensus on a new electoral code. The office presently in  charge of elections says it is ready to work towards such a  rapprochement."    However, in practice, instead of fostering rapprochement  among the political parties in order to obtain this minimum  consensus on a new electoral code, Mr. Bombet has chosen to  draft an "electoral bill" which, on behalf of the government, he  is about to submit to the National Assembly. Between the  initial intent and this rehash, what could have happened? It  would seem that there was no consultation -- most political  party leaders that we have approached say that they do not know  anything about such a bill.    The luckiest person in this situation is Professor Hubert  Oulaye, an FPI electoral expert, who is also the chairman of the  Independent National Electoral Commission -- a body set up by  the FPI. Mr. Oulaye, upon reading the bill, was surprised that  no consultations or referendum had been held, considering that  many election results from 1990 were contested, even if no  concrete action was taken on them. Furthermore, he added,  "there is no country in the subregion today which went to the  polls without going through consultations and an improvement of  the conditions of the electoral system." In any case, Mr.  Bombet's new electoral code is here and will surely be submitted  to the nation's representatives for consideration. As far as we  are concerned, we need to know what it says, in addition to its  worth.    The electoral bill is comprised of 136 articles assembled  into three sections. Right from the first section -- the common  general provisions, and the first chapter -- the electorate --  we enter into what constitutes one of the major themes of the  current political debate. Article 3 tells us that, naturally,  Ivorian nationals are the voters, but in addition there are also  "non-nationals from the Economic Community of West African  States [ECOWAS], in conformity with the agreement relating to  citizenship in the community, and shall be registered on the  voters' list." Voting by ECOWAS nationals is presented by the  government as an innovation in the explanatory text. Thus  "voting is no longer, as in the past, reserved for non-Ivorians  of African origin, but only for nationals of ECOWAS member  countries, in conformity with the agreement...."    Unfortunately, a good number of jurists unanimously admit  that the ECOWAS protocol does not confer any legal rights on  ECOWAS citizens. The recognition of ECOWAS citizen's rights is  left to the discretion of ECOWAS member countries but that does  not make them legal. The protocol does not define the rights  that ECOWAS nationals can enjoy once they are outside their own  country, especially when they are in another ECOWAS member  country.    Simply put, the citizenship referred to in the protocol has  never been defined let alone granting any electoral rights to  citizens. Certainly, the protocol mentions the free movement of  persons but this does not imply the automatic granting of civic  rights. The jurists view, coupled with the fact that only three  countries have signed the famous protocol, shows that the  government might need other arguments to support its action  short of imposing its electoral code.    Again, Mr. Oulaye is of the view that Article 3 poses three  kinds of problems in regard to ethics and safeguarding national  sovereignty. First, foreigners have voted in Cote d'Ivoire from  1960 to 1990 in violation of Article 5 of the Constitution which  reserves voting rights exclusively for Ivorians. Our lawmakers  who have so far passed electoral laws have done so without  amending the Constitution. They were fully aware of the  unconstitutionality of their action. However, they did take  care to ensure that those electoral laws were provisional.  Curiously, however, the new electoral law is not a provisional  but a definite law.    According to Mr. Oulaye, the government does not want to  amend the Constitution. It wants to pass a law that clearly  violates the Constitution -- it is fully aware of the fact --  whereas it would be more logical to amend the Constitution or to  adapt the new law to it.    From the ethical standpoint, foreigners are generally more  exposed to pressure, manipulation, and intimidation. The fact  that foreigners are more vulnerable psychologically paves the  way for fraud in which some relish. What is still more serious  is the fact that ECOWAS citizens, who may be called upon to  vote, are not obliged to face the consequences of their  electoral act. In the event of a tragedy -- in the extreme case  of a civil war for example -- other countries will come and  collect their nationals while Ivorians, who have nowhere to go,  will at best be granted refugee status. Here lies the  difference which is not at all a small one.    Another major concern that Article 3 will surely cause is  the  failure to indicate the duration of stay which makes an ECOWAS  citizen eligible to vote. The ECOWAS citizen is simply being  asked to register to vote. It is easily imagined that only one  trip is enough for an ECOWAS citizen to qualify to vote in Cote  d'Ivoire especially when it is common knowledge that the voters  register is classified as a secret state document which the  public can access only on election day. One can just imagine  the implications.    Moreover, the document is full of contradictions and  discrimination. Although an ECOWAS citizen -- even the one who  is just passing through -- is allowed to vote, Article 5  paragraph 1 states that "those who have acquired Ivorian  nationality for less than five years or by marriage" do not have  the right to vote. So, a period of five years is necessary for  those who have the courage to apply for Ivorian citizenship and  who are therefore prepared to fulfill their obligations and to  face the consequences of their decision to accept this status,  to be eligible to vote.    Mr. Oulaye agrees that all laws more or less fix a deadline  for eligibility to vote which is five years in the case of Cote  d'Ivoire, just the timeframe necessary to show one's patriotism.  However, Mr. Oulaye does not understand why restrictions should  be imposed on a person who wants to be Ivorian whereas nothing  is required of a foreigner, who is just passing through Cote  d'Ivoire and whose vote can upset our political system.    "Is there something in the wind?" The question needs to be  raised because the provisions of this bill are far from  reflecting the earlier concerns expressed by the PDCI during its  recent conclave where it was stated, notably: "Concerning the  issue of voting by foreigners, it is necessary to state and  specify that naturalization at a foreigner's request and in  conformity with preconditions that are yet to be defined, might  be the most appropriate solution in so far as applicants have  economic interests in our country."    Who stands to gain from this change in stand just a few  months ahead of the elections? Clearly, the debate will be  rowdy and bitter even outside the Parliament buildings where the  bill is expected to be debated. One often forgets that Cote  d'Ivoire is one of the few countries where nearly half of the  population is made up of men and women who have chosen to live  in this country without, for that matter, opting for Ivorian  nationality. This percentage, which is far above what is termed  the tolerance level, is problematic and requires a certain  amount of realism that excludes demagogy, passion, and electoral  concerns. It might be the best way of preparing the ground for  xenophobia which will not fail to be expressed at the least  provocation.    The intentions of the bill's authors appear to be even less  clear when Articles 7 and 8 are examined. According to Article  7, the voters register shall be unique, permanent, and  public...and shall be placed at the disposal of all voters.  Thus, we learn that the voters register shall be made public.  This implies that the administration is not compelled to  publish it. It is up to voters to go to the administration to  consult the register, an extra effort that men and women of our  towns and villages will be expected to make.    The establishment of a voters register is too serious and  complex an issue for its sensitization aspect to be neglected,  unless...and talking about the voters register, Interior  Minister Bombet has officially announced the beginning of the  revision of the voters register to prefects and mayors but it is  only at Territorial Administration Director Ipaud Lago's office  and at some obscure places in Abidjan that one is aware of this  exercise, where posters (apparently) aimed at informing the  general public, indicate how to register, where to register, who  should register, how to check on one's registration, and so on.  Too bad for those who do not know where to find Mr. Ipaud  Lago's office and other chosen places.    Finally, looking at Article 13 of the bill which says: "The  modalities for establishing, revising, rectifying, publishing,  and displaying the voters register shall be determined by a  decree issued at a cabinet meeting," everything becomes  understandable and explainable. Thus, instead of a law  codifying the registration and a ministerial decree taking care  of the implementation of the exercise, it is the interior  minister who is in charge of choosing when and how the exercise  will be carried out. The whole bill is conceived in the same  vein. Even provisions which would be more or less acceptable to  everybody are immediately nullified because in the final  analysis it is the interior minister who will issue a decree on  its implementation. The setting up of a voters register  commission, whose functions will be determined by ministerial  decree is envisaged. Furthermore, a commission for the  distribution of voters cards -- an important phase in the  electoral process, especially in the tropics -- will be entirely  controlled by the administration which will appoint its members  among whom will be dignitaries (sic) but no political party  representatives.    Meanwhile, all results shall be sent directly to the  Interior  Ministry contrary to Article 59 which states: "Each returning  officer shall send a copy of the electoral report to the  ministry in charge of the elections by the fastest means  possible and through the head of the constituency under which  his polling stations operate..." The change is certainly  related to what happened in Kani during the 1990 presidential  elections. In fact, that example obviously inspired the  Interior Ministry's senior officials or perhaps it served as a  test case at the time. The laws provide for only three  electoral reports -- that of the Interior Ministry and two  others exclusively reserved for the prefectural capitals and  constituencies.    In short, the administration is omnipresent at all stages of  this bill which considerably favors foreigners as far as  eligibility and ineligibility are concerned. In fact, even if  they can vote, they cannot be elected. Even those who opt for  Ivorian citizenship will have to wait for 10 years. They are  only asked one thing: to vote. Apparently, the election bill has  been purposely worked out to suit the authority controlling the  major sectors of the state and administration, that is the  ruling party.    There is one point on which political officials may agree  unanimously even if they fail to admit it openly. In fact, if  the bill is passed, to contest the legislative and municipal  elections, one would henceforth have to attach to one's  declaration of candidacy an approval from one's party or  political group in addition to a deposit of 200,000 CFA francs  for those contesting the legislative elections and 10,000 CFA  francs for those contesting the municipal elections.    The contents of the bill are clear. It means an end to  independent candidates, and especially a warning to irregular  candidates from all sides. Prospective candidates must  henceforth deal with party headquarters which are often touchy.  They must yield to their authority or bow out. Freedom of  expression within political parties will thereby suffer since  politicians will now be aware that their political future no  longer depends on the citizens' choice but on their party organs.    Concerning the presidential elections, things are different.  An independent candidate will have to pay a fixed deposit of 20  million CFA francs and be backed by 5,000 voters, that is 500  per region. Sometimes, there is a difference between the legal  electoral framework and electoral practice. For that reason,  should one neglect the contents of this framework and allow  oneself to be guided by other concerns?    In addressing deputies from the rostrum of the institution  he  heads, Parliament speaker Charles Bauza Donwahi called for true  democracy and open elections. Will this election bill be  submitted to him soon to help him achieve his goal? We doubt  it, but we dare believe that the nation's representatives will  use common sense in making the necessary amendments to the bill.</p>

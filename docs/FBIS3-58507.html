In a speech to a political meeting in Dundee, Scotland, he  warned that extreme rightwing nationalism in Russia was being  fuelled by unemployment caused by privatisation, and aggravated  by the loss of social safety nets.    "We need to find ways of assuring the local populations that  the new system can work, and even provide better services than  before, and that they will have access to them," Brittan said.    He urged more help in training the unemployed in Russia and  supporting social safety nets, particularly for orphans, the  elderly and the sick, which were threatened by the break-up of  large state corporations.    Brittan said the EC also needed to open its markets wider to  imports from East European countries in preparation for bringing  them into the Community.    He singled out steel as typical of sensitive sectors where  strict barriers against imports of East European products needed  to be reconsidered.    "East Europe has enormous potential in the steel sector. We  need to sit down together to work out how to reconcile our steel  policy with the legitimate aspirations of the East," Brittan  said.    He acknowledged that the EC had the largest responsibility  for helping East Europe, saying: "This is our continent, these  are our neighbours. It is our common future."    But Brittan called on other countries, particularly the  United States and Japan, to shoulder a fair share of the aid  burden for East Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU).    He noted that EC aid payments had dwarfed help from the  United States, accounting for 60 percent of all aid to East  Europe and the FSU and providing a market for the bulk of  exports from East Europe.    However, the EC commissioner paid tribute to the "vision and  drive" of U.S. President Bill Clinton's policies towards East  Europe and Russia, expressed during Clinton's European trip this  week.    "The scale of the challenge to the East is huge. We must  match this with the scale of the resources that we devote to  assistance. The member states of the European Union, the United  States and the other donors must work closely together to ensure  that we do not fall short of what is needed," Brittan said.</p>

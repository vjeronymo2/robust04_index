			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Packer offshoot pulls out of deal with cable group Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications group set up as a competitor to the government-owned Telstra, has announced that Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing &amp; Broadcasting (P&amp;B) had abandoned plans to invest ADollars 318m (USDollars 245m) in it. The investment would have bought P&amp;B a 15 per cent stake in Optus. P&amp;B was created last month by the merger of Mr Packer's magazine publishing and television interests, which include the leading Nine Network channel. When the Optus deal was announced in April, it was seen as an attempt by Mr Packer to gain a foothold in the fast-evolving world of 'superhighways' and pay-TV. Optus and Nine, plus two other partners, subsequently announced that they were forming a joint venture company, called Optus Vision, to build a national cable network. This would be used both for pay-TV and local telephony services, breaking Telstra's monopoly in the latter area. However, P&amp;P never completed the Optus investment, and suggestions that Mr Packer might not pursue the deal began to circulate after the government decided that it would not allow Optus Vision exclusive rights to cable any particular geographical area. Instead, it said laying duplicate networks by Optus and Telstra would be permitted. Optus Vision threatened to drop its cabling plans, but the government has refused to budge. If Optus Vision sticks to its threat, Telstra - which has linked up on the pay-TV front with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - will be the only cable infrastructure provider. In its announcement, Optus said only that it was disappointed, but 'respected their (P&amp;B's) right to make investment decisions according to their own priorities'. The telecoms group, which competes with Telstra in the long-distance and cellular phone markets, is currently owned by a mixture of institutional and corporate investors, including Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Mayne Nickless, the AMP Society and Bell South of the US. It has said that it plans to float on the stock market next year.</p>

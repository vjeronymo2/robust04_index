			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mock: EU Security Aspect"] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Alois Mock has stressed the  security aspects of Austria's joining the European Union (EU).  "The Ukrainian border is only 400 km from Vienna; that is  closer than Bregenz [Vorarlberg]," Mock said at a news  conference in Vienna on Friday [4 February].    One should pay particular attention to security policy,  since  it is one of the most important tasks of the Austrian Government  to guarantee the security of its citizens, the foreign minister  said.    By joining the EU, Austria will also be integrated more  strongly in combating international crime. Mock pointed to  dangers that are threatening from East Europe, such as a wave of  migration or major military conflicts in the Balkans and  escalation of the conflicts in the former Soviet Union,  beginning with Ukraine. "The EU is the only organization that  has proved to be a community of security so far," Mock stressed.  Concerning the Transit Treaty -- which will be negotiated for  the first time at the ministerial level on 8 February -- Mock  said that it must remain in existence. As regards Brussels'  demand to considerably shorten the duration of the treaty, he  said that there are indeed indications that the treaty has had  an effect more quickly than planned, but there is no proof of  that. Therefore, one cannot change anything about the transit  treaty.    Concerning the other still open questions, in particular  agriculture and second residences, Mock showed a militant  attitude. There will probably be still "tougher discussions,  even confrontations" between the negotiating teams, since the  EU's latest offers are unacceptable. [passage omitted]</p>

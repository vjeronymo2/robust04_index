			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italy Will Depart, in Any Case"] </F>   [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Yesterday Army Chief  Incisa di Camerana confirmed that the Army is thinking in terms  of a 450-man task force [to send to Rwanda], 300 at least of  whom would be "Col Moschin" Brigade parachutists and "Comsubin"  Brigade marines from the Navy, the rest being logistics experts.  The Italians would transfer to Africa some 30 trucks and other  vehicles with which to venture onto the Rwandan plateaus. Most  of the logistic support, including air cover and helicopter  transport, would be provided by the French.    Incisa stated that "right now the Army is waiting for  orders;  we shall send to Rwanda what the politicians ask us to. I  received the advance alarm last Thursday [16 June], at the end  of an exercise. They telephoned me confirming the possibility of  an operation."    Incisa mentioned that this operation will be led by Chief of  the Defense Staff Admiral Guido Venturoni, who has also  emphasized that if the Army is asked to undertake tasks which  "in our opinion cannot be carried out, we shall tell the  government so." According to the chief of staff, other aspects  to be considered will be those of the command and of the rules  of engagement.    Yesterday Incisa gave a lecture at the CASD, the Center for  Advanced Defense Studies, the third chief of staff in three days  to talk of the problems of defense, and his -- like those of the  heads of the Navy and the Air Force -- was a cry of alarm. The  three Armed Forces are calling for the reversal of the tendency  to cut defense spending, but are calling in particular on the  government to decide clearly what "defense model" Italy should  adopt, and to set to work to implement it.    "So far we have done the opposite; we have an existing  structure which we have pared down without a clear project in  mind," Incisa said. The general is thinking for the future "of  an army of Franciscans," no luxuries, no waste, but economic  treatment and resources to match the tasks clearly assigned by  the government and Parliament. The Army is projecting a force  of some 150,000 men, including 60,000 volunteers and 40,000  draft soldiers. The conversion process is long: In 10 years it  will require a financial commitment of 19 trillion, but 9  trillion can be saved in cuts in the draft, which will gradually  become more conspicuous.    On Wednesday the head of the Navy, Admiral Angelo Mariani,  had warned that the time was coming when the fleet would be  completely obsolete: "We need today a new shipbuilding program  which in 10 years will begin to give us the ships which will  enable us to maintain the Navy in existence." General Adelchi  Pillinini, the head of the Air Force, is, if this is possible,  in an even worse situation: Already the Air Force lacks the  necessary aircraft to protect the country, and has been forced  to "lease" certain English Air Force Tornados because its  F-104's are now decrepit.</p>

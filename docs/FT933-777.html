			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UN says over 4m face food shortages MORE THAN 4.2m people in the republics of the former Yugoslavia will experience severe food shortages this winter unless pledges of food aid are urgently made, the World Food Programme, the UN agency, warned yesterday. Unless fresh deliveries were made before January, the situation would become critical, the WFP added, noting that its food stocks for the period after January were almost exhausted. The appeal came as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees issued an urgent warning about the plight of Moslems trapped in the northern Bosnian enclaves of Maglaj and Tesanj. Up to 150,000 Moslems, about half of whom were refugees, have been trapped in the towns by Serb forces who have refused to let any aid enter the region since early summer, Mr Ray Wilkinson, UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo said yesterday. Although the UNHCR has been carrying out emergency airdrops, aid agencies have been unable to reach the city for several months, and the situation is believed to be critical. 'From what we know it seems that it is a situation as serious as Mostar,' Mr Wilkinson said. The UNHCR estimates that in Bosnia alone some 2.8m people will require food aid during the next sixth months, including 260,000 tonnes of wheat flour, biscuits, oil, fish, meat, sugar and salt, at a total cost of almost Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m). Although the WFP has enough wheat flour for the next three months, only 50-60 per cent of the money needed to buy high protein foods for that period has been donated, Mr David Morton, WFP co-ordinator in Zagreb, said.</p>

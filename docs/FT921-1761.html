			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: New York City Ballet It seldom happens that people realise that they are living through a Golden Age, but in New York there are many who did just that. That age, it is now plain, lasted from 1948, when George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein founded New York City Ballet, till 1983, when Balanchine died. But the vitality of this extraordinary company was directly related to Mr B. himself, to his vigilance in the wings every night and to his tuition in the classroom every morning. 'What are you saving it for?' he never ceased to ask his dancers. He wanted more energy, more stretch, less acting, more clarity, more daring, more musicality. NYCB still dances most of Balanchine's ballets, and they are still the greatest works ever choreographed. The dancers present feats of technique and speed that any other ballet company in the world might envy. But the bodies are not radiant as they used to be, and neither are the steps. Watching a Balanchine ballet danced now by what was once his company can be like walking round a great old cathedral in winter with no light. Yes, this would indeed be one of the shining achievements of the human spirit, if only it would shine - if only we could see it. Of the eight Balanchine ballets I saw NYCB dance in February, I felt this most painfully in Divertimento no 15. This has been the most ineffable of all ballets. Somewhere in my head I will always carry, like iridescent bubbles, images from the Allegro theme-and-variations sequence of solos in this celestial Mozart ballet as they used to be danced: images of beauty and brilliance that truly enshrined a sublime moral vision. Calling ideally for five ballerinas and three male classicists, it is now both gravely undercast and underdanced. In the two performances I saw, only Nichol Hlinka, in the first variation, had something of the right high-density fullness. Judith Fugate, a soloist at heart and at best, was lost in the diamantine dances for the prima. And a ballet that used to be, even in inferior performances, a shimmering construction of noble idealism, musical wit and gossamer delicacy had shrunk to become a nice little posy of pretty dances for some good girls and their partners. During Balanchine's lifetime, any talk of New York City ballet involved talk of Mr B's favourites. (He married four of his ballerinas and was in love with several others.) )This is one NYCB tradition that continues strong. Gossip and serious criticism have focused on the women in the life of his successor, the Danish-born Peter Martins. Heather Watts, his first and longest-lasting American girlfriend, is still featured in a dismayingly large sector of repertory. I wrote here about this two years ago; suffice it to say that that her inadequate technique and over-interpretation are such that I, like many New Yorkers, now avoid those ballets in which she is cast. RecentlyMartins married Darci Kistler, the last baby ballerina to have been nurtured by Balanchine and a beloved source of light on the State Theater stage; and she is the ballerina of Martins's new post-modern post-Mozart ballet, Delight of the Muses, set to a commissioned score that composer Charles Wuorinen has based on two Mozart sonatas and stage music from Don Giovanni. The use Martins makes of Kistler is as curious and as dispiriting as the use he has made of Balanchine, whose precedent seems, as ever, to have been buzzing in Martins's head. Whereas Balanchine would often ask a male dancer to partner more ballerinas than one, here Martins has Kistler partnered by two men - Jock Soto and his own son (her stepson) Nilas Martins. For 'partnered,' read 'pestered.' They won't leave her alone, and they are forever invading her space. She is forever hedged in, her path blocked, her sky clouded. The mood is meant to be jokey, and Kistler smiles sweetly through everything. But it is a sorry spectacle; the aftertaste is sour. Wuorinen's orchestration and rejigging of Mozart has much the same cramped, clever, mean spirit as Martins's adaptation of the high-classical Balanchine-baroque model (in particular, the style of Divertimento no 15, which, for Delight's first two performances Martins featured on the same programme). One's view of City Ballet is not helped by the fact that Kistler, whose career has been bedevilled by injury, has been dancing way beneath her old form. (She is still under 30.) I saw her also in Balanchine's Duo Concertant and Mozartiana. Her never-failing musicality always helps her to reveal the shape and spirit of a role; and in both there were moments of of the most radiant purity. There were also, however, numerous smudges and blurs. It was more satisfying to watch Kyra Nichols, who is still in her mid-30s the most lucid classicist in the world. I have seen this dancer, again and again in the past ten years and more, make time stop. Suddenly, amid one of her prodigious feats of speed or aplomb, she will make a step stop, slow down or just beam forth with redoubled brightness. These moments are not to be predicted, but when they occur - as, this February, in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux - they are always amazing. Yet she is still a glorious dancer in ballets that give her no such opportunities. She now dances the role that in 1980 Balanchine made on Karin von Aroldingen in Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze'; her lyric grace (an improvement, I find, on von Aroldingen's eloquent but heavier, more acted and less danced account) illumined the ballet anew, like the white Northern light on the ballet's backdrop. I have never seen Jerome Robbins's Afternoon of a Faun danced with greater simplicity; and she was even more breathtaking in his Dances at a Gathering. NYCB has other fine dancers too. I have for some seasons delighted in Damien Woetzel (who often partners Nichols), and now I am also happy to have discovered young Ethan Stiefel. Nichol Hlinka, mentioned above, is a welcomely individual dancer, audacious and dark-glowing. There are dancers in the corps to keep Balanchine's picture of youth and harmony in Le Tombeau de Couperin alive. But NYCB's huge repertory needs considerably more strength than this at every level. Every noble deed by Nichols in Robert Schumann is countered by cheap ones from Valentina Kozlova (in Suzanne Farrell's old role) and Heather Watts. Talented dancers such as Peter Boal are too often subdued. Perky soloists like Margaret Tracey or eccentric workhorses such as Wendy Wehelan have been promoted beyond their potential. Balanchine choreography at its greatest is like nothing else in all of life: it affects one's hearing and sight so profoundly that its use of music and dancers becomes a drama of time and space. Many Balanchine ballets will, I suppose, survive. Other companies dance some of them well; and the School of American Ballet, which feeds New York City Ballet with a supply of exceptional dancers, is still a treasury of Balanchine stylistic wisdom. But New York City Ballet is uniquely placed to honour the work of this supreme artist. Next year NYCB will honour its founder-choreographer with a Balanchine Festival. One wishes it was honouring him better in its day-by-day activity now.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: GEC-Marconi secret contract - The Farnborough Air Show GEC-MARCONI is keeping secret the identity of an overseas government which has placed an order for sophisticated air-to-ground weapons. The order is the first new contract for guided weapons received by the UK company since it completed takeover of Ferranti International's missile operation earlier this year. The sale involves weapons developed under a contract with the United Arab Emirates. Ferranti inherited this programme from International Signal and Control, the US contractor it took over in 1987. The programme involves a specially designed family of air-launch weapons, from guided bombs to missiles. Mr David Fletcher, GEC-Marconi managing director, confirmed there was 'another customer' for the system besides the UAE. GEC-Marconi has been trying to build on the former Ferranti division to establish itself as a prime contractor for guided weapons. Its activities in the sector were previously limited to guidance systems. Mr Fletcher said further acquisitions were planned in the next year, both in the UK and abroad, to strengthen the business. The company's ambitions were set back earlier this year when a joint bid with Matra of France for an RAF air-to-air missile was beaten by British Aerospace.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: La Stampa - Editorial Silvio Berlusconi's victory in the European elections, his second electoral success in two months, has provided a full endorsement for his government. It is essential that this is fully understood not just because the prime minister chose to make these elections a referendum on the permanence of his government. In a country like Italy which has witnessed a brusque decapitation of its political class and a redefinition of its political landscape, the ballot box on the very first occasion was bound to be a test of whether voters confirmed or had second thoughts about their preferences, The outcome is more than a mere stabilisation of this new political situation. Berlusconi and Forza Italia have now grown to encompass more or less one-third of the entire electorate. Berlusconi can govern (as he has sought but has not always been able to do). . . or he would be perfectly entitled to call fresh elections.</p>

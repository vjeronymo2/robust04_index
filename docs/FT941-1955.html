			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Observer: Merry old soul King Coal has been a long time dying; but now he really has passed away it seems. A provisional death certificate appears on Thursday, in the form of a book of photographs published by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. The project began before British Coal's announcement in October 1992 that 31 of its remaining 50 active mines were to be closed; now just 17 remain. The Commission's photographers, backed by archaeologists and industrial surveyors, toured every English coalfield, recording all aspects of the industry. Images of Industry: Coal, will be launched at the Yorkshire Mining Museum in Wakefield. 'The complete set of images, backed by research notes, will become part of the National Monuments Record, where they can be consulted by the public.' RIP.</p>

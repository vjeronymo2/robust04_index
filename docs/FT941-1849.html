			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Poland considers borrowing over Dollars 1bn Poland plans to borrow over Dollars 1bn on the international capital markets following the successful conclusion of its London Club negotiations for a reduction of up to 45 per cent in its Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt earlier this month. Mr Henryk Chmeliak, the acting finance minister, told an FT conference in Warsaw that the Polish government was exploring the possibility of raising Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn through foreign bonds now that the London Club agreement has re-opened Poland's access to international markets on normal commercial terms. According to Mr Ian Hume, director of the World Bank's Warsaw office, Poland needs higher foreign investment to fund the infrastructure investments needed to underpin sustained rapid growth. But the bulk of Poland's current Dollars 14bn to Dollars 16bn annual investment will continue to be financed domestically, he said, with an increasing proportion coming from domestic bank lending, re-invested profits and other non-bank finance. At the same time, the relative importance of funding by international financial institutions will decline, while foreign direct investment will continue to rise sharply, he added. Meanwhile, the Eurobond market's tense vigil for the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting kept issuers and investors sidelined. Although the Fed's afternoon open-market operation indicated an unchanged policy stance, traders still expect an imminent tightening and predicted that, until it arrives, the primary market will remain deadly quiet. What little demand there is remains focused on floating-rate notes, which are less sensitive to interest rate uncertainty than fixed-rate bonds. This encouraged the Southern Australian Government Finance Authority to issue Dollars 500m of two-year FRNs paying three-month Libor flat, with a par issue price. While some traders said the pricing was on the tight side, an official with lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said the deal met solid demand, benefiting from the recent 'demise of the fixed-rate market' and the recent build-up in cash by money market funds and bond investors looking for short-dated investments. By late afternoon,it was trading around 99.95, he said. Germany's Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank yesterday signed a Euro medium-term note programme worth Dollars 2bn, arranged by Merrill Lynch, and plans to issue an inaugural benchmark Eurobond within the next few weeks, it said. The bank is a central refinancing institution for the German agriculture and food industries, channelling loans through commercial banks. S&amp;P recently assigned a triple-A rating to its long-term debt. It is a frequent borrower in the German domestic market, where it has DM21.5bn of bonds outstanding. Moody's has upgraded to A3 from Baa1 the long-term debt ratings of the Birmingham Midshires Building Society, citing the company's improving profitability and financial fundamentals. Some Pounds 200m of debt is affected. Moody's has also placed the credit ratings of the three UK mortgage-backed securities under review for possible upgrade. They are: Collateralised Mortgage Securities (No 4), rated Aa3; Platform Home Mortgage Securities No 1 plc, rated Aa1; and Stars 1 plc, rated Aa1. Around Pounds 780m in long-term debt is affected.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Increased package for Thames chiefs SIR ROY Watts, chairman, and Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames Water, saw their total emoluments fall last year after the company's earnings per share growth did not meet targets set by the board for bonuses to be paid. However, their basic salaries increased by 8.5 per cent and 14.1 per cent respectively, and both were granted substantial share options. Sir Roy's total package fell from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 145,000, as indicated when Thames last month reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 236.3m for the year to March 31, an 11.3 per cent increase. Total emoluments for Mr Hoffman, the highest paid director, fell from Pounds 209,000 to Pounds 199,000. Thames also revealed it made a Pounds 50,000 contribution to the Conservative Party as the board considered 'a Tory election win was in the interests of the company and shareholders'.</p>

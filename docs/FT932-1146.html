			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: BHP BHP, the Australian resources company, and Magma Copper, the US copper producer, have formed a joint venture to consider bidding for a share of the potentially large El Abra copper prospect in Chile. The joint venture is expected to be one of many interested in developing El Abra which has been put out to tender by Codelco, the Chilean resources group. Bids are due to close by the end of August, with any decision due by the end of 1993. A BHP announcement yesterday said preliminary studies commissioned by Codelco indicated that El Abra could produce 265m pounds of copper per year, using low-cost oxide leaching/SX-EW methods. BHP already has an important presence in the Chilean copper industry through its stake in the Escondida mine in which it is partnered by RTZ of the UK.</p>

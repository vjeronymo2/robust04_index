			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie approaches its closing peak REPRIEVED, for the time being at least, from the impact of the blue chip rights issue threatened at the beginning of the week, the London stock market rebounded strongly yesterday, gaining 39.3 points to close within six points of its previous all-time closing high. Speculation on the chances of a German rate cut gave a final boost to stocks in London. Gilt-edged issues extended their gains at the end of the session. There was renewed US demand for ICI shares and the end of the two-week equity market account prompted a rush of bear closing - buying from market traders needing shares to meet selling commitments accepted earlier this week. The bear rush was headed by UK buyers of ICI, who were in turn reacting to heavy demand for the shares in New York overnight. London traders are believed to have suffered heavy losses on ICI shares, which they sold down to 1076p on Monday; the shares ended at just over Pounds 12 in London last night and were attracting renewed US support. Upward pressures on share prices received a further boost as the final deals related to the Pounds 200m-plus buy programme seen earlier in the week were hurriedly transacted. Equities moved ahead strongly throughout the session, receiving a final boost as the new trading account opened. The FT-SE Index closed 39.3 up at 2,868, just under its closing high of 2,873.8 achieved on February 3 - on the following day, the Footsie traded briefly at 2,900.1. By last night, the Index has recovered all the ground lost since last Friday to show a net gain of 28 points over the week. The change in the Index over the two-week equity account is much the same (25 points). The market has moved through its trading range this week, dipping to 2,809 on Thursday and challenging 2,873 at yesterday's peak. Sentiment has been dominated by the swing of views ahead of the ICI trading and demerger statement, culminating in relief that the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will not hit the market until June. Violent swings in the ICI share price have had a significant effect on market indices. Seaq volume increased in late trading as London caught the hint of optimism on German interest rates. The final Seaq total of 671.3m shares compared with 620.6m on Thursday, with both figures swollen by the excitement in ICI and the other pharmaceutical leaders. Non-Footsie volume made up around 61 per cent of yesterday's total. Retail business in equities has remained high in London.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Murdoch drops New York Post deal THE SURVIVAL of the New York Post was once again in question yesterday after Mr Rupert Murdoch walked away from the brash tabloid following a strike by journalists. 'Union members have refused to work at the New York Post, forcing management to cancel its agreement to purchase the newspaper,' said Mr Patrick Purcell, president and chief executive officer of News America Publishing, part of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation. The Newspaper Guild, representing reporters and editors as well as circulation and advertising staff, went on strike on Monday, and pressmen and delivery drivers refused to cross picket lines. Mr Murdoch's company had been expected to finalise its purchase of the newspaper later this week, with or without a contract agreement with the Guild. News Corp, which has been operating the paper under a contract with the bankruptcy court, said it was returning responsibility for the newspaper to the bankruptcy court. It said it had already spent more than Dollars 10m since it started running the paper earlier this year. Although no other buyer has stepped forward with a bid for the 192-year-old paper, the mood on the picket line was cautiously optimistic. Mr Jim Nolan, a reporter and Guild official said: 'This paper has come back from the dead more times than Frankenstein.' Post employees are hoping that Mr Murdoch's move is a bargaining ploy instead of a death sentence. A spokeswoman for New York Governor Mr Mario Cuomo, who has taken an active interest in the paper's survival and helped assemble investors in the past, said Mr Cuomo 'will do anything he can to help the paper. He's been in contact with the paper's unions and management representitives'. Mr Cuomo, who also spoke to Mr Murdoch yesterday, said Mr Murdoch's position had not changed. Mr Murdoch stepped back into the picture in March, when he offered to rescue the paper, which had changed owners several times and was operating under bankruptcy court protection. This is the second time in less than three months that Mr Murdoch has closed the paper. In July, The Post failed to publish for several days while he was negotiating with its unions. He reached agreements with ten of the 11 unions and members of the Guild agreed to return to work while continuing discussions with News Corp. The dispute centres on severance terms and a company demand to have the right to fire any employee, regardless of seniority, within four months of Murdoch's takeover.</p>

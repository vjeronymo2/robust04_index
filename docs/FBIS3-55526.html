			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent A. Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Representatives of the newly reconstituted Federal  Counterintelligence Service held a news conference today at the  Foreign Ministry's press center in Moscow. On 5 January 1994,  an edict of the Russian president endorsed the service's  standing orders which, according to its deputy director Sergey  Stepashin, was an expected surprise [as heard] for its members.    The new structure is not a copy of the disbanded Security  Ministry but makes the service answerable directly to the  president, as is the practice in many other countries. Its  remit covers such important matters as identification, advance  warning, and prevention of subversive and intelligence  activities directed against the Russian Federation by foreign  special services and organizations; supply of intelligence  information on threats to Russia; the fight against terrorism,  illegal trading in weapons and narcotic substances, and illegal  armed groups; and also counterintelligence support to ensure the  security of Russian borders. This is despite the fact that the  border troops have reorganized into a separate federal service  with ministry status.    One thing worth pointing out is that the Federal  Counterintelligence Service's manpower has been cut by 46  percent and will total 75,000 persons. The number of  administrators has been more than halved.    In the new structure, the main emphasis is on strengthening  the counterintelligence and the anti-terrorism departments.    So, this notorious power structure has undergone yet another  overhaul. Time will show how effective this one will be.</p>

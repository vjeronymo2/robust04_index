			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Gardening: Now British Rail has the wrong sort of trees MY YEARLY advice to Christmas shoppers has been to buy a plant which is not a flowering plant or an over-forced plant but an honest, well-rooted mass of twigs which will grow, last for years, and do all the things which other Christmas presents cannot. I now realise that this yearly advice is unsatisfactory. There are also some unreconstructed characters who dislike gardening, dodge it all year, and wish that their partners were not fanatics. They tend to be husbands and many of them commute. So, I am particularly pleased to announce that we have a new initiative for them, backed wholeheartedly by the InterCity division of British Rail. Indeed, according to BR's customer relations manager, it is actually the 'best solution.' This 'best solution' first came to my notice at St Pancras station in London. Earlier this summer, England's most distinguished plantswoman, Valerie Finnis, found herself waiting for the train to Kettering, Northamptonshire, during one of those periods of 'delayed boarding.' She was surprised to notice that more than 30 trees, about 15 ft high, had been arranged down the Pancras platforms in smart new containers of silver aluminium. It looked as if Birnam Wood had come south on an Away Day pass; and so she stood on her luggage to check out the leaves. The trunk, she found, had once been a tree, but the entire head of leaves was fake. There was no mistaking the soil, which looked like a mass of chocolate-coated beans. So, she wrote to BR's chairman, asking why living trees had not been chosen and what this new initiative cost. At the chairman's request, David Gibb replied to her query. The management, he told her, had been 'anxious to put some colour into St Pancras' but the presence of high voltage overhead cables had restricted the choice severely. 'Live trees grow,' he reminded one of our greatest lady gardeners. There was also that universal apology, health and safety. If live trees grew, 'there would obviously be a fire hazzard.' And, he pointed out: 'There would be safety implications for staff climbing the trees in order to lop them.' Safety implications, meanwhile, caused an unforeseen outbreak of 'driver hazzard.' The trees had been stationed so thickly on the platforms that the drivers could not see the guards; and so the trees, pots and all, had to be shunted to the side of vacant platform one. It was there that I found them on Monday while preparing my Christmas list for garden owners who hate gardening. If you stand on platform one, the view soars upwards to the vast height of St Pancras, way above any tree-watchers or any tip of a plausible tree. After 100 years, a Wellingtonia might be somewhere near the cables in question, but a native birch or a hornbeam would have no chance of making contact. A watching porter explained to me, kindly, that so far from being scaled by workmen, the new trees had been climbed already by drunkards. Thanks to the 'alcoholic hazzard,' two of the trees had split at the top, unable to support a visitor's weight. Despite several inquiries, neither BR's chairman nor his management were prepared to reveal where our nationalised transporters had bought these trees on our behalf. But friendly railway security staff were more willing to reveal all. In the last instance, the trees came from Rentokil, and were ordered for St Pancras by BR's procurement and materials management division, located some way up the track at Derby. At Derby, I was pleased to learn from the helpful staff that the new initiative was part of a campaign for 'passenger environment' and that about 200 trees had been distributed round major stations from St Pancras to Cardiff, York and Newcastle - at a cost well in excess of Pounds 100,000. Under recent reforms, stations (like schools) are now managing part of their own regional budgets. To mark their new responsibilities, InterCity managers have been buying fake trees at about Pounds 500 a time. Naturally, they are not just any old trees. Gardeners will recognise them as models of good old Ficus Benjamina, which is not an outdoor tree in Britain but is merely the most familiar of tender green trees for people whose horizons are limited to offices. These specimens are extremely trendy. In keeping with the best FT advice, a climber has been placed carefully so that it looks as if it is climbing up the main trunk. The climber is dead, of course: a vine stem which has been twined so as to look realistic. After less than a year in position, the textured leaves are filthy, as we would have expected in an area of high pollution. Rentokil, I trust, has a cleaning and fire-retardent contract; like real trees, sham trees on stations are expensive to maintain. Rentokil felt unable to supply further details of these trees' origin. Where, then, would you and I go to find one for a non-gardening friend? My first stop would be Clifton Nurseries, in London's Little Venice, where the friendly house-plant managers can cope with every sort of up-market inquiry. Yes, they could always supply such a tree and I should realise that its leaves were not plastic but polyester silk. But why did I not talk first to the British company with the most experience of assembling them? Down at the Marley industrial estate in Southam Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire, the expert firm of Pouliot Designs has been assembling non-living trees for the past 10 years. Indeed, it even began assembling them in a barn about 100 yards away from my family home - the site of my first 20 gardening years. Throughout that time, I was encouraging you all to dig and prepare big holes for fine trees which needed watering: in fact, you could have bought one, ready-hung and without any need for soil or effort, just down the road where Des, the proprietor, had cashed in his retirement Jaguar and handshake and sunk them all in the business which now leads the field. At Pouliot, they were very pleased to have been honoured with the British Rail order. The leaves are brought in containers from factories in China. Pouliot then arranges for dead trunks locally, with the help of the Forestry Commission, and its loyal workforce puts the Chinese leaves on the dead stems. The bestseller is Ficus Benjamina, presumably because it is the tree which looks most familiar to the budget-spender who passes more time in his office than his garden. But Pouliot has been trying to introduce the Chinese workforce to the leaves of British favourites, and oaks will be available soon. Meanwhile, spun aluminium containers are supplied by Lune of Morecambe, Lancashire. Pouliot will assemble the two and add dead vine but will always direct you, after discussion, to one of its retail buyers. It is a wholesaler and deals only with the trade. Have we all been dreadfully stupid? We dig holes, summon manure and hunt for tree stakes but, down at Pouliot, Des and the ladies could run off an oak tree, 15 ft high in a spun aluminium container with earth-like chocolate nuts, and not leave too much change from Pounds 1,500. Meanwhile, station budgets in the InterCity section of British Rail have blown more than Pounds 100,000 on some dead tree trunks, scattered with pseudo-silk leaves from China. Every extravagance has its own neurotic origin: we must all remember that real trees must touch off British Rail's deepest anxiety - that infamous hazzard of leaves on the track. Perhaps the InterCity stations are only phase one of a grander vision radiating out from Derby. Bogus trees will then be pilot-tested for placing on sections of the embankment which have been proven to be at risk, thereby eliminating a major autumn source of delay. It will certainly be good business, and I hope the Chinese can cope with demand. Meanwhile, we can well understand why our British Rail network is so keen to point out to us that it is seriously short of necessary funding.</p>

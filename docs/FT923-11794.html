			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US group plans TV station in Moscow TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the US cable television group that owns CNN, is forming a joint venture in Russia to seek what it claims will be the first independent television station in Moscow. A memorandum of understanding has been signed by TBS and the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Company, (MIBC), a private Russian company. Mr Sidney Pike, president of CNN International's special projects division, is in Moscow to represent Turner interests in the 50-50 project, which will be broadcast free over the air. Revenues will come from advertising. Mr Pike said yesterday the plan depended on obtaining local government approval for a broadcasting licence to use Channel 6, an existing VHF frequency. Russian authorities have indicated they plan to award the licence within the next four months, Mr Pike added. Under an interim licence MIBC and Turner have been broadcasting two hours of CNN International, translated into Russian, every day on Channel 6 since May. Mr Pike said the joint venture channel would include CNN news, classic films, sport, entertainment and children's programmes, broadcast mostly in Russian. Channel 6 is the last VHF frequency available in Moscow. A formal contest will be held to decide who should be given the licence. Siemens, the German engineering group, and Russian partners are jointly developing plans to equip nuclear reactors in the former Soviet bloc with western monitoring technology for added safety, Reuter reports from Bonn. The aim is to improve the safety of 1,000-megawatt VVER pressurised water reactors, the most modern reactors produced in the former Soviet Union. The technology would be based on existing Russian systems and advances under way in Russia and be enriched with Siemens knowhow.</p>

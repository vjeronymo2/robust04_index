The negotiations resumed at 1030 when the Civilian Affairs  Committee stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee met under  lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side and Gadi Zohar,  the Israeli official in charge of the civil administration in  the occupied West Bank.    Al-Tarifi told MENA that the committee will discuss issues  related to the transfer of civilian authority from Israel to the  Palestinians. He said that this week's negotiations will focus  on communications -- including radio, television, postal  services, electricity -- and the Palestinian authority's right  to enact legislation and handle town planning, civil  registration, and travel documents. He added that the issue of  water will be discussed not this week but next week.    MENA learned that Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the radio and  television corporation, and Engineer Amin 'Ulayyan have joined  the Palestinian delegation negotiating the transfer of civilian  authority because the setting up of a Palestinian radio and  television station will be discussed.    The Palestinian negotiator stressed that there was progress  during the past two weeks of negotiations on civilian issues  when the two sides reached agreement on issuing identity cards  and issues of residence, protected nature reserves, and public  works.

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / US and Japan move closer on chip trade US semiconductor manu-facturers and Japanese electronics companies have expressed new confidence about improved foreign access to the Japanese market, in a joint statement that could mark a turning point in the decade-long battle over semiconductor trade. 'The relationship has turned from confrontation to a new phase, which will stress mutual prosperity and inter-dependence between foreign semiconductor suppliers and Japanese users,' said Mr Nobuo Kanoi, executive deputy president of Sony, following a meeting between US and Japanese industry executives in Tokyo yesterday. 'We welcome the increased co-operation and understanding that has occurred under the (1991 US-Japan) Semiconductor Arrangement,' Mr Gil Amelio, president and chief executive of National Semiconductor, replied on behalf of the US industry group. 'We also appreciate efforts by both sides which have led to increased foreign market share.' The US industry will continue to press for 'gradual and steady improvement in market access', as stated in the 1991 bilateral trade pact which also established a target of at least 20 per cent foreign market share by the end of 1992. Foreign semiconductor producers achieved a market share of more than 20 per cent for the first time in the final quarter of last year. No new market share targets were set at this week's meetings in Tokyo. But US industry officials noted that the 1991 agreement with its 20 per cent goal remains in effect until 1996 and that US and Japanese governments will continue to track market share data. US industry officials hope to see an average 20 per cent market share over the next 12 months and are increasingly confident this can be achieved. The Japanese side remains committed to continued improvement in market access, but not necessarily market share. US executives insist the two are synonymous because improved market access is meaningless unless it leads to higher market share. However, taking a conciliatory tone, Mr Pat Weber, president of the components division of Texas Instruments, said that he was confident the US and Japan would 'move beyond' their disagreements over market share goals. 'We will not rely upon it so heavily in future. We will move forward through co-operation and trust with our Japanese partners and customers.' Mr Weber said growing technological dependence between semiconductor makers and the growing number of cases in which US chips have been designed into newer products should help to support the US share of the Japanese market. Mr Hadehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba concurred: 'We need alliances because semiconductors are becoming so diverse, we need mutual interdependence to develop them.'</p>

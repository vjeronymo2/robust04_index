			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (7): Crown dependency of the UK - The UK retains responsibility for the island's defence and international relations and the right to veto legislation passed by the States / Legislature Protagonists of devolution might well hold Jersey as a role model. It is a Crown dependency of the UK with its own parliament, the States, that is responsible for most of the government of its 80,000 population. The UK retains responsibility for the island's defence and international relations and the right to veto legislation passed by the States. The States comprises 53 members - 12 Senators, 29 Deputies and 12 Constables. They are all democratically elected. There are no party politics. Each member is an independent and, by virtue of the island's size, easily accessible to those he or she represents. The whole is presided over by the Bailiff, appointed by the Crown, who retains the right to a casting vote. Other Crown appointments in the island are: the Lieutenant Governor, who represents the Queen, the Deputy Bailiff, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General and the Dean, all of whom have no vote in the States. Senators are elected by the whole island's electorate for a six-year term, six of them retiring every third year. The 29 Deputies are elected by constituency electorates for a three-year term. Each Constable is elected by the electorate of one of the island's 12 parishes. States members are paid a flat allowance of Pounds 8,000 a year, but may draw up to a further Pounds 10,000 subject to means testing. Their duties keep them busy about half of every week. Introduction of the additional allowance a few years ago has led to a broadening of representation in the States. The States assembles for public debate and voting once a fortnight. Until a couple of years ago it was weekly, traditionally starting at 10.15 to coincide with arrival of the train from St. Aubin. The meetings were unstructured and often postponed to the following week. Now the fortnightly meeting begins at 9.30 and follows an agenda drawn up by the Greffier, the clerk of the States. Extra meetings can be held when necessary. The Bailiff, who is appointed to office until his 70th birthday, has a dual role - presiding over the States and over the Royal Court, the island's high court. He and the Deputy Bailiff are the island's judges. Sir Peter Crill, the current Bailiff, was originally elected to the States in 1951. He sees no need for a change in the Bailiff's dual role and says this was confirmed by the Royal Commission in 1973. Sir Peter is concerned about a trend towards professional politicians in the island. 'Jersey is very much a community of voluntary service. I believe that because our structure is based on voluntary work, we should not encourage young, professional politicians.'</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Northern Telecom invests in Matra NORTHERN Telecom of Canada is investing FFr1.36bn (Pounds 138m) in Matra Communications, the telecommunications division of Matra, the French defence electronics group. The Canadian group, which will emerge with an initial 20 per cent of Matra Communications, is also negotiating to take a minority stake in the new holding company which will merge Matra with Hachette, the French publishing company, also controlled by the Lagardere family. Matra Communications, which last year incurred a net loss of FFr17m on sales of FFr5.9bn, has been seeking an international partner since last autumn. The company, which employs 8,000 people, needed to grow to compete in the international telecommunications market. The Matra purchase is in keeping with Northern's recent shift of emphasis from its core North American base to a more geographically diversified business. Dr Paul Stern, chairman, who handled most of the negotiations, said the alliance would help Northern develop markets in Europe and elsewhere. Under the terms of the deal, Northern Telecom will pay FFr700m for a 20 per cent stake in Matra Communications and will also provide a FFr660m convertible loan. The two groups are forming a joint venture to combine Matra's radio technology with Northern's switching expertise. Matra is also offering to buy out the minority shareholders in its communications subsidiary. It has agreed terms to acquire the 18 per cent stake held by Paribas, the French investment bank, for FFr295.70 a share in a FFr612m deal. This is believed to represent a profit of FFr450m for Paribas. The same offer has been extended to other minority shareholders with 12 per cent of Matra Communications. Meanwhile Northern, which last year staged a USDollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.3bn) takeover for the UK's STC, plans to take up to 8 per cent of the new Matra/Hachette holding company, which will come into force at the end of this year. The creation of the company has been criticised in France due to the apparent divergence of interests. However, Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who chairs both Matra and Hachette, has argued it will yield administrative savings.</p>

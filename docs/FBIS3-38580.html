			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik </F> Kooijmans by Bettina Hubo; place and date not given: "`Flanders  Is More Political, the Netherlands More Administrative' -- An  Interview With Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik Kooijmans"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [Hubo] Does Benelux still have a right to exist?    [Kooijmans] Originally Benelux was set up as an economic  cooperative association. In the meantime the European Union has  taken over a large part of its tasks, to such a degree that you  could even say that the European Union train has taken over the  Benelux truck. Soon Benelux will have existed for fifty years.  For me and my colleagues in the other countries that is reason  to examine the future of the association. You should never  throw away old shoes before you have looked to see whether they  could be used for something. We must examine the other fields  where Benelux cooperation could be useful now that the economic  factor has dropped away. I am thinking in particular of  problems which did not arise at the time when it was set up,  like environmental pollution.    [Hubo] "I am against a Benelux process, because in it the  Walloons are the Italian-speaking Swiss who paddle on Lake  Lugano," Guy Spitaels said two years ago, expressing the Walloon  fear of being pushed aside. Is the present combination of  countries the most fortunate?    [Kooijmans] I have no fixed opinion on that. I do think we  should realize that we are in a small corner of Europe with  three countries which largely have a shared historical  background, no matter how differently they subsequently  developed. We are also squeezed between a large Germany and a  large France. In this context the Benelux association creates a  frame of reference where you recognize each other's problems as  small countries.    [Hubo] At present Europe is showing itself to be painfully  impotent where peace and security in its own part of the world  are concerned. Can the small countries still play a role in  controlling these problems?    [Kooijmans] Of course, they can. Take the former Yugoslavia.  Both the Netherlands and Belgium have many troops in Bosnia.  That also gives them the right to express their opinion. I do  not believe that our role is less important because we are  small. We are not able to solve the political problem. To do  so it is necessary for the European Union to speak with a single  voice, which is not the case at present. But to achieve a  single European position, the votes of both the large and small  countries are important.    [Hubo] While a number of allies are considering withdrawing  their troops from Bosnia, the Netherlands is increasing its  contribution by 1,150 combat troops.    [Kooijmans] These troops will protect the safe areas. I do  not think you can say: We are going to withdraw our troops and  abandon the people to their fate. For me withdrawal is not an  option at present. Just speculating about withdrawal will make  the will for peace decline.    I am calling for an increase in pressure for using air  strikes. You should not think of a military intervention like  in Kuwait. Of course that is impossible in a civil war in a  country where everyone will have to continue to live together.  But we must show that we are actually implementing the mandate  which we have been given, and that we will not be put off by the  slightest little group of local militants. That is how you can  strengthen both your authority and the will to reach a solution  at the negotiating table.    [Hubo] The situation has become blocked again. How can it be  unblocked?    [Kooijmans] I think that the United States should be more  clearly present involved in the negotiation process. We should  not ask the United States to supply ground troops, but it would  be very important if the Americans, who now have an observer's  position in the negotiations, would commit themselves more.  That would have an effect on the Muslims, who regard  participation by the United States in any settlement essential  for their security. That would also have an effect on the  Serbs. They could hope that a softening of the sanctions, which  is now rejected by the United States, could become open to  discussion.</p>

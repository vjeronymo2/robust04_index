The negotiators, who have approved all the non-controversial  documents which are to be presented to the GATT ministerial  conference in Marrakesh from April 12 to 15, also set aside a  document approving the creation of a committee to prepare for  the setting up of the World Trade Organisation which is to  replace the GATT in 1995.</p>

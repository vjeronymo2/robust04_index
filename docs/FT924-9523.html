			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Minister visits closure-threat London hospitals GOVERNMENT decisions on closures of London hospitals are likely to be completed about the end of January, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said yesterday. Dr Mawhinney has this week begun visiting all hospitals identified for closure or change in Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report into London healthcare published last month. He began on Tuesday at St Thomas' - which the report recommends should amalgamate on a single site with Guy's - and yesterday visited University College and Middlesex hospitals. The report recommends that these should be rationalised with other specialist services on the University College site. Dr Mawhinney said his visits would enable managers and staff to raise any points they wished about the Tomlinson report's proposals, which would lead to a reduction of about 2,500 hospital beds in London. One of his next visits will be to St Bartholomew's, where a campaign has been launched against a recommendation to close the 800-year-old hospital. The government has emphasised that the Tomlinson recommendations are not government policy, and says decisions on any closures will be made only after Dr Mawhinney completes his programme of visits. Ministers recognise, however, that it will then be necessary to act quickly and end the uncertainty over threatened hospitals. A disproportionate level of London's health resources is spent on hospital services, and the Tomlinson report argues for a shift towards the capital's relatively underdeveloped general practitioner and community services. Many National Health Service staff are concerned that, at a time of acute public-spending constraints, money released by hospital closures might not be reinvested in better services at community level. Dr Mawhinney said London, with 15 per cent of the national population, consumed 20 per cent of healthcare resources. He did not think any minister could give an 'unqualified guarantee' that its ratio would remain inviolate.</p>

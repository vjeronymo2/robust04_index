			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Midlands export growth falters MANUFACTURERS in the west Midlands do not expect a significant rise in export orders before the end of next year, the regional council of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, Tim Burt writes. The council blamed the downturn in export growth on the recession in Germany. It said motor component manufacturers had been particularly hard hit by falling demand from mainland Europe. Local business leaders fear that the weak demand could undermine signs of recovery among manufacturers in the Midlands, where 260 German companies have subsidiary plants. Mr Bryan Townsend, regional council chairman, said that more businesses were trying to exploit markets in the Far East and North America to offset problems in Europe and flat demand at home. His comments followed the publication of a quarterly economic survey of business trends in the west Midlands, carried out by Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, which found that only 1 per cent of companies reported any increase in their export deliveries in the last quarter. The CBI said that the full effects of last year's devaluation in terms of new orders and completed export deliveries would not be apparent for 12 months.</p>

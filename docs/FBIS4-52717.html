			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The members of  Greenpeace published an appeal on May 3 urging the United States  to completely withdraw its nuclear weapons and nuclear-equipped  warships from northeast Asia.    Noting that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty [NPT] has  not  stopped nuclear proliferation but has become a cause of the  proliferation of nuclear weapons, the appeal stressed that the  signatories to the NPT must not extend the period of its  validity but ban the nuclear weapons as illegal and place all  plutonium and other fissionable materials under international  safeguards for ever.    It said that with a view to proceeding to a universal and  comprehensive disarmament, all the nations must give up nuclear  weapons and the United States must fully play its role in  reducing its nuclear arsenal, beginning with the complete  withdrawal from northeast Asia of its nuclear weapons and  nuclear-armed and nuclear-capable warships.</p>

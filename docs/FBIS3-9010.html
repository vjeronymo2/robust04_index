With a view to the turmoil of war in the  former Yugoslavia, Gligorov says that a Balkanization of other  European regions is imminent if the "Balkans are not  Europeanized."    The two presidents were invited to the Rhine by the  "European  Dialogue Bonn," an association of leading politicians and  journalists, to discuss the topic "The Road to Europe -- Too  Many Conflicts?". In separate talks they explained later to FRG  President Richard von Weizsaecker what they had elaborated on  with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth as the discussion leader.    Their basic substance was: "The present picture of the  Balkans is tragic and grotesque. It is also a consequence of  insufficient preparations and the inability to permit, under  crossfire from different interests, the victory of the finding  that in the closely intertwined relations of the modern world  there is no longer room for local wars and that the aggressor's  first step is checked." This formulation was used by Slovene  President Kucan. Like him, Macedonian Gligorov also made it  quite clear that the Serbs are responsible for the war. Both  explicitly rejected a new division into spheres of interest as  it might become possible by Russia's increasing activities in  ex-Yugoslavia.    Gligorov appealed all the more urgently to his Greek  neighbors to put, for their part, an end to the completely  superfluous controversy with Macedonia, to lift the unjustified  embargo, and to achieve a peaceful dialogue. "The problem of  Macedonian-Greek relations is basically an irrational problem of  an emotional nature. We depend on cooperation. We do not have  territorial claims. We are immediately prepared to continue the  negotiations on all questions without exception," the Macedonian  president affirmed.    Both politicians claim for their countries a place with  equal  rights in the future joint Europe.</p>

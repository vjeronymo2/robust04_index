			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Meciar may lose job as Slovakia's premier MR VLADIMIR MECIAR, Slovakia's controversial prime minister, could lose his job after forming a break-away populist political movement. His Public Against Violence (PAV) party and the Christian Democratic Movement (CDM) are now negotiating to form a new coalition government in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Mr Jan Carnogursky, CDM's leader and currently deputy prime minister, is widely favoured to succeed Mr Meciar. Earlier this month, the volatile Mr Meciar antagonised his party's leadership by forming a rival wing called PAV-Platform for Democratic Slovakia. He also aroused suspicion in the federal capital, Prague, by holding talks in Moscow with the Soviet military about resuming arms production at workless Slovak weapons factories. He is now expected to split formally with PAV at its congress later this month and set up a new party. While Mr Meciar is mistrusted by leaders of the PAV, whose ratings have plummeted in recent opinion polls, but is very popular with ordinary Slovaks. President Vaclav Havel has called for a referendum in the Slovak and Czech Republics on the emotive issue of independence for the former. Parliament is expected to adopt the proposal shortly and the referendum could be held this summer.</p>

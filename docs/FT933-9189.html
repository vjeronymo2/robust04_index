			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / England's first three 'community forests' given the go-ahead THE government has given the go-ahead for England's first three 'community forests', which are designed to improve the landscape and give town dwellers access to leisure activities on their doorstep. The forests are a joint initiative by the Countryside Commission and the Forestry Commission, which have been working with local authorities. The forests will be called Thames Chase, near South Ockenden, east of London; the Forest of Mercia, in south Staffordshire; and the Great North Forest, in Tyne and Wear. The government has approved the Countryside Commission's business plans for the forests. Some planting has begun and grants will be available from the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture. It could take 40 years for the forests, which will be a blend of woodland, farmland and open space, to be established fully. Nine more forests are under consideration.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the </F> Baltic Fleet, by Captain First Class Valeriy Gromak; place and  date not given: "New Face of Baltic Fleet. Baltic Fleet  Commander Admiral Vladimir Yegorov Answers KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  Correspondent's Questions"]    [Text] [Gromak] Vladimir Grigoryevich, the Russian flag  was lowered over Liepaja Naval Base on the first day of summer.  The last day of summer will also be the last day spent by  Russian sailors in any of the Baltic countries. What next?  What will the [Baltic] Fleet look like once the force  withdrawal process has been completed?    [Yegorov] First and foremost -- and this is the main thing  -- the Fleet should remain the Fleet, as an integrated  operational-strategic formation of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces in the Baltic designed to protect the Russian state's  interests in the region.    Of course, the face of the Fleet will be different from what  it was prior to the withdrawal of forces from the Baltic states,  where we are leaving behind four basing centers, their  airfields, and a large number (from 15 percent to 80 percent in  certain cases) of military infrastructure installations --  communications units, ship-repair yards, electronic posts,  installations providing navigation and hydrographic support for  the safety of shipping in the Baltic, and warehouse  installations able to store large quantities of material and  technical means.    But we have completely withdrawn both warships and  auxiliaries, all our aircraft, motor vehicles, technical  systems, and stores, and are relocating them on the territory of  Kaliningrad and Leningrad Oblasts. The basing conditions will  be more cramped, of course, but there will be no other losses.    [Gromak] But perhaps there should be further cuts that would  make it possible to improve basing conditions?    [Yegorov] Apart from Russia, nine other states have access  to the Baltic Sea. And each has a navy as a most important  component of its armed forces. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,  having gained independence and despite their serious economic  difficulties, are also setting up their own navies. And that is  entirely natural. Each state in our by no means peaceful age  should be prepared to defend its interests not only on land but  at sea as well. These include prospecting for oil on the  continental shelf, fishery protection, and ensuring the safety  of merchant shipping. So Russia too should have a modern navy  to safeguard security and protect its own state interests in the  Baltic.    [Gromak] What will the Baltic Fleet be like?    [Yegorov] There will be two naval bases within the Baltic  Fleet -- the Baltiysk and Leningrad bases -- one force of major  surface combatants, one force each of auxiliaries and  search-and-rescue vessels, the Fleet air force, coastal troops,  and logistical, technical, and special units. The Baltic  squadron of various force organizations and the assault landing  ship force will be disbanded.    [Gromak] Does this mean that, apart from things being  disbanded and cut back, there will also be an expansion via the  Leningrad Naval Base?    [Yegorov] Essentially the Leningrad Naval Base is already to  a considerable extent part of the Fleet and under its  operational jurisdiction. Now that Lithuania and Belorussia  [Belarus] have become independent states and Kaliningrad  Oblast's territorial isolation from other parts of Russia has  become a reality, we face the acute issue of the need to have a  rear services base to build up stores and prepare reserves on  the main territory of Russia. The Leningrad Naval Base will  fulfill the role of such a rear services base for the Fleet.</p>

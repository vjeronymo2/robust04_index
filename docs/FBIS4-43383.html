			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henri Paillard: "European Debate in the National </F> Assembly"]    [Text] After the election of the 87 French deputies who  will take their seats in a European Parliament made up of 567,  at a time when everybody is analyzing the purely internal  implications of this election, the government yesterday tried to  draw a European lesson from this election. It will probably be  regretted that the European debate, opened by Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, came a little late, because it would certainly have  given some voters clarification about the European Union [EU]'s  real problems, which were often only touched on during the  campaign. On this subject, Jean Lipkowski (Rally for the  Republic) regretted that the debate which had just taken place  on the occasion of Sunday's [12 June] election was overly  influenced by internal political considerations.  <H5>  Dilution and Paralysis </H5>   At the heart of this debate there were two issues which are,  moreover, interrelated: expansion and institutional reform.  Alain Juppe defined the problem by asking whether the EU "has  not condemned itself to dilution by expanding." This is the  fundamental question asked by Alain Juppe, who wondered whether  Europe's expansion should be continued. His answer is yes, on  certain conditions. The negotiations with the new members have  been well conducted both for Europe and for France.    That leaves institutional reform which Alain Juppe admitted  that it has not yet been implemented, adding that the June 1992  Lisbon summit had not made it compulsory. This being so,  various risks exist, the minister admitted. First, "a dilution  into a free trade area and the disappearance of the common  policies which make up Europe's identity," and second, a risk of  "paralysis in the decisionmaking process."    The reform of European institutions must therefore be  planned  with care. The preparatory phase will take place in Corfu, with  the establishment of a think tank. In order to ensure a  "minimum" level of functioning of the EU machinery, Alain Juppe  is suggesting a strengthening of the European Council; an  increased role for the "general affairs" council; a change in  the number of commissioners; and a better implementation of the  subsidiarity principle, which will enable the institutions to  operate more democratically, especially if the Commission's  prerogatives and responsibilities are more clearly defined and  if the national parliaments are more effectively involved in  this approach. Moreover, this is what Philippe Seguin, as  speaker of the National Assembly, is demanding.    Valery Giscard d'Estaing devoted a large part of his speech  to institutional reform. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee asked: "What if the EU failed, either through  rejection or through becoming bogged down." According to the  deputy for le Puy-de-Dome, "the European campaign gave the  measure of the disenchantment," especially through the success  of negative ideas on Europe.    Institution reform must be "a vital precursor to any  expansion. Without such reform, Europe will be powerless," he  said, stressing his agreement with a number of the ideas  developed by Alain Juppe. Valery Giscard d'Estaing invoked the  dual spiritual inheritance of Robert Schuman and General de  Gaulle in arguing his vision of Europe: An impotent Europe  would have displeased the former, and a Europe disregarding  France's rights would have angered the latter.    We therefore had to wait until two days after the election  to  finally have the outline of what could have formed the framework  of a united line by the two majority parties.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Canadian tipped for OECD top job Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister, has clearly emerged as the leading candidate to head the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to informal soundings among its 25 member governments. These show Lord Lawson of the UK trailing in third place behind Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the French incumbent. But it is still unclear whether or when this support for Mr Johnston will crystallise into the consensus by which the Paris-based organisation traditionally conducts its business. He appears to have some backing from the divided ranks of the 19 European members as well as solid support from the six non-Europeans. 'The decision depends entirely on the Europeans at this stage,' said a non-European OECD envoy yesterday. 'They have got to make their views known.' But the three European candidates - Mr Paye, Lord Lawson and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a German - are all from European Union members that have yet to take their more important decision on a new president for the European Commission. 'Until that decision, it is impossible for us (EU members) to get together on a new OECD head', said a European diplomat yesterday. Ambassador Eric Rothlesberger of Switzerland, who has been given the task of sounding out countries on their preferences, said yesterday that the OECD's July 28-29 council meeting, the last before the summer break, was not an essential deadline, because Mr Paye's term expired on September 30. Ambassador Anne-Marie Doyle of Canada claimed yesterday that Mr Johnston was gaining 'strong support across all (geographical) regions' of the membership. The Canadian's most open supporter has been the US, which has argued that the new secretary general should be a non-European to reflect the expansion of the OECD which took in Mexico this year and may admit South Korea next year. Despite the anonymity of the soundings, Mr Johnston's supporters claim he now has a dozen governments behind him. Mr Paye is rumoured to have the clear support of half a dozen. Lord Lawson has apparently gained little support, beyond that of the UK, because of fears that while he would lend intellectual weight to the economic think-tank, his abrasive personality might rock a body used to consensus. Mr Schomerus was never considered a serious contender outside Bonn.</p>

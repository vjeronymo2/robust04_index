			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Departures that are overdue THE contemptuous downgrading of sterling on Friday was a continuous vote of no confidence in the British government, confirmed by every whinge to be heard from Whitehall. Everyone was in favour of our policy; it was the speculators; it was them, not us; nobody told us; everybody got their forecasts wrong; it could have happened to anyone . . . and a pfennig or more for each pathetic thought. Pathetic is indeed too kind a term; for these are all untruths. Signs of trouble were everywhere. German fears about the level of sterling were public from the first day. The whole market was expecting a crisis around the French referendum; and after the lira devaluation it was prudence, not speculation, to go short of suspect currencies. The authorities could have heard warnings in any City bar. There were also plenty of longer-term warnings. Not only from Sir Alan Walters (surely Mr Major can remember him?) and the Liverpool Six, but from Professor Wynne Godley in Cambridge and from a number of City economists. It is not even true that nobody in the Treasury or the Bank of England gave timely warnings. All of them were simply ignored. The prime minister may have imagined that he was following the example of Lady Thatcher in this 'not one of us' attitude to dissent, though she was far more pragmatic. It led directly to what is a disaster without precedent: a government caught not only with a discredited policy, which is common enough, but with no contingency plans for trouble. It is this failure which continues to undermine confidence. Until the government appears to be coming to grips with reality, it can expect neither to make a success of floating, nor to be welcomed back into the comfortless shelter of the ERM. We lack even the basis of a policy. Meanwhile, talk of long-term objectives - low inflation, or tax cuts, or a place at the heart of Europe - is simply fantasising. The government wants to be seen as serious: it must first show that it is seeking to understand rather than to excuse what went wrong. It started a long time ago. There has been no sign that anyone in the Treasury has at any time understood the consequences of the disastrous Lawson credit inflation, and the Bank's warnings were ignored. This left the economy too weakened by debt to withstand the rigours of a Bundesbank policy even in normal times, let alone in a reunification crisis. Hence the stream of cloud-cuckoo forecasts. And the same officials were not only unaware in advance that the ERM exchange rate was over-valued; they continue to deny it. There is no space here to go in to the sloppy theory behind this obstinacy. It is enough for the moment to say that you cannot hope to impress the markets by telling them that they are stupid, and a government which professes to believe in market discipline should not put up with such arrogance for a moment. The first step, then, would be to admit that the government has been guided by dreadful advice; and the second, to seek better. The Treasury should be calling in some of those who were right when it was wrong: its bete noire, Sir Alan Walters; some of the City monetarists who saw most of what was coming; and perhaps the economic modellers of Liverpool and Cambridge, whose official research funds were cut off because, it seems, their methods were too unlike those which have failed at the Treasury. It is a bit late, though, to hope to inspire confidence simply by showing that ministers are now willing to listen to both sides of an argument. The markets need to know that the old errors have been discarded; and the most convincing way to doing that is not only to bring in new advisers, but get rid of the old ones. This might even, in present circumstances, mean getting rid of the minority who were right, in the Bank as well as the Treasury, as well as the rest. This would not be fair, but fairness may be more than we can afford at the moment. All that matters is to be convincing.</p>

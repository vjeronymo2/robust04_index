			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Circular" entitled "Beware of Psychological Warfare," </F> issued by the Fatah Central Committee and signed by Committee  Secretary Abu-al-Lutf (Faruq Qaddumi); date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] To all brother members, friends, and the sons of our  Palestinian people:    The Palestinian arena has suffered from many fabricated  conflicts. Those who wish to create conflicts in the future are  attempting to portray, in advance, the situation in the  territory from which the Israeli enemy will withdraw.    The Mosad began to assassinate nationalist symbols and  strugglers in the occupied territory just as the racist regime  in South Africa assassinated struggler Chris Hani and created  bloody riots in which hundreds of black citizens were killed.    The same experiment is being repeated in the Palestinian  territory. The Israeli occupation could not fabricate bloody  conflicts among the resistance factions, so it resorted to  assassinations. Palestinian strugglers from all revolutionary  factions -- such as Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, and other factions -- were exposed to  the killing and arrests we have seen in Gaza and the West Bank.  The Israeli occupation wanted to create a state of chaos and  insecurity on the eve of the promised Israeli withdrawal from  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area on 13 December. When these  attempts failed, the Israeli occupation postponed the withdrawal  and began to maliciously aggravate sensitivities and  differences, (?embody) them, and exaggerate them. Some of us  fell victims to this black media. International and hostile  press contributed to the inflation of Palestinian events in  order to portray the areas from which the enemy will withdraw as  if they were moving toward conflagration.    This propaganda ended the joy felt by many people and  created  fear and concern in their hearts. This resulted in an internal  situation that produced national, factional events and  differences. Regrettably, the media and press highlighted these  unjustified differences. People became more worried about  security and stability and cautioned against the future. Many  articles were published in newspapers and the Palestinian  leadership was, for no reason, the target of criticism and  defamation.    Popular awareness is necessary so that the masses will be  ready for national reconciliation. It is also essential so that  the leading cadres will be ready to undertake this mission  through their deep understanding of the nature of the coming  stage, which calls on them to be disciplined, calm,  self-confident, and convinced in their future mission so that  the masses will find security.    We must be aware that the Israeli occupation is the cause of  our instability, starvation, and loss of our freedom of  expression. The end of this occupation means the elimination of  these diseases, which were caused by the occupation of our  Palestinian territory for many years. Ending the occupation of  a part of our land will certainly bring us back to normal and  will prepare us to work seriously in building the free  Palestinian society of the future.    Responsible behavior is a test for the awareness of the  factions, cadres, and masses, which should not vie for  authority, but should work for fostering cooperation between all  parties for the sake of construction. Authority has not been  attained yet, and the results of occupation are still before our  eyes.    We ask every member of the police and security forces to  behave as a loyal servant to the security of the masses. The  police and security forces should maintain the masses' property  and their freedom of expression.    The image in the masses' mind that the police and security  forces are coming to impose a coercive system should be changed.  The police and security forces have come to maintain human  relations between the people and to provide the appropriate  atmosphere so that the masses can resume their natural life from  which they have been deprived for so long. They were deprived  of holding parties, celebrations, meetings, and seminars. They  were deprived of cooperating with various groups, and of  establishing social, cultural, economic groups, and practicing  all actions that the human being practices in a stable society.    This is the task of everyone affiliated with a movement,  faction, organization, or political party, because democracy  cannot be entrenched as an expression of human rights and  freedom unless all Palestinian organizations act properly in  dealing with one another first, and then in dealing with the  masses in general. The factions should refrain from inciting  differences or digging in the past, which might incite  factional, family, or religious differences, so that every  citizen will feel that the liberated homeland is his homeland,  and that he is living in it freely, and is enjoying security and  stability.    We stand before an experiment that the world is witnessing,  and on the basis of which it will judge our good or bad  performance and our administration of the liberated territories.  The reaction of the friendly world and the donors will be good  or bad in accordance with our administration and the national  relations that we will weave between the citizens and the  resistance factions, and their performance of their national  duties on the ground.    There is no society that is free from social, political, or  economic problems, but the developed societies give prominence  to these problems and explain them in an objective manner. They  try to resolve them through a collective effort after reaching  the successful solutions for such problems. They keep rival  groups away from fighting, confrontation, and inciting local  conflicts to enable the national authority organs and the  resistance factions carry out their duties comfortably, in a  manner that keeps them away from confrontation with the masses  and serve the masses' daily interests in an honest and sincere  manner.    Our past experiences remained in our minds as Palestinians  in  spite of the signs of [word indistinct] that surfaced in the  Palestinian society. We should return to our nature of national  solidarity, collective action, and eagerness to serve the masses  and offer all that they need in this transitional stage in which  suspicion, doubt, and anxiety are abundant, and the enemy is  sowing these fears in the whole Arab area.    The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for  the whole Arab area because the Palestine question is the crux  of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and all that takes place within  its framework is directly reflected on the Arab situation.  Therefore, we should be a good example in behavior and  performance when we build our future society.    From now, we recommend that voluntary teams of women be  formed in every walk of life. Let us enable women to do  considerable social and economic work; let us organize their  efforts in social, economic, and cultural institutions; and let  us open schools to train and enlighten them in order to qualify  them and make them capable of work, sacrifice, and  participation. If such groups had been formed in quarters and  camps to carry out a comprehensive survey of people's needs, we  would have been able to accelerate economic development.    We also should qualify youths, find job opportunities for  them, and train them in all cultural, social, and economic  fields. Let a school be opened every day for these youths so  that our society can become full of qualified people capable of  construction. Someone said that the voice of work is stronger  than the roar of words. We have to take into account that the  current transitional stage is witnessing some sort of mix of  criticism, freedom of speech, and insult; of narrow sectarian  prejudice and enlightened political affiliation; and of those  who just raise national unity slogans and those who work to  realize those slogans on the ground. We also notice another  kind of mix in what is possible in this transitional period and  what is impossible and of short-term and strategic goals. We  have no magic wand to achieve what we want. Instead, we have to  continue our struggle to make achievements gradually day after  day and year after year.    We should not seek certain positions. Instead, we should  work because work will lead us to suitable positions. We are  not in a stage of sharing the booty, as some unexperienced  people believe. We are now surveying and promoting our  qualifications to carry out our missions and to continue our  hard struggle, in which opinions on the ways to achieve national  goals differ. The enemy, with its sins, is still penetrating  our circles through the pains, the backwardness, and the social  diseases it has left behind. We have to remove them through  hard work and through our social and political awareness.    Let us refrain from punishing those who committed mistakes.  Let us try to reform them and make them good citizens. We also  should promote the spirit of cooperation among all the militant  forces without exception, we should behave like instructors and  educators, and we should forgive people of their mistakes by  dealing with these mistakes in sound ways and far from grudge  and hatred. The homeland is for every one, and every one has  contributed to its liberation and has to contribute to its  construction.</p>

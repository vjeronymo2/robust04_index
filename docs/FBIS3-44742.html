			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "British Side Has No Sincerity in Cooperation </F> on New Airport"]    [Text] On 3 January, the British Hong Kong Government  released a white paper for consultations on a draft new airport  ordinance. The consultation papers were released after pressure  from the Chinese side, for the draft ordinance on the new  airport has a great bearing not only on the building of the new  airport, but also on its future management, as well as the  financial commitments of Hong Kong residents and the interests  of the Special Administrative Region [SAR]. It has been  stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the  Memorandum on Hong Kong's New Airport that all major issues  straddling 1997 should be subjected to consultations and  discussions with both the Chinese and British sides and should  not be determined unilaterally by the British side. Therefore,  after the release of the draft, the British side has a  responsibility, through appropriate channels, to explain to the  Chinese side the contents of the draft, the background  information on detailed arrangements, and the exact definition  of ordinances, heed the concrete opinions of the Chinese side,  and make amendments to the draft.    The Chinese side has always been worried about whether or  not  the British side had the sincerity to implement the "Memorandum  of Understanding on the Building of Hong Kong's New Airport and  Related Issues." It is stated clearly in the second paragraph  of the memorandum: "The airport project should pay attention to  cost efficiency, and should not become a financial burden to the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic  of China after 30 June 1997." However, the British side has put  forward financial arrangements on the construction costs of the  airport, claiming that "a ceiling should not be set on the  cost"; as a result, the SAR government will be left with  "callable equity" of over HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars].  This is why an agreement has not been reached on the financial  arrangement for such a long period of time.    In the draft white paper on the airport, is there a  supervision mechanism which aims to ensure that money will not  be wasted during construction of the airport, that no one can  throw away public money like water, and that the franchise will  not be given to British conglomerates at very low rates and  conditions? Doubts remains on this issue, because the relevant  draft has failed to strictly reflect the stipulations of the  airport memorandum, and also fails to stipulate that all  contracts and agreements signed by the Airport Authority should  be submitted to the Airport Affairs Committee of the  Sino-British Liaison Group for discussion and examination, or to  the relevant departments of the Hong Kong Government for  approval and evaluation. As a result, what the Airport  Authority needs to do is to simply show their accounts to the  Hong Kong Government once a year. Under such circumstances, no  administrative departments will know exactly the actual  operation of the Airport Authority. Such a practice is similar  to that of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,  where overspending was not supervised by relevant departments of  the Hong Kong Government and Hong Kong Government auditors had  no right to check on demand the accounts of the new Airport  Authority and can only "check accounts on issues entailing  special concern" upon authorization from the Hong Kong Governor.  In other words, neither the public nor the Hong Kong Government  can take immediate preventive or restrictive action, and all  they can do is cry over spilt milk.    The operation of the airport as a whole should reflect the  idea of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. Priority should  be given to Chinese when the chief and principal executives need  to be recruited. Overseas recruitment will only be considered  when the talents required cannot be found among Chinese. In the  past, however, the Provisional Airport Authority appointed  Richard Allen as chief executive officer. Without any sense of  responsibility or attachment to Hong Kong, this man overmanned  the airport authority, spent money extravagantly, and included  entertainment and holiday spending in his inspection  expenditures. What is more ridiculous is that he regarded the  Provisional Airport Authority as his independent kingdom and  appointed people through favoritism, he invited many of his old  friends to take well-paid positions and shared the lucre with  them, and he only recruited staff from overseas and rejected  participation by locals. By the time it became aware of the  problem and was forced to end the chaotic and disordered  situation in the Airport Authority caused by Richard Allen, the  Government had no alternative but to compensate Richard Allen  with HK$5 million because his contract was terminated his  contract with the Government. In addition, the white paper also  failed to put forward the necessary supervisory procedures on  personnel recruitment and corporatized personnel management; as  a result, the president and executive director will be entrusted  with excessive powers to handle personnel arrangements. The  general public believe that the principal manager of the new  airport should be a local. Yueh Kung-nan, the present director  of Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, is also a Hong Kong  local, and the Hong Kong people are truly satisfied with the  current management standards at Kai Tak Airport under his  leadership. So why is the draft white paper reluctant to draw  such a stipulation that the principal post at the new airport  must be filled by a Hong Kong resident?    If the British side leaves the SAR government with a new  airport authority which was set up before 1997 and used to be  run by people like Richard Allen, the SAR government will find  itself facing many operational difficulties when it discovers  numerous problems in this management organ at a later date and  has to ask the chief executive of the SAR to dismiss and replace  the organ's staff.    It is stated in the airport memorandum: "The British Hong  Kong Government can exercise leadership over the Airport  Authority and shoulder responsibility for major policy fields  before 30 June 1997. The British Hong Kong Government will be  willing to give consideration to the opinions of the Chinese  side when drafting the ordinance of the authority," "the British  Hong Kong Government is willing to appoint Hong Kong-based  officials from the Bank of China Group as formal members of the  board of directors of the Airport Authority," and "the British  Hong Kong Government will notify the Chinese side of its  proposed appointment of members to the Airport Authority and the  consultative committee and is willing to heed any opinions of  Chinese side before a final decision on the appointments are  made." At present, many clauses in the draft white paper are  imperfect and vaguely defined. Now that the Preliminary Working  Committee consists of both Hong Kong people and Chinese  officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs, we hope that the  British side can provide the Preliminary Working Committee with  explanations (for instance, is the Airport Authority defined in  the memorandum a synonym of the New Airport Corporation) so that  the Hong Kong people and the Chinese side can acquire a better  understanding of the draft white paper and can thus offer more  pertinent opinions.    However, Hamish Macleod and Anson Chan Fang On-sang  yesterday  flatly rejected a request from the members of the Preliminary  Working Committee concerning such an explanation. This shows  that the British side is refusing to cooperate with the Chinese  side on the building of Hong Kong's new airport and, at the same  time, is declining to provide Hong Kong people with reasonable  explanations and data. Their sincerity about soliciting  opinions is open to question.</p>

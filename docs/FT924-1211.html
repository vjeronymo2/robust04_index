			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Germany may cut social spending SHARP CUTS in social spending and in tax allowances for the better-paid are under serious consideration by the German government and opposition as part of their negotiations on a 'solidarity pact' to finance the costs of unification. The aim is to minimise any future tax increases necessary to pay off the burden of accumulated debt in east Germany and to keep essential subsidies going to eastern enterprises and the unemployed. Charges and counter-charges were flying in Bonn yesterday about the scale and scope of the cuts being planned, after publication of a purported list of social spending measures likely to be included. On the list are cuts in unemployment benefit, student grants, children's allowances, social security for asylum-seekers, rent rebates, maternity benefits, and the like. It also proposes an effective freeze on civil servants' salaries, to rise by no more than 3 per cent a year, with a further one per cent deduction for 'social justice'. Publication brought a furious reaction from opposition politicians, who said the poorest would have to bear the brunt of the soaring costs of unification. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, denied that the purported savings plans came from his ministry, or from the Chancellor's office. There was a strong suspicion in Bonn political circles yesterday that the one-sided list of spending cuts had been circulated by colleagues close to Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD, who attended meetings with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday. The Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, yesterday unanimously approved the Maastricht treaty on European union, to complete the parliamentary ratification process in Germany. A deal with the government means that the 16 federal Lander (states) in the Bundesrat will have much greater involvement in the process of European Community legislation enshrined in the German constitution.</p>

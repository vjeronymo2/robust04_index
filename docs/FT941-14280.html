			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Washington shut as 96 die in cold The US government and private businesses shut down in Washington yesterday after Mrs Sharon Pratt Kelly, the city's mayor, declared an emergency in the face of record cold weather. States from Kentucky to Pennsylvania also declared emergencies as frostbite and icy roads claimed at least 96 lives - far more than died in this week's California earthquake. Electricity and gas companies, unable to cope with the demand for power, were forced to impose rotating blackouts on their customers on Wednesday and begged customers to turn down their thermostats. In the end, they asked local governments to shut businesses down in order to reduce the double drain of home and office heating. While utility companies can usually buy in power from their neighbours to cope with unusual demands, sub-zero temperatures covered such a wide area of the country - from Alabama to Maine - that few generators had much spare power to sell. Washington, poised between north and south and afflicted with the weather extremes of both, always seems to suffer more than other places when snow or ice hits. New Yorkers trudged stoically to work yesterday with few noticeable disruptions, while North Dakotans continued to jog despite temperatures as low as - 32 degrees Celsius. But in Washington yesterday, everything closed as the city declared its first ever emergency in a bid to cut down on fuel consumption. Non-essential businesses faced fines of up to Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 675) if they opened, but few workers seemed to be running that risk as snow coated the ice that city emergency workers had been unable to control with salt and sand. Those bold enough to drive faced a half-hour struggle to get cars warmed up and dug out. Those who favoured public transport had to gamble with unpredictable bus timetables and routes. The good news yesterday was that weather forecasters expected warmer weather  -but the east coast could wait days or weeks before temperatures rise above freezing.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dutch finance group rises 2.3% to Fl 395m LOSSES in non-life insurance and reinsurance limited the rise in net profit at ING Group, the big Dutch banking and insurance company, to 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. Net profit increased to Fl 395m (Dollars 219m) from Fl 386m the year before, after adjustments to reflect new accountancy principles adopted in early 1993. If it had not been for these accounting changes, net profit in the first quarter would have risen by 10.3 per cent, ING said. The losses in non-life and reinsurance overshadowed a strong increase in profits in life insurance, with North America in particular posting substantially higher results. Overall, operating losses at ING's insurance arm dropped by 10.3 per cent to Fl 243m. However, ING's banking operations posted a pre-tax operating increase of 16.9 per cent to Fl 298m, helping to compensate for the downturn in insurance.</p>

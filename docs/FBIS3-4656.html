This is a grave military provocation inciting North-South  confrontation and bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula  to an extreme pitch of strain. It is an unpardonable criminal  act against the dialogue partner.    South Korean people and students are now staging fierce  demonstrations urging a stop to the introduction of the Patriot  missiles and "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. Even the  opposition Democratic Party expresses strong opposition to this.    The anti-war, anti-nuke movement in South Korea is a very  just struggle based on the patriotic stand to achieve peace on  the Korean peninsula, and, accordingly, it can never be a target  of suppression.    The Kim Yong-sam group, however, is brutally suppressing the  just anti-war, anti-nuke struggle of the South Korean people.  This eloquently proves that the puppet clique is desperately  trying to light the train of another war against the DPRK by  introducing U.S. destruction weapons into South Korea at  whatever cost.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must not run amok, clearly mindful  that to crack down upon the just patriotic struggle of the  people at the point of bayonet and rush headlong along the road  of division and confrontation will eventually precipitate his  own destruction.</p>

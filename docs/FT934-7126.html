			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Radio WITH Christmas around the corner, Radio 4 is running a Sunday series for non-believers, Devout Sceptics, in conversations with Bel Mooney. The first sceptic was Lord Healey, worth listening to on anything. Philosophy at Oxford destroyed any question of belief, though he began his scepticism at about 13. Now he has faith, not in God, but in the business - chiefly music  -usually attributed to the soul by those who believe in it, which he does not. He feels no loss, and believes death to mean the end of physical currency, no more. Tomorrow, we have Lady Warnock, a less complex case. She is a practising member of the Church of England, but cannot accede to the beliefs that Christianity requires. There must be many in her state, who follow the Christian practice, perhaps admire and enjoy the saga, certainly the ceremony, but mentally cross the fingers when saying the Creed. Devotion lies in the continuous ritual the church provides. Lady Warnock has no hope of life after death, either; we die, she thinks, like other animals. The Saturday and Sunday evening dramas to which I am addicted were better this week. Radio 3 on Sunday gave us Amos Oz's Black Box, about Alex, a distinguished Israeli working in America, Ilana, his divorced wife, Boaz, a dubiously legitimate son, and Michel, Ilana's second husband, involved in Israeli affairs, plus a lawyer, Manfred, who looks after Alex's accounts. Their relationships are interesting, but in Guy Meredith's adaptation are revealed almost entirely in letters exchanged between the characters. The titular black box is really a dramatic extra. Ned Chaillet directed. Radio 4 on Monday gave us Of Rats and Men, by Richard Bean. A famous, unnamed Professor (Garrick Hagon) upgrades his experiments from rats to men. His new assistant, Pearce (Anton Lesser), is asked to simulate the pain of increasingly powerful electric shocks administered by volunteers. Will they go on when they hear the yells of the suffering subject? Will they actually press the switch labelled fatal? When does obedience give way to sympathy? There is an aura of the lab throughout the play, a touch even of science-fiction, but it is exciting enough in its way. Andy Jordan directed.</p>

Rioting  unleashed last week by promises of political reform has died down, but at least  157 people who were arrested await trial on charges such as illegal assembly,  looting, attempted murder and assault. Gramoz Pashko, a Democratic Party  founder who also met with Carcani, said he asked that elections scheduled for  Feb. 10 be postponed by several months.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eugen Georg Schwarz: "Scharping Surpasses Kohl"] </F>   [Text] It is a mystery to the chancellor's friends and to  the chancellor himself in particular: The Germans say that he  has more political experience than his challenger Rudolf  Scharping. They stress that he acts better as a statesman, he  has a considerably higher reputation abroad, and he has the same  ability to push through what he wants. However, only a minority  -- just 29 percent -- would vote for him in direct elections  because Scharping has more "charisma" and, thus, gets 43 percent  of the votes.    However, even the challenger cannot be completely satisfied  with this glorious result of opinion research in January,  because as many as 27 percent of the Germans in the new laender,  as well as 14 percent in the west, said: "We would not vote for  either of them." Twelve percent in the east and the west do not  know whom they would prefer as chancellor.    However, one thing is certain: The reputation of the Federal  Government and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] is falling deeper and deeper into the icy depths  of opinion. As a result, large circles, in particular the CDU,  are shivering: Only about one-quarter of the Germans expect the  government led by the CDU to master the "current main political  problems and tasks best," while 39 percent think that of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD].    Only in economic policy (38 to 30 percent) and in combating  crime (29 to 28 percent) is the coalition expected to be a bit  more competent than an SPD-led government. In all other fields,  the trust in the chancellor and in his team has waned. Be it in  unemployment (17 to 45 percent), tax policy (21 to 43 percent),  state debts (25 to 27 percent) or in social policy (13 to 64  percent), the majority says: "The Social Democrats would be  better able to solve the problems." This applies even to one of  the current domains of the CDU/CSU as the guarding of price  stability. A total of 31 percent of those polled thought that  here, too, the SPD would do better (coalition: 27 percent).    Those in the Konrad-Adenauer House [CDU headquarters] and in  the Chancellor's Office in Bonn, who have not yet dressed warmly  in view of these figures, are beginning to freeze: Only 18  percent of the Germans want a coalition government under the  leadership of the CDU or a CDU/CSU government, but 32 percent  think: The SPD should rule on its own or should be the decisive  force in a coalition.    Despite these devastating results of the FOCUS poll, the  CDU/CSU has not yet completely lost among the voters. Facing  the decision of making a cross on the voting slip for the  Bundestag elections here and now, 34 percent (minus 1 percentage  point compared with December 1993) would still vote for the  CDU/CSU, while 39 percent would vote for the SPD (plus/minus  zero).    Just like before the Bundestag elections in 1990, the polls  in the new laender are damaging the CDU/CSU's hopes for winning  the all-German elections. While in western Germany, 37 percent  would again vote for the CDU/CSU, in eastern Germany, the CDU  would get only a meager 23 percent. Here, the old communists of  the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] would get a proud 16.5  percent of the votes of mourning GDR nostalgics, which, however,  would not be enough for entering the Bonn parliament again  because of the nationwide 4-percent threshold, unless Gysi and  company managed to get a direct mandate.    The strategists of the CDU/CSU can turn these figures around  as much as they want: At the moment, the coalition is so far  removed from a majority among the population as Helmut Schmidt  with his Social-Liberal team in the past. Together with the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] (8 percent), the CDU/CSU  would get 42 percent of the votes. The SPD and the Greens (10  percent), on the other hand, would get 49 percent of the votes  and thus have a sufficiently solid majority in the Bundestag,  because, in addition to the PDS, Republikaner (3 percent) and  "others" (2 percent) would not enter the Bundestag either.    However, if the parties were to take into consideration only  these results, they might reckon without their actual host,  namely those who have not yet decided. A total of 26 percent of  those eligible to vote do not yet know which party they will  vote for. The struggle for votes will focus primarily on them  because their decision can change the election result to such an  extent that it will give the lie to the election forecasts.    The real surprise, however, which everyone -- from Helmut  Kohl and Theo Waigel to Klaus Kinkel and Rudolf Scharping -- can  enjoy is the low number of those Germans who would not vote at a  Bundestag election. On behalf of FOCUS, Basis Research asked  1,500 people eligible to vote (of them 1,000 in western Germany)  and only 12 percent of them answered: "I will not vote." This  means that the turnout would definitely be over 80 percent.  Thus, the often- mentioned "disenchantment with politics" would  just be an empty shell.    The Bundestag elections will be won by those who give a  convincing answer to the dominant question: Who will finally  lead us, how and when, out of the economic low and get the  almost 4 million unemployed back to work?    All over Germany, the present "general" economic situation  is rated very poorly: 49 percent say it is "bad" or "very bad."  Only 15 percent think it is "good" or even "very good" (1  percent). A total of 35 percent think it is neither good nor  bad.    This mood is bound to send shivers down the spines of  politicians, unless there were the replies to the following  question: "How do you assess your personal economic situation?"  To this question, 6 percent replied "very good," 53 percent  "good," 30 percent "neither good nor bad," a mere 9 percent said  "bad," and 2 percent "very bad."    It seems that those who have always said "the mood is worse  than the actual situation" are right.    Even in the new laender, the polling institutes spot  contentment -- not even four years after the "monetary union."  A total of 45 percent say: "I am fine or even very fine." Only  15 percent complain: "I am in a bad or even a very bad way."  Forty percent reply: "neither/nor."    The level of optimism is not going down either: Only 15  percent of Germans see a dark future and fear that they might be  worse off in a year's time. But 19 percent are convinced: "I  will be better off then." A total of 66 percent think that  their economic situation will not change.    Here, too, there is a big gap between the "personal" and  "general" economic situations, for the Germans do not assess the  economic future of their country as brightly as their own. Only  2 percent are convinced that "things will be much better in a  year's time." "Somewhat better," is how 29 percent rate the  year 1995. "The same," say 40 percent, "somewhat worse," 23  percent, and 5 percent say it will be "much worse."    If one compares the positive and the negative replies, the  following becomes apparent: Optimism is growing. In February  1993, the relation between "things will get better" and "things  will get worse" was 26:38 percent; in January 1994, the ratio  was 31:28 percent. The curve of optimism reached its peak in  June 1993: Back then, 35 percent thought that things will be  "better" in a year's time, while only 26 percent said that  things will get "worse."    The elections will be won by those who can present the most  convincing answers to the questions that most bother the voters:  unemployment (the biggest problem for 58 percent), economic  policy (26 percent), social policy (24), fighting radicalism  (23), foreigners (20), and internal security (19 percent).    The election campaign arena is set. The match can begin.</p>

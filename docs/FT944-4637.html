			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fox accuses NBC of hindering expansion The row between Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television and rival US network NBC escalated yesterday with Fox accusing NBC of trying to suppress competition. NBC had claimed Fox contravened US regulations by being foreign owned. In a submission to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the regulator, Fox said NBC was trying to preserve the 'old boys' club' of the established networks and hinder Fox's expansion. In a letter to FCC chairman Mr Reed Hundt, Mr Murdoch said NBC was wrong in law in saying foreign ownership in broadcasting companies was flatly limited to 25 per cent. 'Rather, Congress gave the FCC discretion to limit foreign ownership to 25 per cent if, and only if, it finds on a case-by-case basis that the public interest would be served,' he said. Instead, the FCC had twice ruled in Fox's favour. NBC had claimed that control of Fox has passed from Mr Murdoch, who is a US citizen, to his company News Corporation, which is Australian. Fox argued that its immediate parent, Twentieth Century Holdings, is 76 per cent owned and controlled by Mr Murdoch personally. News Corporation, which owns the remaining 24 per cent, is de facto controlled by Mr Murdoch, Fox said, and derives more than 60 per cent of its sales and profits from the US. In Australia, it is regarded as a US company for the purpose of holding broadcast licences.</p>

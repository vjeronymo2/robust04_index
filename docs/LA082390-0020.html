			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN BELATEDLY JOINS EFFORT TO KEEP AIR BASE IN EL SEGUNDO  </P> <P> After maintaining a low profile on the issue for months, Gov. George Deukmejian  has joined the drive to keep the 3,200-employee Air Force Space Systems  Division in El Segundo, officials close to the governor say.  </P> <P> The officials say the state is now studying how it can help ease a shortage of  low-cost housing for local Air Force personnel, a key problem underlying the  service's tentative plan to move its space unit from the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a local business leader says Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has  agreed to consider turning city land over to the Air Force for low-cost housing  as part of an effort to head off the proposed move.  </P> <P> Sam Iacobellis, a Rockwell International executive who chairs an aerospace  panel for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, said the mayor give him the  assurance Aug. 14.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the mayor said he could not confirm that such a proposal is in  the works, but he added that Bradley's office has begun studying how to help  keep the space division in El Segundo.  </P> <P> The Air Force has discussed moving the base elsewhere in California, as well as  to Colorado or New Mexico.  </P> <P> Deukmejian and Bradley's involvement comes as a boost to a bipartisan lobbying  effort against a transfer of the Space Systems Division, which oversees  research, planning and procurement of military space hardware.  </P> <P> If the move occurs, it would probably also involve the transfer of the  4,000-employee Aerospace Corp., a nonprofit think tank in El Segundo that works  closely with the space division. Losing the two units would be a major blow to  the Los Angeles area's struggling aerospace industry, chamber and local  officials say.  </P> <P> "Aside from the immediate impact of over 7,000 lost jobs, the indirect costs in  jobs and lost revenue for the aerospace sector are staggering," U.S. Rep. Mel  Levine (D-Santa Monica), said at a press conference Tuesday in El Segundo.  </P> <P> The Air Force announced in January that it might close Los Angeles Air Force  Base -- the site of the space system division -- and transfer the space unit  elsewhere as part of a drive to cut defense spending.  </P> <P> For months, the governor took a hands-off approach to avoid favoring El Segundo  over the other in-state sites that the Air Force is considering as alternatives  -- March AFB near Riverside and Vandenberg AFB near Lompoc.  </P> <P> But proponents of two out-of-state sites in contention -- Colorado Springs,  Colo., and Albuquerque, N.M. -- are waging aggressive lobbying campaigns for  the division. And they enjoy strong backing from their respective governors --  Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico and Roy Romer of Colorado.  </P> <P> Officials say Deukmejian is now concerned that unless he works actively to keep  the space division in El Segundo, there is a good chance it will be shifted out  of California.  </P> <P> "It has become apparent that the best way to keep (the division) in California  is to try and keep it right where it is," said John Geoghegan, secretary of the  state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency. "If the Air Force decides it  is going to be moved, the out-of-state locations will become very competitive."  </P> <P> Kenneth Gibson, director of the state Department of Commerce, says the governor  will try to keep the space division in California if the Air Force decides that  a transfer has to take place. Deukmejian's next choice for the base would be  March AFB, he said.  </P> <P> But the assurance does not satisfy the Inland Empire Space Systems Division  Relocation Group, a business coalition pushing hard for the March AFB site.  </P> <P> Stephen Albright, the group's chairman, says he fears that California will lose  the space division if the state wastes time and money trying to keep the unit  in a place that has proved unsatisfactory to the Air Force.  </P> <P> He notes that the Air Force is dissatisfied not only with housing prices in the  Los Angeles area, but also with the high cost of services, traffic congestion  and the high price of land for future expansion.  </P> <P> "There are reasons why businesses are leaving the (Los Angeles) area, and it is  cost-related," Albright said. "We can't just gloss these problems over."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The Air Force has scheduled a public hearing on the environmental impact of  closing the base for 7 p.m. Monday in the El Segundo High School auditorium.  Air Force Secretary Donald Rice is expected to announce his final  recommendation on Los Angeles Air Force Base in December. Any decision to close  the base would have to be approved by Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and  later by Congress.  </P></p>

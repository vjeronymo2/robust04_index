			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> NAVY ENDS CONTRACTS FOR V-22 OSPREYS  </P> <P> The Navy announced in Washington it has complied with orders by Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney and terminated all production contracts for the  controversial V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft program for the Marines. Cheney  and Congress were at odds this year over Cheney's decision to kill the  $27-billion program for the revolutionary aircraft, which takes off and lands  like a helicopter and flies like a plane. Congress eventually agreed to fund  only research and development and not production, and Cheney ordered the  production contracts terminated.  </P></p>

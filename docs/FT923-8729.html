			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Unequal burdens and benefits of German unification GERMAN unification could hardly have come at a worse time for the UK economy. The Bundesbank's subsequent struggle to contain German inflation has depressed economic growth across Europe and prolonged recession in debt-burdened Britain. But few complaints about the economic effects of unification are heard from either the US or Japan, where it has delivered net economic gains rather than pain. Unification has had two contrasting economic effects outside Germany. Within Europe it has meant persistently high real interest rates as Bonn's tight monetary policy has been transmitted by the exchange rate mechanism. But the effects of higher east German spending have also spilled outside German borders. Germany's current account surplus has swung into deficit as imports have grown and west German exporters have redirected their sales eastward. Germany has bucked the trend among the six largest industrialised countries over the past three years. In every other country, domestic activity has grown progressively more slowly, as the chart shows. But unification has fuelled the growth of German domestic demand: the sum of the growth rates of consumption, investment and government spending in west Germany increased from 2.6 per cent in 1989 to 4.5 per cent in 1990. Domestic demand in the unified Germany grew by 4.1 per cent in 1991. The German statistics in this week's national accounts table cover west Germany only. They show exports growing by 12.1 per cent in 1991. But the bulk of these exports were moving from west to east Germany. The IMF figures, on which the chart is based, cover the unified Germany in 1991 and 1992. They show that the fall in net external demand for German goods - the combination of falling pan-German exports and rising imports - reduced Germany's overall growth rate by 2.7 percentage points in 1991. The US and Japan have escaped the direct effect of Germany's monetary contraction. Both have been able to cut interest rates in the face of relatively sharp falls in domestic consumption and investment compared to most European countries, the result of tight domestic monetary policies in the late 1980s. Yet both have benefited from the growth in export opportunities. The value of US exports to Germany has grown by 32 per cent between the first quarter of 1990 and 1992. The value of Japanese exports grew by 42 per cent over the same period. US exports have grown faster than imports in each of the last three years, raising the rate of growth of gross domestic product in 1989 and 1990 and partially offsetting last year's contraction in domestic demand. US total export volumes grew by 5.8 per cent last year, propelled by the boost to US export competitiveness from the slide in the value of the dollar. In Japan, despite US moans, the external sector of the economy actually depressed the overall GDP growth rate in 1989 and 1990. Only in 1991 did the external sector add to, rather than subtract from, GDP growth. Within Europe the negative effect of high interest rates has more than outweighed the positive effect of higher German demand for European goods. Economic growth in Europe, excluding Germany, was only  1/2 per cent last year. But French growth would have been slower had it not been for the 4.2 per cent growth in its export volumes. The fall in UK domestic demand was also cushioned by the external sector, but mainly because imports were falling as the sluggish 0.5 per cent growth in export volumes confirms. The economic impact of unification is becoming increasingly one-sided. The boost to European demand is diminishing swiftly as German spending slows, but interest rates remain high. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects European economic growth, excluding Germany, to rise to 1 1/2 per cent this year, driven by a pick-up in domestic demand. But both this and the IMF forecasts in the chart are based on the increasingly unlikely assumption that European interest rates will fall this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GNP/GDP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series rather than under investment. Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Karl Feldmeyer: "The Adequate Decision"] </F>   [Text] The course and the result of the NATO summit are an  important indication of the state of the alliance. If the two  days of meetings among heads of state and government in Brussels  are compared with the 1991 Rome summit meeting and, a year  earlier, the one in London, it can be seen that the Atlantic  alliance is still the most important basis for peace and  security in Europe. Yet, it has also become obvious that this  is exactly why NATO is at the moment unable to come up to  people's expectations. It disappointed the hopes of the Central  and East European countries, which would like to join NATO, and  has thus gone onto the defensive.    This has overshadowed the offer of military cooperation on  which the heads of state and government agreed in Brussels, even  though what NATO is offering the countries in Central and East  Europe with the Partnership for Peace is quite something. The  offer includes joint military exercises, seats for  representatives of the partner states at NATO's political and  military headquarters in Europe, staff cooperation for planning  and implementing UN operations and crisis management, and the  harmonization of the armed forces of the partner states on  technology and operational procedures to facilitate cooperation  with NATO forces in the future. Moreover, NATO has promised its  future partners consultations when they feel threatened.    Hence, NATO is being serious when it expresses its intention  to develop pan-European security structures and to include its  former opponents in such structures. What is taking place here  is of a different quality than irregular meetings within the UN  framework. NATO's plan to negotiate a treaty with each partner  state to specify the framework document that was adopted in  Brussels according to the individual country's capabilities and  interests offers additional opportunities to do justice to  individual needs.    All that has an impact on Europe's security. That this has  failed to get the praise desired by NATO is due to the fact that  many governments to which this offer was directed only see it as  a consolation prize that is unable to alleviate their  disappointment about being unable to become NATO members in the  foreseeable future and to remain without protection that the  alliance's assistance obligation would offer. Their position is  determined by the desire to protect themselves against  imponderables and dangers that might once more emanate from  Russia.    In view of these countries' experience, their position is  understandable. However, the NATO members had very good reasons  to turn down their request. Future developments in Russia and  other important countries in East Europe appear uncertain. The  risks that NATO would have incurred with the assistance  obligation would not be calculable. Moreover, the assistance  obligation would have to have been reinforced by the political  will and the military capabilities to use NATO forces in faraway  eastern areas under currently unclear framework conditions. The  assistance obligation must not be an empty promise that would  imperil NATO's credibility.    Germany would have special difficulties with such  consequences, not only because it might involve new armament  efforts but also because it would reestablish NATO's old  front-line position against Moscow, and it would forfeit the  chance to integrate Russia. This, however, would run counter to  the interests of all the European countries. The experience  from history is obvious: Without taking into consideration  Russian interests and without integrating Russia into a European  security system there can be no security, particularly for those  states that strongly miss this security right now: Russia's  immediate neighbors.    Only very rarely does one get the chance to build a security  system that is inherently stable because it is based on an  accommodation of interests of all the states on the continent.  This is why this chance must not be forfeited. NATO is doing  the right thing in trying to take advantage of the current  favorable situation. If at all possible, Russia has to be  integrated into the West's policy. This is what Partnership for  Peace is seeking, because it is not only open to states that  fear that Russia might return to its policy of hegemony, but  even to Russia itself. Should Moscow participate in Partnership  for Peace in the same way that it does in the NATO Cooperation  Council, it would be a first step toward military cooperation,  and thus to the development of an pan-European security system.    Not only the European countries but also the United States  are interested in such a system. With their Partnership for  Peace, the United States and its allies have shown that they are  ready to take Russia's wishes and interests into account -- to  contribute to Yeltsin's success. For European security the  success of the democratic forces in Russia is more important  than extending NATO eastward. Should, however, the reformers in  Moscow fail, the next NATO summit would have to face some  difficult decisions. Still, even then NATO would not have to  accuse itself of forfeiting the chance to build a European  security system together with Russia.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> $6.5-MILLION BERLIN WALL ROCK MUSIC EXTRAVAGANZA SET  </P> <P> A $6.5-million rock extravaganza featuring top international stars will be held  this summer at the Berlin Wall as a "memorial for all war dead," former Pink  Floyd band leader Roger Waters said.  </P> <P> "It will be a big show," the British-born rock star said Thursday.  </P> <P> Organizers say some of the world's best-known rock performers, a cast of 300  extras, choirs and a symphony orchestra will appear in the performance of "The  Wall," the brainchild of Waters, who first recorded the chart-buster with Pink  Floyd in 1979.  </P> <P> "It will probably be the biggest rock extravaganza ever," said Jody Miller, one  of the organizers. She said the names of the performers would only be announced  once negotiations were completed.  </P> <P> "A 600-foot-long, 60-foot-high wall will be used in the show," Waters said.  </P> <P> "We hope to get the Berlin Philharmonic or a Polish or East German orchestra.  The Red Army Choir has confirmed that they will take part," he said.  </P> <P> He said the head of one of the puppets in the show "will be as big as a London  double-decker bus."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from Berlin, where he is rehearsing for the July 21  benefit show, the 46-year-old rock star said the proceeds of the performance  will go to the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa -- Speaking at an election news conference at  the oblast council on 20 June, Ukraine presidential candidate  Oleksandr Moroz warned about dangers to the planet posed by a  demographic explosion and people's desire to own land.    "I am against turning land into a commodity," said Oleksandr  Moroz. "In about 15-20 years we will be facing the fourth world  war. This war over food will break out halfway between now and  the doubling of the planet's population. The world will be ruled  by those who will own fertile land. Fate has it that this  wealth is now in the hands of the Ukrainian people. If we start  trading land, we will wind up on foreign soil in our own  country. This must never be allowed."    Answering a question by UNIAN, Oleksandr Moroz confirmed  that  he is "the only candidate who supports a parliamentary republic"  and did not distance himself from the statement in a resolution  issued by the plenum of the Ukraine Communist Party Central  Committee that "president Moroz alone is able to rid Ukraine of  the presidency." Also today, Oleksandr Moroz met representatives  of the local labor collectives at Odessa State University, and  servicemen at the district officers house. According to the  program of his visit to Odessa oblast, the presidential  candidate will meet farmers in the rayon center of Kominternove,  after which he will travel on to meet voters in Rovno and Volyn  oblasts.</p>

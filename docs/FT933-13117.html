			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tribune split on investment plan THE ECONOMY needs an immediate Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn injection of publicly funded investment if unemployment is not to continue to grow, two Labour leftwingers will today argue. In a Tribune group pamphlet advocating a new strategy for jobs and growth, Mr Roger Berry, the MP for Kingswood, and Mr Peter Hain, the MP for Neath, will call for tax increases for individuals earning more than Pounds 50,000 per annum. Expressing support for existing Labour policies designed to strengthen the supply side of the economy, the pamphlet will nonetheless argue that these are not in themselves enough. 'There has been little to distinguish Labour's macroeconomic policy from that of the Tories,' the MPs will say. But the document came under immediate attack from Mr Nigel Griffiths, a Labour trade and industry spokesman and a Tribune member. Mr Griffiths said the pamphlet showed 'political naivety and economic illiteracy'. Proposals for cutting public spending, except on health and education, by between 25 per cent and 50 per cent by the end of the century, were published yesterday by the Bow Group, a Conservative think tank. The report suggested streamlining the tax and social security system, including introducing a 'basic income' to replace the benefit system, and reducing the number of civil servants. It also suggested further cuts in defence spending. Labour and the Economy. Tribune group, c/o Peter Hain MP, House of Commons. Price Pounds 3.</p>

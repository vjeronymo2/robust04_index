			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mystery disease hits Ecuadorian shrimps ECUADOR'S SHRIMP exports have been severely reduced this year because a mysterious disease has affected production. About 15,000 hectares of cultivation pools have already been hit by the unexplained death of shrimp larvae. Losses so far are estimated at Dollars 50m. According to Mr Walter Valarezo, president of the Federation of Shrimp Producers, the disease may be due to an imbalance of chemical or organic substances in the pools. He said the quality of exported shrimp had not been affected as the disease only attacks the larval stage. The coastal area of Taura has been hit hardest, with several shrimp farms having to close and about 7,000 tonnes of shrimp lost. As a result, the export volume has dropped by 10 per cent. Fearing the spread of the disease, the government has pledged support for scientific research efforts. For some time, industry analysts have been urging new investment in disease-control and studies to optimise pool sizes. But state funds for research and development have recently been cut and credits for the private sector have been scarce. This latest crisis in Ecuador's shrimp industry, which boasts 120,000 ha of cultivation and generated Dollars 526m in sales last year, comes on top of a series of problems that pushed up costs and made Ecuadorian shrimp less competitive in the world market. Energy costs to operate the water basins' pumps have risen considerably, while shipping costs from Ecuador remained above the regional average. As a result, Ecuador's productivity per hectare is less than half that of its Asian competitors.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt decline concentrated in financials BOURSES were mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, appearing to accept the argument that the Russian crisis will affect equities longer than its predecessor did in August, 1991. FRANKFURT blamed Russian uncertainty for another fall in the DAX index, down 12.96 at 1,648.44; but the falls in German shares yesterday were more heavily concentrated in the financial sector, where corporate financing moves unsettled the market. Volume fell from DM6.8bn to DM6bn. Dresdner's confirmation of rights issue plans took the shares down DM6.30 to DM399.20, and other banks followed. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, observed that there were profits to take in the sector. However, the market fell more on reaction to a DM950m Allianz Eurobond issue with warrants attached to buy the equity. Investors sold the insurer's shares to buy the warrants, Allianz plunged DM68.00 to DM2,174.00 for a two-day fall of 5.8 per cent, and traders came in to short other blue chips, including BMW which fell DM5.80 to DM462. PARIS recovered some of Monday's losses in a generally quiet session, helped by a stronger bond market. The CAC-40 index closed up 12.90 at 1,952.18, off the day's high of 1,959, in turnover of some FFr2.6bn. There was, however, a flurry of interest in Carnaud Metalbox, up FFr8.40 or 3.7 per cent at FFr234.00, as speculation intensified as to who might buy the 25 per cent stake due to be sold by MB-Caradon of the UK. One of the possible candidates, Pechiney International, fell FFr8.80 to FFr220.00. BRUSSELS rose strongly in late trading on reports that the government had reached an agreement on the budget. However, after the close, it was announced that the talks had failed - which may lead to the government's resignation. The Bel-20 index put on 16.34 or 1.3 per cent to 1,256.32, but off an all-time intraday high of 1,258. Turnover was some BFr1.5bn. MADRID reversed early losses in the last 90 minutes of trading, the general index closing 1.59 higher at 234.35 on speculation that today's inflation figures will be much better than expected. AMSTERDAM's correction continued with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 0.3 to 106.1. ING, the insurer, noted that it was taking extra provisions for its UK subsidiary, Victory Reassurance, and dipped 60 cents to Fl 62.20. Reports that a broker was to upgrade DSM was partly responsible for a Fl 2.10 rise in the shares to Fl 81.90. MILAN'S rumour machine turned its attention to Fiat once again with a resurgence of stories that it could be about to announce an international accord. The shares fixed L300 or 5.6 per cent higher at L5,700 in the wake of one early foreign buy order for 500,000 shares, before continuing up to L5,810 after hours. The market took its lead from Fiat and the Comit index added 5.94 to 487.51. Fiat has consistently denied a series of rumours, the most recent of them last Thursday, suggesting an industrial alliance or disposal to Renault. But yesterday's speculation suggested that an accord with a German group might be in the offing. Stocks likely to be privatised posted gains as the market's confidence was renewed following Treasury Minister Piero Barucci's comments on Monday that state asset sale plans were on line. Ciga, reinstated on the bourse on Monday, was delayed from settlement because of a trading imbalance. Shares in the financially-troubled hotel group finally settled L128 or 12 per cent lower at L922. ZURICH consolidated last week's gains and the SMI index edged 4.7 higher to 2,166.3. Nestle, due to release 1992 profit figures today, saw its bearers add SFr5 to SFr1,180 in spite of some pessimism about its earnings prospects. Analysts are, however, waiting to see whether the company has anything to say about plans to introduce divisional reporting, which would clear the way for a full Wall Street quotation. In the machinery sector, Schindler lost SFr20 to SFr4,100 after it forecast flat 1993 profit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices March 23  THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1129.10  1130.29   1129.41  1128.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1203.94  1202.67   1202.63  1198.84                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1128.08  1130.66   1131.45  1131.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1198.88  1201.81   1202.06  1203.95  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 22    Mar 19    Mar 18    Mar 17    Mar 16 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1129.55   1145.37   1148.55   1146.10   1151.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1204.64   1223.70   1222.53   1214.92   1222.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1131.77; 200 - 1204.43 Low/day: 100 - 1128.06  200 - 1197.74.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 20, RIA -- The Central Electoral  Commission of the Russian Federation today recommended St.  Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak before June 10 to correct the  violations of the legislation on elections and make the  necessary amendments in the statute on elections to the St.  Petersburg City Assembly.    This decision follows the fact that when elections were held  to the City Assembly on March 20 and 21 and also after a repeat  voting on April 3, 1994 the St. Petersburg mayor violated with  his orders a number of articles of the basic regulations on  elections to representative bodies of state authority.    Vyacheslav Marychev, a State Duma deputy who was present at  the session, after saying emotionally that "whole military units  were forced to vote", demanded that the commission should not  limit itself to recommendations, but revoke the results of the  repeated voting.    But Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central  Electoral Commission, explained that only the president has this  kind of competence.    In the event of the St. Petersburg mayor failing to meet the  commission's recommendations, it can only draw the president's  attention to Sobchak's actions.    The session was also told that the Supreme Court of the  Russian Federation today left unsatisfied a complaint by the St.  Petersburg City court that the City Assembly elections were  unlawful.</p>

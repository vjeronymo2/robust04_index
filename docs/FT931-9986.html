			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Imasco extends its penetration of US IMASCO'S financial services unit, through a US subsidiary, is buying USDollars 660m in deposits and 18 branches in the Rochester and Buffalo areas from two New York-based savings and loan companies. The acquisitions, from Anchor Savings Bank and Dime Savings Bank, will raise the indirect Imasco subsidiary's network in the north-eastern US to 86 branches and an asset base of well over USDollars 5bn. Market share in the expanding Buffalo, NY, market will rise to 6 per cent. Imasco owns Canada's largest trust company, Canada Trustco, through CT Financial Services, and the US subsidiary is First Federal Savings and Loan, based in Rochester and acquired by CT in 1991. Imasco would not reveal the price paid for both deals but it said First Federal is not acquiring any loan portfolios. The deals are part of Imasco's financial services expansion in the US north-east. Abitibi Price, the big newsprint producer now owned by creditors of Olympia &amp; York Developments, is raising CDollars 150m (USDollars 119m) with an issue of convertible debentures. The proceeds will be used to reduce long-term debt.</p>

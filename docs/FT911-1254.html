			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Leading Article: The Quayle factor THERE is nothing like a president confined to a hospital to quicken the pulse of US politics. Mr George Bush's release from one yesterday with apparently the full confidence of his doctors ought to set to rest all the obvious questions about the succession, but in practice it will not. Suddenly there is renewed interest in next year's presidential election campaign. What had appeared a mundane event, with the incumbent's return a near certainty, has been rendered full of intrigue, for both parties. The reason for this is Dan Quayle, the vice-president, to whom is attached no sense of political invincibility or governmental desirability. The prospect of running against Mr Quayle, as the man who might take over from Mr Bush, is far more enticing than going against Mr Bush alone. Any doubt about the president's health makes the vice-president, if still running mate, an issue in a campaign. Mr Quayle was a cynical political choice in 1988 and, thankless as the vice-president's job often is, he has done little since to convince that he is qualified to serve as chief executive in his own right. Some vice-presidents have so graduated. Gerald Ford, much helped by an able cabinet, did so after the Nixon resignation in 1974, while Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson went on to some great things, including winning elections on their own. But Mr Quayle, on all available evidence, has nothing like their experience or intrinsic qualities. Widespread assumption Mr Bush has not stated unequivocally that he intends to keep Mr Quayle on the ticket in 1992, though it was the widespread assumption in Washington that he would. With Mr Bush healthy, this would not have mattered too much, since other Republican contenders would still have had plenty of time to position themselves for the race to usurp Mr Quayle as heir apparent four years later. Mr Bush, it is to be hoped, will serve out two full terms, as did President Eisenhower in spite of severe heart trouble and President Reagan after being shot early in his presidency. But this latest reminder of mortality for a man who pushes himself very hard means that the question of who stands the proverbial heartbeat away takes on new importance. Presumably men like James Baker, the secretary of state, Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, and perhaps even, if he is indeed a Republican, General Colin Powell, of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be engaging in quiet recalculation. Enfeebled Democrats The Democrats, on the other hand, have less need for discretion. After the disaster of the Dukakis campaign and some underwhelming House and Senate performances last year, they have appeared quite leaderless, even further enfeebled by their opposition to the Gulf war. Normally, at this stage in the political cycle, candidates have already begun to proclaim themselves but so far only the quixotic - George McGovern and Paul Tsongas from the party's left, old and new - have actively explored running. Not for the first time, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York has started behaving like one, though with plenty of room for withdrawal. The conventional wisdom was that the only reason to run next year against Mr Bush would be to put down a marker for four years later. But this itself is a high-risk and expensive proposition, not lightly to be undertaken. The landslide defeats suffered by Mr McGovern in 1972 and Mr Walter Mondale in 1984 were not long-term investments in the future. But Mr Quayle is a different proposition from Mr Bush, as is undoubtedly under discussion this week in Cleveland where the Democratic Leadership Conference, representing the party's middle-of-the-roaders, is holding one of its regular get-togethers. Mr Quayle may wrap himself in the flag and the Gulf, but his power base is essentially on the Republican right, which has been in progressive eclipse with the passing of the Reagan era. Mr Bush, after the war and perhaps before it, was a difficult target. Mr Quayle, relatively, is a sitting duck.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Mass Resignation Triggers Suspicions"] </F>   [Text] The administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  resigned en masse on 25 June. As a result, the second coalition  administration under Prime Minister Hata came to an end in just  less than two months since its inauguration on 28 April.    The direct cause of the abrupt ending was the fact that the  Hata administration was forced to run a minority government due  to an uproar over the formation of the parliamentary group  "Kaishin." However, the high-handed political style of Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his followers and the lack of  political leadership shown by the prime minister and cabinet  ministers who repeatedly made controversial remarks, only to  find themselves having to make apologies and retract their  remarks, can also be counted among factors that led to the  folding of the administration.    From early next week, ruling and opposition parties are  likely to be engaged in a power struggle, perhaps with parties  breaking up and further political realignment taking place. The  ruling coalition parties plan to resume governmental and policy  consultations with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  in hopes that the latter would return to the coalition. Should  such consultations end in failure, however, the ruling coalition  parties are also said to be considering reaching out to elements  of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ.    Meanwhile, the LDP is considering plans to form a coalition  alliance with the SDPJ and other parties in a bid to regain  power by taking advantage of the situation.    The SDPJ has insisted that a voluntary mass resignation by  the Hata administration would be a precondition to its returning  to the coalition. Considering that this condition has been  satisfied, the SDPJ, which holds a decisive vote over the  outcome of the current political turmoil, has indicated that it  is prepared to return to the coalition, with the possibility of  Hata's reelection in mind.    There is nothing significant about the current situation. It  simply means that a power struggle will continue to rage with  the ruling coalition parties, the LDP, and the SDPJ engaged in a  "tripartite" deadlock.    The mass resignation of the Hata administration has left  many  unanswered questions.    In a news conference, the prime minister said: "Should the  Diet be dissolved, it would create a month-long political  vacuum. Under current circumstances, this must be avoided." He  thus justified his decision on a "voluntary mass resignation" to  avert a Diet dissolution and a subsequent general election.  However, it is suspected that his true intentions were to  prevent being forced to either resign en masse or dissolve the  Diet due to the probable passage of a no-confidence motion,  while leaving the possibility that he may be nominated as prime  minister again.    There was a similar situation in the past. In this case, the  administration of then Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama once  resigned en masse in November 1955, saying that the nation's  political foundation had changed as a result of the formation of  the LDP through an alliance of liberal forces. After being  reelected as prime minister, Hatoyama went on to serve his third  term as prime minister.    In the case of the Hata administration, the line of argument  that Hata and his colleagues apparently take is that their  intentions pose no problems at all from the standpoint of the  Constitution, the Cabinet Law, and other relevant matters.    At the time of the formation of the third Hatoyama  administration, the SDPJ, which was an opposition party at the  time, complained that "this is a plot to establish a permanent  hold on power by conservative forces by prearranging the handing  over of the reigns of government among themselves."    Although historical circumstances have changed, the mass  resignation of the Hata administration gives a strong impression  that this is merely a coalition tactic to muster a majority for  maintaining a hold on power and to prearrange the handing over  of the reigns of the government among themselves.    We have asserted that the current power struggle in which  politicians simply try to gain a majority is intolerable and  that in order to create a government with capable leaders, the  lower house of the Diet should be dissolved in the not too  distant a future to seek the judgment of the people.    With the mass resignation of the Hata administration, a Diet  dissolution and a subsequent general election has been  postponed. However, upon notification by the "House of  Representatives Election Redistricting Council" regarding  demarcation of new single seat constituencies for holding  general elections under a new electoral system, the next  administration must immediately convene an extraordinary Diet  session to promptly enact the redistricting bill. It must then  seek the will of the people after a designated period has passed  for public acknowledgement of the enactment of the bill.    There is not much time to spend on forming a new  administration. There are impending tasks -- including tax  system reform, which primarily involves a consumption tax hike  -- as well as the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Japan-U.S.  summit talks, and the Naples summit.    We cannot allow politicians to continue with their political  struggles, which are based merely on grudges among themselves or  on their likes and dislikes, and which totally ignore the will  of the people; nor can we allow "job-executing cabinets" to  continue on and on.</p>

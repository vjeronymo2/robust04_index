However the latest political moves of Azerbaijani leaders  testify, in his words, that official Baku still relies on force  methods of solving the problem, which is equally bad for the  Armenian and Azerbaijani people.    This, continued the Head of Karabakh Parliament, can be  proved by such facts, as torpedoing of Russian and CSCE peaceful  initiatives, intensive buying-in of arms, using of foreign  mercenaries and military instructors. Such a policy of Baku,  stressed Baburyan, does not in the least serve the cause of  peace in the region. Moreover, it can, in his opinion, lead to  serious destabilization of the situation in Azerbaijan itself.</p>

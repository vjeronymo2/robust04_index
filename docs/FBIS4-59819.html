			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 12 May (JANA) -- A source at the General  People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International  Cooperation commented on the U.S. Administration's claims,  reported by the [foreign] media, accusing several countries of  supporting terrorism. He said: Inclusion of the Great  Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of  accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of  the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people  in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to  serve certain interests which are known to everyone.    Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters  which have been used by the Western powers to serve their  interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points:    1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see  international peace and security established on solid bases  which will help relations between peoples of the world to be  based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in  internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving  disputes, has been calling on the international community to  overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as  the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the  reasons for it, and combatting it.    2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism,  particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it  for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims  as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith  during the U.S.-Atlantist aggression against the innocent  inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as  against the brother leader of the revolution and his family.  This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN  General Assembly in successive resolutions.    3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S.  Administration's  claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented  by international and regional organizations, in which they  condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international  organizations and bodies highly praised this stand.    4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American  claims,  asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to  expose the falsehood of such claims.</p>

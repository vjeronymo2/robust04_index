			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Smash-up delay on 'information super-highway': The implications of two abandoned US telecommunications deals With two juggernauts lying smashed at its side, the road to America's 'information super-highway' is looking increasingly bumpy. On Tuesday, Southwestern Bell, the large Texas-based local telecommunications group, announced that it was abandoning a plan to invest Dollars 1.6bn for a 40 per cent stake in the cable television operations of Cox Enterprises, a private media group. Just six weeks ago Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based phone group, and Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable company, said they were calling off a Dollars 22bn merger which Mr Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman, had once hailed as 'a model for communications companies in the next century'. The idea was that large telecoms and cable companies - which are potential rivals in developing the information superhighway, a network offering interactive multi-media entertainment and services - would do better to form partnerships to pool their respective expertise. Cable companies are good at providing entertainment services, while telephone companies have much greater expertise at routing two-way communications traffic. The collapse of the deals suggest that the introduction of multi-media services will proceed more slowly than its most visionary proponents have been suggesting and will not involve many full-blown mergers between telephone companies and cable networks. That said, America's leading phone and cable companies remain committed to pouring billions of dollars into the development of an information superhighway. Both Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell have blamed the unravelling of their deals on the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the communications sector, and on 1992 legislation which ordered tighter regulation of cable TV prices after public criticism of escalating rates charged by these essentially monopolistic companies. In February, the FCC, under its new chairman, Mr Reed Hundt (a Clinton administration appointee) ordered cable companies to cut by 7 per cent the charges to consumers for a basic package of television channels. Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell say the resulting reduction in cable companies' cashflow undermines the financial assumptions on which their deals were based. Rate re-regulation has certainly increased financial uncertainty in the cable industry, and diminished the immediate financial attractions of the sector to the local telephone companies, which are themselves heavily regulated and want to get into less controlled businesses. However, analysts suspect that there is more to the collapse of the two deals than can be laid at the FCC's door. Certainly, in the case of Bell Atlantic/TCI, sharp differences in culture between the staid telephone company and the free-wheeling cable operator appear to have played a role, as well as Wall Street anxiety over the cost of the deal to Bell Atlantic. If the information superhighway offers telephone companies as glittering a financial future as industry leaders claim, should not they be willing to ride out a short-term dip in cable cashflow? The problem is that no one knows just how profitable, or when, multi-media services will prove for the companies that provide them. It is far from certain that consumers will actually want the services, ranging from movies on demand to inter-active home shopping and computer games. These factors suggest that while telephone companies will continue to press ahead with capital investment in multi-media networks of their own, they will proceed more gingerly with involvement in the cable industry, making either small acquisitions in areas where they do not offer a phone service, or joint ventures. One such route has been pioneered by Southwestern Bell, which in January became the first regional phone company to buy a cable system outright, paying Dollars 650m for two systems in the suburbs of Washington DC, It where the number of homes taking a cable service is high. Another route was pioneered last year by US West, the Denver-based phone company, which spent Dollars 2.5bn on a 23 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable TV and entertainment business. Time Warner is planning to roll out a much-vaunted multi-media field trial to 4,000 homes in Florida, but the launch date has been postponed from this month to the autumn because of technical difficulties - a delay which raises additional questions about the speed at which the information highway will be built.</p>

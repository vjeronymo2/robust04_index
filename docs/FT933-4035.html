			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Government a la Gore THE DIFFERENCE between Vice-President Al Gore's proposals for streamlining the US federal government and the many similar plans advanced in previous decades is largely one of motivation. The Clinton administration believes in government: the purpose of this performance review was thus at least as much to improve the public sector's effectiveness as it was to curb expenditure by 'cutting it down to size'. As President Bill Clinton put it this week: 'Government is broken and we intend to fix it.' The phrase 'reinventing government' is, however, misleading. Mr Gore's study asked how government performs, not what it should do. There was no discussion of larger questions, such as the appropriate role of government in the 21st century or the proper distribution of responsibilities between federal and lower levels. The reforms proposed, moreover, are mostly tame. Mr Gore sets four main priorities: cutting red tape, putting the customer first, empowering employees by decentralising authority, and eliminating obsolete services. He emphasises the importance of consumer choice and market forces. Agencies, for example, will be encouraged to contract out services to the private sector. He urges government to copy the latest management fads of US companies. He says government must concentrate on achieving results rather than setting rules and learn to 'steer, not row'. These fine sentiments hardly amount to a redefinition of government. There is little here that has not been tried in Britain and other countries. Given the US's reputation for entrepreneurship, Mr Gore's charge of 'paralysing inefficiency' in the public sector may come as a surprise. But there are good reasons why US government tends to be rule-bound and inflexible. Elaborate procedures The calibre of its civil service is probably lower than in many European countries, reflecting reliance on short-term political appointees, and the greater relative attractions of private sector jobs. Rules for agencies are highly complex - partly because of a long-running battle between the executive and the legislature and partly because elaborate procedures have been invented to prevent discrimination against minorities and reduce the scope for corruption. The inability of officials to improvise or use discretion partly reflects a justified fear of lawsuits. None of these underlying causes of rigidity are properly addressed in Gore's report. Obvious targets It does, however, identify a number of obvious targets for reform. A century after industry replaced farming as the principal economic activity, the federal agriculture department still operates more than 12,000 field offices, an average of nearly four per county, whether rural, urban or suburban. Yet having emphasised the absurdity of this, the report proposes closing only 10 per cent of them. The administration claims that the 800 proposed reforms will save Dollars 108bn over five years and reduce the civilian federal workforce by about 252,000 (roughly 12 per cent). But few of the savings are spelt out in detail. It is simply asserted, for instance, that more efficient procurement will save Dollars 22bn over five years. The only merger or elimination of departments envisaged - a partial transfer of powers from the Drug Enforcement Agency to the FBI - is opposed by powerful members of the cabinet. The ambitious staff cuts are to be achieved largely through natural wastage and incentives for early retirement. Previous attempts to reorganise federal government have gone nowhere. This time there is a greater chance of progress. Mr Clinton is interested in the topic of government reform in a way that Mr George Bush, for example, was not. Polls suggest he badly needs to convince sceptical voters that the public sector is competent to carry out his activist agenda. 'Reinventing government' seems a perfect vehicle for establishing his credentials as a centrist 'new Democrat' and neutralising the political appeal of Mr Ross Perot. There is thus no doubt that Mr Clinton will make many rousing speeches about the need to streamline the federal bureaucracy; but whether he will have the time or energy to see that Congress acts on many of the Gore proposals is far less certain.</p>

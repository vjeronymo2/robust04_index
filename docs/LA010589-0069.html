			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSEMEAD HOSPITALS' LATINO UNITS SPEAK THEIR PATIENTS' LANGUAGE  </P> <P> Fernando sat at the table and gazed sourly at the irregularly shaped pieces of  colored paper in front of him. Go ahead, the therapist urged him, fit them  together. Joined correctly, the pieces form a big T, she said.  </P> <P> "This is what we call in Spanish a rompe cabeza," said Fernando, a patient at  Ingleside Hospital in Rosemead, still keeping his distance from the puzzle.  Translated literally, the Spanish expression for "puzzle" is "head-breaker."  </P> <P> "That's right," said recreational therapist Arcelia Vasquez-Davis. "Pero no  quiero que rompen la cabeza. But I don't want you to break your heads."  </P> <P> The small group of patients laughed. Recreational therapy with a little Spanish  frivolity? For Fernando (not his real name), who said his mind wasn't clear  enough to match triangles and rectangles that evening, maybe it offered no  great breakthrough, said Vasquez-Davis afterward. But the moment had provided a  small opening for the others to reach a troubled patient.  </P> <P> Fernando began gamely working with a partner on the puzzle.  </P> <P> That, of course, is the point of Ingleside Hospital's new Hispanic Tract  program: Give Spanish-speaking or bilingual patients, who often suffer from the  special alienation of living in a foreign culture, a sense of attachment to  their surroundings.  </P> <P> Bilingual therapists, camaraderie between fellow Latinos, jokes in Spanish,  cultural empathy -- these are rare commodities in private or nonprofit  psychiatric hospitals, says psychiatrist Dr. J. Eduardo Guzman, head of the  Ingleside program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Let Us Take Care of You'  </P> <P> They're also immeasurably important, he said. "In general medicine, the patient  comes to you with an inflamed appendix and says, 'Please, doctor, take care of  me,' " says Guzman. "But in psychotherapy, we are asking the patient, 'Please  let us take care of you.' "  </P> <P> Three months ago, Ingleside and another Rosemead hospital, CPC Alhambra (part  of the national Community Psychiatric Centers chain), began offering those  kinds of enticements to treatment for Spanish-speaking patients. They are the  first such programs in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> At Ingleside, a 146-bed acute-care psychiatric facility, the Hispanic program  means semiweekly sessions with Spanish-speaking occupational and recreational  therapists, group therapy using both Spanish and English, and one-on-one  counseling and testing by bilingual psychotherapists.  </P> <P> It also means having bilingual nurses on duty around the clock, said Guzman,  who heads Hispanic Health Professionals, a Montebello-based group of Latino  mental health professionals who have contracted with Ingleside to staff the  Hispanic program. "It makes a big difference if, say, your aunt or your  grandmother is having a heart attack in the middle of the night and she can  tell someone, 'Hey, it hurts me,' " said the psychiatrist.  </P> <P> CPC Alhambra, whose administrators say more than half the population within a  10-mile radius of their building on Rosemead Boulevard is Latino, provides its  Spanish-speaking patients with bilingual therapy and a lounge where they can  watch Spanish-language television shows. The 98-bed private hospital also  offers Spanish-language reading materials, such as pamphlets from Alcoholics  Anonymous.  </P> <P> "Having bilingual staff provides an immediate bonding tool," said Jeff Thrash,  program director of CPC Alhambra.  </P> <P> Until the two hospitals started their programs in September, psychiatrists who  wanted to hospitalize Spanish-speaking patients had two choices, said Thomas  Carrillo, a psychologist at Ingleside. They could send their Latino patients to  county or state psychiatric hospitals, which are jam-packed with the urban  poor, or to inadequately prepared private hospitals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing Middle Class  </P> <P> "The assumption is that if you're Spanish-speaking, you're poor, and you go to  state or county facilities," said Carrillo. "But that's a misconception.  There's a growing Latino middle class. If something happened to my mother, I'd  want her in a private facility."  </P> <P> Both Ingleside and CPC Alhambra hope to attract Latino patients who are covered  by third-party insurance programs, such as those provided by labor unions or  large employers.  </P> <P> Most private facilities, even well-meaning ones, don't have enough Latino  professionals to go around, said Carrillo. "They're worth their weight in  gold."  </P> <P> The result is often "therapy via an interpreter -- which is ludicrous," said  Guzman.  </P> <P> Mental health professionals say Latino patients have all the usual  stress-related problems of modern life, compounded by special cross-cultural  stresses.  </P> <P> "We see a great deal of depression," said Carrillo. "Mexican-born women, say,  who were raised in a traditional way. They're thrown into a new environment  here. Their children come home and they don't even speak Spanish anymore. . . .  Men who had been dominant figures in their families. Now they're no longer the  sole bread-winners, and they may even have a small child who speaks English  serving as a go-between for them."  </P> <P> Add to those disruptions an inherent reluctance to seek help for emotional  problems, said Guzman, and the result could be serious mental illness. "By and  large, Hispanic people are very private people," he said. "They don't like to  share a lot of intimacies. It's hard enough eliciting confidences from them  without going through an interpeter."  </P> <P> Vasquez-Davis attacks the problems with a combination of the familiar and the  instructive. "It's real important that (the patients) be successful," she said,  explaining the need for cultural sensitivity. "One day we had a cooking  activity and we made guacamole. I knew they'd all be familiar with that."  </P> <P> The recreational therapist tries to connect the activities she supervises  directly to the patients' lives. How did Mrs. G., the middle-aged woman sitting  across from Fernando, feel about working with a partner?  </P> <P> "It was OK," said the patient self-deprecatingly. "I'm used to taking  instructions." But a few minutes later, she was confessing that she was too  passive in frustrating situations. "I'm calm," she said. "Too calm sometimes.  That's not good."  </P> <P> Fernando said working out the puzzle had been satisfying -- after he had sought  help. "You gave me a hand," he said to Vasquez-Davis.  </P> <P> "So maybe you just need to ask someone to give you a hand," said the therapist.  </P></p>

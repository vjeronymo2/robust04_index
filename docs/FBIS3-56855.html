Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who handles agriculture;  Anatoliy Chubays at the State Committee for the Management of  State Property; and Yuriy Yarov, who is engaged on matters  relating to the social protection of the population, will also  retain their posts. This information was given in a Vesti  telephone interview with Valentin Sergeyev, head of the  government's press service. He declined to comment on the fate  of Boris Fedorov.    However, an INTERFAX correspondent has learned that Boris  Fedorov is to remain as finance minister, while the former  deputy prime minister Aleksandr Shokhin will be in charge of the  economics ministry. This afternoon Boris Fedorov stated he is  ready to remain in the government as long as the reform policy  is not radically altered. In the event of the reforms  continuing, he can guarantee a reduction of inflation to five  per cent per month by the end of the year.    It seems too that the fate has been decided of another  former  deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. He has been offered the  post of minister of ethnic affairs and regional policy.    So far there has been no official information about the fate  of the power ministers. Most likely Pavel Grachev, Viktor  Yerin, and Andrey Kozyrev will remain in their posts.    The head of the government's press service also stated that  the new appointments at the top levels of executive authority  had been agreed on yesterday at the meeting between Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin. A presidential decree had also  been signed yesterday and it is due to be published tomorrow.    The new make-up of the cabinet of ministers shows that Boris  Yeltsin has still decided to retain the greater part of Gaydar's  government, and it can be expected that the economic reform  program begun two years ago will be continued.    According to the Russian prime minister, the government has  throughout the past few days continued to work normally. Those  ministries that have not been subject to a reorganization are  engaged on routine work.    Preparations are under way within the government apparatus  for an enlarged meeting of the government, which is to be held  at the start of February. Despite what certain politicians have  been saying about the need for the resignation of the prime  minister and his government, Viktor Chernomyrdin stated he does  not intend to resign and will continue his work in this post  with the government that has been formed.    There is a possibility, however, that there could be some  further consultations. Yeltsin has not yet signed the decree on  the new composition of the government, an EKHO MOSKVY  correspondent was told an hour ago by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the  president's press secretary.</p>

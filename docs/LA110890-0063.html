			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RANCHO BUENA VISTA'S PARKER SAYS HE'LL ATTEND UCSB  </P> <P> Darryl Parker, one of only two juniors selected to The Times All-County boys'  basketball team last season and considered one of the county's top recruits,  has made a verbal commitment to UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Parker, a 6-foot-6 senior at Rancho Buena Vista, said he will sign with the  Gauchos during the early signing period for college recruits, Nov. 14-21.  </P> <P> Parker, the son of former NBA player Sonny Parker, averaged 24 points and 14  rebounds in 1989-90, leading the Longhorns to a 16-10 record and the  quarterfinals of the San Diego Section Division I playoffs.  </P> <P> He chose UCSB, which finished 21-9 last year after a second-round loss in the  NCAA Tournament, over Cal State Long Beach and Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> "As far as a kid being able to do it all, he's the best I've ever had," said  Rancho Buena Vista Coach John O'Neill, who is in his 18th year coaching. "I  think he's going to have an outstanding college career. (UCSB coaches) speak of  him up there as a player who is going to be a starter for three years."  </P></p>

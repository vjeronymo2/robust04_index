			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / NatWest fined Pounds 10,000 over BES advertisement NATIONAL Westminster Bank has been fined Pounds 10,000 and ordered to pay Pounds 3,208 costs by Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, in connection with misleading advertising for a business expansion scheme it was promoting. NatWest was fined by Imro's disciplinary committee on June 29 for an advertisement which appeared in several national newspapers on March 6 1993, the public register of disciplinary actions by the self-regulating organisations shows. The breach for which the fine was levied is unusual because most BES scheme promoters consult regulators before issuing advertise-ments. The advertisement, urging the purchase of shares in the Homeshare (UK) companies offered under the BES, violated Imro rules which prohibit the use of specific illustrations or projections of potential returns. The advertisement, which carried the headline 'How NatWest turns Pounds 6,000 into Pounds 10,800 in five years' promised '11.48 per cent tax-free for five years'. It told readers that after six months, the implied savings for higher-rate taxpayers, together with other elements of the investment, could lead to an annualised return of nearly 30 per cent. Separately, Imro has fined Waverly Investment Management Pounds 10,000 and ordered it to pay an additional Pounds 15,000. Waverly bought shares in companies for which it was engaged in corporate finance activities with the proceeds of a unit trust it managed. The corporate finance activities involved the placing of shares which ultimately were sold to the Australasian Gold Fund Unit Trust managed by Waverly. Moreover, Waverly failed to inform the trustee of its dual role, but was in any event not authorised to conduct corporate finance business. It also failed to meet minimum capital requirements on seven separate occasions.</p>

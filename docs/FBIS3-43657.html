That, says  State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National  Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, is the success recipe other  political leaders should use to make free and fair elections  possible in South Africa. Agreements or proposals during  today's crucial meeting were not, however, released to the  media. Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela confirmed that a  comprehensive anti-violence plan containing ANC proposals and  government initiatives would be drawn up.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Gary Alfonso] After four hours  of  critical talks at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Mr. de Klerk  and Mr. Mandela emerged to say, against media expectation, that  the government and the ANC had formulated a joint plan to curb  violence. Although both leaders agreed not to release sensitive  details to the media, they again condemned recent senseless  attacks such as the Katlehong shooting. They, however,  confirmed that future efforts to end the carnage in troubled  areas would have to be facilitated through strong  community-based projects.    [De Klerk] A very strong action, coupled also with solution-  orientated and community-orientated actions will be necessary  and we will be focusing, in the days to come, very strongly --  now having had also the important input from the ANC's side.  Secondly, we discussed the constitutional situation and the  need for further interaction with the Freedom Alliance. We are  thinking inclusively. We want the significant parties within the  Freedom Alliance to become part of the process.    [Mandela] The progress that we have made today is a very  encouraging one. That crisis will emerge if Mr. de Klerk  remains deaf to the proposals that I am making, but from what  has happened today it does appear that we are making very good  progress.    [Alfonso] Referring to the breakdown in talks with  right-wing  negotiators, Mr. Mandela remained firm on the impossibility of a  volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners, but said he hoped the  right- wing would prefer dialogue to civil war.    [Mandela] I urged Ferdie Hartzenberg yesterday that he must  heed -- and his colleagues -- must refrain from inciting that  section of the Afrikaners who want a separate homeland -- that  they must avoid the situation where that section is going to be  isolated and become the target for the anger of the majority of  the people of South Africa, black and white.    [Alfonso] Mr. de Klerk confirmed that the government had  proof that extreme right-wing elements had been involved in  various incidents of township violence.    [De Klerk] From time to time right-wing people are directly  involved in specific incidents and evidence has been uncovered  and, therefore, we must assume that there are elements in their  ranks who are involved in violent actions    [Alfonso] Both leaders have agreed to meet again next week  to  discuss and finalize the joint strategy against violence and  other constitutional issues.

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Children's shares I have three children, aged 16, 12 and 10. Last year I gave them some money which they asked me to invest on their behalf in one company's shares. The shares are registered in my name with a designation showing that I am holding them for my three children equally. The shares produce less than Pounds 300 per year in income. The dividends are made payable to me, with the children's designation shown on the cheque. I pay this into my bank account and transfer to each of my children one third of the net amount. 1) Am I right in supposing that each child can claim the tax credit for his/her third of the total gross annual income? 2) If so, would this hold true if the company declared an increase in its dividend to the point where the gross amount was above Pounds 300 per year, or would all the income then be treated as mine? 3) If my children were to ask me to sell the shares and a profit was made would they, or I, be liable for CGT? 4) If, after selling the shares for a profit, my children were to ask me to reinvest the proceeds in a higher yielding share which produced an income exceeding Pounds 300, would the entire income be deemed to have come from me, or only that proportion of it which correspond to my original gift? First, we should point out that you and your wife cannot escape your legal duties and responsibilities for proper investment of your children's money be merely doing what they each ask you to do. You may wish to consult a solicitor on your legal obligations. 1) Yes, in principle (subject to evidence of the terms of the gift last year), provided that by 'Less than Pounds 300' you mean 'Less than Pounds 300 inclusive of tax credit'. 2) All the income would then be treated as yours, under section 663 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. 3) The chargeable gains would be assessable upon each child, in principle. 4) All the income would be treated as yours, as under question 2. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

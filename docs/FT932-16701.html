			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: US networks win right to slice of Dollars 5bn TV syndication market THE BIG US television networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - were yesterday celebrating a crucial breakthrough in their efforts to take from Hollywood studios a slice of the Dollars 5bn-a-year market for the syndication of prime-time television shows. The Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the industry, overturned on Thursday a 23-year-old rule which prevented the networks from owning re-run rights to the prime-time shows they carry, or producing more than 40 per cent of prime-time shows themselves. The ruling is not final, as it has still to be reviewed by a federal court in Los Angeles, and is likely to be the subject of further legal challenges. However, it opens up an important new source of revenues for the networks and is a blow to Hollywood studios, which had lobbied furiously to keep the restrictions in place. Analysts said the most important long-term implication of the FCC move could be to pave the way for mergers between the networks and leading film production companies. However, the FCC ruling does not allow the networks to syndicate programmes directly themselves. This must be done by an outside party, with the networks taking their share of the profits. It also keeps them out of the important market of first-run syndication, which covers programmes developed for use by local stations outside prime-time schedules. The old FCC regulations, known as the financial interest and syndication rules, were adopted in 1970 following an anti-trust case against the three networks, which then controlled more than 90 per cent of the US prime-time audience. However, the networks argued that their hold over the market had been undermined by the rise of the cable television industry and the rules were being used by Hollywood to restrict competition.</p>

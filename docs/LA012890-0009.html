			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: IMPERFECT 'MERMAID'  </P> <P> Calendar reader and animation buff William Simpson is a dedicated fan of "The  Little Mermaid" -- he's seen Disney's animated hit nine times, by his count --  but he's also discovered it's less than perfect. Calling it "my all-time  favorite Disney film for sure," he nonetheless cites "a few of the more obvious  continuity errors" he's noted during his multiple viewings:  </P> <P> * Ursula's lipstick mysteriously vanishes the moment before she applies it.  </P> <P> * Max the dog licks Ariel's right cheek but, as Ariel reacts, she rubs her left  cheek.  </P> <P> * The thimble that Sebastian the crab catches on his foot disappears, then  reappears only to disappear again.  </P> <P> * Sebastian himself disappears in a shot with King Triton near the end of the  film.  </P> <P> * Lemon slices magically vanish from Grimsby's dinner plate.  </P> <P> * Countless positioning errors made in transition from long-shot to close-up.  </P> <P> "In live-action films, minor inconsistencies may be forgiven," says Simpson,  for 10 years the voice of Whimsical Will, who delivers the Demented News on  KLSX-FM's "Dr. Demento" show. "But in animation, with its storyboarding and  frame-by-frame plotting, continuity errors are inexcusable. I enjoy 'The Little  Mermaid' too much to think it was the victim of sloppy production."  </P> <P> A Disney rep says that the studio is happy Simpson's seen the movie nine times  and hopes he sees it nine more -- but had no further comment.

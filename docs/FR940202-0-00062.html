			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples illustrate the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Qualified stated interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1999, and has a stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument provides for interest payments of $8,000 on January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, and January 1, 1997, and quarterly interest payments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,942.65, beginning on April 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Amount of qualified stated interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments of $8,000 and the quarterly payments of $1,942.65 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable at a single fixed rate because 8 percent, compounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually, is equivalent to 7.77 percent, compounded quarterly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, all stated interest payments under the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument are qualified stated interest payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Qualified stated interest with short initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment interval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On October 1, 1994, A purchases at original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that matures on January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1998, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturity. The debt instrument provides for an interest payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of $2,000 on January 1, 1995, and interest payments of $8,000 on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, January 1, 1997, and January 1, 1998. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, all stated interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments on the debt instrument are computed at a single fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and are qualified stated interest payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Stated interest in excess of qualified stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1995, B purchases at original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue, for $100,000, C corporation's 5-year debt instrument. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $100,000,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable at maturity, and calls for annual interest payments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $10,000 for the first 3 years and annual interest payments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $10,600 for the last 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Payments in excess of qualified stated interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the first three interest payments and $10,000 of each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last two interest payments are qualified stated interest payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remaining $600 of each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the last two interest payments is included in the stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redemption price at maturity, so that the stated redemption price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at maturity is $101,200. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, the weighted average maturity of the debt instrument is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.994 years [(4 years&times;$600/$101,200)+(5 years&times;$100,600/$101,200)]. The de minimis amount, or one-fourth of 1 percent of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the weighted average maturity, is $1,263.50. Because the actual amount of discount, $1,200, is less than the de minimis amount,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument is treated as having no OID, and, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the interest payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Qualified stated interest on a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is subject to a contingency <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1995,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A issues, for $100,000, a 10-year debt instrument that provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a $100,000 principal payment at maturity and for annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payments of $10,000. Under the terms of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument, however, the interest payments for each of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five years will be reduced to $5,000 if a specified annual level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of earnings is not attained by A by the end of year five.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Amount of qualified stated interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule determined by assuming that the specified earnings level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be attained is treated as the debt instrument's sole payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule, the instrument would provide for annual qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated interest payments of $10,000. If the payment schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by assuming that the specified earnings level will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be attained is treated as the instrument's sole payment schedule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, only $5,000 of each annual interest payment would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute qualified stated interest. Accordingly, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only $5,000 of each annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payment constitutes qualified stated interest. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess of each annual interest payment over $5,000 is included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. De minimis OID; interest holiday <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1995, C purchases at original issue, for $97,561, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2007, and has a stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument provides for an initial interest holiday of 1 quarter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quarterly interest payments of $2,500 thereafter (beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on July 1, 1995). The issue price of the debt instrument is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $97,561. C chooses to accrue OID based on quarterly accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> De minimis amount of OID.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> But for the interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holiday, all stated interest on the debt instrument would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, for purposes of determining whether the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price at maturity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument is $100,061 ($97,561 (issue price) plus $2,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($2,500) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount over its issue price ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is treated as having OID of $2,500 ($100,061 minus $97,561).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $3,001.83 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,061 multiplied by 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete years to maturity), the debt instrument is treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having no OID, and all stated interest is treated as qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. De minimis OID; teaser rate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of this paragraph (f) except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that C uses an initial semiannual accrual period rather than an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial quarterly accrual period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> De minimis amount of OID.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The debt instrument provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an initial teaser rate because the interest rate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual accrual period is less than the interest rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the subsequent quarterly accrual periods. But for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial teaser rate, all stated interest on the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument would be qualified stated interest. Under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at maturity of the instrument is $100,123.50 ($97,561 (issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price) plus $2,562.50 (the greater of the amount of foregone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest ($2,562.50) and the amount equal to the excess of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument is treated as having OID of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $2,562.50 ($100,123.50 minus $97,561). Because this amount is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the de minimis amount of $3,003.71 (0.0025 multiplied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $100,123.50 multiplied by 12 complete years to maturity), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument is treated as having no OID, and all stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest is treated as qualified stated interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

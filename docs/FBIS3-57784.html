AS of 1 January, the civilian air traffic  control office will be fully responsible for controlling the  airspace over east Germany. Its modernization will involve  millions of marks.    Since the 16th Air Force unit was transferred recently to  somewhere near Moscow, only two fighter aircraft units and one  fighter bomber unit, which are deployed at the airports of  Damgarten near Rostock, of Wittstock, and Templin, will remain  on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic [GDR].  These units will probably also be transferred to Russia by June  next year. The flight formations include Russian military  helicopters that are operating at the bases of Mahwinkel south  of Stendhal and of Oranienburg.    Before the collapse of the communist regime, the Soviet  Armed  Force and the National People's Army (NVA) used 35 military  airports. Approximately 6,500 military flights took place every  day over the territory of the former GDR. One year ago, the  Russian air fleet was reduced to 400 combat aircraft and 450  helicopters that still operated from 14 airports and carried out  1,000 flights daily. Currently, there are 250 flights per week  by the approximately 120 jets, and about 100 flights by the 90  helicopters.    Of the 35 military airports, the Bundeswehr wants to use a  maximum of five. The MiG-29, taken over from the NVA, will be  stationed in Laage near Rostock, and a unit of Phantom fighters  will be transferred from Hersfeld to Laage. A total of 45  planes will be deployed in Laage for the control of the air  space. There are plans -- but no decision has been made -- to  station a transport unit in Holzdorf south of Jueterborg that is  to be removed from Wuensdorf near Hanover. The Bundeswehr has  helicopter airports in Cottbus and Basepohl near Neubrandenburg,  and the Navy has concentrated its helicopters in Parow near  Stralsund.    As a result of the withdrawal of the Russian Air Force, the  Airspace Coordination Office of the Bundeswehr has been  considerably reduced. When the military air traffic control in  Germany is integrated into the German Civilian Air Control GmbH  on 1 January, the military air controllers of the Bundeswehr  will be given leave and will work for the German Civilian Air  Control GmbH. At present, the military air controllers who  control the airspace in the new laender are sitting next to the  civilian ones at Tempelhof Airport. The Airspace Coordination  Office of the Bundeswehr will then be dissolved.    A new air control system for Berlin and the new laender is  currently being built; it will be based at Tempelhof Airport.  This involves 150 million German marks. At the beginning of the  winter timetable in autumn 1994, the new system is to start  operating. The German Civilian Air Control GmbH will then be  able to offer new routings, new approaching methods, new  overflight possibilities, shorter routes, fewer delays, more  capacities, and shorter flying times in its sphere. The new  system will be responsible for the entire air traffic in the new  laender and for the landings and departures at the airports of  Leipzig, Dresden, and Erfurt.    In the offices above the large check-in hall at Tempelhof  Airport, which comprise about 900 square meters and which have  so far been used by the U.S. Air Force for observing the  European air and radio traffic, work stations for 74 air  controllers will be created. At the same time, the control  towers in Tegel, Tempelhof, and Schoenefeld will be equipped  with new instruments, and additional radar and navigation  instruments will be installed to ensure a three-fold radar  control. New flight routes make it possible to intensify the  east-west and the north-south traffic over Berlin.    With the opening of the new control center, the transition  period will end that started with the restoration of Germany's  full sovereignty on 3 October 1990. [passage omitted]</p>

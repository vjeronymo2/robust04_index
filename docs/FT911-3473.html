			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Delta in talks with Pan Am DELTA, the third largest US airline, said yesterday that it was in discussions with Pan Am, the smaller carrier which earlier this year filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, about 'potential asset acquisitions in the airline business', writes Nikki Tait. But, in contrast to recent speculation, Delta fell short of saying that it was interested in a full merger of the two companies. It also emphasised that no definitive agreement had yet been reached, and said that there was no assurance that a deal would be struck. However, it seems unlikely that Pan Am - which has been disposing of assets for many years - would be willing to sell off its remaining business piecemeal. 'We're not interested in selling parts of the company,' commented the New York-based carrier yesterday, although it has previously said that its East Coast Shuttle was up for sale. There was further evidence of the turbulence which hit the airline sector earlier this year when USAir Group, one of the middle-ranking US carriers, revealed a Dollars 168.7m after-tax loss in the first three months. This compared with a Dollars 38m loss in the same period of 1990. Revenues stood at Dollars 1.58bn (Dollars 1.54bn), while the passenger load factor fell to 54.1 per cent (57.2 per cent).</p>

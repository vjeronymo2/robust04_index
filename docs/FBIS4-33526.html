			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Carlos Santana] </F>   [Text] Belem, 7 Jun (AE) -- The OAS General Assembly  approved here today a resolution that rules out military  intervention in Haiti and states that the restoration of  democracy in the Caribbean country, through the reinstatement of  the government led by Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was  elected in 1990 and ousted in September 1991, should be achieved  by reinforcing the trade, commercial, and financial embargo  approved earlier by the United Nations and the OAS.    The committee charged with drafting the resolution worked  until 0300 today to iron out wording problems, to avoid  ambiguity, and to make it reflect the thinking of the majority  of the OAS member countries. This effort was aimed at ensuring  that the draft resolution would be readily approved by the  plenum.    In a speech before a special session on Haiti yesterday,  ousted Haitian President Aristide stated that he was not calling  for a military occupation of Haiti because to do so would entail  violating the Constitution. "In any case," he said, "I truly  believe some action can be taken to free our nation from the  thieves who are holding it hostage and to restore democracy. I  will not waste time describing what type of action should be  taken. The international community knows how to proceed."    Aristide's words sounded at the plenary session like an  endorsement of a prompt military intervention that would be  immediately followed by his return to Port-au-Prince along with  the UN technical assistance mission.    The OAS has decided to pay heed only to Aristide's request  that the trade embargo and the isolation of Haiti be  strengthened, even if this means prolonging the hardships the  Haitians are enduring. The embargo is being violated by some  countries that the diplomats have chosen not to identify, with  the exception of former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo,  who charged Colombia and Venezuela with violating it. The  embargo is reportedly hurting only the lower income groups of  the Haitian population, especially those residing near the  border with the Dominican Republic.    On the first day of the assembly, at least two delegates  endorsed President Aristide's proposal to remove the military  regime. One of them was Dante Caputo, UN special envoy to  Haiti. Speaking at the plenary session, he said he doubted the  effectiveness of the economic sanctions because there are  countries that are not observing them. Defending the forceful  removal of the Haitian military, Caputo said: "The time has come  to say no to the Haitian dictatorship."    Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, stated that  the United States fully endorses the proposal to strengthen the  embargo, and that it would not mind unilaterally suspending  commercial flights to and from Haiti should this measure be  unacceptable to the other OAS member countries. He also  expressed doubts about when the economic sanctions would yield  results, and noted that Washington would not oppose military  intervention if the coupists resisted.    Yet voices contrary to this intention, including that of  Brazil, have apparently prevailed. Most foreign ministers ruled  out this possibility and expressed confidence that the embargo  will yield results as long as it is observed by the entire Latin  American and international community.    The OAS resolution approved today begins by citing earlier  resolutions and by noting that the Inter-American Human Rights  Commission "has confirmed that the overall human rights  situation in Haiti reflects an extremely serious deterioration  of and disregard for essential human rights, as a result of a  systematic plan of intimidation and terror used against a  helpless people."    The resolution notes that "the coup disrupted constitutional  order, which affected the exercise of democracy. It is  essential to restore this." It then outlines the approved  decisions, including appeals, condemnations, and  recommendations. The OAS congratulates the International  Civilian Mission for its dedicated effort to guarantee a minimum  of freedom in Haiti. It asks for a greater number of personnel  so the group can cover the entire Haitian territory. It  proposes starting, without delay, an educational program in the  area of human rights to help the Haitian people, and reiterates  the need to reinforce the embargo with measures "such as the  suspension of commercial flights, the freezing of the assets of  the de facto regime and its supporters, and the suspension of  international financial transactions with Haiti."    The resolution also requests that neighboring countries  "examine the possibility of providing the Civilian Mission with  the radio broadcasting facilities needed to carry out  educational programs on human rights." Finally, it urges the  OAS member states and the international community to help deal  with the problems of Haitians who are leaving their country at  great personal risk, by granting them the status of refugees and  offering them temporary protection</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: German powerhouse for Europe Europe, up 2.4 per cent in local currency terms and excluding an unsettled UK market, took most of the credit for last week's 0.9 per cent gain in the FT-Actuaries World index. Nordic markets maintained their recent contribution with a rise of 1.9 per cent, but Germany was the powerhouse with a climb of 5.4 per cent, virtually all of which came last Wednesday and Thursday. Dealers were more bullish than analysts on Frankfurt ahead of the event. Mr Patrick Bettscheider, equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said last Friday week that the bank was seeing strong US demand for scrip, and that foreign demand for German equities had been a feature of its business over the previous six weeks. German daily turnover was moderate at that time, in the DM6bn area, but last week it hit a sequence of DM5.2bn, DM8.3bn and DM15.5bn. In Dusseldorf, Merck Finck said there had been a change in Anglo-Saxon investment attitudes, a feeling that the bottom had been reached in the German economic cycle, a willingness to look through what will be some dreadful results for 1993 into recovery prospects for 1994 and 1995. In London, however, Nikko Securities, a bear of the market, expresses the doubts which many share over the valuation base of the market. 'We believe that the forthcoming reporting season will reveal that Geman industry is still suffering from the recession and that the turnround is not close at hand,' says Nikko in its current German weekly. 'In addition, the underlying structuring problems of reduced international competitiveness and resilient inflation have yet to be addressed by the market,' adds the Japanese broking house. 'The market is a fundamental sell, but in the near term, inward capital flows and traders' reluctance to be short could mean a brief period of activity around the (DAX) 1,800 level.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 % change                                                      % change     in US                     % change in local currency*      sterling*  Dollars*                1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of  Start of  Start of                                              1993      1993      1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         +3.18     +5.87    +0.50    +12.69     +7.85     +5.53 Belgium         +1.15     +8.01   +14.34    +17.78    +12.73    +10.31 Denmark         -0.88     +4.45    +0.54    +20.43    +16.17    +13.68 Finland         +6.91    +14.75   +76.84    +56.41    +45.31    +42.21 France          +1.89     +3.55    +7.75     +9.15     +5.34     +3.08 Germany         +5.38     +6.22    +1.45    +16.24    +11.80     +9.40 Ireland         -1.52     +2.12   +26.64    +33.21    +18.02    +15.48 Italy           +1.68     +5.30   +41.33    +32.63    +26.48    +23.77 Netherlands     +1.86     +4.57   +15.43    +17.15    +12.53    +10.12 Norway          +3.20     +9.63   +14.63    +20.62    +16.53    +14.03 Spain           -0.59     -0.42   +11.33    +20.62     +6.98     +4.68 Sweden          +2.00     +3.31   +27.41    +13.64     +2.89     +0.68 Switzerland     +1.59     +3.98   +28.71    +17.41    +14.89    +12.42 UK              -0.42     -0.56   +16.18     +1.66     +1.66     -0.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE          +1.25     +2.47   +14.66    +10.29     +7.35     +5.05 Australia       +0.59     +2.73    +3.78    +11.31    +13.21    +10.77 Hong Kong       -2.20     -3.57   +14.05    +28.69    +31.28    +28.46 Japan           +1.62     -2.47   +26.68    +21.85    +41.79    +38.75 Malaysia        -0.50     -4.34   +39.71    +24.82    +29.62    +26.84 New Zealand     +2.09     +6.18    +9.79    +14.85    +25.71    +23.01 Singapore       -1.12     -2.88   +13.41    +15.52    +19.08    +16.52 Canada          -1.92     -0.05    +6.24    +10.42    +12.27     +9.86 USA             +0.53     +0.45    +8.81     +3.02     +5.28     +3.02 Mexico          +1.00     +5.39   +10.10     -7.58     -5.67     -7.70 South Africa    -0.76     +5.21   +19.59    +32.02    +41.94    +38.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX     +0.92     -0.05   +14.93    +10.79    +16.09    +13.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on July 9th 1993.

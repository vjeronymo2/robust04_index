			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Zurich Insurance forecasts good year ZURICH Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, says it expects another good overall result this year, with premium growth similar to last year's 9.9 per cent rise to SFr21.5bn (Dollars 14.60bn). Mr Rolf Huppi, chief executive, said results in the first half looked good. He was 'very happy' with Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), the troubled UK insurer of local authorities, whose ongoing business Zurich acquired in March. He said there had been no unpleasant surprises at MMI, and that he was 'very impressed' with the MMI staff. The challenge was now to integrate the administration of MMI with that of other Zurich businesses in the UK. Although the group was interested in making other acquisitions in Europe, Mr Huppi said there was no hurry. Zurich was already strong in most European countries, with the exception of Germany. He was confident that prices of potential acquisitions in that country would drop in the next two years. Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said the group expected a good investment result this year after last year's 10.8 per cent rise to SFr4.10bn. Yields would not rise, but income would grow in line with the increase in investments. Last year, bonds and loans accounted for 60.4 per cent of the group's SFr65.3bn portfolio; equities 14.8 per; real estate 12.3 per cent; mortgages 7.5 per cent; and short-term investments 3.4 per cent. The group's policy this year was to expand investment in equities, particularly in countries where these do not yet represent 15 per cent of the portfolio. 'For fixed interest rate investments, we will tend to select shorter maturities in US dollars and related currencies, although we still prefer longer terms in Europe,' Mr Hanggi said.</p>

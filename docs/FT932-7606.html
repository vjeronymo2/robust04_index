			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Albion advances 50% to Pounds 507,940 Pre-tax profits of Albion, the Northern Ireland-based maker of tailored mens wear, showed a 50 per cent improvement, from Pounds 338,378 to Pounds 507,940, in the half year ended March. Turnover was up by Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 9.14m. Earnings per share came out at 9.6p (5.6p) and the interim dividend is being raised to 1.6p (1.2p). The company said its order book was satisfactory, bearing in mind that trade on the high street remained highly competitive. Further profit improvement is dependent on growth, the directors said. And with this in mind the acquisition of Maitland Menswear was finalised on April 30 this year.</p>

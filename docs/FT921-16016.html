			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica's bauxite output rises by 5.5% JAMAICAN PRODUCTION of bauxite (aluminium ore) increased last year by 5.5 per cent to 11.5m tonnes, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. Production of alumina (aluminium oxide) was 3.01m tonnes, 5 per cent more than 1990. Exports of crude bauxite ore in 1991 reached 4.3m tonnes, 10.25 per cent more than 1990. That represented a slowdown in the growth of the Jamaican industry, the world's third largest after Australia's and Guinea's. In 1990 Jamaica's bauxite ore production increased by 19.8 per cent, while alumina output grew by 30 per cent. Mr Dennis Morrison, the institute's director of economics, said the fall in international aluminium prices had affected Jamaica's earnings from bauxite and alumina, and that the industry's net earnings in 1991 of Dollars 240 were Dollars 30m less than in 1990.</p>

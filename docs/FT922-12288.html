			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Not a fair picture of EC aid Sir, Mr James Ingram, outgoing director of the World Food Programme interviewed by Mr Robert Graham ('Food aid: demand grows, resources fall', April 14), states that 'The European Community has been a little disappointing' in its food aid policy. These statements, uttered by someone who is supposedly knowledgeable on food aid worldwide, are absolutely shocking. The EC and its member states together are by far the largest donor to the WFP, accounting for 35 per cent of all the resources contributed, the second largest contributor being the US (21 per cent). Mr Ingram cites the case of the Horn of Africa and Sudan in particular. He does not mention the fact that, in Sudan, total aid from the EC and its member states amounted to Ecu 100m (Dollars 130m) in 1991, while the US contributed Ecu 14m and Japan Ecu 3m. Just because the EC does not exclusively use the WFP to channel its aid, it does not mean that it is doing nothing. For 1992, the European Commission, facing an ongoing threat of famine in the Horn and southern Africa, has proposed, as in 1991, a new emergency programme. The total food aid contribution from the 1992 EC budget alone (ie excluding national contributions from the Twelve) will be close to Dollars 1bn. It is difficult to understand how Mr Ingram can be so 'disappointed' with the EC. Arguably, all international donors could contribute more to the WFP. But to express dissatisfaction only vis-a-vis the very largest of all donors while considering the US 'the most responsive' does not seem very reasonable or fair. The Community, its member states and, above all, its citizens and taxpayers do not deserve such a misrepresentation of their solidarity with the developing world.

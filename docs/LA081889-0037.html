			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> David Lynch, the film maker of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" fame, is back  with more pictures from the netherworld roiling just under the skin of everyday  life -- but on canvas and paper rather than celluloid. Phrases spelled with  individual letters cut out of paper (like anonymous death notes) cluster on the  black grounds of the paintings, thinly populated by gangly striding stick  figures, the blocky outlines of buildings or windows, thin skitterings of light  and smoke-ring clouds.  </P> <P> In "Can Billy Come Out and Play?" the words belong to a bawling dirty-white  face near the bottom of the painting. An obsessive collage of Band-Aid strips  clings to one edge of the canvas and a window-like area is sullied with  rainy-day streams of built-up wax. Other paintings recall nocturnal urban  journeys ("On a Windy Night A Figure Walked to Jumbo's Klown Room") or great  open spaces ("Boise, Idaho").  </P> <P> Lynch's pastel drawings, in soft grays and luminous white, are somewhat  reminiscent of Arthur Dove's organic abstractions. In "Introducing One Brand  New Cloud," a patch of glowing whiteness -- like a draped hank of silk -- hangs  on a soft gray field. Suffused by a gentle unearthliness, the simple image  yields an unexpected sweetness.  </P> <P> Although Lynch's art flirts with cuteness, its authenticity and freshness win  the viewer over. The surprising thing is how mild and plaintive the large but  wispy paintings are, compared with the films. (James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th  St., to Sept. 9.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

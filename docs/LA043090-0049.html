			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIANS REPORTED READY TO VOTE ON PLAN TO END BLOCKADE  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Parliament will vote this week on a compromise offer to try to  end Moscow's economic blockade and open the way to negotiations on  independence, an adviser to the republic's leadership said Sunday evening.  </P> <P> Antanas J. Buracas, a political economist and adviser to President Vytautas  Landsbergis, said by telephone from the capital, Vilnius, that a compromise  plan is being drafted for consideration by Parliament within the next few days.  </P> <P> The announcement came as Soviet officials said that they will resume supplying  natural gas to a major Lithuanian fertilizer plant, the first break in Moscow's  two-week-old energy embargo. The decision was the latest of several signs of  progress toward an end to the political stalemate that began March 11 with  Lithuania's declaration of independence.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 10,000 people packed Cathedral Square in Vilnius late Sunday to hear  Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which Landsbergis has turned into the independence  movement's unofficial anthem.  </P> <P> At the end of the performance, broadcast in towns and villages across the  republic, the emotional crowd broke into shouts of "Lithuania! Lithuania!"  witnesses said.  </P> <P> In the neighboring republic of Latvia, the nationalist Popular Front suffered a  setback Sunday in key runoff elections, winning only four of the 17 remaining  seats in the Latvian Parliament and falling short of the two-thirds majority  needed for an aggressive secession campaign.  </P> <P> The election, four days before Parliament is expected vote on independence for  the Baltic republic, could determine whether Latvia follows Lithuania in a bid  to break free from half a century of Soviet rule.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Latvia and the third Baltic  republic of Estonia that if they move rapidly to secede, they will face the  same tough economic measures he has imposed in Lithuania.  </P></p>

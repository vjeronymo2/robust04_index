			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Talabani and Barzani Will Meet </F> in Turkey"]    [Text] Ankara--Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud  Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani  will meet in Turkey to end the clashes between their supporters  in northern Iraq. It has been ascertained that Talabani is  already on his way.    It has also been ascertained that Turkey has been trying to  convince the two sides to end the clashes in northern Iraq and  that these efforts have begun to yield positive results. It has  been reported that Talabani and Barzani have conferred by  telephone several times during the past three days and agreed to  a cease-fire. There is a very strong possibility the two leaders  will meet in Silopi in a few days.    Sarcil Kazaz, Jalal Talabani's representative in Ankara, is  currently in Damascus. He has replied to the questions HURRIYET  put to him by telephone. Kazaz said: "We have been in constant  touch with the Turkish officials during the past few days.  Turkey is a friendly and neighboring country and we take its  views very seriously."    Kazaz also asserted that Talabani left for the region after  reaching an agreement with Mas'ud Barzani by telephone.  Stressing that he will travel to northern Iraq through Turkey,  Kazaz said: "A meeting could be held in Turkey. However, that  has not yet been finalized."    The Turkish officials have confirmed Kazaz's disclosure.  <H5>  Ankara Warned the Two Leaders </H5>   It has been reported that Turkey has decided to take certain  steps because the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has gained  significant strength as a result of the clashes between the  supporters of Talabani and Barzani. Ankara has warned the two  leaders--who have been trying to find allies against each  other--not to cooperate with the PKK. The Turkish officials are  reported to have warned Talabani and Barzani that Turkey will  support the opposite side and provide it with arms and  logistical support if any of them decides to cooperate with the  PKK. It has also been reported that Talabani reacted positively  to Ankara's warning. That has dispelled the relatively chilly  atmosphere that existed in his relations with Ankara for a  rather long time.    Meanwhile, Ankara continues to be worried about the  emigration of Turkey's Kurdish citizens in southeastern Anatolia  to northern Iraq. In fact, it is expected to make a disclosure  on the condition of the Kurdish citizens who have been forced to  emigrate by the PKK. It has been reported that it may call on  them to return and guarantee that the Government will consider  their complaints.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULK-LOADER DEAL WITH KAISER OKD BY PORT PANEL  </P> <P> A controversial plan for the Port of Los Angeles to pay one of its major  tenants up to $6 million for coal exporting equipment -- at a 10% profit for  the tenant -- was approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles Board of Harbor  Commissioners.  </P> <P> The board voted 3 to 2 to approve the deal between the port and Kaiser  International Corp., which is buying a coal bulk loader from the Port of  Portland, Ore., for the express purpose of selling it to the Los Angeles Harbor  Department.  </P> <P> Critics contended that it would have been cheaper for the port to purchase the  equipment directly from the Portland facility and bypass Kaiser.  </P> <P> They complained that Kaiser, which already runs the port's coal-exporting  operation, will earn a "middleman profit" from the contract -- which was not  put out to competitive bid. They also said that Kaiser could achieve an unfair  advantage over its competitors if the port should expand its bulk-loading  operations.  </P> <P> The harshest critic of the arrangement is Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke  Flores.  </P> <P> "I think it's highly irregular," Flores said. "It certainly gives all the  appearance of being a deal put together to benefit Kaiser. . . . If the port  wants (the bulk loader), they should buy it directly."  </P> <P> Both port officials and Kaiser President Richard Holdaway have denied Flores'  charges.  </P> <P> The commission's approval came one month after the plan failed to pass because  of a tie vote.  </P> <P> Commissioner Robert Rados, who was absent from last month's meeting, cast the  swing vote Wednesday, saying he thinks the port needs the equipment.  </P> <P> The commissioners who voted against the contract -- Jun Mori and Ronald Lushing  -- said they did so only because the port is buying the equipment for a project  that has not yet received commission approval.  </P></p>

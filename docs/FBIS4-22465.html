			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ioann, metropolitan of St. Petersburg and </F> Ladoga, by Valentin Chikin, chief editor of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA;  place and date not given: "Let Us Put a Stop to the Discord"]    [Text] V. Chikin: Your Grace, I often have to  address the most diverse audiences--in terms of age, in terms of  social composition, in terms of political views. In addition, I  regularly familiarize myself with the extensive readers'  mailbag. All this enables me to conclude that the role of the  Russian Orthodox Church in our life is becoming increasingly  material. This is connected to a large extent, I believe, with  your efforts for the spiritual, Orthodox-patriotic enlightenment  of society, the revival of Russian national self-awareness, and  the preaching of mercy and love, righteousness and piety.    In our society today, which is rent by discord, there are  many forces that would not be averse to portraying the church as  their political ally. It is sufficient to point to the efforts  being exerted for this by the present ruling regime. You, Your  Eminence, despite your clear civic, patriotic position, have  until recently rejected all suggestions that you link your name  with any political force whatever. You were always above this.  But quite recently you responded to our request and blessed the  initiative of certain politicians, journalists, and cultural  figures who announced the creation of the broad public movement  Accord in the Name of Russia. It is the first time that a man of  the church of so high a rank has "intervened in politics," on  the side of the "center-left opposition," what is more. What  prompted you to make this decision? Are you not afraid of  charges of political intriguing?    Metropolitan IOANN: I fear no charges. It is  important that I keep my conscience clear before the impartial  Day of Judgment, but the common talk of man does not frighten  me--it is transient, frivolous, and rash. As far, however, as my  "intervention in politics" is concerned, things need to be made  clear here in order to avoid possible misunderstandings. I am,  as before, free of any party predilections whatever. This goes  against the grain for many people. The news media have  repeatedly pronounced me at times a communist, at times a  nationalist, at times (as soon as they could bring themselves to  say it!) a fascist even and pogrom instigator, virtually. There  is nothing surprising in this for the stern words of  ecclesiastical understanding and paternal arch-pastoral  denunciation are pleasing to far from everyone in the present  lacerated Russia. Black-hearted people are endeavoring to evade  the expository light of Christ's truth and ecclesiastical grace.  Evil, generally, cannot stand the truth and always attempts to  debase and calumniate it. But we must not give way to despair.  The Lord said in Holy Scripture: "Blessed are ye when men shall  revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against  you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for  great is your reward in heaven..." (Matthew, 5, 11)    I consider it essential to emphasize that I do not  distinguish between "right" and "left," "liberals" and the  "supporters of strict authority." I endeavor merely, to the best  of my abilities, to distinguish well-intentioned people sick at  heart for the profaned motherland from the ill-intentioned  destroyers who have reduced my unhappy country and my  kind-hearted, trustful people to the shame in which they now  find themselves. While being outside of politics, the church  cannot, for all that, be outside of society, outside of life,  pretending not to notice the orgy that has been put on in Rus by  Christ-haters, corrupters, and Satanists of various stripes. So  I did not bless the "opposition" as such for I am not a  politician. But, on the other hand, I joyfully blessed the pious  intentions of people who appealed to me for support and  assistance. After they had said to me: "Your Eminence, Russia is  dying. Bless us, we wish to make every possible effort to halt  this monstrous process and revive our common fatherland in the  strength and glory of its past grandeur"--some kind of Russian  Orthodox archbishop I would have been had I refused this  blessing.    For the first time leaders of an influential political  grouping appealed directly for benediction and spiritual support  to the church hierarchy. And this invests all of us with a great  deal of responsibility. Although I am not so naive as not to  understand the entire complexity of the current apportionment of  forces, ascribing to myself some special role. In addition, the  events of "Black October," when the church was cynically used as  a screen by political intriguers conducting under the cover of  the negotiations at the Danilov Monastery preparations for a  large-scale provocation, taught all of us a thing or two. So it  needs to be said clearly that the archbishop's blessing is given  for selfless, sacrificial labor in the name of salvation of the  dying fatherland, the unification of all healthy forces of  society, an end to the discord, and for spiritual devotion, not  political games, backstage machinations, and the struggle for  office.    The main thing today is to find the ground for unification,  not allow oneself to be pulled into another bloody "showdown,"  and to ensure the evolutionary, predictable development of  events in the country. I believe this to be the sole possible  path, which should be taken jointly by everyone: the government  and parliament and the opposition and the "power party." No one  should ever be accused indiscriminately, en masse. I am  convinced that the vast majority of politicians, wherever they  are--in the structures of the executive, legislature, or  judiciary--could reach agreement if they could isolate  themselves from the baneful influence of extremism.    V. CHIKIN: This is true, nonetheless, we cannot  close our eyes to the fact that the politicians, like society as  a whole, are today considerably disunited. Each has his own view  of the causes of the present drama, his own prescription of a  way out of the crisis, his own circle of followers. On the one  hand this creates favorable soil for compromise for the most  sober-minded and farsighted are beginning to understand that  under the current conditions no one can cope with the general  problem alone and that the alternative to broad patriotic  unification can only be chaos, an intensification of the  discord, and an endless succession of "Praetorian" palace coups.  But, on the other, there is always the temptation to emphasize  one's own exclusiveness and significance. What, in your view,  should the unificatory platform be?    Metropolitan IOANN: We should be united first and  foremost by the danger of general perdition, seeing the growth  of the trends of disintegration of Russia's millennial sovereign  statehood. We should unite on the basis of our centuries-old  holy places, moral and civic values, and fidelity to the best  traditions of Russian history and culture.    Unfortunately, certain present extremist reformers, who have  inherited the worst traits of the terrorist--"Bolshevik"--self-  awareness, have already cost Russia incredible sacrifices and  are moving in the direction of the creation in our country,  which is rapidly becoming destitute, of a power monstrous in its  cynicism-- corrupt and uncontrolled and concealing behind  pseudo-democratic rhetoric utter scorn for the laws and a  single-minded aspiration to dictatorship. Their unchecked,  heedless, and irresponsible experimenting has brought our  motherland to the brink of state, economic, political, and  spiritual catastrophe.    But an end must be put to the omnipotence of the petty  politicians who have ruthlessly crippled Russia beneath the  demagogic "Reforms at any price" slogan. The death of the  country must not be the appalling price of the arrogant  aspirations of a handful of power- lovers. It can be averted  solely, however, on the path of a responsible and thorough  search for ways of national reconciliation and the mobilization  of all healthy social forces prepared in the name of the  fatherland to rise above their opportunist mercenary interests.    The basis of this unification should be a comprehensive and  integral patriotic ideology designed to revive in society the  flouted sense of national dignity and cleanse the mass  consciousness of the legacy of group and class enmity, state and  religious nihilism, and aspirituality and amorality. The  undoubted priorities in this sacred cause of the reconstitution  of Greater Russia as a healthy, conciliary organism, responsible  component of the international community, and most important  guarantor of geopolitical balance in the world are the  restoration of the historical continuity of its development;  reunification of the artificially disarticulated Russian people  and the reconstitution of the conciliary trinity of Great  Russians, White Russians, and Little Russians; and the  strengthening of all moral-religious foundations, which from age  to age inspired our valorous forefathers to endeavors for the  good of the beloved fatherland.    In addition, it is vitally necessary today to ascertain and  support a responsible and authoritative political leader who can  rally the nation, having harmoniously and constructively united  the efforts of all who sincerely take to heart the country's  fate. Only such a leader may be a real guarantor of national  accord, rein in the growing chaos in the economy and the turmoil  in politics, emphatically and commandingly introducing to the  life of society a strict legal framework and having excluded  violence from the arsenal of political struggle, standing "above  the fray" in the role of peacemaker and impartial judge, not  provocateur and instigator.    It should be understood, of course, that we are all faced  with an unprecedented historical choice threatening Russia with  the chaos of collapse and a slide into the abyss of historical  nonexistence. We need to recognize the far-reaching complexity  of the tasks of revival confronting a society rent by discord.  Grant us, Lord, the patience, courage, and faith necessary on  this onerous path....    V. CHIKIN: The opposition has been attempting for  several years now to formulate a patriotic ideological platform  which would be a foundation for the joint actions of all healthy  forces and has invariably failed. All this ends in its basic  ideas ultimately being intercepted and used with ill intent by  our political opponents. Could you, Your Eminence, indicate if  only the general features of the ideology of a Russian revival  capable, in your view, of imparting to all of us the necessary  creative, unifying impetus which Russia is lacking today?    Metropolitan IOANN: Politics is today,  unfortunately, chiefly a sphere of the operation of human  passions, a sphere of the clash of ambitions and desires, a  field of the domination of the love of power, vanity, and pride.  Politicians are failing to formulate a common "ideology of  revival" because they approach this matter in exclusively  opportunist fashion, regarding such ideology as a mechanism of  the control of society, not as the result of profound,  conceptualized, and substantiated convictions arrived at through  much suffering. Everyone wants to have an ideology "for himself"  and is prepared for any artificial manipulations, provided that  he stand out from the common herd. I speak of this not in  condemnation but in sorrow for it is the present discord which  is the result of this approach. It remains only to wait and hope  that with God's help common sense ultimately prevails, for all  that, over personal ambitions. The Accord in the Name of Russia  affords such a hope.    As far, however, as the availability of an ideological  platform suitable for Russia's revival is concerned, it does, of  course, exist. And, what is particularly important, there is no  need for it to be specially devised or artificially designed. It  is necessary only to avail ourselves of the giant spiritual  experience which the Russian people have accumulated in the time  of their sovereign existence. After all, it is perfectly obvious  today even that the reviving Russian national self-awareness is  gravitating in all parameters toward the fullest possible  restoration of the historical continuity interrupted in the 20th  century by a whole series of devastating military clashes and  powerful social cataclysms.    Despite, however, the catastrophic nature of Russian  history,  Russia has thus far ultimately emerged from all upheavals and  discord even stronger than it was before they started. The  unique spiritual qualities of the Russian national-religious  self-awareness has contributed primarily to this course of  events.    For many centuries it has been based on three fundamental  philosophical archetypes. The first--the archetype of  sovereignty-- has traditionally appeared in the mass  consciousness as the ideology of Russian imperialism  presupposing conviction as to the universal peacemaking role of  Russian statehood. As distinct from its West European brethren,  Russian imperialism was never of an aggressive nature,  militarist even less. Its underlying slogan: "Moscow is the  third Rome," postulated an understanding of the empire, the  state, as the optimum state form for the spiritual-- religious  and cultural--development of society in accordance with the  moral imperatives of the Christian religion.    The sovereign might of the state was not regarded as an end  in itself here but merely as the means of the protection and  defense of the traditional values and objects of worship of  national life.    The second archetype of Russian self-awareness--the  archetype  of conciliarism--takes the form of an ideology of Russian  nationalism. And once again, in contrast to aggressive  European nationalism, this ideology was in Rus always of a  conservative- protective, peacemaking nature and paternally  protective in relation to the small peoples living in Russia.  Its foundation was the unreservedly just assertion that it is  the Russian people (taken in their triune conciliary fullness  together with Little Russians and White Russians as a spiritual,  not only ethnic, community) who are the most important custodian  of the sovereign consciousness, pillar of Russian statehood, and  its dependable guard.    The third, most important, profound, and ancient, archetype  of Russian self-awareness is firmly connected with Orthodox  ecclesiasticism and is formalized philosophically in the  ideology of Russian religious messianism. Its  development was the natural result of the ineradicable impact  made by the Orthodox Church on the entire system of Russian  being--eternal, family, social, and state. The basis of this  philosophy is the belief that the highest, providential duty of  the Russian people-- the "Chosen People"--is the obligation to  preserve the dogmatic and moral ideals of Christianity and to  carry them undefiled through all obstacles, misfortunes, and  disasters. This ideology, just like the first two, is of a  clearly expressed introverted, that is, nonaggressive, peaceful  nature.    It was these three philosophical archetypes that were  reduced  to one in the Russian slogan "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, People,"  which remained the social slogan of Russia right up to the 1917  revolution. It is they--in updated, modern form--that should be  made the basis of the new, reviving Russia, which will combine  within it all that is best that was cultivated by Russian life  both in ancient times and in the recent past....    V. CHIKIN: But today many of the concepts among  those about which you have been speaking are being earnestly  discredited by the news media. Could they consolidate a mass  consciousness still subject to the powerful influence of  television rot?!    Metropolitan IOANN: First, I do not insist on some  definite terms: What is important is the essence, not the name.  Second, a real ideology of Russian revival should be geared to  the long term. We need to know how to wait because, after all,  it will take time for our national self-awareness to return to  its natural forms. Even the branch of a tree weighed down by a  heavy load does not straighten immediately. One thing can be  said for sure: The process of Russian revival is today under way  tumultuously, its direction has been determined, and any  political force that dares to ignore this is doomed to vanish  from the Russian front stage in the coming years even.    V. CHIKIN: But such a natural process could be  interrupted at any moment. Does not the dreadful example of the  October carnage in Moscow confirm this?    Metropolitan IOANN: It confirms precisely the  opposite for, despite the Black October and the forced  brain-washing before the December elections, their results  confirmed the powerful national-patriotic shift that has  occurred in public opinion as of late. I believe, incidentally,  that the Accord in the Name of Russia initiative is to a  considerable extent the result of a general burning need for a  unification of efforts in order to prevent extremists and  provocateurs availing themselves of the fruit of these  processes. It is not, after all, a question of which office one  occupies but of the first outlines of the truly constructive  interaction of very dissimilar people beginning to emerge. I, in  any event, will make every effort to ensure that this be the  case for I see this as an opportunity to contribute the best I  can to the conciliation of suffering Russia and the achievement  of the national accord and civil peace so desired by us all.</p>

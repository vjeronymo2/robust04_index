			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Yarrow shipyard workers end strike A FOUR-WEEK strike at the Yarrow warship yard in Glasgow ended yesterday when the 1,300 hourly-paid workers voted by a four-to-one majority to return to work. The workers accepted a two-year pay-and-conditions offer which they had turned down a week ago and which represented only a marginal improvement on the offer which was available when they went on strike on February 5. Yarrow, a subsidiary of GEC, had offered a 3.78 per cent pay increase over 12 months in return for changes in working conditions - including the abolition of the Friday tea break - as well as an immediate one-off payment of Pounds 300.</p>

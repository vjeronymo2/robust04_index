			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / IRA greets peace pressure with bomb The IRA yesterday responded to British pressure to endorse the UK-Irish peace declaration by mounting a low-level bomb attack on a police station in West Belfast. The attack, the third since the IRA ended its Christmas ceasefire with a mortar attack on Monday, occurred around midnight when a small bomb was thrown at a Royal Ulster Constabulary station on Springfield Road, west Belfast. There were no injuries. The bomb followed a warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that the IRA would face a renewed security clampdown if it rejected the declaration. Unionist leaders yesterday accused the IRA of seeking to use low-level violence to wring more concessions from the British government. 'This type of violence has been deliberately planned to show that they (the IRA) are capable of very controlled terrorism - each unit seems to be doing one incident in turn,' said Mr Sammy Wilson, a senior official of the hardline Democratic Unionist party. British officials in Belfast denied that they were prepared to make further concessions, and insisted that the initiative now lay with the IRA. The IRA, and its political wing Sinn Fein, are understood to be holding intensive consultations with their members across the province about the response to the peace declaration. But with neither side prepared to make public concessions, and the IRA reported to be increasingly split over the proposals, Sinn Fein yesterday said it would be 'weeks, rather than days' before it issued a formal response. Insisting that Mr Hurd's statement was 'counterproductive', Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein official, said it had not yet decided about the declaration. 'We have not said 'no', but we have not said 'yes' either,' he said. 'We will not give into this type of pressure from the British government,' he said. Local political sources yesterday said British officials were expected to hold further meetings with republican sources over the next week for further 'explanations' about the peace declaration. A central issue is expected to be IRA demands for political amnesty for its prisoners. But in spite of fears that violence could undermine the peace process, leaders from the Ulster Unionist Party and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party yesterday maintained a cautiously optimistic tone. It said: 'Given the knee-jerk nature of so much of Northern Irish politics, it is probably encouraging that Sinn Fein is taking as long as they are.' Meanwhile, Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, dismissed as 'absolute bunkum' reports of a grassroots rebellion in the party over its leadership's endorsement of the peace declaration.</p>

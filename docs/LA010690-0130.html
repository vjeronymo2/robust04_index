			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 ARRESTED IN SHOOTING OF 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL  </P> <P> Local law enforcement investigators, with the aid of the Orange County district  attorney's gang detail, have arrested an Oceanside man in connection with a  Christmas Eve drive-by shooting that left a 4-year-old girl hospitalized.  </P> <P> Floyd Avery, 18, described by acquaintances as an unemployed high school  dropout, was arrested at his mother's home at 2 p.m. Thursday, police officials  said. He has no prior criminal record.  </P> <P> Avery's arrest was made public on Friday after police arrested a San Juan  Capistrano juvenile and named another who was already being held in Orange  County Juvenile Hall on an unrelated charge, San Clemente Police Chief Albert  C. Ehlow said.  </P> <P> In addition, police said they have recovered a shotgun believed to have been  used in the shooting.  </P> <P> Avery, who moved to Oceanside from San Clemente almost two years ago, was  charged with attempted murder and shooting at an occupied dwelling, Ehlow said.  He was being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.  </P> <P> The two juveniles, whose names were withheld, face similar charges, according  to Ehlow.  </P> <P> "We put a lot of work into this," Ehlow said, adding that the investigation is  continuing. "We're still trying to sort things out."  </P> <P> Despite the involvement of the district attorney's gang unit, police and  investigators for the Orange County Sheriff's Department maintained on Friday  that they are not sure if the shooting was gang-related.  </P> <P> "We're getting a lot of conflicting stories," Ehlow said. "Until we get it  straightened out, we won't know if it's gang-related. It could be a personal  thing."  </P> <P> The shooting victim, Prisca Lorena Caudillo, was hit in the face and upper body  by shotgun pellets as she was playing on the porch of a neighbor's second-floor  apartment in the 100 block of Avenida Pelayo.  </P> <P> She was released on Dec. 28 from Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The family was unavailable for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Police initially had speculated that the shooting was the result of a feud  between two gangs -- the San Clemente Varrio Chico and the San Juan Boys, also  called the SJC Boys.  </P> <P> But law enforcement officials later said that they had no proof that the  shooting -- the first of its type in South County -- was linked to gang  activity.  </P> <P> Ehlow confirmed that the two juvenile suspects, both 17 and Latino, were San  Juan Capistrano residents. But he declined to say if the two were members of  the SJC Boys.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Martin Engquist said that the gang unit was asked to aid  in the investigation at the request of the San Clemente Police Department.  </P> <P> "We got involved because there was an indication that there was group  involvement," Engquist said. But like other law enforcement officials, he was  reluctant to say that the shooting was the result of gang activity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Sleepy'  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Avery's former classmates in Oceanside, who said Avery wore thick  glasses and was nicknamed "Sleepy," expressed mixed feelings about the arrest.  </P> <P> While some said that they believed Avery was capable of committing such a  crime, others defended him, saying he was "mellow and friendly" and spent a lot  of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> "He was probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time," said David Rivera,  21, as he stood with a group of friends in a park near Avery's home.  </P> <P> "I don't think he would have pulled a trigger," Rivera added.  </P> <P> Acquaintances described Avery as a quiet person and one who did not pick  fights. Although not a gang member himself, he often hung around with known  gang members in the neighborhood around the high school and often visited  friends in South County.  </P> <P> "He's like a home boy," said one 16-year-old girl who asked not to be  identified. "He was not part of a gang. He just hung around with some gang  members."  </P> <P> Avery's mother, visibly shaken by her son's arrest, declined to be interviewed  or give her first name.  </P> <P> "I don't want to talk about it," she said, holding back tears before going back  into her modest, single-story home located in an older section of the city.  </P> <P> Police would not give details of the connection between Avery and the San Juan  Capistrano juveniles who were arrested on Friday.  </P> <P> "We believe they know each other," Ehlow said. "We're not certain what the  relationship is."  </P> <P> Sgt. Richard Downing said that investigators believe that the two juveniles  were with Avery in his car when the shots were fired on Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> Suspects believed to be riding in two other cars are still at large, Downing  said.  </P> <P> One of the other cars, a 1978 Buick, was found abandoned along Interstate 5 in  Capistrano Beach shortly after the shooting, police said. It was later found to  be stolen in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> On the night of the shooting, Avery reported that his light-blue, 1973 Datsun  had been stolen "somewhere on Camino de los Mares" in San Clemente, police  said.  </P> <P> Two days later, Avery's car was found, stripped down, off San Juan Creek Road  in south San Juan Capistrano, Lt. Bob Rivas said. He would not, however, say  what evidence was in the car that may have linked it to the shooting and  Avery's arrest.  </P> <P> Ehlow said police were tipped off to the location of the weapon believed to  have been used in the attack.  </P> <P> A 20-gauge, pump-action shotgun was found buried in the back yard of a San Juan  Capistrano residence. Police declined to give the address, saying that other  suspects were still being sought in the investigation.  </P> <P> Ehlow said it was not likely that residents at the home where the shotgun was  found were involved with the shooting.  </P></p>

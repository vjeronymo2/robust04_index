			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MGM Grand Air Orders Planes: The Los Angeles-based airline said it ordered two  Boeing 757-200 long range aircraft to be delivered in the mid-1990s. The  airline said the jets would be used for transcontinental flights, replacing the  Douglas DC-8s that now service the Los Angeles-New York market. Charles  Demoney, MGM Grand president and chief executive, said the DC-8s might then be  used in charter service, or possibly for a New York-London route.  </P></p>

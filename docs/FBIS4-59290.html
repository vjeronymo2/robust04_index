			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The discovery of a microphone in the Islamic  Republic of Iran's Embassy in London has exposed the espionage  activities of the British Government against our country. This  microphone, concealed inside a wall, had been transmitting the  ongoing talks and conversations in the Iranian Embassy in London  to Britain's espionage apparatus.    The action of the British Government in eavesdropping and  diplomatic espionage in the embassy is totally contrary to  international laws and is considered as interference in our  country's internal affairs. The embassy of a country is  regarded as that country's territory and, on the basis of the  Vienna 1961 Convention, enjoys special privileges and immunity.  The British Conservative government therefore, by resorting to  espionage in the Iranian Embassy, has violated the Iran's  sovereignty, too.    The British Government, which considers itself the vanguard  of international law, human rights, the fight against terrorism,  and other similar titles, has directly resorted to espionage  inside the Iranian Embassy in London. Almost simultaneously  with the exposure of the British espionage activity in our  London embassy, John Major's government, in order to provide a  cover for this huge disgrace, began some baseless propaganda on  contacts between Iran and the Irish Republican Army. This show  was not even effective in Britain, so much so that the British  press and media too confessed that these allegations are false  and vague.    Unfortunately Britain, this permanent member of the Security  Council and the so-called protector of international peace and  security -- the same as some of its western allies -- is  pursuing its anti-human objectives without care for any  regulations and law. This country's behavior in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue has exposed in the best possible manner  the true face of this so-called free democratic state. Britain  brings pressure to bear on any state which opposes its policies,  by resorting to such accusations as human rights violations,  attempting to obtain nuclear weapons, and terrorism. Whereas  Britain itself is classed as one of the major international  lawbreakers.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish on 23  January carries, on pages D6 and D7, a 2,000-word article by  Pamela Aravena Bolivar on the "controversy" created by the  signing of an agreement between the Chilean Association of  Municipalities, ACHM, and the U.S. Peace Corps.    The Peace Corps, which returned to Chile in July 1991,  signed  agreements with about 30 national organizations without creating  any controversies until last week, when ACHM Chairman Jaime  Ravinet signed an agreement with the corps. Political party  leaders reacted by saying they do not accept new U.S.  intervention in municipal affairs.    Jaime Insunza of the Chilean Communist Party, Councilman  Herman Chadwick of the Independent Democratic Union, and Senator  Ricardo Nunez of the Socialist Party criticized the agreement.  Insunza and Chadwick agree that the Peace Corps presence in  Chile was a form of "intervention."    Chadwick said: "The U.S. policy toward Latin America in the  1960's was based on the Alliance for Progress. Its relation with  us was of protectionism. This allowed the U.S. Government to  intervene directly in the Latin American countries that were  poorer and less developed socially and politically."    Jaime Insunza said: "I believe the main problem is that the  corps represented a flagrant intervention in the Chilean social  process that went against the interests of the national  majorities."    Sen. Ricardo Nunez prefers to be more cautious. He said the  main problem with the corps is that it is an obsolete  organization. He believes there should be an exchange between  Chilean municipal governments and municipal governments in other  countries. He added: "My criticism is not aimed at the  cooperation itself but at the fact that instruments that are no  longer part of the international scene should not be used. The  Peace Corps, no matter how reorganized, is something from the  past that already has been overcome."    Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet reacted angrily because he  believes an agreement of this type should not revive the  controversy of the 1960's. He said those who will come will not  be youngsters with romantic ideas about how to help an  underdeveloped country. He added: "The municipalities will get  people with high academic training and vast labor experience."</p>

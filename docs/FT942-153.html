			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / People: Global task for NatWest's Jaskel Martin Jaskel, 48, a former gilts salesman, has been given the job of welding National Westminster Bank's various trade finance operations into a single global business. Jaskel, who joined NatWest in 1990 after a career with various City stockbrokers, has been appointed to the new post of managing director, global trade and banking services. He will be responsible for co-ordinating the development of the international trade activities of the bank's four main operations - NatWest Markets, UK branch business, NatWest Bancorp and international - and will have a staff of around 1,800. He will report to Roger Byatt, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets. Jaskel's new post is a result of a three-month project he carried out for Derek Wanless, NatWest's group chief executive. Wanless wanted a more focused trade finance operation which could be expanded on a global basis and would utilise the synergies that exist within the group. As part of the change, two new businesses are being created: structured trade finance, concentrating on large corporates' specialised needs; and a banking institutions group, responsible for marketing high value-added products. Jaskel is not being replaced as director, global marketing in NatWest Treasury, and his responsibilities will taken on by the three regional directors. Michael Kershaw, 42, head of project finance at British Telecommunications, has joined Samuel Montagu to head its new project advisory and finance unit. The new unit, part of Montagu's specialised financing division, will concentrate on advising and arranging finance for projects in the UK and continental Europe. Kershaw's background is in the utilities and construction industries. Before joining BT, he worked for Balfour Beatty and Hawker Siddeley.</p>

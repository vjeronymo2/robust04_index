			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ALBUMS OF WINTER;  </P> <P> POSTHUMOUS ROY ORBISON RELEASE LEADS THE PACK;  </P> <P> **** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * RUNNING ON EMPTY  </P> <P> ROY ORBISON  </P> <P> "Mystery Girl." Virgin  </P> <P> *** 1/2  </P> <P> For anyone ever touched by the dramatic sweep and disarming intimacy of Roy  Orbison's voice, there are moments in this posthumous release as magical as  anything the late Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member ever recorded.  </P> <P> Working with a variety of producers and musicians (including T Bone Burnett,  Jeff Lynne, George Harrison and Tom Petty), Orbison doesn't always come up with  material that matches the haunting poignancy of such '60s high points as  "Running Scared" or "Only the Lonely."  </P> <P> For the most part, however, the songs are both distinguished and finely  tailored. In Elvis Costello's dark "The Comedians," Orbison retraces the eerie  intensity of his most unsettling tales of romantic heartbreak, while the  soothing "California Blue" (which he wrote with Lynne and Petty) recalls the  innocence of "Blue Bayou."  </P> <P> "She's a Mystery to Me" -- written by U2's Bono Hewson and the Edge --  represents the greatest growth. Rather than the familiar Orbison roles of  someone defeated by rejection or overjoyed by acceptance, the song deals with  the confusion of a complex relationship. It's a difficult song, but Orbison's  delicate rendition is as gripping as any of his more overtly dramatic  exercises.  </P> <P> The album's most evocative track is "In the Real World," a graceful Will  Jennings-Richard Kerr composition that enables Orbison to offer some comforting  reflections about life outside of his trademark dream world: "There are things  we can't change / And endings come to us / In ways that we can't rearrange."  </P> <P> The gentleness of the vocal on "In the Real World" reminds you that Orbison's  greatness wasn't tied simply to the power in his voice or the intensity of his  arrangements. Of all the great rock vocalists, perhaps no one sang with quite  so much natural soulfulness as Orbison. That's why his tales of loneliness were  so haunting. They didn't just approximate our feelings. They virtually  duplicated them. ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (21): One bright spot in a sluggish market - Japan: Michiyo Nakamoto examines the painful reversal in the industry's fortunes For the past few months, employees at a Toyota car factory in Motomachi, Nagoya, have been putting in extra hours to keep up with strong demand. The Motomachi factory is the manufacturing base for a 4-wheel-drive recreational vehicle called RAV4, which has been a spectacular success in the five months since it was launched. In the RAV4, Toyota hit on a formula for success that reflects the fundamental changes Japan's car market has seen in the past years. Its off-roader filled a gap for Japanese consumers. It is a different kind of passenger car, available at a much lower price than they had come to expect. However, the RAV4 has been a conspicuously bright spot in Japan's otherwise stubbornly sluggish auto market. Following three years of falling demand, the Japanese car market suffered another 3 per cent fall in domestic demand in the first half of this year to 3.3m units, while exports declined by 20 per cent to 2.2m. In 1993, domestic sales of new passenger cars fell to 4.2m units, down 5.7 per cent from the previous year, while 1992 saw an 8.5 per cent decline. The reversal in the Japanese automakers' fortunes has been all the more painful, as it followed three years to 1990 of spectacular growth. During that period, new car sales jumped 150 per cent, Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, the country's second largest carmaker, said. Three years of falling demand have, however, wiped out any hope Japanese car makers may have had for a return to the boom years when prestige, rather than price, was the main concern for the domestic market. Instead, given the country's shrinking population growth and a trend to greater economy, Japan's market is expected to stabilise at an annual growth rate of about 1-2 per cent, compared with an average of 9 per cent in the three years to 1990, Mr Kume said. Furthermore, competition will intensify as the greater price competitiveness of foreign-made cars in a high-yen environment has opened up Japan's domestic market to a high level of imports. In the first six months of this year, registrations of imported automobiles rose 40 per cent to nearly 138,000 units, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association. As awareness and availability of foreign cars increases, their popularity is expected to continue growing. At the same time, exports have been in steady decline, for the eighth consecutive year in 1993. The trend is in part a result of the falling competitiveness of Japanese cars overseas due to the yen's appreciation, but more fundamentally as a result of increased production overseas. That trend is expected to accelerate further, as political pressures, the comparatively high costs of manufacturing in Japan and the growing necessity of developing models that are suited to particular regional needs are making it imperative that Japanese carmakers further globalise their operations. Amid these structural changes, Japanese carmakers have been conducting a fundamental review their entire operations. 'In this market environment, we at the Japanese automobile industry who enjoyed a continued expansion in production up until recently, are now pressed to undertake a major restructuring,' Mr Kume said. One pillar of restructuring will be increased globalisation of operations as carmakers come under pressure from the yen to reduce their dependence on Japan as a world manufacturing base, and to seek growth in overseas markets. 'From now on, growth for Japanese auto makers will come mainly from outside Japan,' said one industry analyst. In response, Japanese carmakers have been building their operations in south-east Asia and China, and strengthening their manufacturing capabilities in western markets. Toyota recently made clear its intention to increase local vehicle production in North America by more than 50 per cent, to double engine production, and to increase exports from the region to other countries, including Japan, by 60 per cent. Production of the popular pick-up truck sold in the US will be moved entirely to North America. Honda, meanwhile, aims to give more autonomy to its global manufacturing bases and lessen dependency on Japan. The company will increase spending in North American facilities by Dollars 310m in a bid to boost manufacturing and R&amp;D capacity. Exports from North America are expected almost to double this year, and double again by the turn of the decade. In Europe, Honda plans to increase capacity at its UK manufacturing plant so that about half the cars sold in Europe could be produced there. At the other end of the spectrum, Mazda has been left somewhat behind in the move to globalise. It is particularly vulnerable in Europe, where plans to share production facilities with Ford, the US auto maker which owns more than 24 per cent in Mazda, collapsed early last year. The other pillar of restructuring in the Japanese auto industry is the adjustment of domestic production. One important aspect of Toyota's success with its RAV4 has been the company's ability to reduce costs by increasing commonality of parts with other cars, and keeping the car very simple. 'We decided to make the car as simple as possible and not to include anything unnecessary,' explained Masakatsu Nonaka, chief engineer of the RAV4. By restricting the car to one engine, one body and one grade, a revolutionary step for Toyota, the car maker was able to substantially lower costs. Other Japanese carmakers have been pursuing the same goal, and some have enjoyed similar successes to Toyota. However, shifting production overseas and reducing costs will not alone be remedy for their woes. Japanese carmakers have yet to face up to the overcapacity that remains in the domestic market. While overall sales of new cars have recovered slightly in the past months, helped by a long-awaited tax cut, domestic demand is unlikely to recover to the levels seen during the peak years, while exports will continue to decrease as production is shifted overseas. As a result domestic production, which fell from almost 13.5m units in 1990 to 11.2m last year, is not expected to recover significantly. Even while recognising the problem, Japanese auto makers have been reluctant to implement full-scale capacity cuts. At the lower end of the manufacturing pyramid, smaller sub-contractors are showing the strains of reduced domestic production. Since the beginning of last year, 127 auto parts suppliers in Japan have collapsed, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company. Sooner or later, the wider impact of the structural changes facing the industry is likely to be seen higher up the pyramid.</p>

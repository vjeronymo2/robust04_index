			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Sunday Supplemental NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] It has been reported in a press release that a group  of people illegally entered the residence of His Excellency Paul  Vermeirsch, the Belgian ambassador to Cuba, on the morning of 28  May in an attempt to push for their departure from Cuba.    This new incident is another consequence of the calls to  illegality made by counterrevolutionary stations broadcasting  from Miami and, basically, the result of the restrictive  policies implemented by U.S. immigration authorities who  continue to block legal procedures for people wanting to  emigrate to the United States.    These people resort to illegal and even violent means to  depart the country after repeatedly failing to obtain visas.  The revolutionary government, which does not obstruct those who  comply with the legal procedures for departing Cuba, has  reiterated, on several occasions, its commitment to not allowing  the use of illegal break-ins into diplomatic missions in Cuba as  a mean of leaving the country.</p>

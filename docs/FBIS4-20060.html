			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bernardo Valli: "Unavoidable Choice"] </F>   [Text] NATO had no other choice. Its stern ultimatum to  the Serbs was unavoidable. The delay in issuing it had a very  high, intolerable, human cost, but perhaps the consequences  entailed in NATO's decision demanded such a long period of  reflection. Now, however, the people of Gorazde can no longer be  abandoned to General Mladic's gangs. Their fate is, and has  been for some time, closely bound to the credibility of the top  international bodies and the major democracies. It is for this  very reason that an ultimatum, in practice, an order for an  immediate cease-fire, was issued. By its inflexibility it seeks  to compensate for blameworthy delays and reveals anger and  outrage not entirely due to the human tragedy.    The Serbs tried to conceal the bloodshed, prevented  television cameras from entering the besieged city, and it is  likely that the absence of pictures of the massacre reduced the  level of people's feelings and thus public pressure, especially  in America, which was very strong during the earlier tragedy in  Sarajevo. General Mladic was thus able to gain time. In his  haste, the Serbian leader nevertheless failed to realize that,  by so obviously defying NATO, by humiliating the military  alliance on which the United States bases its leadership in  Europe and a large part of its image worldwide, he was prompting  an inevitable response. General Mladic is a man with a  primitive audacity who, like many of his contemporaries, has  learned to calculate time according to the television yardstick.  After the two NATO incursions on 10 and 11 April he waited a  few hours, long enough for two or three CNN news broadcasts,  then resumed his assault. He thought that the West, headed by  the Americans, had abandoned their arduous task of halting his  men on the outskirts of Gorazde.    In fact he had good reasons for believing so. His belief  rested on several precedents. But this time Mladic went too  far, and he did not receive a warning from television. He  failed to realize that, by dropping those four bombs in two  incursions on 10 and 11 April, NATO took an important change of  course. Having acted for 45 years as a deterrent shield against  the Soviet Union -- almost half a century without ever firing a  single cannon shot -- on that occasion the Atlantic alliance  became an offensive mechanism. Those four little bombs in April  had a great political significance. As LE MONDE put it, having  been a shield, NATO became a sword. Mladic took it for a tin  sword. A comical sword. The Serbs laughed at it and continued  bombarding Gorazde. And the whole world laughed with them,  mixing tears for the dead and wounded, nowhere to be seen on  television, with laughter for the disgraceful showing by  Clinton's America (people stopped laughing at Europe some time  ago).    European diplomatic and military officials involved in  discussing what stance to adopt in Bosnia with their American  counterparts say that in recent days the latter "became  monsters." They stubbornly insisted on the need to salvage  NATO's credibility, readily admitting that the United States'  own credibility was at stake too. The United States decided some  time ago to continue performing a crucial role on the Old  Continent, via NATO, by providing it with the decisive means for  essential air cover. That is, without obligatorily deploying  land troops, which would revive nightmares about Vietnam across  the Atlantic.    The French and British, anxious about their men in Bosnia,  tried to curb America's anger by pointing to the dangers that  the blue helmets would face if NATO bombarded General Mladic's  troops and guns. The latter would not hesitate to take them  hostage, and probably even he would be unable to prevent his  troops from taking savage reprisals against isolated UNPROFOR  units within easy reach.    In the past such arguments stifled UN and NATO plans for  intervention amid uncertainties. This time, however, the  Americans dragged the reluctant Europeans with them by force;  some of the Europeans, under irresistible American pressure,  subsequently decided to speak out in favor of the ultimatum to  the Serbs even before the NATO meeting in Brussels. Better to  appear the promoters of the enterprise rather than to be accused  of cowardice by an over-excited public. In an attempt to tame  the American "monsters," the Europeans used even Russia's  rumblings. Actually, the Russians did more shouting than  grumbling in the European capitals. They often raised their  voices in an attempt to show that air incursions against the  Bosnian Serb troops would kindle Slav and Orthodox patriotism  within Moscow's parliament, creating difficulties for the  already beleaguered Boris Yeltsin. In order to divert the  Europeans from their intent, Russian diplomats insistently  pointed to the reassuring "promises" given by Clinton to Yeltsin  by telephone. But the Americans convinced the Europeans that  the Russians must not be taken too literally and that they  should be reassured but not heeded at this stage in their  history. Furthermore, Yeltsin had dissociated himself  considerably from the Serbs. He had essentially displayed  salutary common sense, partly dictated by the need for Western  economic aid and the desire to save energies to be devoted to  more vital crises. That in Ukraine, for instance.    So General Mladic was misled by Clinton's innocent face as  it  appeared on CNN. He thought that NATO had abandoned its  endeavor and that the Serbs could calmly massacre and "win the  war." Instead, the war has suddenly been further complicated.  It is acquiring a different pace and a different dimension.  What are they? It is possible to question the effectiveness of  an air intervention without the deployment of adequate ground  troops. Indeed, with inadequate ground units that are in danger  of being taken hostage. But these are the consequences that  were pondered for so long -- though every hour cost human lives  -- thus postponing the inevitable NATO ultimatum. There was no  other choice. We knew it. Perhaps General Mladic too will  realize it before tonight's midnight deadline.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: HE HAS A WAY OF BOUNCING BACK  </P> <P> If you have a strong heart, it's kind of fun watching Paul D. McKinnon do his  thing.  </P> <P> Lately, he's been been jumping off bridges, such as the 200-foot-high Vincent  Thomas Bridge in San Pedro.  </P> <P> In fact, he has leaped off 14 bridges and plans more adventurous jumps in  England, which he will visit starting Saturday as a delegate to the World  Congress of Chiropractic Students.  </P> <P> He is part of the latest craze of Bungee jumping -- leaping off something and,  hopefully, being pulled up just short of the ground by an elastic-type tether  attached to the feet.  </P> <P> "I'd like to a make a 600-foot fall," he said. "I see that as a big-time jump."  </P> <P> And get this. McKinnon says it's his way of overcoming fear.  </P> <P> "I sort of was afraid of height," said the La Habra chiropractic student who  also operates a local house-sitting business. "It's a wonderful, challenging  thing to do."  </P> <P> McKinnon believes that if people jumped off bridges, they would lessen their  fears, helping them to be more successful.  </P> <P> "Now I know I can do anything I want to do," he said. "If you break one fear,  you can break all the others. Your fear turns into exhilaration when the air  rushes by you."  </P> <P> At the end of the jump, he said, "you just feel a gentle tug. It's almost like  flying without an airplane."  </P> <P> His support group pulls him up.  </P> <P> Although he's big on bridge jumping, McKinnon also likes roller-blading, a new  type of roller-skating using skates with four wheels lined up behind each other  rather than two wheels side by side.  </P> <P> "Hockey players and speed skaters use them for conditioning during the  off-season," said McKinnon, who recently completed a 102.7-mile, roller-blading  trip to San Diego in 8 hours and 50 minutes.  </P> <P> He started at the Huntington Beach Pier and finished at the entrance to Sea  World in San Diego.  </P> <P> He asked chiropractors to donate 25 cents a mile for each mile he roller-bladed  to finance the $1,500 needed for his England trip.  </P> <P> "I started out asking only chiropractors to help me so I could develop a  rapport with them since that's going to be my life's work," said the one-time  amateur hockey player who had thoughts of becoming a professional.  </P> <P> But McKinnon was forced to seek donations from other professionals to meet his  goal.  </P> <P> His decision to be a chiropractor was prompted by a sports injury.  </P> <P> "I suffered a back injury and was told I wouldn't be able to play hockey any  more," he said. "Besides, I'm only 5 foot, 8 inches tall and that's too small  for the pros."  </P> <P> He was facing back surgery until he received treatment from a chiropractor who,  he said, not only helped him physically but helped him decide his life's work.  </P> <P> McKinnon said he was once a premed student with a full scholarship,  </P> <P> "But I decided that being a chiropractor was the best thing I could do to help  a lot more people," he said. "I like the hands-on approach without doing  surgery."  </P> <P> McKinnon said he has a number of visions and goals, including a mission to  promote good health through diet, exercise and education.  </P> <P> One of his goals is to become the team chiropractic doctor for the Los Angeles  Kings.  </P> <P> "A lot of hockey players use chiropractors to help keep them fit," he noted.  </P></p>

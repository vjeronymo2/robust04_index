			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Money Markets: European rate cuts BOTH the Belgian and Dutch central banks pushed money market dealing rates below those of Germany yesterday because of the D-Mark's weaker position in the European Monetary System grid, writes James Blitz. The move led to a rise in short-dated Euromark futures, as dealers expected that the move might make bring forward the time when German official rates could be eased again. Otherwise, money markets in both Germany and the UK were extremely calm. The German cash market was closed for the one day prayer and repentance holiday. Sterling dealers appeared to be taking a breather in the wake of the third successive base rate cut in two months. Their attention was focused on the Bank of England's decision to roll over the special funding facilities that it is offering banks following the massive intervention to support sterling on Black Wednesday. The easing of official dealing rates in Holland and Belgium was caused by the very strong position of both the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder in the ERM in recent weeks. Both countries' central banks are committed to keeping their currencies within tight ranges against the D-Mark. To redress the balance, Belgium cut its overnight rate to 9.20 per cent from 9.25 per cent, while the special rate for primary dealers was cut to 8.70 per cent from 8.75 per cent. The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 8.70 per cent from 8.80 per cent in response to the strong guilder. However, the cuts had only a marginal effect on these currencies exchange rates against the D-Mark. The moves forced up Euromark futures, because of increased expectation that Germany would ease rates. The March contract rose 16 basis points to a close of 92.33 on heavy volume. In the sterling cash market, 3-month money eased to 7 1/4 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 7 3/8 per cent. The fall reflected the easier tone to the Bank of England's operations. A shortage of Pounds 950m was forecast and Pounds 475m was removed in the early round. The Bank of England announced that it would continue to provide special facilities to the banking system to take effect on November 30 and mature on February 1. The new facilities will replace the ones currently in operation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josep Gisbert report: "Pujol Asserts That CiU's Support </F> for Government Does Not Depend on European Elections"]    [Excerpt] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol asserted yesterday that  "our support" for the government "does not depend on the  European elections, which were not called in order to say who  should govern Spain; rather, it depends on our reaching  agreement to carry out the policy that must be effected in the  economic, labor, and autonomy fields, and on the government's  acting severely against the corruption cases."    At the news conference following the latest cabinet meeting,  held yesterday, the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government]  president stressed that "it is these criteria that guide us,  because the best thing for the country is that there be  stability"; not the results of the European elections, "which  will perhaps be important and crucial for the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] and for the government, but not for  us." Jordi Pujol, who stated that "we do not know what will  happen 13 June, not because of us but because of what the PSOE  may do," thus made it clear that the outcome of the European  elections will not affect his support for the government, and  that, in any event, the initiative for what might happen in  Spain's political life the day after 12 June remains in the  hands of Felipe Gonzalez himself.  <H5>  Call for Calm </H5>   Concern about the aspersions that the PSOE and People's  Party  leaders are exchanging in this framework was also expressed by  the Generalitat president, who stated: "I never assess favorably  wounding tones from anybody -- neither PSOE people not People's  Party people." Jordi Pujol's opinion is that "this is not a  good approach," because "the atmosphere of constant threat is  not good, nor is that of radical attacks, which seem to show  that there is a desire for destruction." In view of this, he  showed himself opposed to "everybody's excesses of language,"  and called for calm and "forgoing aggressive and not always  accurate criticism and insults, since, although everybody does  what he can, there are sometimes people who use this approach  because they really have nothing else to say."    The Generalitat president, who specified that CiU  [Convergence and Union] will not allow itself to be swept along  by this dynamic, finally demanded that "everybody restrain  themselves," although he expressed his doubts about achieving  this in view of the "insults and slanders" that are being  leveled, and when "there are rallies such as last weekend's,"  referring to the Socialist Party of Catalonia meeting in  Barcelona, at which Narcis Serra severely criticized Jose Maria  Aznar, and the People's Party meeting in Moron de la Frontera  (Seville), at which both the PSOE and CiU were very harshly  attacked. For his part, Miquel Roca also condemned yesterday  the aspersions that the PSOE and the People's Party are  exchanging, and, referring to the People's Party rally, stated  that "to say that Felipe Gonzalez is selling Spain out to Jordi  Pujol is unfair, offensive, and very unpleasant nonsense, aimed  solely at stirring up an anti-Catalan message based on  demagoguery; and demagoguery only creates problems that are  difficult to resolve."

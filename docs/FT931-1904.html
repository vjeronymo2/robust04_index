			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Threat of unrest hits European equities SHARE prices on European stock markets fell sharply yesterday amid concern that President Boris Yeltsin's imposition of direct rule threatened Russia with civil unrest. The political showdown in Moscow also helped to weaken the D-Mark, after several days in which the German currency had rallied strongly against the dollar and most European currencies. Dealers yesterday sold D-Marks for other currencies because of concerns about the high level of German economic involvement with the former Soviet Union. The crisis gave a respite to the French franc which had weakened sharply against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism last week. UK equities, which had taken a generally negative view of last week's UK Budget, moved lower in response to events in Moscow. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares closed down 36.2 on the day at 2,863.9. In Frankfurt, German shares fell even more sharply, with the DAX index slipping 37.41 to close at 1,661.40. Construction stocks were particularly badly hit on fears that Mr Yeltsin's problems could threaten contracts with German companies to build flats for Russian soldiers returning home from east Germany. In Paris, the CAC-40 index lost 23.4 to close at 1,939.28, as fears over Russia offset any comfort from the strong performance of the right in the first round of the national assembly elections. The US market fell in morning trade, but a rally in bonds brought shares off their lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.1 down at 3,463.48. The dollar rose to DM1.6473 in the morning, but closed at DM1.6375, up nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day. It eased slightly to DM1.63725 in New York. The French franc closed in London at FFr3.40 to the D-Mark from FFr3.41 previously, and stayed close to this level in New York. Lex, Page 22 Currencies, Page 33 World stocks, page 39</p>

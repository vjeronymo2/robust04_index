			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft Metallgesellschaft's new management is still not ready to reveal the extent of the problems it has unearthed. The news that it has brought forward its bank creditors' meeting and that its gross debt is DM8bn is disconcerting nonetheless. Gross debt has doubled since its last balance sheet in September 1992, when group equity was incidentally just DM3.7bn. The need for a debt rescheduling is becoming increasingly apparent, but the negotiation may be particularly tortuous, given Metallgesellschaft's far-flung network of subsidiaries, many of which involve substantial outside shareholders. It thus looks as though the German banks will not be able simply to impose their own solution. Indeed, there must already have been a strong temptation for overseas banks to abuse Deutsche and Dresdner Bank's commitment to provide liquidity by seeking to call in some of their own loans. That alone would be grounds for bringing the creditors' meeting forward. In the short run, arms may have to be twisted but a longer-term answer might be to slim down the group and simplify its structure by selling off subsidiaries in countries such as Canada and Australia, but that would also involve stripping out mainstream businesses in metals and mining.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EX-DEPUTY CHARGED ON 2 SEX COUNTS  </P> <P> A former Orange County sheriff's deputy has been charged with two counts of  sexual misconduct after confessing to investigators that he had sex with  inmates.  </P> <P> In an apparent act of religious repentance, former deputy Bret McCammon  contacted sheriff's officials on March 22, 1989, to confess that he had had sex  with inmates while he was employed at the Men's Central Jail, Sheriff's  Department Lt. Bob Rivas said.  </P> <P> McCammon, who is now a construction worker, had been hired as a sheriff's  deputy in 1982. His employment as a deputy ended in 1987.  </P> <P> After a seven-month investigation by the Sheriff's Department and the district  attorney's office, McCammon was charged with two felony counts of forcing an  inmate, identified only as James A., to have oral sex with him.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, McCammon, who is a Mormon, said: "I have a desire to  clean up my life and the church plays a role in that."  </P> <P> McCammon said he could not discuss his case. Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade, who  is in charge of special investigations, said the Sheriff's Department had  originally investigated McCammon in 1987 after an inmate filed a complaint  against the deputy.  </P> <P> McCammon, who is free on his own recognizance, was arraigned Jan. 19. He faces  a preliminary hearing March 26 in Santa Ana Municipal Court.  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Equity derivatives held a fairly steady course, managing to preserve gains made in the previous session, Christine Buckley writes. Activity was modest, with just under a third of the 13,111 volume in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 attributed to a roll over of positions. Some 4,000 were rolled into the September contract, making a significant amount of the day's trade directionless. With June near to its expiry, and fair value at zero, the contract traded at a discount to cash for large periods of the session. But it did muster a small premium on a couple of occasions and hit a day's high of 3,020 just after Wall Street opened. Its low had been struck very early in the session when it slipped 3 points from an opening 2,993. Some negative arbitrage has been observed lately, with the June contract having fallen so low that buyers have moved into the future and gone short on stocks. Traders were hesitant about calling the mood in stock index futures, blaming the absence of any real pointers in the market. June closed 4 points up on the day at 2,997. Low activity in traded options made for a modest 22,879 lots, with the FT-SE 100 option recording only 8,660 and the Euro FT-SE 4,368. The most active stock option was British Gas at 2,159 contracts.</p>

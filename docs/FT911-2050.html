			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Environment warning to tourism industry THE TOURISM industry was warned yesterday that it must tackle the problem of 'tourist blight' on the environment if it was to survive and prosper. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said: 'The glittering prospects that the tourism industry has will be tarnished unless it takes its responsibilities to the environment seriously.' He was speaking in London yesterday after the publication of a working party's report on tourism and the environment. The party, drawn from all sides of the industry, urged greater contribution to schemes to help protect the environment from excessive numbers of tourists and developments. Mr Howard said that the English Tourist Board was conducting pilot studies to find the best way of coping with large numbers of tourists. The studies will focus initially on Windsor, the Cumbrian uplands, and the emerging tourism area of Castlefield near Manchester. Mr Howard said tourism contributed Pounds 24bn to the economy and that nearly 1.5m people worked in the sector. However, the influx of tourists to Britain - nearly 18m last year - was harming the environment. The report identified problems such as overcrowding in towns including York and Brighton. It added that wash from pleasure boats on the Norfolk Broads was seen to be eroding river banks. Consumers are suspicious that manufacturers are making environmental claims to push up prices, says a survey published yesterday by the Mintel research group. The survey, of more than 1,300 adults, found that almost six out of every 10 supported 'green' products but were not prepared to pay more than a 5 per cent premium for such goods. Mintel's survey suggests that customers of the Sainsbury, Tesco and Gateway supermarket chains were most interested in 'green' products. The Green Consumer 1991, Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London. EC1.

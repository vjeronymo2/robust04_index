			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Classroom exports - UK boarding schools are attracting more foreign pupils with vigorous marketing 'Pipers' Corner School. 15 miles from Heathrow,' proclaimed a banner at a recent exhibition of UK independent schools. It was by no means the only one enthusiastically touting its convenience for international travellers. The recession, and its impact on wealthy parents' salaries, has given UK boarding schools a stressful few years, and last year saw a sharp, headline-grabbing fall of 6 per cent in the total number of boarders at UK schools. But the same survey showed that their success as exporters had improved noticeably, with a rise in foreign pupils of 3.9 per cent. Boarding schools have always provided a home for the children of British expatriates, but they are now increasingly selling their wares to foreigners. Starting from a base in areas of strong British influence, notably Hong Kong and Singapore, schools are now recruiting heavily from the other emerging economies of the Pacific - despite competition from Australia and the US - and are even beginning to penetrate Europe and the Middle East. Last year, the number of new recruits from Hong Kong increased from 458 to 506, while the remainder of East Asia saw an increase from 391 to 441. The number of new Europeans rose from 568 to 605. Apart from extensive and ambitious trips to drum up custom, schools are also tailoring the courses they offer to include internationally recognised qualifications and lessons in English as a second language. Free transport between airport and school is provided each term for the pupils, and marketing material is slickly produced in several languages. Foreigners come for differing reasons, which the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) is careful to analyse. According to John Towey, of Isis, British schools are now recapturing ground previously lost to Australia. Schools there appealed to Asian parents because fees tended to be lower, and transport costs were less prohibitive. Parents these days are usually making a hard-headed investment rather than looking for any 'snob' value carried by Britain's public schools. An important attraction of British schools is the route they offer into British higher education. Parents in Hong Kong, Taiwan or Malaysia are increasingly keen for the career advantages this can offer. Towey also notes a sharp change in attitude in the last three or four years. Parents now want close details of exactly who is going to care for their child, and some guarantee of a stable background. Getting the message across, however, is time-consuming and expensive. Parents are widely dispersed, and need close attention from school representatives before they will commit their children to a journey around the world. An ever-growing number of school development officers have therefore resorted to lengthy trips to East Asia. Many schools use the co-ordinated marketing offered by Isis, which arranges international exhibitions and fairs in these areas. But increasingly, head teachers are travelling in person. Not only the more eye-catching public schools are looking east. St Aubyn's, a Sussex prep school with around only 115 pupils, still felt it worthwhile to send its headmaster on a tour of Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong this year. It is a traditional cosy prep school, but still uses high-quality marketing aids. Julian James, St Aubyn's headmaster, took copies of the school video, featuring a voice-over by television presenter Chris Serle, and ringing endorsements from the former heads of Radley and Harrow. The message is clear - truly ambitious parents can improve their son's chances of a place at a public school by placing him at a prep school first. Statistics on the number of boys moving on to Eton and Winchester were also readily available. However, James found that parents were most keen just to find a stable environment for their children. The other vital point was academic quality - the Chinese, in particular, were anxious that their children would be worked hard, and that they would go on to good public schools and universities. However, he did find one note of caution for schools which are boosting foreign recruitment - many parents were keen that most of their sons' companions would be English. As a result, St Aubyn's is limiting its non-English intake to 10 per cent. Cultural differences can make negotiations more difficult. Richard Pearce, admissions director for the International School of London, has compiled a glossary of what parents really mean by the questions they ask. For example: 'We have heard that your school is the best in England' could mean 'Prestige is important in our country and there are few prestigious schools,' or it might just be an attempt to be polite. Another common question is: 'Is your school recognised by the ministry of education?' Pearce interprets this as a statement that certificates matter more than general education, and that in the home country some, or all, private schools are of dubious quality. Tactics for attracting students from Europe are different. The opportunity to improve English is important, while A-levels, attractive to children from East Asia hoping to go to an English university, are less popular. Schools keen on signing up students from Europe are starting to offer the International Baccalaureate, which is recognised in several countries, as an alternative course. Sevenoaks School in Kent introduced the IB 10 years ago, and is now truly international, with 30 nationalities represented in its student body. Malvern College in Worcestershire is also now offering the IB, and has been rewarded with a sharp increase in applications from Germany. Many schools now see a limited future for A-levels and the move towards the IB is likely to continue. Other independent schools are trying to build links with the former communist bloc countries. Uppingham School, in Leicestershire, now has a full-time European liaison officer, and offers scholarships to eastern Europeans. The aim, apart from helping the countries in their hour of need, is to build links with their future decision-makers.</p>

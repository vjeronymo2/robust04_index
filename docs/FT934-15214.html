			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Travel company calls in receivers TRAVEL company Sea-sun called in receivers yesterday. The company, which specialised in coach and camping holidays to Spain and France, shut its offices in Colchester, Essex, and telephone callers were met with an answering machine advising the company had ceased trading. The Association of British Travel Agents said Sea-sun had been a member since 1989 and holidaymakers would not be left stranded. The costs of their holidays and return travel would be met from a bond. Holidays due to start from or after today had been cancelled and the money would be refunded.</p>

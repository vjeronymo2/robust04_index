			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Zooming in on a bargain - Glyn Genin, the FT's picture editor, focuses on cameras FROM LATE last century, when most photographs were taken on glass plates, with cameras built of brass, leather and mahogany, designers sought to utilise 35mm film, made for the cinema, to make picture-taking more compact. Oscar Barnuck's brilliant Leica prototype of 1913 was the forerunner of a classic range against which 'miniature' cameras are judged, even today. The grainy, slow, soot and whitewash emulsions made for the the silent screen were less than complimentary to Barnuck's uncompromising engineering, though. Processing and enlarging was also pretty primitive, and it was more than 10 years before Ernst Leitz had enough confidence in the film stock available, produced chiefly by Eastman Kodak and Agfa, to begin manufacturing the Leica I in any quantity at their Wetzlar factory. German manufacturers dominated the market for 35mm and rollfilm cameras between the wars, with Leica, Contax, and Rolleiflex the last word in mechanical and optical excellence. But they were far from cheap. When Zeiss Ikon launched the Contax in 1932 it retailed for about the cost of a family car. A few were exported to Japan where they sold for the cost of a small family house. It was certainly an enduring design, the Tokyo-built Nikon S2 of 1954 is a faithful replica of the 1936 vintage Contax II. Nikon, together with other Japanese manufacturers, Canon, Pentax, and Mamiya among them, now dominate the camera market. Ironically, the modern Contax is now made in Japan. Amateur photographers now use much more 35mm film than the motion picture industry, for which it was designed - some 75m colour negative films, Pounds 280m worth this year in the UK alone. Quality cameras no longer need be super-expensive. Excellent no-nonsense point-and-shoot compacts are available for as little as Pounds 100, and bulkier, interchangeable lens SLR (single lens reflex) cameras for even less. Here are a few of the better buys: KONICA BIG MINI (Pounds 100). Robust, lightweight, no nonsense compact. SIGMA ZOOM SUPER-70 (Pounds 140). Impressive feature-laden specification in less than compact body. Borrows passive autofocus technology from pricier SLR's. A real bargain. NIKON TW ZOOM (Pounds 160). Neat, compact, versatile, with the pin sharp optics you would expect from Nikon. SAMSUNG AF ZOOM (Pounds 190). Korean import, lots of features in a sleek body. KONICA AIBORG (Pounds 210). Do not let the Star Wars appearance put you off  -won the Amateur Photographer Zoom Camera of the Year Award for 1992. CONTAX T2 (Pounds 500). If you have Pounds 500 to spend, forget the others. Beautifully engineered, with pin-sharp Zeiss lens. PENTAX K1000 (Pounds 160 with 55mm lens). Old-fashioned, but rugged no nonsense SLR. MINOLTA X-300 (Pounds 210 with 28-70mm zoom lens). Simple to use SLR. CANON EOS 1000FN (Pounds 300 with 35-80mm zoom lens). SLR with built-in flash. Quiet and light. NIKON F-801S (Pounds 590 with 50mm lens). Most of the features of the 'professional' Nikon F4 - for a lot less than half the price. Prices are a guide only; consult the weekly Amateur Photographer or the monthly Practical Photographer and What Camera? for the latest and best prices. Dealers and manufacturers have occasional special promotions. Buy a Nikon compact camera before the end of August, for example, and you can get a family ticket to EuroDisney and up to three nights accomodation in Paris - not a bad way to start using the camera.</p>

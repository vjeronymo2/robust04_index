			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has not suggested a UN discussion of the  Crimean question. This was reported on Monday [23 May] to  INTERFAX-Ukraine by the head of the information department of  the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Yuriy Sergeyev.    Commenting on the statement of a political advisor of the  Russian foreign minister Galina Sidorova that Ukraine wishes the  Crimean question to be discussed at the UN, Sergeyev expressed  surprise at how she could have come to such a conclusion.    He stressed that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy  Zlenko in a letter to the heads of state and leaders of  international organizations only drew the attention of the world  public to the complexity of the situation in Crimea.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Rocard's big bang hardly ruffles polls FRANCE'S unpopular ruling Socialist Party has recovered fractionally, according to the latest opinion poll, but still faces heavy defeat in the elections in two weeks' time. The poll, for Le Nouvel Observateur magazine, puts the Socialists up one point over the past month at 21 per cent. It attributes this to the impact of former French prime minister Michel Rocard's call for a political 'big bang' to form a new grouping of human rights supporters, moderates and ecologists. This small shift has a bigger effect on parliamentary seats, because of the France's first past-the-post constituency voting system. So the Socialists now stand to win 122 seats in the 577-seat national assembly, up from 40 in last month's Sofres poll and down from 247 now. Overall, the poll gives the opposition alliance of Gaullist RPR and centre right UDF between 396 and 423 parliamentary seats. The poll puts the UDF and RPR neck and neck, with 19 per cent of the vote each, thanks to a slight loss in RPR popularity and a small gain by the UDF. This throws fresh uncertainty over the identity of the next prime minister, who until recently seemed more likely to be a Gaullist rather than UDF member. The final choice rests with President Francois Mitterrand, who traditionally picks the prime minister from the majority grouping, though the constitution sets no formal limit on his choice.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Laurentian improves 13% to CDollars 9.5m LAURENTIAN Group, a Montreal-based financial services conglomerate, had third quarter profits of CDollars 9.5m (USDollars 7.4m), or 16 cents a share, up 13 per cent from CDollars 8.4m, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Results from the general insurance subsidiary improved. Nine months' profit was CDollars 23.8m, or 39 cents a share, down nearly 9 per cent from CDollars 26.1m, or 45 cents, a year earlier. The 1991 period included a special gain of CDollars 2.5m from the sale of a British affiliate. Nine months' revenues were CDollars 2.1bn, up 7 per cent. Corporate assets at September 30 were CDollars 14.4bn, up 5 per cent from December 31 1991. Including assets under administration, the total was CDollars 20.9bn, up 6 per cent. The gain in corporate assets was due mainly to expansion by Laurentian Bank. Teck, an internationally-owned diversified mining group, is expected to take over the Baler and Greenhills coal mines in southern British Columbia from the bankrupt Westar Mining. Teck bid CDollars 85m, with the backing of the Bank of Montreal, Westar's largest secured creditor.</p>

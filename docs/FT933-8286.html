			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Decline in empty London offices THE AMOUNT of available office space in central London has fallen by 17 per cent from its peak of 34.3m sq ft in the middle of last year, figures from property advisers DTZ Debenham Thorpe show, Vanessa Houlder writes. The figures reflect a gradual rise in demand, a sharp decline in the amount of property under construction and the effects of the City bomb in April, which forced landlords to withdraw damaged offices from the letting market and prompted tenants to relocate to new premises. In spite of this improvement the central London office market is still very depressed by historic standards. It has about 28.6m sq ft of empty space, equivalent to 23 Canary Wharf towers or 15 per cent of its total office stock. Take-up in the second quarter of this year totalled 3.1m sq ft, up 40 per cent from the first three months of the year. The largest fall in availability occured in the City, where it fell by 14 per cent over the second quarter of the year. Take-up rose by more than 140 per cent to 1.3m sq ft, helped by the relocations that resulted from the City bomb, which took up an extra 500,000 sq ft. The Health &amp; Safety Executive, a government agency, is expected to agree soon a deal to rent Rose Court, a 157,000 sq ft building in Southwark that is owned by Postel, the UK's largest pension fund. The building, which was built over the remains of Shakespeare's Rose Theatre, has been empty since completion in 1991.</p>

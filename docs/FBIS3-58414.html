			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Egon Bahr, director of the Hamburg </F> Peace Research Institute, in Hamburg, by Hero Buss in the  Cologne studio on 12 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Buss] According to news agency reports from  Washington today, U.S. President Bill Clinton in a television  interview commented on internal conflicts worldwide, such as the  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. Regarding  Bosnia, Clinton had corroborated his country's readiness in  principle to take part in NATO air raids in the event of a  continuing siege of Sarajevo, for instance. According to  reports today, however, the President expressed doubts about the  wisdom of foreign military missions in crisis centers in the  world. He is quoted as saying that it is one of the saddest  facts of the world that people slaughter one another within  their own borders.    These two statements appear to clearly contradict each  other,  and we will try to solve this contradiction in an interview with  security expert Egon Bahr of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD]. Good day, Mr. Bahr.    [Bahr] Hello, Mr. Buss.    [Buss] How do you interpret this?    [Bahr] I interpret this as the establishment of a fact,  namely, it is objectively impossible to intervene with the aim  of creating or enforcing peace, if people really intend to kill  one another within the borders of their state or their former  state. This holds true for Bosnia, Nagorno-Karabakh, southern  Sudan, and Somalia. If they absolutely intend to do so, we  cannot prevent them, unless we intervene in a way that allows us  to stifle such conflicts. However, under the aspect of  fairness and equitableness, we would then have to intervene  everywhere, not just in regions where the media or oil interests  suggest such an approach.    In the case of Yugoslavia, such an intervention would  require  500,000-800,000 men, which we do not have. To that extent, your  question is justified. The option -- which no one is really  taking seriously -- that NATO will suddenly carry out air  strikes by mandate of the United Nations is in contradiction to  this.    But I am glad he has realized this, because nothing can be  achieved with isolated air raids at Bosnia -- neither militarily  nor in the sense of creating peace.    [Buss] But, Mr. Bahr, there is still the question of what  applies in the case of Clinton -- his tough words in Brussels or  his more recent cautious statement? Would you have to guess, or  do you have any new information?    [Bahr] No, I do not have any new information. You would  have to ask the President. I think we should hope that the  statements he made in Brussels will not survive today or  tomorrow.    [Buss] Somalia and Bosnia, in particular, have reflected the  international community's impotence. Would or could it be a  solution for us to just forget our international responsibility  and to wait and see how these civil wars will develop?    [Bahr] If we are unable or unwilling to create peace by  force and to stifle a conflict, there is, first, the option to  allow it to dry out by the embargo being made watertight, so  that not a drop of oil, gasoline, or diesel, and nothing except  for medicines gets into the country, or, if we are not even able  to do this, there is, second, the option to allow the conflict  to burn out -- as terrible as this sounds.    [Buss] A few words on Bonn's policy, Mr. Bahr. Reviewing  the recent past, we see that the trend in Bonn rather is in  favor of an increasing international commitment. In view of  Clinton's recent statements, do you think that our government  should perhaps reconsider its position?    [Bahr] No, I think in this respect, Bonn's position is  correct, meaning that if the United Nations can implement what  it planned to do in 1945 when it was founded, namely, to create  global collective security, Germany must be ready to decide on a  case-by-case basis and take part.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Management Company Entertainment Group Inc. announced plans Thursday to finance  and produce at least one film directed by a graduate of USC's School of  Cinema-Television and to develop at least one student screenplay each year. The  entertainment company also plans to underwrite most of the costs of USC's  twice-yearly student film festival (24 student films will be debuted at the  inaugural festival, June 13-22), according to Jonathan D. Krane, the company's  chairman and chief executive officer. "I'm always looking to sign up young  talent," said Krane, who said he had wanted to formalize a relationship with  USC because "students (are) coming out of there knowing how to make films,  knowing how to realize their vision on the screen."

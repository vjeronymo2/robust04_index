			<p>BFN     [Text] Rival groups in Afghanistan resumed fierce battles  in Kabul this morning. Our correspondent Darestani reports from  Kabul:    [Darestani] Forces of the two conflicting sides in  Afghanistan started severe battles in the southern areas of  Kabul city this morning. In the battles, which are continuing,  the two sides fired rockets and mortars at each other's  positions, and fighter jets of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's  government bombed the joint positions of Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar and General Dostam in the south and  southeast Kabul several times.    Severe street clashes have taken place along several lines  of  contact of the conflicting forces in the southern part of Kabul  city and the forces loyal to the president are especially trying  to infiltrate the positions of the other side.    Although hospital sources in Kabul have not published the  causality figures of this battle, prolonged honking by cars  carrying the wounded to the hospitals speak of the high number  of casualties.    The severe clashes in Kabul are taking place at a time when,  according to the decisions reached by the leaders of jehadi  parties in Jalalabad and Islamabad, only four days are left  before the expiration of Borhanoddin Rabbani's presidential  term. His opponents--namely Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar,  National Salvation Front leader Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, who was  also the first president of the mojahedin government, as well as  representatives of General Dostam--have gathered in Jalalabad to  discuss the formation and institution of a government based  outside Kabul.    This is the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of  Iran,  Kabul.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The economically  developed coastal areas in China have made it a point to man  leading posts with officials from poorer western China to serve  under capable local officials so that they can learn the  expertise involved in economic operations and apply it after  they return to their native places.    This has proved to be an effective way to help develop the  economies of western China as their officials have become more  and more capable.    In recent years Gansu Province, one of the poor areas in  northwest China, has sent over 300 officials to developed areas  such as Zhejiang Province in the east and Tianjin Municipality  in the north to work for a period of time to learn from local  experience; in return, officials from the developed coastal  areas have gone to remote areas to help them develop their  economies.    The officials from Gansu have not only learned the skills of  marketing and economic operations, they have also helped to  introduce over 100 technical projects to boost the economies of  their native places.    The past 15 years of reform and opening up in China have  brought great changes to the eastern and southern parts of  China, but the northwest has made comparatively less progress  because of poor natural conditions and other factors.    Since 1991, when Jiangsu and Shaanxi Provinces first started  exchanges of officials, other provinces have followed suit, and  officials exchanges have been carried out between Beijing and  the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shandong and Shaanxi  Provinces, and Zhejiang Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region.    The exchanges involve more than 10,000 officials at various  levels.    Officials from Shandong and Jiangsu working in 59 poor  counties and cities in the west have held a dozen training  courses for over 10 million people.    They have also helped western areas set up over 250 joint  ventures which recorded 440 million yuan (about 50 million U.S.  dollars) in output value last year.    Scientists and technicians from the Tianjin Academy of  Agricultural Sciences have helped farmers and herdsmen in the  west learn vegetable storage and cross breeding.    At the same time, officials from the poor areas have their  eyes opened by the brisk market economy in the east.    People from Xinjiang have learned advanced management  techniques and helped introduce advanced equipment to their  hometowns to promote the development of the chemicals, textiles  and electronics industries, as well as agricultural production.    Meanwhile, such exchanges have promoted economic and  technical co-operation. Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, and the  Xinjiang Uygur, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Regions have signed contracts of cooperation in funds  and labor with the developed areas.    The developed areas benefit as well from the exchanges as  they receive raw materials and energy from the underdeveloped  areas.    Some political and economic analysts hold that the officials  exchanges have brought new changes in the circulation of  personnel, technology, commodities and resources between the  east and the west.</p>

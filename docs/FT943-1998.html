			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Bonds: World Bank to follow Dollars 1.5bn global issue with DM offering The World Bank yesterday launched its long-awaited Dollars 1.5bn global offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds, priced to yield nine basis points over US government bonds. The offering, the bank's first in the dollar market since September 1993, met firm demand, lead managers UBS and Lehman Brothers said, with 45 per cent of the deal sold in the US, 33 per cent in Europe, and 22 per cent in Asia Pacific. The bank intends to follow up the deal with a global D-Mark issue later this year and a further dollar global offering in the first half of 1994, officials said. 'We are tentatively considering a D-Mark global offering in the DM2bn range with a five-year maturity but this depends on market conditions and we are not ruling out a 10-year bond,' a bank official said. The D-Mark offering would be launched in October at the earliest. The bank estimates that it will raise a total of around Dollars 10bn in the 1994-95 fiscal year, which runs to the end of June. It raised Dollars 9bn in the previous fiscal year, Dollars 1bn below its initial target. Syndicate managers said the deal was a success. 'All the bonds have not been sold, but that is the nature of the market at the moment,' said one syndicate manager. However, some syndicate managers said that many of the new bonds had been bought by investors who had sold existing bond holdings. 'There was little new money around,' said one dealer. 'There were some very aggressive switch trades done by underwriters rather than outright sales in order to get the new issue sold.' The spread held at 9 basis points after the syndicate had broken. In the sterling sector, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 250m three-year offering, priced to yield 30 basis points over UK government bonds. The offering was prompted by investor demand for shorter-dated sterling bonds due to current attractive yields and a lack of comparable recent sterling issues, joint lead manager S. G. Warburg said. The bonds were sold mainly to UK and continental European investors, the lead manager said. Dealers said pricing on the deal was tight, but S. G. Warburg argued that bonds with a similar rating were trading at a yield spread of 22 to 24 basis points. The bonds maintained their spread after they had broken syndicate.</p>

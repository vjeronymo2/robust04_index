			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: A backward looking argument Sir, Dr Sally's letter (August 10) is surprising, coming from an institution which has as its goal the promotion of forward looking strategic thinking. Dr Sally's arguments relate to the past, not the future. I am not sure the stakeholders in Bayer, Hoechst and BASF would agree that Germany is today 'a conducive environment'. High wages, environmental costs which outweigh the benefits they bestow and a legislative/constitutional environment that prevents the exploitation of biotechnology - hardly a positive picture. Many observers of today's chemical landscape have suggested that the three chemical companies face equal traumas to those which ICI is already setting about tackling. It has been noticeable that only in recent years have these companies begun to deal with their sprawling bureaucracies and reduce headcounts. Even without a level playing field - equivalent electricity prices and a similar cost of capital to name only two - I would be hesitant to pick them as tomorrow's winners.

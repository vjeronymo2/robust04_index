			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Mixed demand for Italy's Y450bn multi-tranche deal The eurobond market sprang back to life yesterday, revived by Tuesday's increase in US interest rates. The dollar sector led the way, with several issuers capitalising on the recent resurgence in investor demand for short-dated US dollar paper. The biggest deal of the day, however, was Republic of Italy's long-awaited multi-tranche Y450bn offering consisting of Y125bn of 3.9 per cent three-year bonds, Y200bn of 5 per cent 10-year bonds and Y125bn of 5.5 per cent 20-year bonds. The three and 20-year portions were lead-managed by Daiwa and Nomura, while the 10-year tranche was led by Daiwa alone. Dealers reported healthy demand from Japanese retail investors for the three-year tranche and from Japanese institutions and insurers for the 20-year tranche. However, most said the performance of the 10-year tranche was disappointing, undermined in part by the large syndicate group for this tranche, which contained a number of non-Japanese houses who sold their allotments back to the lead manager soon after the syndicate broke. In the dollar sector, the Hellenic Republic launched a Dollars 500m five-year global bond via joint leads CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers. The deal is due to be priced today, with an indicated yield spread of 190-200 basis points over Treasuries. While some dealers were sceptical that Greece, with its BBB-/Baa3 credit rating (the lowest of the investment-grade ratings), would entice investors, others said the deal's generous pricing would attract decent demand. 'The main aim of this issue is to penetrate the US capital market,' said Mr Spyros Papanicolaou, head of the international banking department at the Bank of Greece. 'It is important for us to offer a good deal and get good placement, even if it costs us a little more.' Also tapping demand for short dollar paper, Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank, the Triple A rated German agricultural bank, made its eurodollar debut with Dollars 250m of 7 5/8 per cent three-year bonds via Nomura, priced to yield 15 basis points over Treasuries. Ontario Hydro also came to the three-year sector with Dollars 350m of 7 3/4 per cent bonds via CS First Boston, priced to yield 30 basis points over Treasuries. Although some traders felt the pricing was aggressive, others reported strong demand for the paper from European retail investors. Dealers expect more short to medium-dated US dollar issuance in the near term, including a Dollars 300m five-year deal today for the Japanese government-guaranteed Electric Power Development Company, with IBJ tipped as lead manager.</p>

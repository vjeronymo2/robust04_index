			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCTOBER QUAKE PROVES HARD ACT TO FOLLOW FOR S.F.'S ESTABLISHED ACT  </P> <P> Unveiling the American Conservatory Theater's 24th season last September,  Edward Hastings, the company's artistic director, promised theatergoers that  the coming months wouldn't "just startle and delight them . . . but shake and  disorient them by the unexpected. . . ."  </P> <P> When the unexpected took grim form in the Oct. 17 earthquake, Hastings' hopeful  puffery became ironic prophecy. Left in rubble was ACT's home of 23 years, the  ornate, octogenarian Geary Theater and left in doubt was the future of ACT  itself, a once-proud company that only recently had begun to restore its  reputation and recover an audience.  </P> <P> Five months later, the company finds itself in the midst of what may prove to  be a bruising period of self-examination. Architectural decisions that must be  made today will affect the kind of plays that can be produced in a restored  Geary far into the future, said ACT managing director John Sullivan. So before  any restoration decisions are made, ACT has to determine what kind of theater  company it wants to be.  </P> <P> Hastings said he would schedule a series of what he calls 'thinky-feely"  meetings, where, under the guidance of a $600-per-day professional  "facilitator" the 300 company members will air their ambitions for ACT.  </P> <P> "It's caused people here to go into spiritual lapses and re-examinations," Mike  McShane, an ACT actor, said of the quake's impact. Less obliquely, as Sullivan  put it, "the first issue is the survival of the company." The company  immediately closed the then-running show (George Coates' "Right Mind"), and  took the balance of the season on the road.  </P> <P> "We've had wildly different ideas" about the future, Hastings said. "The  question is, how much into the avant-garde do we want to go? If you're  primarily a classical company, what won't you do?  </P> <P> "Some say we should leave the walls unfinished, so we can see the bones and  muscle, and feel the strength. Others say we should get the lights and  equipment hidden behind the gold cupids -- so it looks like the perfect theater  of 1910.  </P> <P> "Then," he continued, "there is one school of avant-garde theater that believes  all actors' voices should be amplified, so directors can orchestrate the sound.  And we've been told to build a hydraulic stage, like (the one) at CalArts north  of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "But when you start talking about that, you're talking about the orchestra pit,  which brings up the subject of musicals. Do you want a company that does  musical theater? And so on." The debate seems ready to pit younger company  members, eager to use ACT's still-formidable resources for more experimental  theater, against veterans who cherish the company's traditions.  </P> <P> "A lot of us want to go in a new direction, the one we've started with 'Twelfth  Night,' " said actor McShane, a 34-year-old who's been with ACT four years.  </P> <P> Under director John C. Fletcher, the Shakespeare comedy was cast in Day-Glo  colors on a tropical isle. Performed at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre near  the Presidio, the production's inventive visual images and bouncy Caribbean  score won great praise.  </P> <P> "We don't want to do this lofty, East Coast deconstruction of the Bard," said  McShane. "We'd like to deconstruct him all right, but with a cream pie in his  face. We should tear things up with a joyous frenzy."  </P> <P> McShane wants ACT to take the same aggressive, irreverent appproach to other  writers.  </P> <P> "Why not take on American authors -- and tear them up? I mean, sure we'd all  like to do 'Nicholas Nickleby,' but, hey, why not Jack London? How about some  new young black playwrights in the Bay Area?"  </P> <P> Others aren't so sure.  </P> <P> "These points are all well taken, but I don't think they're going to change the  nature of ACT, or of the kind of theater ACT does," said actress Michael  Learned, one of many company alumni who moved on to television and film.  </P> <P> "How many theaters in the States do classics? I think there's a place for that  here," said Learned, who was in San Francisco to appear in the current ACT  production of Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood."  </P> <P> Learned, best known as Olivia on TV's "The Waltons," asserts that "ultimately,  what the theater is about is a great and philosophical question that we won't  be able to answer here."  </P> <P> Underlying the creative discussions is an economic reality: the need to gain  more subscribers and contributors without putting off current ones. Eighty  percent of present subscribers live in the suburbs outside San Francisco,  Sullivan said, and many are senior citizens with conservative tastes. The kinds  of plays they tend to like -- such as the recent "Judevine," a pastoral of  small-town New England that received tepid notices -- fail to excite the  younger, urban theatergoers.  </P> <P> McShane argues that more adventuresome work would attract support.  </P> <P> "I'm talking people who look at theater as something you just can't not go to.  People who appreciate the new breaking-up of the language, modern verse, strong  choral plays.  </P> <P> "We've got to develop these people for our audience," he said. "Otherwise, all  our subscribers are getting older and sweeter and nicer -- and gradually (the  subscription base) will decline into nothingness."  </P> <P> Since 1967, ACT has been wedded to its performance space, a landmark structure  near Union Square in downtown. Thanks to a 1975 Ford Foundation grant, ACT  bought the Geary outright, and over the years has matched its repertory to the  imposing classical style of its home.  </P> <P> Standing as a symbol of ACT's strengths during difficult days in the early  1980s -- a period of decline that ended, many believe, only with the ouster in  1986 of the company's founder, William Ball -- the Geary now represents the  huge financial and creative challenges the company faces in the 1990s.  </P> <P> The 1,500-seat theater's facade survived the 7.1 temblor unscathed, but those  walking inside found a spectacle to rival anything Andrew Lloyd Webber could  cook up: the ornamental proscenium had collapsed in eerily dramatic fashion,  dislodging the lighting grid as it fell and tumbling onto the stage and  orchestra seats. Sinews of wire, banks of plaster and shreds of curtain  stretched from ceiling to floor, presenting viewers with a four-story study in  destruction.  </P> <P> Structural damage riddled the building, forcing the closure of the then-running  show and the eviction of costume and scene shops. Estimates put restoration of  the Geary -- which was itself built to replace theaters destroyed in the 1906  earthquake -- at $15 million, Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Spared only was ACT's conservatory, which is housed along with company offices  in rented space across Geary Street.  </P> <P> Observers credit Hastings and his company with a resourceful response. Dubbing  the balance of the season the "1990 World Tour," ACT arranged use of five other  theaters in San Francisco, and redesigned its productions to fit them.  </P> <P> Throughout, said playwright Anthony Clarvoe, whose "Pick Up Ax" was then in a  conservatory workshop, "they've done one really proud thing: They haven't laid  anybody off."  </P> <P> ACT's resilience came at a price, however: Continuing the season in rented  space will cost $1 million both this year and next, Sullivan said. Even before  the earthquake, the company was committed to raising one-fourth of its  $10-million annual budget from donations and grants.  </P> <P> Some of the emergency money will come from the region's Arts Recovery Fund,  created by the National Endowment for the Arts to raise $2.2 million for Bay  Area artists stricken by the quake. The fund, which has already distributed  more than $1.4 million from firms and local governments in the Bay Area, has  earmarked 40% of its proceeds to ACT's operating expenses. To help raise the  balance, the California Arts Council recently undertook a statewide fundraising  campaign that asks the public to contribute to the recovery fund. As of last  week, $3,500 had been contributed. But solutions that might seem obvious to  people in other cities -- such as selling ACT-owned property adjoining the  theater to a developer -- are more problematic here.  </P> <P> "We've had suggestions that we build a big building on top of the theater,"  Sullivan said, evoking methods that are used by high-rise developers in Los  Angeles and New York. "But this is not a pro-development city. I think the  political environment is not quite the same as in Los Angeles." Difficult as  the financial problems are, they are compounded by the creative quandary that  has long faced the company. Choosing the sort of plays that should be performed  during ACT's enforced vagrancy and planning the new form of the Geary demands a  clarity of vision that ACT has had difficulty articulating in recent years.  </P> <P> Ball, who founded ACT in 1965, conceived a repertory company that would combine  its stage work with professional training for actors and directors. Under his  early leadership, ACT emerged as the pre-eminent theatrical company in the Bay  Area, and won a special Tony Award as an outstanding regional theater in 1979.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, however, Ball's management became strained and misdirected. Amid  allegations of financial impropriety, the company ran up a $1.5 million  deficit, and pared down its productions to odd, spare plays that alienated  audiences and contributors.  </P> <P> ACT trustees finally forced Ball's departure in 1986, replacing him with  Hastings, also a founding member of the company. Measured and professorial,  Hastings steered ACT back to some respectability, reducing the deficit and  stressing competent productions of familiar plays.  </P> <P> By the beginning of the 1989-90 season, officials said, the deficit had been  cut to $320,000; subscriptions, which had fallen to 11,000 in 1986, stood at  18,000.  </P> <P> However, many in the theater community found the troupe's work uninspired. Some  questioned whether San Francisco's leading theater company should be devoting  itself to such community theater staples as "A Christmas Carol" and "A Funny  Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum."  </P> <P> With ACT forced into smaller theaters during its exile, actor McShane suggests  more experimental works could be sustained.  </P> <P> Hastings demurred. "We're not going to be able to take greater risks," he said.  "As I'm envisioning it, we'll be in smaller theaters, but for longer runs, so  the number of tickets remains the same."  </P> <P> As far as the Geary goes, Hastings said, "it is one of those splendid old  theaters that has a special relationship with the audience -- and with the  play. I'm willing to listen to other ideas, but I think it is perfectly suited  to classical plays."  </P> <P> David Sweet contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P></p>

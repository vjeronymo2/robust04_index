			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Calls U.S. Action `Ignorant'"] </F>   [Text] China denounced the United States yesterday for  having breached international norms by unilaterally slashing  China's textile quotas.    "The U.S. announcement on January 6 of its intention to  reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports by 25-35 per cent was  unreasonable, flimsy and in total ignorance of international and  bilateral agreements," pointed out Li Zhongzhou, a deputy  director general for international relations of the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).    The U.S. move has run counter to the Uruguay Round of talks  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which  wound up last month with a new agreement to phase out quota  restrictions on textiles within 10 years, he told China Daily  yesterday.    "We cannot help doubting the sincerity of the U.S. in  honouring multilateral agreements, with its steep rise in quota  restrictions against China shortly after the birth of the Gatt  Uruguay package," he said.    The U.S. decision has also trampled on the Multi-Fibre  Arrangement of which both China and the U.S. are signatories, he  explained.    The arrangement stipulates that the quota imposed by an  importing nation or region on any textile product must not be  less than its actual import volume during the previous year.    And the importer must increase the amount of imports under  quota management by at least 6 per cent per year.    Li said the U.S. practically has not increased quotas for  Chinese textile imports. The latest massive reduction "speaks  volumes about the fact that the U.S. is binding other nations,  but not itself, to international agreements.    He said the U.S. also has ignored the eighth provision of  the  Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which rules that an importer should  first consult with an exporter if the former claims illicit  exports from the latter. If the two sides can't reach a  solution, they should resort to the Textile Surveillance Body  (TSB). "The U.S. apparently has not complied with this  practice," Li said.    He said the U.S. lacks sufficient proof for its charges  against China's "massive illicit transshipments."    "And whatever proof it has, the U.S. can hardly justify its  reduction by as much as 25-35 per cent," he asserted.    It is obvious that the U.S. is seeking trade protectionism  under the veneer of stopping illicit transshipments, he added.    He also blamed the U.S. for being unwilling to join hands  with China to clamp down on such illegal activities.    He said China had hoped to set up a strict inspection system  in co-operation with the U.S. to combat the problem, but the  U.S. has insisted on its right to slash China's quotas  unilaterally.    "The U.S. is not ready to co-operate in the least sense." he  said.    He urged the U.S. to revoke its decision and return to the  negotiation table to find a satisfying solution.    "Otherwise, China will be forced to submit the dispute to  the  arbitration of the TSB, and respond with retaliatory measures,"  he said.</p>

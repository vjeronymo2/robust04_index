			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM long-term debt rating cut by Moody's INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, for decades the most blue chip of all US manufacturing companies, yesterday suffered the indignity of having its long-term debt downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating agency. Moody's cut its senior debt rating from Aaa, the highest possible ranking, to Aa2, on the grounds that its 'credit quality over the longer term will be adversely affected by shifting customer requirements and intense competitive pressures'. The blow is likely to be more psychological than practical since the company's rating is still high and Moody's stressed that 'IBM remains an exceptionally strong credit'. However, analysts said the move was a further sign that IBM, which used to dominate the global computer industry, was a diminished force facing strong pressures from smaller and nimbler rivals - which it is now trying to emulate through a management shake-up and decentralisation. The first downgrading of IBM's debt occurred last year at the hands of Duff &amp; Phelps, another rating agency, but Wall Street tends to pay more attention to the views of Moody's and Standard and Poor's. S&amp;P retains its top rating on IBM - AAA - but has had the company on 'negative outlook' since last August. It has said in the past that a downgrade would be possible if IBM failed to improve profits when it shipped its new line of mainframe computers, a process which began in late 1990. IBM said it was disappointed with Moody's action but believed the impact on its worldwide financing requirements would be minimal. The company said that in seven of the 10 years from 1980 to 1990 it had been the most profitable company among the Fortune 500. Although 1991 had been a difficult year, it had earned pre-tax profits of nearly Dollars 4bn. It had also cut its operational expense and gained additional financial stability through growth in software, rentals, financing and services. However, Moody's said it believed that 'IBM's competitive environment, and its own necessary remedial actions to adapt to it, will continue to induce volatility in its operating performance, and that overall returns and margins will stabilise at lower levels than those IBM has historically reported'. The company's Prime-1 short-term rating in the commercial paper market, where IBM is an important player, is not affected.</p>

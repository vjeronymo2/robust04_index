			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TURPIN TIME NO LONGER MEANS DINNER TIME  </P> <P> Harvey Grant leaned into the crowd surrounding Mel Turpin's locker and posed  this provocative question:  </P> <P> "Do y'all know what time it is?"  </P> <P> Everyone knew.  </P> <P> "Turpin Time," came the loud and clear answer from his teammates.  </P> <P> Grant liked the group response so much, he tried it again. And so it went, for  the 30 minutes or so it takes the Bullets to shower and dress and entertain  inquiring sportswriters. That it sounded a lot like a pep rally should be no  surprise. The Bullets had beaten Milwaukee, 97-91, to close out a five-game  losing streak Tuesday night that might have been six except for the unlikely  presence of one Mel Turpin, who used to look more like two Mel Turpins.  </P> <P> There were more cheers out on the floor, too, when the slumbering Cap Centre  crowd erupted into a chant of "Mel, Mel, Mel." That was after Turpin had  stuffed Jack Sikma in the closing minutes, his third block of the fourth  quarter, to go with three rebounds and five points.  </P> <P> "When the fans responded like that, it gave everybody a lift," said Mark  Alarie. "We kind of went, 'Wow.' He blocks Sikma's shot. He gets big rebounds.  It was fun to watch him out there."  </P> <P> OK, Turpin Time. For most of Mel-Mel-Mel's life, Turpin Time has been marked by  the sound of the dinner bell. If he seemed to be the hungriest player on the  court Tuesday night, that's only because he was. This is a guy who had eaten  his way out of the league, forcing him into exile last season in Spain (yeah,  he liked the food there, too) and back home for one last chance.  </P> <P> The Bullets, in desperate need of a big man, were not looking for someone quite  that big, however. When he came to summer rookie camp, Turpin, who is  6-foot-11, weighed in at 286. And that was before lunch. The Bullets put him on  a weight program -- lifting weight, not gaining it.  </P> <P> "I'm 259 now," he said. "And I feel great."  </P> <P> The last time he was under 260, he says, was in college.  </P> <P> When asked what year, he smiled. "Come on. This is a new year," he said.  </P> <P> For the Bullets, actually, it looks a lot like last year. It's pretty much the  same cast, adding rookie Tom Hammonds, who has done little to impress so far,  and Turpin. The Bullets play with desire and will and win more games than they  should. But, Tuesday night, they were tired. Just home from a six-game,  eight-day trip to the Far West, they didn't figure to be too vital. And as the  third quarter came to a close, they were losing ground to a physical Milwaukee  team that will wear you down.  </P> <P> Coach Wes Unseld had basically run out of options. He looked down the bench,  saw Turpin (could he miss him?) and sent him into the game, Turpin's first  minutes at home. A few of the fans noticed. Maybe the Milwaukee Bucks did, too,  but maybe not.  </P> <P> "I was hoping he would maintain for a few minutes until John (Williams) got  some rest," Unseld said. "It was no stroke of genius. I didn't know what else  to do."  </P> <P> To that point, Turpin had played 24 minutes the entire season and hadn't  exactly worked his way into Unseld's heart. For Unseld, it was an act of  desperation, not an act of faith. But, then, before everyone's eyes was the  new, lean and mean Turpin on the break, getting a hoop. There he was  rebounding. He blocked a Ricky Pierce layup, starting a fast break. He took the  ball on the wing, faked Sikma into the air, and drove for a dunk. The place  went a little nuts.  </P> <P> It was a one-point Bullets lead, at 88-87, when Turpin blocked a Sikma shot for  the second time, preserving an advantage the Bullets never lost to put their  record at 6-6. Turpin played 13 minutes in a row. Sikma, who scored eight in  the third quarter, failed to score in the fourth.  </P> <P> "I wasn't winded," Turpin said. "I was sweating, though. The weight has always  been my problem, and now I feel like a different person out there.  </P> <P> "I knew I had to stay loose, to be ready to go in whenever Wes called. But I  was more loose than I thought I was."  </P></p>

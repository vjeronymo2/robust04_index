			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    On 10 March, Conservative Party presidential candidate  Andres  Pastrana Arango suggested breaking off relations with Cuba again  because Cuba supports guerrilla and dynamite attacks in  Colombia. Pastrana emphatically said: "Colombia should not have  ties with Cuba as long as Fidel Castro's government continues to  support the National Liberation Army, which kills our leaders,  as in the case of late Senate Vice President Dario Londono,  blows up oil pipelines, and sows terror." Pastrana noted that:  "Given the crisis Cubans are facing, it is important Fidel  Castro shows he is willing to facilitate an opening to  democracy. That is what Latin America expects from him." (Santa  Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 17A)    On 11 March, Liberal Party presidential candidate Humberto  de  la Calle Lombana stated he has always tried to establish the  central points of his campaign and the differences and  similarities with other candidates' campaigns. He added that he  has not and will never resort to personal attacks. De la Calle  said he does not agree with the idea that the runner-up should  automatically become the vice president because Colombia needs a  harmonious relation between the president and vice president. De  la Calle emphasized that: "It is not a matter of Samper or de la  Calle, Colombia is what is really at stake." (Santa Fe de Bogota  Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 11 Mar 94)</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt left out of the continental upswing GERMAN equities were left out of the firmer continental trend. Paris was shut for a holiday, but French stocks traded in London were lifted by another cut in interest rates, with the French segment of the Eurotrack 100 adding 1.4 per cent, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended its downturn to a fifth consecutive trading day as another forecast from Bayer illustrated the weakening trend of the German economy. Bayer, which once expected maintained earnings in 1992 - and only recently forecast a slight fall - said yesterday that its profits would be 'clearly below' those of 1991. The shares fell DM8.50 or 3.2 per cent to DM254.50. Turnover stayed quiet after Friday's DM3.2bn. Other big cyclicals took their cue from Bayer, with BMW down DM11.50 to DM473.50 and Volkswagen DM5.90 lower at DM264.10, and the DAX index dropped another 19.75, or 1.3 per cent to 1,472.57. Mr Tony Cox of Kleinwort Benson, who had indicated a 10 per cent profit drop for Bayer last week and had hoped for a maintained dividend, thought it wiser now to pencil in another DM2 drop in earnings to DM23.50 a share, from DM28 in 1991, and perhaps a dividend cut from DM13 to DM12 a share. But he was still inclined to believe that German chemicals will enjoy their usual seasonal upturn in the next few months, in advance of the annual dividend season. In engineering, where profit margins are also threatened by the higher D-Mark, Linde lost DM18.50 to DM661, a two-day loss of DM32.50, while MAN dropped DM7.50 to DM243. MAN holds its annual press conference tomorrow, while Linde is due to report nine-month sales and orders soon. MILAN was quiet for the first half-hour but then resumed its upward trend on buy orders from domestic funds and from the banks. However, dealers warned that the rally might slow in the next few days on profit-taking or selling linked to the forthcoming call options expiry. The Comit index rose 7.22 to 446.25 in turnover estimated at slightly less than Friday's high L313.9bn. Financials and telecoms led the market higher. Fondiaria rose L1,350 or 5.1 per cent to L27,700 while Stet added L28 to L1,480. AMSTERDAM was lifted by a firmer dollar in the second half of the session. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 higher at 102.1. The stronger dollar helped DSM to recover Fl 2.60 to Fl 79.80 after its recent weakness while Akzo gained Fl 2.50 to Fl 127.80 ahead of its third-quarter results, due today. Elsevier added another 60 cents to Fl 112.60 following Friday's news of revised merger terms with Reed of the UK. ZURICH, sometimes accused of slavishly following Frankfurt, continued to assert the independence it has shown this year with a firmer dollar improving sentiment in the industrial segment of the market while banks and insurers were neglected. The SMI index added 10.5 to 1,921.6 as Roche certificates, SFr50 higher at SFr3,730, topped the active list. Ciba-Geigy registered, SFr4 higher at SFr597, were second. MADRID closed weak, with the general index 0.69 lower at 197.78. Turnover totalled 7.67 billion pesetas of which the oil blue-chip, Repsol, made up a third. STOCKHOLM saw strong demand from abroad for Astra. Its A shares were up SKr8 at SKr576, while the B shares rose SKr10 to SKr558. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 6.3 to 713.2 in turnover of SKr454m after Friday's SKr338m. HELSINKI resumed its rise with the Hex index climbing 6.9 to 758.2 in turnover up from FM58.0m on Friday to FM289.0m. Industrials rose 0.6 per cent and service shares by 2.0 per cent. ISTANBUL dropped 7.2 per cent on its return from a three-day national holiday, the market index closing 261.92 lower at 3,380.78 on heavy sales after a deposit rate increase by Ziraat Bank, Turkey's largest state-owned bank. Monthly inflation jumped to a seven-month high of 7.4 pct in September. October figures will be released on Wednesday. VIENNA's ATX index eased 3.89 to 794.59 in quiet trading. Creditanstalt preferred fell Sch4 to Sch435, unmoved by news the government wants to sell a 20 per cent stake in the company to General Electric of the US; but the ordinaries rose Sch10 to Sch470.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 2                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100**      1026.55   1026.69   1026.26   1027.22 FT-SE Eurotrack 200**      1084.96   1085.95   1086.78   1087.48  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100**      1027.58   1028.75   1030.86   1032.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200**      1089.85   1089.41   1093.21   1095.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 30    Oct 29    Oct 28    Oct 27    Oct 26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1028.47   1025.26   1028.09   1038.79   1038.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1090.07   1086.76   1091.64   1100.79   1104.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1032.99; 200 - 1097.89 Low/day: 100 - 1025.63  200 - 1084.96 ** Part.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

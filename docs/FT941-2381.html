			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors bank on decisive Italian poll  -International When Italy's voters go to the polls on March 27 and 28, they will have a vast array of parties - on the right, left and centre - from which to choose and a new electoral system to try out, consisting of a mixture of first past the post and proportional representation. For the Italian government bond market, however, the primary concern is whether a stable government can be formed. Bond market investors want to see a government which has a working majority, and which has a commitment to tackling the budget deficit, keeping inflation under control, and pushing ahead with the privatisation programme. Economists point out that on paper, at least, the economic fundamentals and background to the Italian government bond market look good. Italy was one of the best performing government bond markets in local currency terms last year and investors piled in for the high yields and scope for capital gains as interest rates declined. However, as with most of the other European government bond markets, 1994 has not been so rosy. Italy has witnessed a sharp back-up in yields - from 8.5 per cent on 10-year bonds in early February 1994 to 9.8 per cent in early March. This reflects the general unease over US inflationary prospects, heavy selling by big investors, such as the US-based hedge funds, irritation at the slow pace of easing by the Bundesbank, and political uncertainty at home. Yet, as Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, points out, Italian inflation remains well under control with an annual rate of 4.2 per cent in January and February. 'The fall in inflation since 1990 has undoubtedly been facilitated by the recession, but the labour market reforms of the past two years should mean that inflation stays low despite economic recovery,' he says, forecasting an average inflation rate of 3.7 per cent in 1994 and 3.1 per cent in 1995. On the budget deficit, Mr Marco Pianelli, southern European economist at Nomura Research Institute Europe, argues that due to lower financing costs this should 'come well below the L144,200bn target, even in the absence of supplementary measures.' Mr Jessop points out that on the debt front, Italy is expected to over-fund in 1994 by L30,000bn in order to take into account the big jump in bond redemptions, from L78,000bn in 1994 to L178,000bn in 1995, and says this implies net issuance in 1994 of around L175,000bn which he believes should be manageable. Meanwhile, the privatisation programme is expected to generate funds which will be used to repay debt. There are concerns that some of the proceeds could be diverted to other parts of the state holding companies rather than used to pay off debt, but even so, Mr Jouni Kokko, European economist at SG Warburg Securities, says these privatisation proceeds 'should make a significant contribution to pay off debt rather than fund current expenditure'. As inflation comes down, and as the Bundesbank continues to cut interest rates (albeit at a snail's pace over recent months) there should be scope for the Bank of Italy to lower its key discount rate, and for the bond market to rally. Mr Kokko is forecasting a 10-year yield spread of 230 basis points over German bunds in 12 months' time, against the recent 310 basis points. However, the difficulty lies in predicting the short-term scenario. The uncertainty comes from whether or not a workable majority can form after the election, with many economists admitting that they are unsure whether there will be a centre-left coalition or a centre-right alliance, or a hung parliament. 'Picking the winner of the Italian election . . . is a mug's game,' says Mr Jessop. 'It doesn't matter what it is, just as long as it's a decisive majority,' says Mr Andre da Silva, bond strategist at PaineWebber. If a stable coalition forms quickly, the bond market ought to rally strongly. Mr Pianelli at Nomura points out that 'the environment is very good for the bond market, so the market would fly if it got a stable coalition', such as one formed between the socialist PDS and centre parties, or by the right wing parties (Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the National Alliance) and the centre parties. If the PDS managed to form a stable coalition and it kept Mr Ciampi as prime minister, the market would be even happier. However, both Mr Pianelli of Nomura and Mr Kokko of SG Warburg Securities believe this particular scenario of an easily-formed coalition is highly unlikely. 'None of the three big alliances is likely to get a majority, and even if they do, they will be fragile coalitions. After the election there will probably be a lot of horse-trading and it will be difficult to find a sensible coalition,' says Mr Kokko. Against such a background, the bond market is likely to remain nervous and volatile and the spread over German government bonds will probably widen initially.</p>

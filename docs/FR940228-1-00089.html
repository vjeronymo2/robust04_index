			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if it has had a decrease in total net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets at the end of its latest fiscal year of such significance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, if continued, would result in a ratio current assets to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current liabilities of less than 1:1. Under this proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary could consider the effect of extraordinary gains or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into consideration the cumulative effect of a change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such a change results in a more accurate representation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's financial position in accordance with generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted accounting principles. For purposes of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, the Secretary could exclude unrealized gains and losses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on investments that have been reported as changes in unrestricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net assets. The standard was revised to reflect the changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brought about with the issuance of FASB 117 and in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide parity with the for-profit institutions. The concept of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net worth, as it applies to profit-seeking entities, does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist for a not-for-profit entity. Upon implementation of FASB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 117, fund accounting will no longer be used for colleges and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universities, but these entities will adopt a format that is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to the format for-profit entities have been using. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``fund balance'' will no longer apply, but will be replaced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total net assets, divided into unrestricted, temporarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted and permanently restricted assets. For institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required to implement FAS 117 prior to the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations, the regulations applying to nonprofits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently found in 34 CFR 668.13(c), ``the institution shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a deficit current unrestricted fund balance'', will remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect until the institution adopts FAS 117.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary requests comments on whether the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should determine a nonprofit institution to be financially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible even if it does not meet these requirements if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has an acceptable ``bond rating''. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests that a type of acceptable bond rating may be a current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general obligation or general obligation equivalent debt rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (because such a rating is backed by the full resources of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution) by a nationally recognized debt rating organization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Secretary, that is at least investment grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that a public institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible only if the institution has its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of the State, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an equivalent government. The Secretary is aware that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting principles for public institutions differ from those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for for-profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comments on other acceptable measures of a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial responsibility that take the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting principles into account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

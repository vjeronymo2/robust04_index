In an interview with  IRNA the source added that the decision was taken at a meeting  between al-'Attiyah and the visiting Nigerian Petroleum and  Mineral Resources Secretary Chief Don Obot Etiebet in Doha on  Wednesday. Etiebet is on a tour of OPEC member countries to  shore up support for production cut and price boost.    Without the cooperation of OPEC member countries in cutting  production a price hike would be impossible, said the source.    So far Russia, Yemen and Syria have announced their  readiness  to cooperate with OPEC, but Britain and Norway, two major  suppliers of crude have refused to negotiate and cooperate with  OPEC, noted the same source. The price of OPEC basket of seven  crudes stood at dlrs 13.36 a barrel Wednesday, compared with  dlrs 13.39 the previous day.</p>

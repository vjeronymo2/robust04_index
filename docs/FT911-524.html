			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Continental/Pirelli The ousting of Mr Horst Urban by his own supervisory board looks like a remarkable victory for Pirelli. More significantly, though, it might just prove an important turning point in German attitudes to takeovers. No one should think the floodgates are about to open. Indeed, if anything, the immediate lesson lies in the powerful influence of the German banks, given that Mr Urban's days were obviously numbered once he lost the confidence of Deutsche Bank. On the other hand, the events of the last 48 hours may send a growing number of German businesses scuttling to their financial advisers in search of a better bid defence than the traditional dead bat. But, as the equally spectacular bid for Societe Generale de Belgique by Mr Carlo De Benedetti showed, that does not automatically ensure a warmer welcome for outsiders. This is where the European Community's takeover code could perform a useful role. It is too early to be sure whether the resumed Conti/Pirelli negotiations will lead to a full merger, though this seems the probable outcome. It is quite another matter whether the combined group will be any better able to tackle the severe problem of overcapacity in the world tyre industry. Shareholders on both sides have been warned.</p>

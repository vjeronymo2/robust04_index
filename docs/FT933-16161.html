			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Publicity led to break-up of GEC talks with BAe TALKS between GEC and British Aerospace on combining defence interests were called off by BAe at the weekend because of press publicity, it emerged yesterday. A joint statement said 'discussions on fuller collaboration have ceased'. However, neither company ruled out the possibility of talks being resumed. The Ministry of Defence, which has occasionally opposed GEC's expansion, said yesterday it was unlikely to object to a deal. Its main concern was to avoid dependence on foreign suppliers for significant equipment. One official said it was principally a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry. Both companies had dismissed as 'speculation' a Sunday Times story which said BAe and GEC were merging their defence interests. Behind yesterday's short statement lay disagreement on how far the confidential talks had progressed. BAe said talks had been going on since the company was privatised in 1985. 'This certainly wasn't the first time, and it probably won't be the last,' the company said. It played down the significance of the talks, saying they had 'not moved perceptibly for weeks'. The fact of their disclosure had put BAe in 'a messy situation'. BAe restructuring, including the sale of several businesses, meant a deal with GEC was not in shareholders' interests at present. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has made no secret of his desire to do a deal. GEC attacked the weekend coverage as irresponsible and destructive. It added 'the important thing for our defence industry is our relationship with BAe'. Neither company would comment on the nature of the deal which had been discussed. However, it is believed to have involved putting all or part of their defence interests into a joint venture similar to that which GEC has with Alsthom of France in power generation.

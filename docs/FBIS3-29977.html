			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  ease restrictions on visits to North Korea by South Korean  businessmen in view of recent developments in the North Korean  nuclear issue, officials said Monday. The government would also  relax regulations for South Korean businessmen wishing to set up  pilot business ventures in North Korea if the nuclear problem  was resolved, they said.    Seoul is studying a revision of its stance on inter-Korean  economic cooperation to allow business contacts "when  South-North dialogue makes significant progress." Until now, it  had maintained it would allow inter-Korean business contacts  only "when a breakthrough in the nuclear issue was found." The  new government policy would represent a considerable relaxation  on other pre-conditions that call for Pyongyang's return to the  Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty, acceptance of the  International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] ad hoc and special  inspections, an inter-Korean agreement on simultaneous  inspections of each other's nuclear facilities and reactivation  of the South-North joint nuclear commission.    In addition, the government plans to relax conditions for  South Korean businesses to establish small, pilot ventures in  North Korea. Seoul had said it would only approve such ventures  after the two Koreas conducted mutual inspections of their  nuclear facilities and Pyongyang accepted special inspections by  the IAEA.    The proposed changes are being contemplated to actively  promote economic cooperation with Pyongyang while maintaining  Seoul's original policy of linking inter-Korean economic  cooperation with the nuclear issue. If the current government  policy was maintained, it is possible that inter-Korean economic  cooperation would be delayed considerably, one official said.  "The government has decided to apply its economic cooperation  policy flexibly while watching North Korea's attitude closely,"  he said, asking for anonymity.    The official stressed, however, that the government would  not  separate the economic and nuclear issues because South Korea was  committed to going along with its allies on the nuclear problem.  Overall economic cooperation with North Korea could be possible  only after suspicions about North Korea's nuclear intentions  were cleared up, he added.</p>

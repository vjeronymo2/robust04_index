			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SHUNS ROLE OF CENSOR OVER ARTS FUNDED BY U.S.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration told Congress today it would not seek to control the  content of art supported with federal tax dollars. The decision seemed sure to  anger right-wing Republicans.  </P> <P> Controversy over whether to restrict content of federally financed art received  extensive publicity last year because of two photographic exhibits supported by  money from the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included depictions of sadomasochism and  homoerotic acts. Another, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar of  urine.  </P> <P> As a result, this year's spending bill contained restrictions, inspired by Sen.  Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), on financing obscene works and gave a definition of  obscene within limits set by the Supreme Court. The restrictions were effective  for one year only.  </P> <P> In submitting legislation today to extend the existence of the arts endowment  another five years, starting Oct. 1, the Bush Administration chose not to  include "content restrictions" similar to those that apply this year.  </P> <P> John F. Frohnmayer, chairman of the arts endowment, spelled out the  Administration's reasoning in testimony before the House Education and Labor  subcommittee on post-secondary education.  </P> <P> He said the content restrictions in effect this year caused "much concern and  confusion" within the arts community.  </P> <P> "After much careful thought and discussion, it is our conclusion that the  legislation proposed here which contains no content restrictions, along with  measures discussed earlier, will best serve the American public," Frohnmayer  said.  </P> <P> The other measures mentioned by Frohnmayer include ways to improve the system  for evaluating grants. The NEA will develop a "grid" to assure that all  geographic areas are represented and that as many cultures as possible are  represented. The makeup of the evaluation panels also will be diversified.  </P> <P> "Will these modifications in the panel process eliminate controversy?" he  asked. "Probably not. I do not see as a desirable goal that the art which the  federal government supports be so bland that no one even notices it."  </P> <P> Anne G. Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, which opposes  content restrictions, said she was pleased by Frohnmeyer's comments but  cautious about whether the Administration will succeed in keeping NEA free of  such restrictions.  </P></p>

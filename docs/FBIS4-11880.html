			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, 2 Apr--Their highnesses and  excellencies, the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation  Council, ended their second ministerial council working session  today under the chairmanship of the Saudi foreign minister, His  Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. [passage omitted]    His Highness said, "The nature of this meeting is to  implement decisions reached during the summit meeting of their  majesties and highnesses, the leaders of the Council's states.  Accordingly, the decisions reached at the summit were reviewed  during the meeting, be they security, economic, or political  decisions."    His Highness said the meeting at the outset concentrated on  the summit's decisions and ways of implementing them, and thus  on political evaluations, political topics, GCC states' ties  with their neighbors, and on the international effort that would  be launched.    Asked about incongruity in the GCC's political stands, His  Highness said, "That is what we hear in the press, but at the  summit-level meetings or at those at the foreign ministers  level, we have not noticed any incongruity between GCC states."    Responding to a question on Iraq's attempts to split the  Arab  front, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said, "I did not mention splits  in my address. I said that Iraq was trying to come through with  justifications, particularly humanitarian ones."    He added that Iraq wanted to reached its aims of not  complying with the Security Council resolutions, particularly in  its dispute with Kuwait on the demarcation of borders with  Kuwait and on ending Iraq's claims on Kuwait. That effort had  to be confronted and shown for what it was.    His Highness said, "We sympathize with the Iraqi people and  their plight, but what is standing as an obstacle to improvement  of the conditions of the Iraqi people is the Iraqi Government  and not international resolutions."    He said that the international resolutions would solve the  Iraqi people's tragedy. But Iraq was trying--through them--to  get through to the Arab countries emotionally by telling them  that the continuing sanctions were harming the Iraqi people.  However, Iraq wanted to exploit this in order not to comply  with the resolutions, which were of utmost importance for the  Arab sphere, to Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties. If the basic condition was  carried out, the whole picture toward Iraq would change, and  Iraq would gain international support.</p>

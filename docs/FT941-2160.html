			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Tenneco names new Case head Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, has named a veteran of Honeywell's European restructuring programme to head JI Case, Tenneco's largest division. Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, a 53-year-old from Vichy, France, will succeed Mr Edward Campbell as Case's president. Mr Campbell will retire on March 31. Mr Rosso's appointment is seen as a sign that Case is about to proceed with an extensive rationalisation of its European operations, where its construction and agricultural equipment lines have been battered by competition and shrinking markets. Case has just completed the first year of a three-year, Dollars 920m restructuring programme designed to rescue the equipment manufacturer from losses of Dollars 1bn in 1992. To date, the bulk of Case's rationalisations and plant closings have been in North America. Announcing Mr Rosso's appointment, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said 'a substantial amount of restructuring steps remain across all of Case's worldwide operations'. Twenty-five per cent of Case's business originates in Europe, mostly in the UK, France, and Germany. Mr Mead, who remains chairman of Case, confirmed rationalisations were expected beyond the previously-announced closure of the Neuss tractor plant in mid-1996.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernst Uhrlau, head of the Hamburg Office for </F> the Protection of the Constitution, by Nana Brink and Ludwig  Rademacher; place and date not given: "`Uniform Movement'"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Are we being deceived by the impression  that the cooperation between German right-wing extremists, who  have so far been rather divided, has achieved a new quality?    [Uhrlau] No, your impression is correct. Right-wing  extremism in Germany is about to assume the character of a  movement.    [FOCUS] What does that mean?    [Uhrlau] The point is the networking of right-wing extremist  activities. Until the early nineties, we only knew this  phenomenon on the left-wing extremist scene. Networking means  that the individual groups remain independent and that political  hierarchies are avoided. Politically active right-wing  extremists hitherto longed for hierarchy and leadership. Now  they are taking advantage of state-of-the-art communications  technologies to mobilize people from different groups for action.    [FOCUS] Has your office underestimated the neo-Nazi who is  equipped with a personal computer [PC], fax, and mobile  telephone?    [Uhrlau] No, we have not underestimated him. However their  position is different today and will continue to change. The  traditional right-wing extremists of the eighties were much more  at variance. Comprehensive media such as mail boxes and  information telephone lines have sprouted tremendously over the  past two years. While the "old" right-wing extremism remained  static, so to speak, the protagonists of the new right-wing  extremist tendencies, tactics, and strategies are using  inexpensive modern communications technologies. After all, one  can not forbid anybody the use of a fax, a PC, or mobile  telephone.    [FOCUS] Can you give us an example?    [Uhrlau] It was only through mobile communications that the  right-wing extremists were able -- as they had successfully done  before in 1992 -- to redirect a demonstration on the occasion of  the death day of "Deputy Fuehrer" Hess to the city of Fulda, in  Hesse, in August 1993.    [FOCUS] Which ended in a political and a media spectacle.    [Uhrlau] The right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis are  deliberately banking on the media to transmit their message.  What is actually conveyed is of secondary importance -- the  point is that they are present. I am greatly worried to see  that some neo-Nazis have been idolized as "personalities of  modern history" via the media. The media bear a special  responsibility in this connection.    [FOCUS] After right-wing tumults, let us now talk about the  intellectualization at the right margin. What about the  Deutsches Rechtsbuero [German Legal Office], which offers legal  advice to neo-Nazis?    [Uhrlau] That is part of the network. Via mail boxes one  can also access court decisions, appeals for demonstrations and  actions or the banning of such actions. The activities by  right-wing extremist students are gaining in importance in this  connection.    [FOCUS] Are right-wing extremist graduates getting ready for  a march through the institutions?    [Uhrlau] We know that such plans exist in individual right-  leaning fraternities. The difference is that such groups do not  resort to Nazi patterns of justification but to the classic  models of anti-democratic thinking such as Carl Schmitt and the  Italian elite theorists. This can be found, for example in  JUNGE FREIHEIT [YOUNG FREEDOM], which has set out to become a  "TAGESZEITUNG [far left Berlin daily] of the right." This  development is also a result of the fact that right-leaning  high-school leavers entering the universities are finding the  political field there lying fallow.    [FOCUS] And their objective is to march through the  institutions?    [Uhrlau] If one understands oneself as a movement, there is  either the parliamentary or the extra-parliamentary approach.  The path into the institutions requires a strong representation  in parliament. According to this concept, it is necessary to go  into the institutions -- just as was tried by the generation of  '68.    [FOCUS] Are you in favor of a new radicals decree?    [Uhrlau] No, the existing instruments are sufficient.</p>

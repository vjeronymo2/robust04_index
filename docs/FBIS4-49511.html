			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 KYODO -- A group of Japanese lawyers  lodged a formal protest with the Japanese Embassy in Beijing on  Friday [6 May] demanding the resignation of Japanese Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano over his remarks on World War II.    The delegation led by Shigemitsu Oda protested Nagano's  statement published Wednesday in the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper  that Japan's involvement in World War II was "not a war of  aggression" and the Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication."    The lawyers are on a mission to investigate Chinese war  victims and the human rights situation in China.    Nagano retracted his remarks at a press conference Friday.</p>

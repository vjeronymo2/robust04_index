			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / French industrial output falls 4.5% THE French national statistics office, Insee, yesterday announced that the country's industrial output fell in November by 4.5 per cent, a sharp drop that will further entrench economic recovery as the main issue in the country's March election, David Buchan reports from Paris. The exceptional decline was largely due to special factors causing a 12 per cent fall across the range of energy production, including a refinery explosion limiting oil output. The Bank of France intervened to the tune of FFr156.2bn (Pounds 19bn) to defend the franc in the seven weeks following mid-November and FFr16.66bn in the first seven days of this year, according to the economic studies department of state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

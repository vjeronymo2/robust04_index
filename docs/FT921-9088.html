			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Watchdog passes first test but more to come THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the new watchdog of accounting standards, is taking stock after three weeks of publicly rapping corporate knuckles. After months of backroom work away from public attention, the panel leapt into the spotlight at the end of January. In the space of a few days, it announced settlements reached with four companies whose accounting practices it had questioned. Now it anticipates issuing no new reprimands for several weeks. Its caseload has temporarily subsided, and it must, in any case, turn its attention to the task of selecting a new chairman. Mr Simon Tuckey, QC, the present incumbent, has just been appointed a judge and will not be able to continue his work with the panel. 'I'm quite pleased with how things have gone,' says Mr Tuckey, weighing his thoughts carefully before speaking. 'We have set out to make our presence known and we have dealt with a number of cases satisfactorily. I have the impression that we have succeeded in making it clear we mean business.' The panel was established in February last year as one of three arms of the new Financial Reporting Council. While the other two bodies, the Accounting Standards Board and the Urgent Issues Task Force, set new accounting standards and guidelines, the panel polices the existing ones. Until now that has primarily meant scrutinising deviations from the Statements of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAPs) drawn up by the Accounting Standards Board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee. In the case of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate and one of the first two companies to draw the panel's attention, there was a contravention of SSAP 3, on earnings per share, over its treatment of disposals and reorganisation costs. For Ultramar, the oil and gas group since taken over by Lasmo, it was SSAP 8 and the interpretation of advance corporation tax. Shield Group, a property developer and estate agent, transgressed SSAP 6, concerning prior year adjustments on the value of its properties. Finally, Forte, the hotels group, was scrutinised for its refusal to depreciate freehold and long-leasehold property. The panel decided that the company had not, in fact, broken SSAP 12, the depreciation standard, but Forte nevertheless agreed to provide more detailed information on its policies in future accounts. The companies themselves argue that their divergence from the standard was justified, giving a truer view of the accounts in light of the businesses concerned - and did not always boost earnings. Mr Tuckey replies: 'Our approach is that if you depart from the standard you need to justify it. If you think some other treatment is preferred you should state it in a note but use the official figure in the accounts. It's a matter of emphasis.' More seriously, some critics suggest that the four chosen were easy targets, or that the punishment they received was too light. Others question the disappointing total number of settlements which have been reached so far. There was an inevitable delay last year as the panel found its footing, identified cases to examine, and conducted its investigations. Nevertheless, its remit was to examine company accounts with financial years beginning in December 1989, all but a handful of which should now have been received. It seems surprising that it has only so far made four public pronouncements. The criticism leaves Mr Tuckey undeterred. 'We have dealt with every case that has come our way,' he says. 'The volume is rather larger than we had anticipated.' He stresses that the panel has written to a further 240 companies that have failed to comply with a statutory requirement introduced by the 1989 Companies Act. They have not broken accounting standards, but have simply neglected to include a note stating that their accounts were prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The action may have helped to raise the profile of the panel, but it is a technicality which has probably done little directly to raise the standard of financial reporting. In addition, the panel has held discussions with a small number of other companies over the last year, but decided they have no case to answer. In these cases, the policy is to make no public announcement. But the number of companies in this category is believed to be less than 10. Partly the panel is restricted by its remit: it does not have the resources to probe accounts at random, and is reliant on referrals. Some have come from the Department of Trade and Industry and other government bodies; and others from individuals, including Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby. Three of the four companies criticised had qualified auditors' reports to highlight their divergence from accounting standards. The fourth drew attention to its unusual treatment on the profit and loss account - rather than hiding it in an obscure note - and stated the alternative figure. The reactive nature of the panel helps explain why those chosen appear to be relatively soft targets: they were easy for outsiders to spot. If there is a demand for greater and more aggressive policing of sloppy accounting, the panel's powers or the mechanisms feeding it information will need to be strengthened. One thing as unclear to the members of the panel as to outsider observers is what effect it is having on financial reporting. The ultimate sanction is that the directors are forced in court to re-state their company's accounts at their own expense. That remains to be tested. Its main weapon is negative publicity. So far that has had some clear effect: Williams Holdings' share price dropped 20p after the announcement and closed down 11p on the day. 'I heaved a sigh of relief when the Williams share price dropped,' said one member of the panel. 'All our work would be as nothing if the market ignored it.' The danger is that media interest in the panel's edicts will wane as the novelty wears off, as they become more commonplace, or the issues being criticised appear too esoteric. 'For those of us who are out with our clients, it is obviously a talking point at the moment,' says Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. 'There is a realisation that they may have to justify their accounts.' 'I think the existence of the panel could have a salutary effect on a number of companies. But my sense is that most are pretty supportive. The majority are irritated by the few getting away with things,' he adds. Another partner in a leading accountancy firm says: 'Auditors can now take a tougher line by using the panel as a threat. To say an auditor was impotent in the past would not be true. But in a very competitive marketplace, it was quite hard to stand up for what you believed in. You yielded till any deviation from the standards was flagrant.' One other significant imponderable remains. So far the panel has reached amicable settlements with the companies it has investigated. But the ultimate appeal is to the courts, which might be called for the first time to test the Companies Act requirement that accounts present a 'true and fair' view. 'That is uncharted territory,' says Mr Tuckey. 'But we have made it clear we're prepared to go all the way if we have to. Directors will have to take that into account.'</p>

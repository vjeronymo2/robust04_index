			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Cross-border shoppers discover cross-border fraud: The single market is held back by lack of proper consumer protection Why does cross-border shopping amount to only 3 per cent of all transactions in the famous European single market? Mr and Mrs Roger Degraeve of Ypres can supply part of the answer. The Flemish couple were initially delighted with their recent trip to Kortrijk, still in Belgium, where they made the equivalent of a cross border purchase after coming across a smooth-talking French salesman who had organised a competition for a Limoges dinner service. The latter had set himself up in a temporary stall in a local mall. The Degraeves won, only to be told their 'prize' could not be delivered unless and until they agreed to pay BFr64,000 (Pounds 1,269) for the privilege of having their initials carved in gold on each and every plate. Grudgingly, the Degraeves agreed to a BFr24,000 downpayment, but then decided not to pay for their 'prize' and contacted the European Consumer Information Agency (ECIA) office in Kortrijk which told then that under Belgian legislation they had a seven-day reflection period in which they could change their mind and revoke their payment. The Kortrijk office contacted its French counterpart in Lille and the French fraud office in Paris who eventually got the Degraeves back their money from the Limoges-based china company, 'La Table des Cesars', which from subsequent complaints lodged with Kortrijk and Lille still appears to be carrying out its marauding raids on Belgian consumers. Traditionally, these consumer bodies are dispensers of data such as the vast array of comparative beer prices in northern France, Belgium and Kent open to anyone dialling into the ECIA computer in Lille. Increasingly, however, they are also having to double up as trouble-shooters. The five 'jurists' in the ECIA office in Lille have, for instance, dealt with some 300 complaints in the first seven months of this year. Figuring high among the purchases which trigger French complaints about the Belgians are furniture, ready-made verandahs, and second hand cars. Mrs Mireille Leroy, the ECIA's Lille director, says French furniture hunters tend to flock into Belgium 'where the salesmen are good, warehouses are open on a Sunday, coffee and creches are provided and people are sometimes ready to sign any old piece of paper'. The upshot is that the Lille centre gets regular complaints about goods that are misdescribed or delivered late or not at all; one French buyer of a Flemish wardrobe found it was heavy in weight as well as style, being partly made of concealed concrete. What makes these cases harder to resolve than the standard consumer disputes or frauds occurring inside EU member states is precisely the difficulties inherent in trying to pursue a foreign company in a foreign language through a foreign legal system. Sometimes the stake for individuals can be quite high. Mrs Leroy points to the case of some French in Alsace who, she says, 'have landed themselves deeply in debt by taking life insurance mortgages from Commerzbank which carry a tax advantage in Germany, but not in France'. Generally, however, the sums of money involved rarely justify an aggrieved consumer calling in a lawyer in one country, let alone in two countries. The Brussels Commission is contemplating two measures to improve consumers' access to justice and to regularise guarantees. One is a plan for a standardised complaint form which, when duly translated, judges and consumer agencies around the EU will readily recognise and act on. The other is harmonisation of the different legal guarantees offered by EU members. This basic right of redress, distinct from additional commercial guarantees offered by specific manufacturers for specific products, only lasts for six months in Germany, but for six years in Britain and Ireland. This worry over what-happens-if-it-goes-wrong is, according to consumer surveys, what most often deters shoppers venturing over borders. Until this concern is eased, the single market will remain unexploited.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Observer: Mane stream Gendjim the mystery horse finally surfaced in France yesterday, two months after arriving from the central Asian republic of Turkmenistan, a special gift to president Francois Mitterrand. The French media has been whinnying about Gendjim's non-appearance so the presidential palace gave him a special photo-call at the Parisian barracks of the Republican Guard. Alexandre Gros, a veteran rider and trainer, said Gendjim, a light-bay 7-year-old, had arrived tired and emotional and needed peace and quiet. He should be getting plenty of that. Mitterrand, 77, does not ride.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Objective Criteria -- Focal Point </F> of Economic Framework Talks"]    [Text] The issue of setting up "objective criteria" to  measure the openness of Japan's market has come to the surface  as the key to resuming economic framework talks between Japan  and the United States. This is because there is a  behind-the-scenes move within the two nations toward holding  unofficial talks in an attempt to break the impasse in the trade  talks. However, while the United States urges Japan to set up  criteria that have the character of numerical targets, the  Japanese Government is persistent in setting up criteria just to  measure the effectiveness of Japan's efforts to open its market.  Is it possible for the two sides to come to a compromise? The  following article reviews the focus of the dispute between the  two nations and to predict how the situation will turn out.  <H5>  Foreshadowing Confrontation </H5>   "An outcome of the Miyazawa-Clinton summit last July is one  cause of the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit in February."  Many of those concerned with the government regard the  agreement reached between then Prime Minister Miyazawa and U.S.  President Clinton as a cause of the rupture of the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. It was specified in the joint  statement of the July 1993 summit that progress in Japan's  market opening will be measured "on the basis of objective  criteria." Those officials said that there are still  differences between the two nations in interpreting such a  statement.    An official who took charge of drafting the joint statement  said that Japan urged the United States to specify that  objective criteria are not a pledge. However, the United States  answered that "if we specify that, we will be not able to win  our people's understanding." The official said that the  statement eventually became "vague" because of the Japan-U.S.  dispute over how to specify objective criteria.  <H5>  Meaning of Objective Criteria </H5>   A senior Foreign Ministry official said that objective  criteria are merely a "yardstick to measure progress in market  opening." He said that "it seems that the United States hopes  to have Japan set up objective criteria in the form of the  Japanese Government's pledge and that the U.S. Government is  ready to take sanctions if such a pledge is not fulfilled," thus  showing a stand of keeping an eye on U.S. moves.    On the contrary, in the United States, particularly within  the Congress, there is a hardline view calling on Japan to come  up with numerical targets that Japan will achieve to promote a  share of foreign products in Japan's market, saying: "Japan  will not seriously come to grips with the issue of expanding  imports unless clear targets are set." While saying that the  United States "will not call for setting up clear numerical  targets," such U.S. leaders as U.S. Trade Representative Kantor  have been urging Japan to set up an indicator that has the  character of numerical targets. Underlying this is that the  United States deeply distrusts Japan.    However, there is another view. [Bowman] Cutter,  presidential assistant (and deputy for economic policy),  stresses that "Japan should understand more that the United  States is not calling for setting up numerical targets that are  subject to sanctions."    Just before the February Japan-U.S. summit, Presidential  Assistant Cutter reportedly hammered out a compromise proposal  in which he said that among priority areas of economic framework  talks, numerical targets will not be introduced to the insurance  sector, and that in the area of government procurement, the two  nations will only analyze the "trend" of Japan's market opening.  Although his proposal failed to become an official U.S.  proposal, there is still a possibility that it will give a  "hint" to resuming economic framework talks.  <H5>  Possibility of Compromise in Government Purchases and </H5> Insurance    Judging from the U.S. stance not to call for setting up  numerical targets, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] sees that a request calling for setting up a  target "designed to help foreign products gain a certain market  share in the future" is "out of the question, and the United  States will not make such a request." Meanwhile, as for the  U.S. call for "keeping a growth rate in Japan's imports," MITI  views that it is possible that the United States will instead  stress that "such a call is not a numerical target, and Japan  should accept this as objective criteria." For that reason,  MITI says that "both requests are numerical targets, and we  cannot accept them," thus indicating a strong posture in  rejecting numerical targets.    In the February negotiations, Japan and the United States  were about to reach an agreement in the area of government  procurement and insurance, two of the three priority areas,  which are: 1) government procurement of telecommunications and  medical equipment, 2) insurance, and 3) automobiles and auto  parts. In view of this, in the course of behind-the-scenes  negotiations, it is possible for the two nations to find a  breakthrough in the deadlocked talks. Although it is observed  that the two nations will try to reach a compromise based on a  proposal that places emphasis on "an increase in import trends,"  the Japanese say that "if we put any kind of a number in a  proposal, it will be interpreted as a pledge." In this way,  Japan's distrust of the United States is deep-rooted. On the  other hand, Japan is required to make efforts to dispel the  distrust of the United States, which says "moderate criteria are  not effective to promoting Japan's imports."    Japanese officials in charge of negotiations "are half in  doubt about the U.S. position not to call on Japan to set up  numerical targets" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It  seems that the two nations' ability to dispel mutual distrust  will be the key to a compromise on "objective criteria."</p>

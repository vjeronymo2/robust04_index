			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Legal &amp; General returns to the black LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the life assurance group, called for the UK to stay outside the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System yesterday as it reported a return to profits. First-half pre-tax profits were Pounds 74m, compared with a loss of Pounds 56.1m a year earlier. The turnround was due mainly to exceptional gains and sharply lower losses from general insurance. However, its reserves against mortgage indemnity insurance losses increased by Pounds 27m to Pounds 185m. It is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 6.2p. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, suggested 8 per cent base rates would be more realistic. He said: 'Having moved down to 10 per cent we have the benefit of lower sterling. I personally think this is an opportunity to take sterling even lower.' Mr David Rough, director of investments, was more forthright. He said: 'I see no benefit in going back into the ERM. It's too constrained under the current system. One man has 99 per cent of the votes, and that man resides in Germany.' Analysts, who were in general guarded in their response to the results, said Legal &amp; General was strongly exposed to economic uncertainty, due both to its mortgage guarantee and investment management business. Mr Roger Harvey, of Kleinwort Benson, pointed to their exposure to the housing market, and said: 'One of the problems for them is that the factors which most influence their profits are out of their control.'

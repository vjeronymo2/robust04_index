			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Volvo and Renault separate as alliance is terminated Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, and Renault of France yesterday agreed to scrap their three-year-old strategic alliance following the collapse last December of their plans to merge. In a move against a trend of consolidation and co-operation in the hard-pressed motor industry, the two groups said they were terminating the web of cross-shareholdings and agreements on technical and industrial co-operation they established in 1990 as a first step towards merger. The divorce came less than three months after Volvo, facing a shareholder revolt, tore up an agreement to merge its car and truck operations with the state-owned French company. Almost all that will remain of the alliance will be existing projects for the supply of engines and gearboxes and joint marketing of cars in some markets. The companies said the separation gave them the freedom to act independently. Renault called it the logical conclusion to the failure of the merger. For the French government, the unwinding of the cross-investments was seen as a necessary step to facilitate Renault's privatisation, scheduled for the second half of this year. Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the Swedish group was in a position to plot a new long-term strategy - expected to include the search for a new partner. 'We now have the freedom to plan and work out our own future in Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Truck Corporation. The positive cash flows being generated by these operations can now be fully utilised.' Under the separation pact, the parent AB Volvo will swap its 45 per cent holding in RVI, Renault's car and truck operations, for Renault's 25 per cent holding in Volvo's car corporation. No payment will be made by either side, although no details were given of the valuation of the swap. Volvo will buy back Renault's 45 per cent holding in Volvo trucks with 60 per cent of its 20 per cent holding in the Renault parent company when Renault is privatised. If the privatisation is delayed, Volvo is obliged to buy the truck holding for FFr4.5bn (Dollars 763m), a provision that suggests for the first time a valuation of Renault of about FFr37bn. Renault holds a 3.45 per cent stake in AB Volvo and Volvo will hold an 8 per cent share in the Renault parent, but neither holding will have strategic significance. The Swedish group will pay Renault FFr1bn as the last tranche of a price-adjustment agreement linked to the 1990 accord. Volvo said it would write off SKr3.6bn in goodwill and make a provision of SKr1.6bn related to the exchange of shares against 1993 income. In Paris, the deal was seen as positive financially for Renault. It was welcomed in Stockholm where Volvo's most-traded B shares rose SKr14 to close at SKr692 on the Stockholm bourse. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the architect of the Renault merger who quit as Volvo chairman in December, said Volvo was left in the dangerous position of being without a partner for the future.

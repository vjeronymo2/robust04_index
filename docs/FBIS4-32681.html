			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Grlickov: "Money: Indication of Changes"] </F>   [Text] Bank liquidity has deteriorated suddenly because the  banks have half the funds (70 million dinars) in giro accounts  than in their previous "fatter condition" because of the  measures taken by the central bank. Since the greatest debate at  present is about furnishing money for the purchase of  agricultural products, the impression has been created that bank  liquidity is dropping because of the outflow from accounts for  those purposes. Now, this could be a partial explanation. The  season for the principal purchases in agriculture (wheat) has  not yet arrived, and the job of "covering" seasonal fruit and  vegetables is coming to a close. (Union Bank had a share of 30  percent in financing transactions that bring considerable export  results.) Bank liquidity is dropping, above all as a consequence  of money withdrawn from circulation because foreign exchange has  been purchased with the reserves of the National Bank. The  slowness with which that foreign exchange is effectuated  (providing imports) is another question; this can mainly be  attributed to the sanctions and less to speculative operations  related to the outflow of capital abroad.    The fundamental commitment in the Avramovic program of  supplying the money in circulation from real sources, that is,  with coverage by foreign exchange, gold, and goods -- is not for  the moment in jeopardy. But this policy of sound money, as  Governor Dragoslav Avramovic said himself in the meeting with  people from the Yugoslav-Swiss Bank, has its limits. First of  all, we cannot assume that the state will be able to supply  foreign exchange indefinitely to cover budget deficits, which  include purchases from agriculture. That is why the governor is  insisting that the budget deficit be eliminated entirely as of  24 July, so that expenditures are covered entirely by taxes (a  broader coverage of taxpayers at a somewhat lower tax rate). At  the same time, the state could borrow on the capital market, but  absolutely not from the National Bank in the form of credit  supplied from primary issue. This ought to be done through the  sale of government bonds, whose sales on the market should be  sign to the central bank as to the extent that the budget  deficits can be covered with real funds.    The tax system is the second vital area whose importance to  the success of the program the governor is stressing. The most  acute problem is the tying of taxes to wages and salaries, which  is resulting in the phenomenon of "double payrolls": the one on  which the taxes are charged and the other, which is paid in  cash. It is the system that is driving the state to increase  wages and salaries, since total tax collections depend on that.    It is still uncertain whether primary note issue will be  used  to cover wheat purchases, which, according to some calculations,  will require 320 million dinars in July and August. The model  proposed by the Federal Government precludes primary note issue;  the banks would have to supply 80 percent and the purchasers 20  percent. The banks would provide most of the funds from federal  or republic deposits, and they would use the legal reserves to a  lesser extent. Statements to the effect that there will not be  any adverse monetary effects are based on the assumption that  the federal state and the republics have deposits in the banks  from real sources, while use of the legal reserves (the  remaining 5 percent which the banks set aside against sight  deposits) is not considered an inflationary source, or it is  assumed that the effect on this basis will be canceled out in  some way, say, by withdrawal of money from circulation through  the purchase of foreign exchange.    One particular problem is that payments based on purchases  in  agriculture would follow a protracted schedule: 30 percent would  be paid immediately, while 70 percent would go into savings  accounts in time deposits for 30 or 60 days. It would have been  better to use securities, commercial commodity bills or notes,  as elements for speeding up financial markets.    The greatest doubts about realization of the Avramovic  program center on the fact that the banks seem not to be able to  count on repayment of outstanding credits (about 1,070 billion  dinars as of end-May) as a source for making new loans. Governor  Avramovic does not deny the existence of that problem, nor did  he earlier, but he mentions that he himself does not know what  the figures are on the extent of uncollectibility (money has  gone, for instance, to pay wages and salaries), nor how much was  loaned out for longer terms than allowed by sight deposits --  but for the first time he mentioned as a problem the  inefficiency of the system, which arises in connection with the  approval of loans and use of money from the banks. To be sure,  he does not say this explicitly, but indirectly, giving as an  example the deteriorated situation in the German economy  following unification of the Western and Eastern parts. The  question is whether the otherwise desirable increase of wages  and salaries of those who are productively employed will be  sufficient shock absorbers to offset the adverse consequences of  possible social unrest. In any case, primary note issue must be  precluded as a way out, since the limits within which it could  be given real coverage are very narrow.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / London launches tourist campaign A Pounds 2.2M PUBLICITY campaign to attract high-spending visitors to London was launched yesterday by 40 private and public-sector organisations, with the backing of film and sports personalities including Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Roger Moore and Steffi Graf. The campaign, aimed at visitors from the US and UK, is supported by British Airways, American Express, the Forte hotel group, Harrods, Marks and Spencer, the British Tourist Authority and several London museums and other attractions. Based on the slogan 'It's not only Londoners who love London', the campaign will rely on newspaper and magazine advertising, direct mail and Prodigy - a shopping service linking 1.8m personal computer users in the US. The film and sports personalities have agreed to appear in the advertisements and publicity material. The London Tourist Board, one of the campaign organisers, said tourists comprised 25 per cent of London Underground passengers, 40 per cent of West End theatre audiences and 25 per cent of taxi passengers. They accounted for 17 per cent of Oxford Street spending. More than 7 per cent of London's working population is employed in tourism, which last year earned Pounds 4.4bn. The Pounds 2.2m will be spent over six months. The campaign will then be extended for an additional 2 1/2 years.</p>

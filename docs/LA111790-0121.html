			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONCERN, REALITY SPLIT ON BROADWAY  </P> <P> The doorman, a beefy guy dressed in a fancy jacket and gray derby, is smiling  and nodding as he holds open the door for the people going into the hotel lobby  full of chandeliers, marble, antiques and splendor.  </P> <P> A woman with a briefcase comes up.  </P> <P> "Where's the homeless workshop?" she asks.  </P> <P> The doorman looks into the park across the street. A bare-chested man with a  dog collar around his neck is growling like an angry Rottweiler, a drunk with  rubber legs is nearly falling into traffic, and a Charles Manson look-alike is  frantically scratching and digging at his skin, screaming, "One shot to the  body, baby, one shot to the heart. . . . "  </P> <P> The doorman pulls open the big glass door, and the cool, clean, old-money  fragrance of luxury sweeps onto the sidewalk.  </P> <P> "The homeless conference? You've got the right place," the doorman says. "It's  right inside, ma'am."  </P> <P> The sun is pounding off the white face and windows of the U.S. Grant Hotel at  the corner of Broadway and 4th Avenue in downtown San Diego, making the place  look like a palace.  </P> <P> Across the street -- and at the other end of the world for all practical  purposes -- the same sunlight is hitting Horton Plaza Park, warming it up  nicely, taking off the morning chill and making it ripe with the smell of urine  and sweat.  </P> <P> "The Lawyer," who has just sat down on a bench, is a little disbelieving.  </P> <P> He had just been asked if his colleagues -- the park's drugged-out, hung-over,  unconscious or otherwise out of it denizens -- are aware that the glittering  hotel looming in front of them is host to a major, two-day workshop Thursday  and Friday of the federal Interagency Council on the Homeless, a regional  conference that hopes someday to spawn the answers for getting them off the  mean streets and back into mainstream society.  </P> <P> "Oh, hell, no, son," says The Lawyer. "I'm afraid a lot of these folks aren't  aware of too much that happens around them, let alone in a hotel like that."  </P> <P> At age 63, Robert Dupre is living proof that homelessness can happen to anyone  and -- this is the part that makes homeless advocates cringe and the  anti-homeless gloat -- that being a hobo just ain't always that bad.  </P> <P> Dupre tells one of those stories you would never believe. As a young man in the  1950s and '60s, he was an FBI agent, a senator's aide and an assistant U.S.  attorney, a real up-and-comer in the powerful legal and political circles in  Washington and the South.  </P> <P> You think: Yeah, sure you were, old man. And I'm the Wizard of Oz.  </P> <P> Only problem is The Lawyer's story checks out. The FBI, Sen. Strom Thurmond  (R-S.C.), and the U.S. attorney's office in South Carolina all confirm it.  </P> <P> "Well, I declare, I declare. That's shocking. . . . As a young man, I thought  he had a bright future," Thurmond said softly, upon learning Dupre has been on  the streets since the early 1970s, when his life crumbled under alcohol, a  divorce and other personal troubles. He was a public defender until being  disbarred a few years later.  </P> <P> Dupre says some homeless people call him The Lawyer because he does occasional  paralegal work and once in a while will help a street person find the right  legal and social services.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, sitting on a park bench, Dupre looked over an agenda for the  conference on homelessness.  </P> <P> After a moment, he launches into a knowledgeable discourse about financial  waste and the inner workings of the bureaucracy administering funds from the  federal McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.  </P> <P> He favors eliminating much of the bureaucracy, which he considers a  self-sustaining black hole for taxpayers' money, and instead giving vouchers  for food, clothing and other necessities directly to the homeless.  </P> <P> "There's so much money wasted," The Lawyer says. "It's such a complex system,  and it really shouldn't be."  </P> <P> During the conference, the Interagency Council on the Homeless, a coalition of  federal, state and local agencies, discussed everything from housing to job  training for the homeless in the council's Western region of California,  Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii.  </P> <P> The language of the workers discussing the homeless is much different from the  language of the homeless.  </P> <P> San Diego was chosen to host the conference because of its record for  "interagency cooperation" and establishing one of the nation's highest numbers  of "single-room occupancy boarding houses" for people surviving on government  benefit checks, conference officials said.  </P> <P> In one workshop, the topic was mental illness and substance abuse, considered  two of the most pernicious disorders gripping many homeless people, putting  some on the street, keeping others there, reinforcing many people's perception  of the homeless as lazy winos and addicts who wouldn't take honest manual labor  if you gave it to them.  </P> <P> Inside the ornate meeting rooms, the social workers used their clinical terms  -- "dual diagnoses" and "integrated assistance programs" and "relapse  prevention" -- to discuss the troubles of the mentally ill and alcohol and drug  abusers.  </P> <P> Someone mentioned the homeless who refuse help -- the ones whose brains and  bodies are too far gone, the ones who have, for whatever reason, abandoned  mainstream society.  </P> <P> One item mentioned was a proposal for more conservatorships, where social  workers get control over a person's monthly Social Security disability and  veteran's benefits checks so the money, theoretically, is used "properly,"  rather than lost, stolen or "wasted."  </P> <P> The homeless "wasting" government benefits is at the crux of the issue of  "true" homelessness. Some get no money from anyone. For others, monthly benefit  checks are more than $1,000, enough for a vagabond lifestyle, with shelters,  churches and other social service programs meeting emergency needs.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, the merchants would stop complaining about the homeless if  they realized how much the street people were spending on clothes, motels,  liquor and Walkmans, said Susan Dempsey, head of a Santa Monica social service  program.  </P> <P> "They blow the checks. They just spend it as they wish. . . . It's an abuse of  the system because these people have no desire to get off the streets," said  Dempsey.  </P> <P> A tough-talking woman in her 40s, Dempsey emphasizes the need for compassion  and hope for the mentally ill homeless, but she doesn't appear to tolerate any  mollycoddling. She opposes shelters that provide food and clothing without  offering recovery services and permanent housing programs.  </P> <P> Most homeless people want off the street, Dempsey said, but helping those who  don't is nearly impossible.  </P> <P> Fear is what keeps many people on the streets, she said -- a fear of failure  mixed with no self-esteem and a denial of what life really is on the streets.  </P> <P> "If you trust in the system for help and you fail -- for whatever reason --  then the next time will be twice as bad. . . . You get into a vicious cycle  and, after a while, you figure what's the use, life isn't so bad on the streets  as long as you get your (benefits) checks."  </P> <P> A young man Dempsey knows lived on the street for years until his family helped  him get psychiatric care. He got medication, clean clothes, hot meals again.  And he hated it.  </P> <P> "On the streets, he was out of it (mentally)," Dempsey said. "But he said the  medication made him too aware of who he was, what his problems were. He said,  'I have no life. I see that now.'  </P> <P> "It's very sad. The only thing we can do with people like that is just keep  trying to improve their quality of life."  </P> <P> Back in Horton Plaza Park, The Lawyer is talking in a raspy Southern accent  about how he can quit the streets any time and go live with relatives -- he  hasn't told them he is a hobo -- in San Francisco, Salt Lake City or even  return to his native Oconee County, on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains in  northern South Carolina.  </P> <P> Dupre is clean, polite, soft-spoken, avuncular. He is not a braggart about his  past; he is more interested in discussing homelessness from both a first-person  perspective and as a socio-cultural phenomenon.  </P> <P> Neatly dressed in tennis shorts, an Izod sweater and South Carolina Gamecocks  baseball cap, his worldly belongings in a gym bag, he sounds, looks and smells  like a grandfather from the rural South: strong hands and a potbelly, smelling  vaguely of pipe tobacco, cologne and old sweaters.  </P> <P> He has no intention, however -- at least right away -- of leaving the street.  He says he's "not ready" yet.  </P> <P> He has been lucid until now, but he starts wandering a little, talking of  "searching for something . . . a way to change homelessness. . . . I'm still  learning about life."  </P> <P> He says it as if he were a young student gathering material for a doctoral  dissertation on homelessness or the human condition, and not a 63-year-old  recovering alcoholic who has nowhere to go and doesn't particularly care, an  old man who spends his nights on concrete and days soaking up the sun among the  Horton Park regulars -- some harmless, some dangerously unstable and none  clearly all there.  </P> <P> The $845 a month Dupre gets in Social Security and veteran's benefits -- for  being a Navy Air Corps tail gunner in the South Pacific during World War II --  goes for food, an occasional motel room, odds and ends and, since he gave up  booze, enough marijuana to get "relaxed" a few times a month.  </P> <P> Sen. Thurmond, irritation edging out his pity, cannot understand it.  </P> <P> "Just between you and me," the old senator whispers. "Is he all there in the  head? . . . He's got an education, and he comes from a very respectable family.  I wonder why he hasn't gone home to his people. He could get a job in real  estate or insurance. I just don't understand."  </P> <P> Dupre wants none of it.  </P> <P> "Nobody's smart on the streets, but you choose to be in society or out of it,"  he says. "Those are the two choices -- there is no middle ground. I've chosen  to be out of it. To fit in, you need that good ol' American work ethic. . . .  and I don't have it.  </P> <P> "I didn't mind losing my status -- I never had any great calling to be a lawyer  anyway -- but I don't want to lose my mind and sink into the homeless  mentality."  </P> <P> He looks around. Dozing or chatting in the sunshine are dozens of young men,  able-bodied and looking well rested, a little drunk or high, bumming change off  people passing by, relaxing on the grass and benches.  </P> <P> This, apparently, is what Dupre thinks of as the "homeless mentality." Nobody  is poring desperately over the want ads in search of gainful employment or  otherwise "pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps."  </P> <P> Jack Kemp and Frank Keating would be disappointed.  </P> <P> Inside the Grant Hotel, in a vast ballroom after lunch, Keating, general  counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was speaking about  HUD Secretary Kemp's "Operation Bootstrap" and homelessness being a "national  tragedy" afflicting "lost souls."  </P> <P> Nothing was too memorable among the cliches and rhetoric until Keating recalled  a winter day in Washington a few years ago when he was returning from lunch. He  came upon a man sitting on a sidewalk grate. It was raining and 20 degrees.  Icicles covered the man's beard and bare head. He was trying to peel a frozen  orange.  </P> <P> And Ted Bundy popped into Keating's mind.  </P> <P> It was a tragedy, Keating said, that a society's priorities could be so screwed  up that a serial killer like Bundy could live in a Florida prison before  getting the electric chair -- and yet no one was taking care of that freezing  man with his rock-hard navel orange on the Washington grate.  </P> <P> Down in Horton Plaza Park, with a few of the social workers from the conference  passing by, a woman with no teeth asks for the time.  </P> <P> She has not bathed in weeks -- her hair looks like a mechanic's grease rag. The  crotch of her farmer's overalls -- big enough for a 250-pound man -- hangs to  her knees. She is in her 40s and looks 70 -- a very ill 70.  </P> <P> She clearly is in a hurry. Impatiently, she shuffles away -- to a corner, back,  around the park, to another corner, fenced in a by a one-square-block mental  barrier.  </P> <P> She is going nowhere.  </P> <P> After a while, she gets tired and sits on a bench. Ten minutes later, she  starts bouncing off the invisible walls again -- corner to corner to corner to  corner. It goes on all day.  </P> <P> "Poor woman," says The Lawyer. "See, I'm not like that because I have the  choice of being out here. . . . Do you think she has that choice?"  </P></p>

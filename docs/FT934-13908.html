			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (1): Embracing a new realism - The importance of offshore investment and insurance has been growing following a recent decline in the tourist industry which is suffering from recession in the US. But Richard Lapper finds that this is just one of many developments being witnessed by the island's business community FROM his office overlooking the yachts in Hamilton's picturesque harbour, Charles Vaughan-Johnson, who next year takes over as president of Bermuda's biggest bank, unfolds a map of the world showing thick red lines linking the tiny Atlantic island to New York and London. The map is published by Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications giant, and the lines represent the digital communications 'highway' which links the island to the world's financial centres and is a crucial element in the success of Bermuda's offshore investment and insurance business. 'It enables us to do the things which depend on high-speed electronic communication,' says Mr Vaughan-Johnson, whose bank already has eight overseas offices and has recently expanded its trust business in East Asia. Mr Vaughan-Johnson believes that the Cable &amp; Wireless communications lines now equal if not outweigh the importance of the sea and aircraft links on which Bermuda's tourist industry - and economic welfare - has traditionally depended. In Bermuda's business community he is not alone. Following the election victory earlier this month of the United Bermuda Party (UBP), the immediate future of international business appears assured. Over the past three years under the UBP government of Sir John Swan, the premier, the offshore sector has grown and now accounts for about 50 per cent of Bermuda's foreign exchange earnings. To a degree this reflects the decline of the tourist industry, the island's traditional economic mainstay, which has suffered from the recession in the US, the island's main market. Arrivals fell by about one sixth between 1987 and 1992. The island's big hotels have steadily lost money and local retailers and other trades largely dependent on tourists have shed staff, contributing to a rise in unemployment to about 5 per cent of the workforce. Partially to compensate for this decline, the government has promoted the offshore investment, trust and insurance industries, partially through more active marketing. In addition, it has started to dismantle elements of the restrictive and protectionist economic model which has guided the island's economic life for much of the past 50 years, making Bermuda more attractive to overseas financial services companies. The island's two biggest banks - the Bank of Butterfield and Vaughan-Johnson's Bank of Bermuda - which dominate some offshore financial services, have been exposed to much greater competition in the trust and securities business. Legislation passed in 1991 allows newcomers to compete with the banks in the trust business. As a result, the island's big legal and accountancy firms have set up trust companies, while international institutions such as Lombard Odier and Coutts have been attracted by the island's potential. Schroders, the UK financial group, has taken advantage of the relaxation of the rules to acquire full control of its local subsidiaries. The easing of rules governing stockbroking operations has allowed the creation of new local securities firms, such as First Bermuda Securities, which are already spearheading some important innovations. First Bermuda, for example, is playing a vital role in a prospective Dollars 131m project to develop a new business hotel on the site of the Bermudiana hotel in Hamilton, the capital - a development which it hopes will serve as a focus for the international business community. Partially responding to pressures from the likes of First Bermuda, the banks have moved to streamline the local stockmarket, bringing it into line with international trading centres. Daily trading was introduced for the first time this February and plans to introduce electronic trading are advanced. The market aims to become a centre for Bermuda's insurance and reinsurance companies and for other companies now based in Hong Kong but which may seek new homes after the Chinese takeover in 1997. Greater dynamism in the banking sector is also expected. Mr Vaughan-Johnson's appointment as the first non-Bermudian to head up Bank of Bermuda is symbolic of the changing mentality among Bermuda's business elites. A shift in ownership earlier this year at Bermuda Commercial Bank (BCB), the third largest bank but hitherto the poor relation of the banking community is another indication of change in the industry. The buyer, John Deuss, a Dutch oil trader and long-time Bermuda resident, acquired a controlling stake from Barclays earlier this year and plans to transform BCB into a niche bank, providing specialised services to corporate and individual clients. But he also wants the BCB to be the first local bank to offer long-term mortgage loans. The decline in tourism, meanwhile, and the contraction in the economy which has ensued, is leading to change even in more sheltered parts of the island's economy. Local businesses dependent on tourism, such as retailers, have become more adaptable and with full employment no longer guaranteed, Bermuda's tough labour unions are becoming more flexible. One small but telling example of this new realism is that shopkeepers on Hamilton's Front Street have begun opening in the evenings. It is a step which would not be out of the ordinary in Europe or the US, but for Bermuda such a development would have been unthinkable five years ago. Further change is on the cards. The growth of the reinsurance market this year will place new demands on local infrastructure and services. Bermuda is already a leading captive insurance centre and a favoured venue for a number of specialist companies selling such esoteric products as financial reinsurance and high level insurance covering international companies against the cost of legal awards. Companies such as Centre Re, ACE and XL dominate their markets and are among the fastest growing and most profitable companies in the international insurance industry. This year investors have chosen to pump more than Dollars 4bn into new catastrophe reinsurance companies, with some of the world's leading reinsurers establishing new subsidiaries on the island. The growth has been fed entirely by developments on international reinsurance markets, where rates have increased steeply following a string of recent hurricanes and other disasters. Bermuda's loose but reputable financial regulation and the absence of tax on either profits, dividends or income, allow the companies much more room to build up reserves against future losses, than in either the US or Europe. 'The insurance market is so large and substantial, it is bound to lead to further opening up. People will become less insular,' says Audette Exel, international manager at the BCB. Further economic liberalisation is in the pipeline. Last March David Saul, the finance minister, said he favoured ending exchange controls. 'To try and shelter behind the 'business as usual' mentality will surely see the rest of the world pass us by and our economy will slide backwards as a result,' Mr Saul said recently. Sir John Swan, the premier, says he has an 'open mind' on the issue of exchange controls - at present Bermudians pay a tax on any capital shipped out of the country. But he says that it may be difficult to enforce rules restricting foreign investors to 40 per cent ownership of non-exempted companies if exchange rules are scrapped. 'We would have been like the rest of the Caribbean if we had had an open door policy. We would have had a big private debt problem,' he says. Sir John Swan concedes that Bermuda needs some restrictions and protection, but he says the easing of exchange control is in everybody's interest and can be done without adverse fall-out. 'We just have to understand that exchange control is anachronistic . . . Something needs to be addressed if we are going to call ourselves truly international.' Local financiers such as Jeffrey Conyers, one of the founders of First Bermuda Securities, agree. 'Business locally is more and more realistic. It is part of a maturing process to become truly recognised as an international financial centre.'</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Tecs warned of funding cuts MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, employment secretary, yesterday warned Training and Enterprise Councils that they could face cuts in funding in the next public expenditure round. Mrs Shephard said at a conference in Birmingham attended by chairmen and chief executives of Tecs: 'Tecs cannot expect to get additional funding this year. Our funds could be less.' Nevertheless, she wanted Tecs to improve overall performance. 'I suggest a key task is to raise performance, to bring the rest up to the level of the best and to ensure our best continually improve,' she said. She wanted to encourage a shift towards Tecs being paid for achieving results, such as qualifications, rather than for the number of weeks trainees spent on courses.</p>

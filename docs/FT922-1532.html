			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / EC may reach compromise on air deregulation today A COMPROMISE over European airline deregulation could be thrashed out today in Luxembourg, where EC transport ministers are meeting to discuss the European Commission's third package of air liberalisation proposals. Free marketeers, such as Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark, will press for airlines to be able to fly within and between any member states and to charge any fare, subject to controls on predatory or exorbitant pricing. However they will face resistance from Germany, France and southern member states, which want to delay full liberalisation. Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, said on Friday he wanted the changes to be implemented 'as soon as possible'. He said a breakthrough was possible. Under the compromise proposals to be debated today, airlines from one member state would be allowed to offer domestic services in another country as part of a longer route from January 1 1993. The UK is hoping the market will be opened to full cabotage - with airlines allowed to compete directly on any route within the EC - just 12 months later. France, Germany, Portugal Spain and Italy want a transition period of up to six years. 'The principle is that we would like to have a progressive opening, with safeguards (to prevent damage to the environment, congestion and unfair competition with rail and road services),' said a French official. During their two-day meeting, ministers will also consider similar compromises freeing up freight transport by road and water in the Community.</p>

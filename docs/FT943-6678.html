			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers The dollar rose sharply yesterday on the foreign exchanges after the US second quarter GDP report prompted a recovery in the US bond market, writes Philip Gawith. Second quarter GDP was revised up by only 0.1 of a percentage point, to 3.8 per cent, and the market took this to mean that tighter US monetary policy was less likely. The dollar later gained further momentum from rumours that Mr George Soros, the US investor, was selling yen for dollars. There were also reports of very active buying of dollars by the Singapore government, apparently unrelated to the GDP figures. The dollar's recovery took the market by surprise, coming against the backdrop of thin trading conditions ahead of a long weekend in the UK. It finished in London at DM1.5615, and was later trading at DM1.5750 in New York, compared to Thursday's London close of DM1.5462. It also breached the Y100 barrier, to close at Y100.285, up from a low of Y99.05. In Europe, the escudo prospered despite a half percentage point cut in the emergency lending rate to 12 per cent. It closed unchanged at Es102.2. The sterling index finished unchanged at 78.9, as the pound made up against the D-Mark what it lost against the dollar. The short sterling market responded calmly to the August Confederation of British Industry survey, despite an increase in the balance of respondents expecting to increase prices. The December contract traded 20,221 lots to US close at 93.38, up from 93.36. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI said the market appeared to have 'recovered some of its composure. Certainly the market has put up a braver face than it did earlier this month when it was undermined by interest hikes in Italy and Sweden.' At the weekly Treasury bill tender, the top accepted rate of discount rose to 5.35 per cent from 5.25 per cent last week. In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 550m shortage at established rates. Analysts were sceptical about how long the dollar rally would last. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, commented: 'I think the dollar will quickly run up against a brick-wall. If the bond market is fuel for the dollar, it will run out pretty soon.' He said it was doubtful whether the US bond market could recover much from current levels and this would cap the dollar. Mr Michael Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial markets consultancy, said rumours of Mr Soros turning positive on the dollar had encouraged the market to think that short-term, speculative funds might be buying the dollar again. Concerted buying by a well-known US hedge fund, and determined intervention by the Bank of Japan are two factors which account for the dollar's solid performance against the yen, despite the potentially destabilising influence of trade talks. The consensus is swinging increasingly towards the view that some sort of US-Japan trade deal will be sorted out by the end of September. But dollar sceptics argue that this will still leave unattended the trade balance between the two countries. Recent data suggest it is still growing in Japan's favour.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Hang the Commons Whenever a general election looms I consider the parties and try to shut my eyes to the awful prospect that one of them might win. What a delight it has been to contemplate last Thursday's local election results and savour the possibility that perhaps, with any luck, no party will achieve an outright victory. A hung parliament is not a recipe for chaos. If you believe that, join the blinkered troglodytes who think Britain is doing well under single-party rule. A forced deal in the lower house is, rather, the only mechanism that offers even a glimmer of hope that we may overturn our serial elective dictatorship, abolish the Lords, write a modern constitution and prosper in the 21st century as the Federal Republic of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Liberals blew their chance in the late 1970s and Mr Paddy Ashdown is over the top in demanding proportional representation without a referendum, but we have to take what history offers us. If the leader of the Liberal Democrats manages to win enough seats in the Commons to give him the necessary leverage, and if he uses it successfully, he will deserve a statue in his honour. Parliament Square is the correct site. I enjoyed that. Now back to reality. The mundane question of the year is, will Tortoise Major beat Hare Kinnock? In the original fable there was some doubt at the beginning, but we all know that Tortoise won in the end. That was because Hare lost his concentration, became over-confident, lolloped about. Mr Neil Kinnock is doing none of that. He is leading the Labour party as if the general election was due next week. Mr John Major is still trying to find the starting line. The two larger parties may be neck and neck in the opinion polls, but only Labour is up and running, ready for a decisive national election. The Conservative party is not. They are so unready that they failed to keep to their strategy of introducing the health service reforms without making changes that could damage their electoral chances. The job cuts by Guy's and other opted-out hospitals may be right, and they may be technically outside the domain of Mr William Waldegrave, secretary for health, but they need not have been announced 10 days before the local elections. That was somewhere between careless and unintelligent. You can, however, bank on Labour's readiness for a national contest. The party demonstrates every other day that it is fighting fit. If campaigning is the yardstick, it is running rings around the Conservatives. It launched no fewer than eight policy documents last month. Ostensibly aimed at the local elections, they dealt with national issues: the arts, crime, health, the environment, the family, education, and so on. The rumbustious education secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Only Labour is up and running, ready for a decisive national election has been obliged to respond, with increasing frequency, to the fresh initiatives put out by his scholarly-looking Labour opponent, Mr Jack Straw. Last week Mr Straw came out with a plan for broadening A-levels and improving technical education for 16-18-year-olds; the best that Mr Clarke could muster was that, just wait, his own gloss on technical education will be published soon. For the past several months Mr Gordon Brown has been advertising his 'policy for industry', which is socialist to the extent that it might have been written by Mr Michael Heseltine. You may or may not like the whiff of interventionism discernible in this policy, but that is beside the political point. Mr Brown has obliged Mr Peter Lilley, the industry secretary, to jump to it, which he did smartly last Tuesday. Now he has to mouth the same objectives as Mr Brown, leaving to the small print the considerable differences between them. Mr Michael Howard has had the unenviable task, for an employment secretary, of defending the rapid increase in unemployment. His Labour counterpart is one of the party's photogenic stars, the very image of a bright young public-school conservative barrister, Mr Tony Blair. He has cajoled the unions into apparent docility and now constitutes a not-so-secret weapon in the battle for the centre-ground. Mr Blair has launched sections of his party's policies for employment, training and reform of labour law five times during the past couple of months and is due to bring forth a further manifestation in a few weeks, when he will propose a cash-limited fund against which bids could be made to support schemes to train employees in work in areas of special pressure. All this campaigning is being carried on in semi-private and in public. If you are a captain of industry and you have not been invited to a discreet meeting with Mr Blair, Mr Brown, Mr Straw or the shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, consider your position. Do you matter? Are you as important as you think? But if you have been favoured you will know how prudent, how reasonable, is the consumerist sales patter of these representatives of producer interests. We can all now see the principal difference between Labour and the Conservatives. The former will raise income taxes to fund public services; the latter will proclaim an intention to improve services and at the same time cut taxes. Labour has its arguments ready; the Tories are arguing among themselves. Maybe they will knock each other out and hang the Commons. The probability is that more people will vote for lower taxes than the other way. Assuming that when the time comes mortgages are down and the economic optimism is up the Conservatives still stand the better chance of coming out as the larger party; even an overall majority is not out of the question. If Mr Kinnock had had the vision to embrace electoral reform wholeheartedly four years ago he might be in de facto alliance with the suddenly important Mr Ashdown and therefore in a commanding lead now. But he didn't and isn't.</p>

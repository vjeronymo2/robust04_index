			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUR INTEREST IN UNWRAPPING BONN'S COCOON  </P> <P> The Atlantic Alliance is embroiled in the latest of many disputes about nuclear  weapons and arms control. This dispute unfortunately has obscured what, from  the U.S. perspective, is the real argument with West Germany.  </P> <P> This argument is not about technical questions of defense and arms control. The  persistent disagreements in this area are merely symptoms of far more profound  divergences of perceived interest. The real argument with West Germany is about  the implications of its re-emergence as a great European power, about Bonn's  long-term policies in Eastern (more properly, Central) Europe, about German  reunification and about the role and aims of the Soviet Union in the Gorbachev  era.  </P> <P> If we do not bring these questions into the open, but rather force the Germans  into agreeing to positions they no longer believe in, we are not merely storing  up resentment for the future; we are jeopardizing the future of Western  security itself.  </P> <P> The debate is urgent because a revolution is occurring in German and European  elite opinion about East-West relations, the dimensions of which are hardly  realized on this side of the Atlantic. Virtually without exception, Europeans  believe that the Cold War -- and with it, the Soviet military threat -- is  over. Furthermore, they believe that Western Europe can and should take a  leading role in overcoming the division of Europe, and that it is far better  qualified politically and morally to do so than the United States. So far, the  Bush Administration has done nothing to disprove that belief.  </P> <P> What is happening on the threshold of the 1990s is that West Germany, for long  Europe's economic superpower, is becoming its political superpower as well.  This development has three epoch-making implications. First, even almost two  full generations after World War II, Germans remain remarkably unwilling to  acknowledge their status openly. This means that they still feel obliged to  describe their international political goal of expanding West German power and  influence in Central Europe in moralistic terms as an altruistic peace policy  that in no way reflects crude national and material interests. These pretenses  cause far more harm than good. They oblige the West Germans to pretend to be  everybody's friend at all times, thereby leading Washington, as we have seen,  into entirely unrealistic assumptions about what security policies Bonn will  accept.  </P> <P> The second effect of West Germany's new status is that the left-right split on  security and foreign policy that divided the country in the 1980s has  disappeared. In its place we have a near-total consensus that West Germany can,  should and will use its economic and political power to promote liberalization  and pluralism in Central Europe.  </P> <P> The final, and most remarkable, implication of Bonn's growing power is that it  is welcomed, not feared, by West Germany's European neighbors, both East and  West. This fact alone should encourage West German leaders and elites to be  more honest about their interests. It also should encourage the United States  to stop playing catchup with European opinion about West Germany's role or  about East-West relations. Washington has every reason to take the lead in  encouraging West Germany to take full responsibility for its actions as a great  power. That way, the Germans will face the risks, rather that merely enjoying  the gains, of their detente policies.  </P> <P> The same goes for the U.S. position on German reunification. The West German  government decided in the mid-1960s that the West had no chance of forcing a  withdrawal of communist power from East Germany. For the past 25 years, the  question of reunification has vanished completely from the U.S. policy agenda,  though not from West Germany's. Forward-looking Germans speak now in terms of  association or federation of the two Germanys, not reunification, but the goal  is the same: national self-determination. Washington has much to gain, and  nothing to lose, by publicly stating its full moral and political support for  Bonn's endeavors to achieve this goal.  </P> <P> Bonn's national self-assertion is not free of illusions, though those illusions  would carry much less danger for the West as a whole if both we and the Germans  were more honest about where our national interests coincide and where they  diverge. On modernizing Central Europe and on German self-determination, they  clearly coincide. On wholesale aid to the Gorbachev regime, perhaps they do  not. I say perhaps because I think that honest West German appraisal of its  great-power interests leads to the conclusion that lowering one's guard while  helping to revitalize a still-powerful Soviet empire is a dangerous policy. As  long as we allow the Germans to conceal their power policies in a moralistic  cocoon, however, no German will be forced to make such an honest appraisal.  </P> <P> Russia entered the arena of European power policies in the 18th Century as  Prussia's enemy. Ever since then, the German eagle and the Russian bear have  contested the political and cultural hegemony in Central Europe. After almost  half a century of abnormal conditions, the old struggle is re-emerging in what  one hopes is a peaceful form. It cannot fail to have intimate implications for  American foreign policy and America's own shaky status as a great power. It is  high time we started talking about it.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Every which way but out of office: John Major's government is rudderless, driverless and lost just five months after its election triumph It is no use asking what the British government will do next. As we can all see, the prime minister and the chancellor are living from day to day. When it comes to the long term - to, say, next week - they show every sign of not having the foggiest notion of what strategy to propose. For the time being we can forget about new directions for Britain. We will be lucky if we get any direction at all. The objective of both the organ-grinder and the marmoset who goes around with the little tin cup is clear. They want to keep their jobs. If they manage to achieve that they will try to rebuild their reputations. When parliament meets on Thursday Mr John Major will remind the opposition behind him that he has set the Maastricht treaty aside until further notice. He is already committed to doing nothing until the Danes have demonstrated that they have a plan for reversing their No vote. He had the foresight to build that particular hidey-hole into a speech he delivered on September 7. Now he has found another escape-hatch. He has used his presidency of the EC to convene a meeting of European leaders early next month. There are good European reasons for calling such a summit, but to the prime minister its principal function will be that of air-raid shelter. He needs one, to protect himself from the bombardment of his own back-benchers. His current state of mind is evident. It is nervous, the disposition of a man who has had the stuffing knocked out of him. You do not have to read very far between the lines of his article in yesterday's Evening Standard to conclude that while Mr Major remains a European, sort of, ('we cannot cut ourselves off from the European continent') it is the anti-EC Tory right he most fears ('now even the French have shown they have serious doubts about the extent of control from Brussels'). He wants the summit to 'take a profound look at where Europe is going'. As to the exchange rate mechanism, it turns out that there are 'fault lines' in the way it is run. Presumably these were not discerned two years ago when, as chancellor, Mr Major proudly announced that Britain was going in. 'We shall not go back into the system until the flaws have been put right,' he now asserts, making assurance doubly sure by adding, 'we cannot return to the ERM until it has been reformed'. The genius whose experiment blew up is blaming the laboratory. There is, however, a cunning plan to save the government's skin. It is patently a work of genius. The other 11 members of the EC are to be asked to rewrite the Maastricht treaty, or add clauses to it, or abandon parts of it, in the interest of restoring unity to the Conservative party. At the same time the Bundesbank is to be requested to pledge itself to rules of ERM behaviour that take into account British Tory needs. There is a flaw. Without the ERM, with not even a symbolic commitment to monetary union, the structure of European Union agreed at Maastricht falls down. Britain reserved the right to opt out of Emu; now it is taking a step backwards by staying out of the ERM itself. Never mind. All will be well, provided that the foreigners adjust their thinking. Don't laugh. This is a serious matter. The fatal weakness of the Tories is their propensity to indulge themselves in illusions of grandeur. Do not take my word for it. Consider the words of Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, at a Conservative Political Centre summer school in July. 'It is not just a British contribution that we will be making,' said Sir Norman. 'It will be a Conservative contribution - a lead for Europe based on the proven experience of Britain over the last decade.' That was BD, before devaluation. It sounded grandiose even then. Repeated today, AD, the assertion sounds merely pathetic. Yet there is a real chance that aspects of Maastricht will be rethought. The other 11 members of the EC are indeed concerned about the degree to which the treaty meets the aspirations of their own electorates. The Danes said No; the French very nearly did. The Germans are clearly uncomfortable. As the third or fourth most important member of the Community Britain can expect a hearing for its views, particularly while it holds the presidency, and especially if it shows that it knows its place. But Mr Major should be aware that it is the Germans and the French, in that order, who will determine whether any changes are acceptable. These could then be negotiated by the prime minister, as was the original deal last year. There is no doubting his skill in handling the pre-Maastricht horse-trading. We must hope that his natural self-confidence returns in time for the next round. Mr Major is, after all, the only prime minister we have. He has demonstrated that he will not resign, even if forced to devalue within a week of swearing that he would never do so. This may not be glorious, but it is his choice. There is no prospect of an election, so we can rule out the leader of the opposition. In any event, Mr John Smith is as tied to Maastricht and the ERM as, BD, Mr Major was. So far no Conservative challenger has appeared. There are several potential successors in the Cabinet, but these would only step forward if Mr Major were to be removed by some unfortunate accident. In that circumstance Mr Kenneth Clarke would probably be front-runner, against, perhaps, Mr Michael Heseltine. Since both are Euro-enthusiasts, there is little point in the anti-Maastricht Right plotting Mr Major's downfall. Lady Thatcher is, fingers crossed, safely tucked away in the Lords. Anyhow, the country likes the prime minister it appears to be stuck with. Whether it likes him better as the winter draws on may depend on who wins the economic argument: the angel whispering in his right ear that he must keep interest rates high to combat inflation, or the devil on his left urging him to cut loose and dash for growth. Popularity is there for the buying, if he but succumbs. Thus there is no way of establishing whether the ambition, restated by the prime minister yesterday, of achieving 'low inflation and a prosperous economy' will be matched by as inflexible a resolve outside the ERM as it was within it. In short there is no telling where Britain is heading. It could be in the direction of another bust-up with the EC. Even if a fresh Maastricht deal is renegotiated, there is no guarantee that it would get through the Commons. In spite of the government's repeated rejection of a British referendum, it is quite possible that Mr Major will once again be mugged by events and obliged to call one. He must rely on Mr Smith to save him from that, as from so much else. Five months after Mr Major's election triumph his government is rudderless, driverless, lost.</p>

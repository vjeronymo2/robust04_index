			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["pid" report: "Neo-Nazi Tourism to the East"] </F>   [Text] Northeim -- Neo-Nazis from Lower Saxony are  recruiting members in Saxony-Anhalt. According to information  from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in  Magdeburg, Thorsten Heise, Lower Saxony chairman of the  right-wing extremist Liberal Workers Party [FAP], is attempting  to establish "FAP structures" in Saxony-Anhalt. The new center  of the anticonstitutional party is Wernigerode in the Ostharz,  said Wolfgang Heidelberg, head of the Office for the Protection  of the Constitution in Saxony-Anhalt, where the FAP, which has  between 400 and 600 members throughout Germany, established a  regional circle of 60 members last week. However, the number of  supporters appears to be even larger. Nevertheless there is no  land organization in Saxony-Anhalt yet, but even in this land  Heise leads FAP as a "provisional chairman." FAP bases itself  on the 1920 program of the National Socialist German Workers  Party [NSDAP].    Because of constant violence usually caused by FAP  supporters, the police are permanently on alert, said Heidelberg.    On Saturday [28 May], in Heise's home town of Northeim,  there  was a demonstration against FAP staged mainly by numerous groups  from the autonomous sphere, but also Greens.</p>

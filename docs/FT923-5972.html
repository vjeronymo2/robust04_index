			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: News Corporation There are signs that Mr Rupert Murdoch is getting itchy inside the straitjacket imposed by last year's refinancing. Asset sales mean the repayment schedule is undemanding until 1994, but plans to raise Dollars 1bn from the debt market suggest a degree of impatience. On the basis of yesterday's full-year figures, however, News Corporation looks fully able to deliver earnings growth without a big move. The performance of newspaper titles in the UK and Australia is perhaps the most impressive feature. With costs pared and capital expenditure already in the bag, the group should be well placed for any upturn in advertising spend. The same might be said of BSkyB: at the very least the project is no longer draining cash at the operating level. The scale of losses at Ansett are more disappointing - and are likely to remain a drag on earnings unless a serious buyer steps forward. On the basis of yesterday's figures, Ansett's attractions are difficult to pinpoint. With a third domestic Australian airline due to take to the skies next month, margins will doubtless come under renewed pressure. But events are now unfolding in News Corp's favour. An effective tax rate of 4 per cent will rise as tax losses run out, but only to perhaps 10 per cent in the current year. Servicing the debt pile cost ADollars 238m less than a year ago, thanks to lower interest rates. Given the potential for growth, a prospective multiple of around 11 times this year's forecast earnings is undemanding. But the low tax charge and the debt makes it less clear that the company deserves to trade on much of a price earnings premium to the market.</p>

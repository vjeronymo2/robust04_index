			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Tremors on the television  The Bell Atlantic-TCI merger reflects US faith in the new age of multi-media communications A year of ever-increasing seismic rumblings in the US telecommunications industry culminated on Wednesday in an earthquake of colossal proportions which promises to transform the sector and give America a powerful push towards the long-heralded 'information age'. Bell Atlantic, the most innovative of the nation's giant 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies, announced plans to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the largest and most aggressive of the cable companies which pipe dozens of television channels into American homes. The agreed deal could end up worth more than Dollars 20bn - or more than Dollars 30bn with TCI's debt added in. Underpinning the deal is the belief that the combined forces of a telephone company and a cable company will be far better placed to exploit the new age of multi-media, interactive television than the two businesses acting alone. This is not in itself a new idea. In the UK, which has one of the world's most liberal regulatory environments, cable and telephone companies (including three Baby Bells) are already co-operating to build networks offering combined cable TV and telephone services. In the US, the earth tremors which preceded this week's deal came from other Baby Bells taking stakes in the cable industry. Southwestern Bell is spending Dollars 650m on two cable systems in the Washington area, while US West has spent Dollars 2.5bn buying a 25 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable and entertainment business. What is different, and important, about the Bell Atlantic deal is its scale and scope. By bringing together two of the largest and most aggressive players in their respective industries, it would create the first multi-media company with a national reach. And the fact that it is a full merger, rather than a loose alliance, should give the new Bell Atlantic greater management, technological and financial resources than most of its rivals to invest in creating a multi-media communications network - the 'information superhighways of the 21st century'  -and a powerful national brand name. It is hardly surprising, then, that Mr Raymond Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic, should immodestly describe the deal as a 'perfect information age marriage' and 'a model for communications companies in the next century'. Indeed, it is expected to set off a rush of takeovers of cable companies by the Baby Bells and some of the larger independent local phone companies scattered across the US, such as GTE. However, the TCI takeover also raises some huge questions about the emerging multi-media world. First, it would blow a big hole in the already crumbling regulatory wall erected by Washington between the US cable/entertainment and telephone industries. How much concentration of power - either horizontally between service providers or vertically with entertainment originators - should the federal government's anti-monopoly watchdogs sanction? And how much is commercially sensible? Second, to what extent will this deal, and any copycat ones, give other countries a push towards the introduction of multi-media services, and the US a global competitive advantage in supplying them? 'The principal asset this company will have is leadership,' says Mr John Malone, chief executive of TCI. 'I think it will be the leader of the industry on a worldwide basis.' Third, how much demand really exists for the brave new world of interactive multi-media when many consumers have trouble programming a video recorder or keeping track of the choices offered on a few dozen existing channels? Behind the frenzy of deal-making in the US telecoms and entertainment industries lies a technological revolution which is causing the phone, media and computer industries to converge in one giant sector, often called 'communicopia'. This is multi-media in nature because video, audio and data information can all be transformed into the same digital form and transmitted in vast quantities down modern fibre-optic cables to television terminals in homes, offices or mobile telephones. It is interactive because powerful microprocessors and sophisticated software embedded in the system are allowing the consumer to send more and more information back down the line. The day is not far off, insist communicopia evangelists, when someone sitting at home will be able to call up hundreds of channels of television, pay bank charges, or summon a movie at the press of a remote control button. More sophisticated uses could include contacting a friend in a distant city on a video phone and going on a joint TV shopping trip, browsing through video shopping catalogues together. The two industries best placed to package and distribute these new services are those which have existing wires going into US homes and offices - the local telephone companies, which provide virtually universal coverage, and the cable TV companies, which service some 60 per cent of US homes. Until recently, the two sides appeared to be squaring up for a fight over multi-media, but the spate of recent deals shows them recognising instead that they have complementary strengths. The cable companies understand programme packaging, and the coaxial cables they send into homes can carry much more traffic than the telephone companies' twisted copper. The phone companies have great financial strength, together with expertise in switching traffic - which is vital to the interactive part of the multi-media revolution. Technical change, therefore, has given a compelling logic to the combination of these two distribution industries, leaving the US regulatory framework lagging behind. It was only two years ago that the seven Baby Bells won a court case giving them the right to enter the information and entertainment industry. They had been banned from the sector, for fear of their monopoly power, under the 1984 anti-trust court settlement that spun off the Baby Bells from their parent, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which is restricted to the long-distance market. And the local phone companies are still banned from owning or buying video services in the regions where they also provide a telephone service, under a 1984 act designed to protect cable companies. However, in a landmark legal breakthrough, Bell Atlantic won a court case in Virginia in August allowing it to offer a cable service in its own region, on the grounds that the 1984 act violated the company's constitutional rights to free speech. The case is under appeal, and does not apply to the other Baby Bells, but it is a clear indication of the way the regulatory winds are blowing. It also gives added point to the deal with TCI. For while Bell Atlantic is obliged to sell TCI's cable operations which overlap with its region, it plans to set up new cable operations of its own, in competition with other local cable companies. Outside its own region, the new Bell Atlantic will also help TCI set up telephone operations, in competition with other Baby Bells. In other words, the deal envisages a world where two or more combined cable/telecommunications companies in each region will vie with one another to supply customers with multi-media services. Says Bell Atlantic's Mr Smith: 'I believe that when the regulators and Congress look at it they will see it is very competitive.' That is a moot point. While the Justice Department, which oversees anti-trust issues, and the Federal Communications Commission, which sets the detailed rules for the industry, may be fairly sanguine about the deal, several leading Democratic congressmen see it as potentially anti-competitive. According to Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives sub-committee on telecommunications and finance: 'Only through competition between the cable and telephone industries can we hope to bring consumers lower prices and greater choice.' One important question is whether consumers will be offered a genuine choice between competing multi-media companies in each region, but that may only become clear as the revolution unfolds. Another is whether the new distribution giants will have so much monopoly power that they can act as 'gatekeepers' - forcing independent providers of programmes to accept poor financial terms before distributing their products to homes. According to Mr Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, the monopoly power of the new Bell Atlantic and 'its ability to discriminate against broadcasters and other non-affiliated programmers is beyond all measure'. These concerns have been heightened by a rush among both Baby Bells and cable companies to form links vertically with programme producers - a trend demonstrated clearly in the current battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, and the Bell Atlantic deal. QVC, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn offer for Paramount, has financial links with TCI and is rumoured to have been in talks with several Bell companies about possible finance. A rival Dollars 7.5bn offer from cable group Viacom has Dollars 1.2bn in backing from Nynex, the Baby Bell serving the north-eastern US. As part of the TCI deal, Bell Atlantic wants to buy an associated company called Liberty Media, which has interests in several large cable programming channels. Bell Atlantic boasts that it will create 'the world's premier communications, information and entertainment company'. This general rush into programming could end with the telephone and cable companies paying high prices for creative assets which can walk out the door. And since cable law mandates that programmers sell their wares to all comers, at market prices, why is vertical integration so vital? The answer from the multi-media industry is not entirely convincing: the laws may change; a strong stream of in-house product allows greater scheduling flexibility; and in the final analysis the prime determinant of a service provider's success in the new age will be the quality of its programmes, which in turn should ensure high profit margins for production companies. All this, however, still leaves a huge question mark as to whether consumers want to pay for all these potential new services. The multi-media industry is hoping that at the very least it will be able to attract revenues from other large industries, such as the Dollars 50bn catalogue shopping sector or the Dollars 12bn video rental market. But the track record of some US experimental systems suggests that demand could be very slow in developing. At Cerritos, in California, where GTE has had a multi-media test running for four years, local enthusiasm for interactive services appears muted. However, this apparent reluctance to embrace the information age could change rapidly if technology now in the pipeline makes the service much more easy to use, and adds useful new services such as video telephones. Insists Mr Smith: 'The fear that there is no demand for multi-media services is totally misplaced. The surprise will be how fast the market develops.' As for international markets, the TCI deal could give Bell Atlantic something of an advantage over other US companies, though it remains to be seen what other powerful alliances emerge in the wake of this deal. Yet the formidable regulatory barriers faced by Bell Atlantic in the US are small compared with those it would face in continental Europe, where state-owned telephone companies have monopoly rights to voice services until 1998. But despite all these hurdles, Mr Smith may well be right in his judgment that 'the entire communications industry stands on the verge of a new growth curve the like of which we have never seen'. At least he's betting Dollars 30bn on it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       MAKING CONNECTIONS: LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES MOVE INTO VIDEO  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US WEST                                AMERITECH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bought 23 per cent stake in Time       No significant plans announced.

In a harsh note approved by all those  legislators who were present, the PT bloc voiced its  disagreement with the decision of the party leadership to ban  their participation in the constitutional revision, and held the  PT executive board responsible for any problems the PT's absence  may cause for the social and individual rights attained by the  National Constituent Assembly. PT leader Jose Fortunatti  asserted: "If the executive board has banned us from voting, it  has to assume the responsibility for this."    According to Fortunatti, the entire federal bloc was upset  by  the executive board's prohibition, regarded as an inappropriate  and authoritarian interference. Fortunatti commented: "So far,  most of the bloc has maintained a cautious attitude."  Fortunatti noted, however, that the unrest was obvious. From  the cautious attitude -- many remain silent during a crisis --  the bloc decided to make public its disagreement with the party  leadership. Fortunatti added: "The bloc unanimously rejects  the executive board's decision to not participate in the  constitutional revision."    Senator Eduardo Suplicy sees no other alternative for the  party leadership than to yield to the pressure being excerted by  the PT bloc.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Inflation drops to six-year low INFLATION fell to its lowest level for six years last month, as recent base rate cuts drove mortgage interest payments lower. Official figures showed yesterday that retail prices fell by 0.1 per cent in November bringing the annual rate of increase to 3 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to October. Retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments - an underlying measure favoured by the Treasury - fell to 3.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent in October. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, whose target range for this measure is 1-4 per cent, described the fall as 'very welcome news'. 'Clearly there is substantial disinflation in our economy,' he said. In spite of the latest drop in inflation, Mr Lamont again damped hopes of an early rate cut by insisting that he would not loosen monetary policy. Speaking after the figures were released, he said: 'We need to be resolute in the battle against inflation. We cannot give up on it.' Glimmers of a recovery in retail sales were encouraged by an announcement from the John Lewis Partnership, the department store chain, that Christmas demand was starting to pick up. Although total sales in the first week of this month were 1 per cent down on the same week a year ago, the company said sales of video games, personal computers and printers were buoyant. 'There is much left to play for and the next two to three weeks will be crucial,' it said. Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that headline inflation is now rising at its slowest rate since October 1986 when it was also 3 per cent. It is expected to carry on falling in the new year as the most recent base rate cut feeds through to the all-items index. However, the CSO said that higher import prices after sterling's devaluation in September had yet to affect prices. Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's treasury spokesman, said: 'Of course low inflation is important, but what people want to see is an end to rising unemployment and a start to growth in the economy.' Although lower mortgage payments were the main factor behind the sharp fall in the headline rate, prices were depressed in virtually every component of the RPI, particularly in seasonal foods, clothing and footwear. International comparisons of consumer price indices show that the UK's headline rate is less than the EC average of 4 per cent.

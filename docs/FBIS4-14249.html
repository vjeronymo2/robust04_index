			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview and public phone-in with Foreign Minister Shim'on </F> Peres by Nisim Mish'al in the studio on the weekly "Conference  Call" program -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified caller] The  press reports that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has advised  the prime minister against a full withdraw from the Golan  Heights, while the prime minister declared he is willing to  fully withdraw in return for full peace with Syria. In 1973,  the chief of staff advised the cabinet to call up the reserves  and, regrettably, the government decided otherwise, though the  price was different. In view of this, does the foreign minister  not think that maybe we should take the IDF estimate that we  should not withdraw from the Golan Heights more seriously?    [Peres] Allow me first to correct you. The prime minister  never said he favors a full withdrawal from the Golan. He said  that the depth of withdrawal will match the depth of peace, but  he did not say that we want full withdrawal. There are two  questions here: one is military and regards the General Staff,  the other is political and regards the government. The Army was  asked how can we win a war -- that is, should we hold on to  another mountain, which is reasonable. The government is asked  how to prevent a war. Let me ask you, which is more important  -- winning a war or preventing it? To prevent war, you need to  attain peace. Hence, the question is not whether or not to get  off the Golan Heights but how to attain peace. You should  honestly ask yourself: Can we attain peace with Syria while  holding on to the Golan Heights? If you want the State of  Israel to live from one war to another while always thinking  about how to win the next one, what kind of security is this?  In terms of security, peace is an asset more important than  army deployment. Peace is a weapon which protects Israel's  security.    [Mish'al] Mr. Peres, let us review your stands on the issue  of the Golan: You are for removing settlements from the Golan,  as the prime minister said, and you are for ceding the Golan in  return for a peace agreement. If so, what is there left to  negotiate; the duration of the withdrawal?    [Peres] I never said I am for relinquishing, or even for  saying I am for relinquishing, the entire Golan Heights.    [Mish'al] You are not for it?    [Peres] I am not for saying it. There are many questions  that I have asked, and I am not willing to give answers  regarding Israel before receiving answers that concern Israel.    [Mish'al] Excuse me, Mr. Peres, the press carry daily  reports in which you and Mr. Rabin announce concessions on the  Golan Heights, declare evacuation of settlements. Where else  did the Israeli public get this idea from?    [Peres] This will not work. You will not mislead me. Let  me tell you this: We say that we are willing to make  concessions on the Golan in order to reach peace with Syria. It  is clear to us that if we cede parts of the Golan Heights -- and  I am not referring to their size at this time -- no settlements  will remain there. The one follows from the other. I believe  in saying the truth. The time has come to stop pretending.    [Mish'al] Please, say the truth.    [Peres] I am. I believe that attaining a comprehensive  peace arrangement with Syria, including the Golan Heights, calls  for the attainment of several goals: I want this to be the last  agreement with the Arab world -- that is, after it is signed,  the Arab world will no longer boycott us, threaten us, or be in  a state of war with us. Al-Asad claims he is the leader of the  Arab world. This is the last peak over which we haggle. I want  this to be the last war we discuss.    [Mish'al] But while you attempt to conquer this peak, you,  Mr. Rabin, in fact the entire Israeli Government, announce a  willingness to make concessions. At the same time, we have not  heard anything from al-Asad.    [Peres] Why are you worried? If he makes no concessions,  there will be no agreement. Why are you so worried?    [Mish'al] You, who are negotiating with him, should be  worried.    [Peres] I am not worried. In general, we are talking as if  this is some ball. Everyone knows we have an agreement with  Egypt, and that this agreement was signed by a person who said  he will never give up the Sinai and he gave up on the entire  Sinai, thus setting a precedent.    [Mish'al] But there was a slight difference: Al-Sadat  announced he is ready to come to Jerusalem and address the  Israeli nation and the Knesset and announce his willingness to  make peace.    [Peres] I am all for al-Asad doing the same thing.    [Mish'al] Only he does not want to.    [Peres] We have no peace yet. Also, this is why we have no  agreement. I say that peace with Syria should be accompanied by  two types of agreements: A comprehensive peace between the  states and a thorough peace in terms of the issues, including  the strategic, tactical, and economic issues. This time, we  want a comprehensive peace. We do want an open wound. We want  real and comprehensive peace. We know the price; we know it is  painful; I do not have to announce it at the beginning of the  negotiations. [passage omitted]</p>

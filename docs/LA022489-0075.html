			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NCAA NOTIFIES MISSOURI OF INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> Missouri officials said they have been officially notified that the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. is investigating possible violations by the school's  basketball program.  </P> <P> That marks the first time the NCAA has formally investigated Missouri's  programs, said Chancellor Haskell Monroe, who announced the investigation after  a meeting of the school's Intercollegiate Athletic Committee. Monroe said he  received notice from NCAA officials Wednesday.  </P> <P> Monroe and Athletic Director Dick Tamburo said officials have not said when the  investigation will be complete. The school has hired a Chicago law firm to  review its compliance with NCAA rules, and both men said that investigation  would continue.  </P> <P> The mother of former Missouri player P.J. Mays has released to the media a tape  recording of a conversation between herself and Bob Sundvold, a Missouri  assistant coach. In the tape, Sundvold apparently talks about purchasing an  airline ticket for Mays, in violation of NCAA rules, and asks Mrs. Mays to help  cover it up.  </P> <P> Mays has also said he and other freshmen players received $100 each from  Sundvold, who has been suspended pending the school's investigation.  </P></p>

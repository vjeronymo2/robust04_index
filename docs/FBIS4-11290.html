			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 25 Apr (AFP) -- More than 20  persons were reportedly shot dead last Friday during a police  operation in the low-income neighborhood of Raboteau in Gonaives  (152 km northwest of Port-au-Prince), according to reports  received by AFP. Three bodies were found last Saturday, and some  20 others were found on Sunday and Monday morning.    The bodies, which were in an advanced state of decomposition  as they had been in the water and the region's usual heat, were  buried so the their exact number is difficult to determine.    The first account made available on Monday morning by the  private station Radio Metropole reported that at least four  persons were killed but added that the number of victims could  be greater because police were firing on fishing boats. [passage  omitted]    Numerous frightened residents of Raboteau abandoned the  neighborhood and moved to other parts of the city. So far there  has been no official confirmation of the incident, the most  serious to take place in the provinces recently.</p>

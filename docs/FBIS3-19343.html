			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After the demonstrations against the youth  vocational training contract (CIP), Budget Minister Nicolas  Sarkozy declared: "We will maintain the CIP. This is the  question that I would like to ask to all demonstrators." He  added, "Should we tolerate that 750,000 young people are  unemployed, or should we do something about it?" He insisted  that "we have to solve this problem, and we will solve it,"  adding "the question is not so much whether we stick to the CIP;  the question is: what is the formula to give jobs to  youngsters." Nicolas Sarkozy continued: "We suggest this  formula; nobody is suggesting another one. If it produces  results, if it reduces youth unemployment, we will have done  something useful for France." According to the minister, "all  traditional measures have failed." And he asked: "Why do you  want us to stop this experiment for electoral reasons? And what  if the French think it better to experiment than to fail?"</p>

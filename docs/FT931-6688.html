			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel: Waylaid by Dante's little paradise - Nigel Andrews is captivated by Italy's Ligurian Riviera and a pizza at Luigi's THE Ligurian Riviera is a chain of ambush posts set up by nature in concert with the Italian tourist board. Beautiful Viareggio, elegant Santa Margherita, enchanting Portofino: as dusk falls on your drive along the tunnel-strewn autostrada, it is hard to resist being waylaid. Beguiled by the advertisement for a four-star hotel sulla mare, you will find yourself happy and financially impoverished in the morning. My own favourite watering-place is Sestri Levante. Some guidebooks refer to it, rudely, as the most 'commercial' of the Riviera resorts, but it is hardly Blackpool. This exquisite peninsular town, between Lavagna and Levanto, pushes out into the sea and then rises into a park-size bluff at its end. On this verdant promontory, I spent two nights in a suite at the Hotel Dei Castelli with a balcony-cum-roof from which you can gaze down at both Sestri's beautiful shorelines. If I say that this little paradise once was praised by Dante and Petrarch, you will remark, rightly, that so was every other town in Italy if travel literature is believed. But, in Sestri at least, you see what might have provoked their transports. The town grows along a narrow isthmus. On one side is the long, commercial beach ending in a huddle of multi-coloured fishing vessels perched under the cliff. On the other side is a perfect crescent of shoreline created by the mainland to the north-east and the promontory to the south-west. Here, the light is silver, the cliffs a deep, breathing green, and the houses are painted in bright pastel washes. The silence is palpable even when there is noise about: I have never been in a place so mystifyingly serene. If you can bear smallish rooms, the Helvetia hotel, a pretty, white wedding cake overlooking the water, has a superb command of the bay. You can stroll from one end of town to the other in 30 minutes. Cars are as redundant here as in Venice, although, for canals, read narrow pedestrian shopping streets: up-market streets, too, as you run the gauntlet of Guccis and Versaces. Always try to look upwards. This way, you will avoid the lure of the costly shop windows and also notice a Sestri Levante speciality. The houses are painted with patterns: neo-Pompeian swags and flourishes, trompe l'oeil imitations of relief work, and decorative 'tiling' that is not tiling at all but an artist's mock-up. Viewed from afar, it all looks like Toytown. It can also behave like that. As in Venice, real life keeps sliding aside to be replaced by stage-set views and seemingly staged incidents. Surely the 12 Italian women who passed by me on a pavement, singing in perfect harmony some melodic Ligurian folk song, were laid on as a stunt? Surely I did not really see a gaily-coloured plaster dwarf built into the side of an old tree? (I did - my photo album proves it). And what about that seagull that sat in the sand and did not budge even when I approached to stroke it. I was struck by its poetic, ruminative look: perhaps it was the transmogrified spirit of Dante or Petrarch. The Hotel Dei Castelli - you drive to it up hair-pinning cobbled streets or, if on foot, ascend from the beach by a lift - consists of two crenellated villas set in a large garden. They were built from the rocks of the fallen Genoese castle that once stood here. Since the rooms are furnished monastically, you should take a suite and send your bank manager a pacifying postcard. My suite provided inspiring views, and more can be obtained by walking around the garden and then around the whole promontory. Only rickety fences prevent you from plunging down thyme-scattered cliffs into a cobalt sea. But enjoy the light, which is Capri-like, and also note the Marconi tower, a small, rude ruin whence the wireless inventor sent some early messages to listening battleships off La Spezia. It is evening, and I repair to Luigi's for a pizza. This is where Sestri Levante ascends from the magical to the completely uplifting. Luigi's is along the street from the town's other main hotel, the Balbi, with its garden guarded by stone lions and its interior that of a scarce-changed 18th century villa. Have a coffee here after Luigi's, or a drink before, and stroll between venues along a street balmy with night scents. At Luigi's itself, insist on a pizza diavola burnt to a near crisp, and irrigate it with some cold house wine. If you feel the need to get out and about while based at Sestri, visit the Cinque Terre. These are five remote fishing villages lying to the town's east. Once, they were so inaccessible that their inhabitants never saw a tourist and scarcely saw an Italian from another part of the country. Alternatively, drive to Varese Ligure, where a 15th century castle awaits you and where the local nuns make an income from tempting you with scivette (marzipan flowers). Back in Sestri itself, the only thing you cannot do with ease - be warned - is sea-bathe. There is water everywhere but it is usurped by boats. If you stay at the Hotel Dei Castelli, you can use its bathing facility: a rocky inlet between cliffs. Very picturesque. But time your dip for the brief space of time in which the sun peers, sometimes furiously, into the chasm. Otherwise, pencil-in bathing for the second leg of your Italian holiday. Sestri Levante is for land-lubbers only: those who like to look at the sea without getting involved too closely.</p>

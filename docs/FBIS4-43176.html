			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "No-Voter Forms His Own"] </F>   [Text] Member of Parliament Bjorn von der Esch, Moderate  Party, from Vagnharad, who was rejected [from the party list],  is forming his own party to continue his opposition to the  European Union [EU].    "I am convinced that it is possible to get into the  Riksdag,"  he says.    In the election this fall he hopes to be able to gather  no-voters in Sodermanland Province from all political parties.  The new party will enter the election on one issue -- preventing  Swedish membership in the EU. The names on the list will span  the entire political field, according to Bjorn von der Esch.    "The yes side has joined from left to right. The no side  should do the same," he believes, and this weekend he will  travel to Lund to talk some more about his plans during the  organization No to EU's convention.    The party name is still secret, however.    "The period for registration of party names has ended. If I  were now to say what the list will be called, anyone could steal  the name."    Bjorn von der Esch was rejected by the Moderates because of  his strong opposition to the EU. Since then, support for him has  been strong both from friends in the party and others. However,  12 percent of the votes in the election are needed to enter the  Riksdag from a list in Sodermanland Province.    "If I succeed, it will really give the political  establishment something to think about. In the Riksdag  opposition to the EU is represented by only 3-4 percent of the  delegates, while more than half the Swedish people has a  negative opinion."    Hans Lindqvist, chairman of the organization No to EU,  welcomes the initiative.    "He will certainly do very well. There are lots of  nonsocialist voters who are critical of the EU."</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: TCI adds twist to Paramount battle THE COMPLEX takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film and entertainment company, grew even more convoluted yesterday when Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service company in the US, announced plans to re-merge with Liberty Media, a company it spun off two years ago. Liberty, which provides programming for the cable industry, is a large shareholder in QVC Network, the television home shopping company which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount. Liberty is making a new Dollars 500m investment in QVC to help it fund the Paramount bid, which is competing against an agreed offer from Viacom, a cable service and programming company, worth around Dollars 7.5bn. Reacquiring Liberty would bring TCI much more closely into the battle for Paramount. This could reassure Wall Street that QVC, a much smaller company than Paramount, has the financial strength to wage what promises to be a long and costly battle, with both sides trying to attract support from other large communications companies. TCI spun off Liberty in 1991 to comply with federal regulations limiting concentration in the cable television and programming industries, but the rules have turned out to be less stringent than the sector expected. Links between the two companies have remained strong. TCI holds a 5 per cent stake in Liberty and TCI's chief executive, Mr John Malone, is chief executive of Liberty and its controlling shareholder. The two groups said yesterday their boards had approved a combination in principle because it was difficult to monitor regulatory compliance as separate operations. Viacom said this would have no effect on its plans to take over Paramount but added that the Liberty deal underscored the concerns it raised in a lawsuit against TCI, accusing Mr Malone of trying to monopolise the cable industry. TCI said the proposed deal with Liberty would be structured as a tax-free exchange of Class A and B shares of both companies for like shares in a holding company yet to be formed. Its shareholders would receive one share of the new company for each of their shares, while Liberty holders would receive 0.975 of a new share for each of their shares.</p>

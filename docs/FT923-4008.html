			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon may sell core businesses HARLAND SIMON, the control systems company where share dealings were suspended last Friday pending 'clarification' of its financial situation, is urgently reviewing its business plan and may decide to sell core operations. Harland is conducting the review with Hambros Bank, its financial adviser, after Barclays, the group's main commercial banker, indicated last week that its banking facilities were being cut by up to one third. A source close to the company said its survival was still not guaranteed. 'But it looks a good deal more hopeful than four days ago,' he said. Barclays said discussions were continuing. Harland's problems began when it received the proceeds from the sale of Vickereys, a specialist blade and equipment maker. It expected about half the Pounds 6.9m proceeds would remain with Barclays, which extended most of Harland's Pounds 14m overdraft, while the remainder would come back to it as working capital. However, Barclays appeared to be concerned by the recent collapse in Harland's share price, as well as rumours about declining orders, and kept all the money. Harland's overdraft was repayable upon demand. Its shares were suspended at 20p, compared to a high for the year of 653p. The latest review of business strategy goes further than a similar one in February by Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman following the departure of Mr Roy Ashman ahead of unexpected losses. The first review led to the sale of Vickereys and the intended disposal of Contraves, an electronic control company bought last year. Harland hoped these sales would leave it free to concentrate on its remaining core businesses of controls, automation and image processing. However, the working capital crisis has forced the company to consider further disposals, withdrawing from some markets or other ways to scale back operations.</p>

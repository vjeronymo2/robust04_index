			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Flaw space An Englishman's home is his castle. Keith and Mary Baker were determined to defend theirs. In April local councils across the UK introduced the replacement for the much-hated poll tax, one of the then Mrs Thatcher's less successful ventures into social engineering. The new tax bears the rather anodyne name 'council tax'. It works simply; the more valuable your house, the higher the level of tax you pay. Many homeowners are protesting that their houses have been over-valued, and that the tax they must pay is therefore excessive. But from the Bakers' Hertfordshire battlements came the protestation that they were paying too little. They told the Journal of Public Finance that their appeal has a rational basis. A low valuation for tax purposes might mean they won't be able to sell their house for the sum they want. Result? Happiness all round. The taxman gets an extra Pounds 100, money which the Bakers think is well spent.</p>

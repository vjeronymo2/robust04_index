			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: The magic of Monterey Bay - Golf JOHN Steinbeck never knew much about golf. As far as we know he did not play  -unlike John Updike, who seems to do little else these days. On the other hand, Steinbeck was plus-four at writing. He was born in California and used his home state as a setting for books. In Travels With Charley, for instance, there is a passage in which he climbs to a peak overlooking Monterey Bay and remarks to his companion: 'In the spring, Charley, when the valley is carpeted with blue lupins like a flowery sea, there's the smell of heaven up here . . .' Next week the best players in the world will gather at Pebble Beach golf club on the Monterey Peninsula, three hours' drive south of San Francisco, to compete in the 92nd US Open. They could be forgiven for not keeping their eye on the ball, for no US Open course can match Pebble Beach in splendour of setting. Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have described the Monterey Peninsula 'as the greatest confluence of land and water in the world.' Go and stand on the seventh tee at Pebble Beach and you will see what Stevenson meant. To your left is the chocolate-box town of Carmel where Clint Eastwood was once mayor and still owns a restaurant. Drinking tea, wearing tweeds, sitting by open log fires and going for walks are what people do in Carmel. To your right is Cypress Point, the course which, to my thinking, comes nearest to being the one in the whole world I could happily play for the rest of my life. As you stand in this privileged position, you see beneath you sea lions on the rocks, weaving their fat brown necks from side to side and croaking so loudly it is hard to concentrate on your tee shot. At little more than 100 yards, the hole is easy on a calm day but as calm days come along in these parts as often as a hole in one, you had better be prepared for anything. 'Depending on the wind, it can be anything from a wedge to a two-iron,' says Jack Nicklaus. He, more than anyone, should know. Nicklaus and Pebble Beach are locked together in a grip as unremitting as Nicklaus's own. He won the US Amateur there in 1961 and the US Open on the same course in 1972. In 1982, Nicklaus stood by the side of the 18th green waiting to see whether Tom Watson, at that moment on the 17th tee, could birdie one of the last two holes to tie with him for the US Open. Moments later Watson chipped in to the hole from the thick grass that lapped the edge of the green. It was a stroke of genius, one that he probably could not repeat if he had hit another 1,000 balls, he said. Buoyed by this success, Watson birdied the 18th as well and defeated Nicklaus by two strokes. Next week's will be only the third US Open ever held at Pebble Beach. When it first moved there, someone wrote, it was like the US Supreme Court turning up in Marrakesh. The US Open was 42 years old before it went further west than Minneapolis and 45 before it crossed the Mason-Dixon line. It was 48 before it moved to California, to Riviera golf club in Los Angeles. It is not that California does not have enough good golf courses, but rather that the conservatives of the US Golf Association took some persuading of the merit of California. Once they saw what was out there and realised that Pebble Beach was not just a pretty patsy of a golf course - it is almost as difficult as it is beautiful - they could not move fast enough. The course was designed by Jack Neville, a crack amateur golfer, on land bought by Samuel Morse at the time of the first world war. It had then, as it has today, eight holes on cliffs overlooking Carmel Bay and 10 that wind this way and that. It measures a shade under 7,000 yards. It is a beautiful course which reaches its conclusion with a flourish, a par-five curving like a scimitar along the bay. Gary Player once took an eight at this hole, and Fred Couples a nine. If previous Opens at Pebble Beach are any guide, we are in for a treat next week. I hope so. John Steinbeck would be pleased.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti shareholders favour administration if GEC bid fails Disgruntled Ferranti Internat-ional shareholders are urging that the defence electronics group should be placed in administration rather than receivership if GEC's token 1p a share bid is reject-ed. A court-appointed administrator's role is to try to secure the survival of the company as a going concern, or achieve a more advantageous realisation of the company's assets than available through a receiver's winding up of the company. Mr John Katz, chairman of the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association, has challenged GEC and Ferranti and their financial advisers to explain why the offer document fails to mention the possibility of administration if the bid fails. In a letter yesterday to SG Warburg, GEC's adviser, Mr Katz wrote: 'There may be factual considerations which applied in the (Ferranti) board preferring to propel the company to receivership if and when your offer is voted down . . . instead of protecting through administration the banks, creditors, employees, customers, contractors and shareholders of Ferranti. 'Or possibly, certain banks have denied a petition to allow administration.' Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, has told the group's 48,000 shareholders that if GEC's offer is not accepted by shareholders representing at least 90 per cent of the group's 1bn outstanding shares on December 8, the closing date for the offer, the banks will be asked to appoint a receiver. There are some important differences between receivership and administration, according to Mr Robert Dow, an editor of PLC, the practical law magazine for companies. The main duty of a receiver, who is generally appointed by a secured creditor such as a bank, is to protect the interest of the bank whereas an administrator is appointed by the court and protects the interests of the company and general body of creditors. An administrator enjoys the benefit of a statutory freeze on enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies, a benefit which is not available to a receiver. However, Mr Dow warned that administration was generally only advantageous when a company was experiencing temporary cash flow problems, or where no creditor was able or willing to appoint a receiver. 'If Ferranti's financial position is as bad as the company appears to say, with no immediately foreseeable improvement, it is difficult to see how shareholders could benefit from administration.' In any event, secured creditors may be able to block an administration. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, notice has to be given to anyone entitled to appoint a receiver as soon as a petition for an administration order is presented. This means that if any of Ferranti's secured creditors, including the 15 banks which are owed some Pounds 100m, chooses to appoint a receiver under a properly drafted charge, administration would not be an option anyway.</p>

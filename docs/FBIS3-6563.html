"To assume that we have the sole monopoly in our  understanding of democracy and human rights constitutes a form  of arrogance," Anwar said.    Anwar, who was in Honolulu for an Asia-Pacific finance  ministers meeting, said he raised Malaysia's concern of the U.S.  human rights policy in a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen. Anwar was particularly critical of the U.S.  policy of linking China's human rights record to its most  favored nation trading status in the United States.    Linking trade issues with human rights amounts to "forc(ing)  down the throat of other countries to see your point of view,"  Anwar said.    Anwar, who serves as Malaysia's finance minister, said the  United States should "listen a bit more" on political realities  in other countries. When it comes to human rights, "you must  show a lot of tolerance and understanding," Anwar said.</p>

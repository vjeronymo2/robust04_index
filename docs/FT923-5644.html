			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Russia warns it cannot repay debt RUSSIA can repay 'no more than Dollars 2bn' of its foreign debt this year, Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister, said yesterday, indicating the extent of the government's budgetary squeeze. His comments came as a Russian delegation in Paris continued to press representatives of the Group of Seven industrialised countries (G7) for a rapid rescheduling of the estimated Dollars 70bn debt chalked up by the former Soviet Union. Yesterday's meeting followed discussions in Munich last month between Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, and the G7 heads of state, when they agreed to his request for a moratorium on the debt issue. The deputy finance ministers met to work out a mechanism for the rescheduling of the Dollars 70bn of debt before next month's Paris Club meeting of the former Soviet Union's principal creditors. Earlier in the week, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the vice-prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, said Russia's hard currency revenues were severely limited and the government was running Dollars 4bn behind on debt payments. Russia would have to postpone payments by the end of the year in the absence of a debt rescheduling, he warned. Russia's debt and interest payments have continued to be deferred but the country was aiming to make repayments of Dollars 10bn in 1992. Russia is the only country in the Commonwealth of Independent States attempting to service the former Soviet Union's debt. More encouraging news on Russia's economy came yesterday from Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, a leading reformer and deputy chairman of the committee on managing state property. He predicted that production levels would begin to pick up sharply from next year after experiencing a severe slump in 1992.</p>

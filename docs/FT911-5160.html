			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ron Brierley in GPG restructuring package SIR RON Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, is to take over the running of GPG, the British investment company, in a restructuring deal announced yesterday. Brierley Investments (BIL), which recently distanced itself from its founder, intends to reduce its shareholding in GPG from 63 per cent to 40 per cent by selling 74m shares at 15p each to Australasian investors. Sir Ron will buy 3 per cent of GPG from his former investment vehicle for the same price. He was founder president of BIL, the New Zealand-based international investment concern that he created and chaired until last month. All ordinary shareholders will be given 10p per share, and 86 per cent of the par value of Pounds 726,000 of preference shares will be repaid plus the accrued dividends of 6.3 per cent - the preference dividend has been passed three times. The shares of GPG, one wing of the former Guinness Peat Group, were suspended in December at the time of its sale of Management Compensation Group. That left GPG as a shell company, the reason for its suspension, with about Pounds 65m in cash and net-assets of 22p a share. Three BIL investments which Sir Ron has been personally involved with are to be sold to GPG for Pounds 6.8m. The major holdings are 29.86 per cent of Stanley Gibbons Holdings, 14.99 per cent of Villa D'Este and 12.49 per cent of Allgas Energy. The restructuring package, which was negotiated by the GPG board with the parent company, Industrial Equity (Pacific) and the holding company BIL, will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on May 13. Sir Ron hopes the International Stock Exchange will restore GPG's listing once it has secured its independence from BIL, widened its shareholder base and reduced its cash.</p>

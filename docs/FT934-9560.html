			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bank governor's advice to industry 'nonsense' Sir, Mr Eddie George's comments on the rule of business in fighting inflation ('Bank governor tells businesses to hold margins', November 4) left me wondering quite how he imagines the world to be organised outside the confines of Threadneedle Street. 'If we can persuade you that we will deliver sustained non-inflationary growth, I would hope we might see businesses seeking to generate profits through higher volumes and less through higher margins.' What is this nonsense? What does the Bank of England produce, manufacture, distribute or retail which will generate growth in gross domestic product? The Bank does not produce anything which measurably adds to GDP. It is companies that produce goods and services which are sold to satisfy the needs of consumers. And they are being told not to change their prices. In a market economy competitive companies change prices all the time in order to maximise their profits, maybe by introducing better quality goods, maybe exploiting temporary opportunities which are then competed away by rival companies entering the market. Any first-year economics undergraduate knows that prices are the primary signalling device of a market economy; interfere with this and you prevent competition from working effectively. Perhaps Mr George is concerned by the lack of competition in British industry, but then he should speak to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than issue Canute-like exhortations to industry. Of course, perhaps Mr George did not mean his comments to be taken seriously. If so, he has succeeded.

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chipcom Corp - Correction Our November 23 report of the breakdown of the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ automated price display system on November 19 attributed this in good faith to the failure of a Chipcom hub in the Exchange's ethernet network. We now understand that the problem was caused by the failure of a transceiver not manufactured by Chipcom. We apologise for any embarrassment caused by the error.</p>

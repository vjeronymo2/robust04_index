			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> CHEMICAL PLANTS A TOUCHY ISSUE FOR LOUISIANIANS;  </P> <P> PHARMACIST IS BELIEVED BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BOYCOTTED BECAUSE SHE WARNED OF  MISCARRIAGES.  </P> <P> Here in the heart of what is commonly called Louisiana's chemical corridor, a  woman who three years ago questioned the relationship between illness and  chemical contamination may be paying a price for her candor.  </P> <P> In 1987, Kay Gaudet, the pharmacist in this city's only drugstore, asked state  officials to investigate the area's miscarriage rate after logging about 65  miscarriages out of a population of 2,100 in a 26-month period. According to  Gaudet, one of every three pregnancies in that period ended in a miscarriage.  </P> <P> Today, Gaudet's drugstore is closed, a victim of a declining clientele that  some people believe was part of an economic boycott started by several area  chemical plants. The industry denies that there was an organized boycott.  Meanwhile, a study conducted by Tulane University in New Orleans, which said  that St. Gabriel's miscarriage rate is not abnormal, remains the subject of a  heated debate in Louisiana.  </P> <P> "There was a boycott, but it was never officially announced," said Peggy  Hoffman, who suffered a miscarriage. "Kay was a target, she was harassed, and  some customers told her they could no longer come to her drugstore because  pressure was being put on them by their employers."  </P> <P> Gaudet has since taken a teaching job in Baton Rouge and no longer talks to the  press about the miscarriage controversy. "I think she's very discouraged," said  her husband, Chris Gaudet, a pharmacist at the local prison.  </P> <P> St. Gabriel and the surrounding Iberville and Ascension parishes are the home  to 15 heavy chemical plants which, along with the dozen or so other plants,  release as much as 200 million pounds of carcinogens such as benzene, ethylene  dichloride and carbon tetrachloride annually.  </P> <P> St. Gabriel, situated near the Mississippi River, where 120 more chemical  plants and refineries dot the map, has been largely a company town since World  War II, when petrochemical companies built refineries by the riverbank to be  near shipping lines.  </P> <P> But, as the industries boomed throughout the 1970s and '80s, many  environmentalists wondered what effect the toxic debris and smoky air were  having on the local community. "This has long been a state with serious  environmental problems," said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a former president of the  Louisiana chapter of the Sierra Club. "It only stands to reason that, with so  many chemicals in our environment . . . there would eventually be serious  ramifications with our health. I think Kay's questions pointed in that  direction and made a lot of people uncomfortable."  </P> <P> The Tulane study, which was undertaken with state cooperation after Gaudet  disclosed her miscarriage statistics, said that, out of 430 pregnancies in  Iberville Parish between 1982 and 1987, 54 were documented miscarriages, an  almost 13% rate, which one of the Tulane researchers, Jacqueline Clarkson, said  was "well within the national miscarriage rate."  </P> <P> But researchers for the Center for Environmental Health Studies in Boston this  summer criticized the Tulane study as "fraught with problems" and said it  "should be considered inconclusive."  </P> <P> Officials of the Louisiana Chemical Assn. feel differently. "The study was well  done, well executed and generally regarded as a model epidemiological study,"  said Ed Flynn, health affairs coordinator with the association.  </P> <P> Almost all of the larger refineries sponsored Earth Day activities earlier this  year and have implemented school programs designed to highlight the positive  benefits that result from a large chemical-based industry.  </P> <P> "All we've tried to do is make people aware of the good we do," said Richard  Kleiner, a spokesman for the chemical association. "Generally . . . most . . .  companies here are environmentally aware . . . . From 1988 to 1989, we reduced  our emissions by about 38%, and that trend will continue."  </P> <P> In St. Gabriel, however, where the night sky is bright with lights shining from  the always busy chemical plants, some residents still harbor doubts. "Most of  the companies have done everything they can think of to divert attention away  from the real issues," said Chris Gaudet. "And, by and large, they've been  successful. A lot of people here worry about losing their jobs, they really  don't want to talk about what these plants might be doing to their health."  </P></p>

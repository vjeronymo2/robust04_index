The following is the text of the message:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    The brother chairman and members of the expanded people's  gathering of the Aden Governorate.    It is my pleasure to extend to you and all the sons of the  valiant Aden Governorate my best wishes and congratulations on  the blessed month of Ramadan during which your gathering is  convening.    No doubt, your gathering is a positive step and bodes well  for carrying the accord document -- once it is finally signed in  a few days, God willing -- to a new stage. The most important  features of this stage is that it ensures sound development,  progress, peace, and unity for unified Yemen.    You are meeting in valiant Aden, which occupies a special  place in the heart of every Yemeni, since this city witnessed  the greatest positions and noblest sacrifices for the triumph of  the 26 September and 14 October Yemeni revolutions against  invaders.    In Yemen's contemporary history, this city has been a bright  center and a source of radical historical changes, most  important of which is raising the flag of unity to flutter high  in its skies. Also, Aden witnessed the signing of a historic  unionist agreement on 30 November 1989. This valiant city,  which occupies a special place in the heart of every Yemeni, has  remained a city for honorable unionists of the Yemeni homeland,  which is proceeding today toward great changes. These changes  will achieve for our people more progress, stability, and peace,  God willing, under the banner of the young Yemeni Republic and  under the umbrella of the blessed unity, which rid our people of  fragmentation, disunity, and backwardness, toward a new world of  progress and development. This could never have happened  without unity.    While blessing your assembly and blessing all positive steps  and national efforts, we tell you that we are very eager to  embody and put into action the accord document, which is a  practical way out of the political crisis. This document also  expresses national consensus. We hope that this document will  end all the misunderstandings and disputes that have harmed the  interests of the people and the homeland and hampered  development efforts in the homeland.    We are confident that your assembly's decisions and  recommendations will further enhance the building of unity and  the homeland's march. These will be added to what your brothers  in the rest of the governorates have contributed. Your  decisions and recommendations will also emphasize adherence to  our national principles, foremost are unity and democracy, and  eagerness to safeguard higher national interests.    We are also fully confident that the masses of the valiant  Aden Governorate best reflect the city's history and role, as  well as its great national stands in national struggle against  hostile and imperialist forces until victory was achieved. Aden  became brighter after the proclamation of the state of unity on  22 May 1990. It was a glorious day that dispelled the darkness  of fragmentation in the life of our people, ended for good  decades of domination and persecution, and ushered in a new era  in the life of Yemen based on justice, freedom, and respect for  human rights.    Our people have suffered a great deal as a result of the  crisis and its negative effects, manifested in price hikes, a  drop in the value of the national currency, obstructing work at  government departments, administrative chaos, and other  phenomena. All these phenomena got worse because of the  escalation of the political crisis. As we are about to  implement the accord document, we hope that all these  regrettable phenomena will end. Our patient people have endured  all the negative effects of these phenomena for the sake of  unity and democracy.    Despite all the misunderstandings and irregularities that  accompanied the regrettable crisis, our people, in all their  factions and forces, will maintain their cohesion, strength, and  ability to face challenges. Our people will also look with hope  and optimism toward ending this accidental crisis and will not  be influenced by malicious propaganda that tries to take  advantage of this crisis to undermine our national principles,  fragment our national unity, and cause bloody conflict,  dissension, and catastrophes in Yemen whose scope is only known  to God.    However, the people's vigilance and awareness of the  objectives of Yemen's enemies has denied the enemies any chance  to achieve these objectives. Also, the awareness and vigilance  of the Armed Forces and security agencies -- and this national  institution's awareness of the scope and dangers of being  carried away by the enemies' schemes -- has thwarted all  conspiracies and emphasized that the army of September and  October is the army of Yemeni unity and is for all the people.  This army cannot but share the same views and options of the  the people, away from all influences, and defend the homeland,  its sovereignty, unity, and democracy.    Concluding, I greet you again and wish your assembly success  along the path of defending unity and democracy.    Peace be upon you.    Also, a message from brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice  chairman  of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], was read.    To begin, the message conveyed the YSP Political Bureau's  wishes for the success of this important gathering. It stated  that the YSP remains true to the position it chose for itself in  the course of the struggle of the Yemeni people for their  freedom and comprehensive social progress.    The message stressed that the YSP, which has contributed,  along with all national forces, toward drafting the accord  document, will be faithful to the implementation of this  document.    The gathering opened its activities yesterday evening with  several speeches and poems. Brother Fadl 'Ali 'Abdallah, head  of the preparatory committee of the Aden gathering, made a  speech in which he welcomed the attendees. He noted the  importance of holding such a gathering in Aden, which saw the  birth of the accord document. The Yemeni masses think of this  document as a solution that embodies a comprehensive national  program.    Other speeches were made on behalf of other mass gatherings  in the governorates of Ibb, Hadramaut, and Shabwah, expressing  hope for their success. Leaders for the gathering's committees  were elected and a plan of action was read, reviewing the  situation of the homeland. The plan was discussed by the  attendees.</p>

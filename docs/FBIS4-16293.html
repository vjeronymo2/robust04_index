			<p>BFN     [Text] It was announced today at a news conference by Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius that the form of work by the  Lithuanian Government is to be changed in the immediate future.  All decisions will be made at closed meetings, and then the  government press attache will comment on them to journalists and  the public.    Such practice exists in many countries. This does not mean  that government work will be secret. We free journalists from  taking part in weary meetings, said the prime minister.</p>

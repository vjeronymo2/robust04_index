			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Warning on export insurance BRITAIN could become the only European country without government cover for export risk unless ministers rethink their plans, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday, Alison Smith writes. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr Cook emphasised the difficulties experienced by the commercial insurance market since the Export Credits Guarantee Department was partly privatised. There was, he said, 'broad agreement that there is not the capacity to provide export reinsurance, particularly for political risk'. His warning follows last week's figures showing the trade deficit had reached its highest monthly level for 2 1/2 years, and Mr John Major's appeal to exporters to play a leading role in bringing about economic recovery. Government reinsurance for political risk is due to be discontinued in 1994.</p>

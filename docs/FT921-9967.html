			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Off The Wall (An Arts Diary): Competing in a cold climate THE BBC is hopping into bed with businessmen with increasing frequency these days. It has yet to tempt anyone with its Proms - the Pounds 5m sponsorship price tag, and strict controls on the type of client it wants and what it will permit them to do, has stalled that one - but BBC Wales has found a buyer for its top arts programme, the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition. BP is putting up almost Pounds 300,000 to link itself with the 1993 competition and is also committed for 1995, with an option on 1997. With Lloyds Bank backing the Young Musician of the Year contest with Pounds 1.3m, the BBC has now found partners for two of its trio of prestige musical events. But if the BBC, under Government prodding, is forced to look towards business for extra funding, so business is gettingmore hard headed about sponsorship. Falling profits, mass redundancies, and carping investors have brought an end to the days when companies joyfully proclaimed their desire to return something to the community. Given its current difficulties it is not surprising that BP, which spread Pounds 1m a year over a mass of good arts causes, is changing tack, concentrating a frozen budget on fewer but bigger sponsorships, and looking for links - like the Singer of the World Competition - which guarantee media coverage and corporate branding. Unfortunately the first casualty of rationalisation has been another singing competition, the Aldeburgh based Peter Pears, which, thanks to Pounds 80,000 sponsorship from BP, had enhanced the careers of young singers of lieder and opera in the mould of Pears. Last year's winner, Anne-Christine Goransson, was reckoned a great find and there are high expectations for part of her prize, a Purcell Room concert on March 3. There may be stronger singing in the Valleys, but Aldeburgh is numbed as it seeks a new sponsor for its competition in a cold climate. The recession, and the subsequent fall in land values, has, in theory, impoverished many owners of great houses and wide acres. When the recession combines with an unexpected death, theory can become painful fact. This has happened at Luton Hoo, the magnificent Robert Adam home which was stacked with treasures by the late Sir Harold Wernher, following the tragic death last year of his grandson and heir, Nicholas Phillips. The silence which descended on the property as the family contemplated the tax bill and business debts is slowly lifting. Intense discussions are underway with Christie's over what must be sold and what can be saved, with the family pulled in many directions. There is a desire to save the Wernher collection, a magnificent, if eclectic, assembly of medieval ivories and bronzes, tapestries, Chinese and continental porcelain, some good Old Masters, and the Russian icons and Faberge contributed by Sir Harold's wife Zia, a niece of the last Czar. So far only one work of art has been selected for disposal, Constable's view of Harnham Bridge, Salisbury, which was first on public display at last year's Constable show at the Tate. Given the state of demand for British pictures it will probably carry an estimate of under Pounds 2m. It is doubtful whether this will be enough to see off the family's creditors. And even if the unthinkable is considered, the disposal of Luton Hoo, there is no chance of getting a fair price for the property in the current climate unless the Government, working through the heritage bodies, offers a negotiated tax deal. Canary Wharf, London Dockland's most blatant development, was full to capacity last Thursday: indeed it was turning potential customers away by the hundred. This is not the Olympia &amp; York office complex, of course, but Cabot Hall, the arts centre inside the structure, which is proving a roaring success. The attraction was jazzman Roy Ayres. An extra attraction was that, like all events at Cabot Hall, admission was free. This is posing problems for the arts director, Helen Marriage, who somehow has to balance supply and demand and the conflicting interests of Canary Wharf's 3,000 office workers - who think the events are designed for their amusement; the local residents -  who see them as one tangible benefit to emerge after the years of construction turmoil; and the visiting fans who have braved the Dockland Light Railway to get there and are in no mood to shrug and go home quietly. There have been disappointed customers for dance, classical music, even mime events. Only contemporary music has failed to fill the 500 seat venue, although, in contrast, the current contemporary jazz season threatens to stretch the free admission policy to the limit, especially when the legendary American guitarist John Scofield plays his only British date there on March 24. For Scofield there are plans to erect a giant screen in the gardens to cope with the crush. O &amp; Y used the arts to stimulate interest in its big New York office development on the tip of Manhattan and it worked. It seems to be repeating the trick here. The annual cost, around Pounds 1m a year for over 100 events, is negligible compared with its investment in Canary Wharf, and for prospective tenants the sight of people excitedly milling around is an unanticipated tonic. Few queues meanwhile in the West End where Phantom and Joseph are the only shows hard of access. Even so, compared with the economic state of the nation, the theatre did not do at all badly last year. Almost 11m people took in a West End performance, just 3.7 per cent down on the record 1990. The most encouraging feature was the build up in audiences during the year. Attendances were 7 per cent down in the summer but by November the fall was only 3 per cent and in the month before Christmas they were actually 12 per cent higher than in 1990. The revival has continued into the New Year. Of course the fact that over half the theatres open were showing escapist musicals, an unprecedented proportion, accounts for much of the success. By the end of the year musicals were doing 7 per cent better box office business than in 1990 although, because of the flood of new cabaret style product, the overall audience had fallen from 83 per cent of capacity to 76 per cent. So if you want to take in a show tonight it might not be impossible to get tickets. In contrast Broadway is in deep depression. In the second week in January, with the holiday celebrations over, four shows closed and box office receipts fell by almost 30 per cent. Like London, New York is looking towards musicals, especially old musicals, to save the day. Crazy for You, a reworking of Gershwin's Girl Crazy, has just opened and Guys and Dolls and Man of La Mancha are about to.</p>

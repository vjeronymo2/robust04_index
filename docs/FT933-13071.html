			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / No easy answers to job questions: Rising employment and wage flexibility have gone hand in hand in America's market economy It may seem ironic that President Bill Clinton has taken the lead in proposing an international 'jobs summit' this autumn. Many of his Group of Seven colleagues would regard the current US unemployment rate as a mark of success rather than failure. In the recession, the US jobless rate peaked at less than 8 per cent. It has already fallen to 7 per cent, well below the double-digit rates projected for much of the European Community. By EC standards, the US barely understands the meaning of the phrase 'long-term unemployment': according to OECD figures, in 1991 (a recession year) only 6 per cent of the jobless in north America were out of work for 12 months or more, against nearly 50 per cent in the European Community. The US's job creation record over the past two decades, meanwhile, is often cited as a classic illustration of the virtues of flexible labour markets. In spite of temporary setbacks during recessions, non-farm employment has grown at a staggering pace: from 71m in 1971 to 110m this June, an increase of 55 per cent. No other large industrial country has come near to matching this performance. The US generated jobs twice as quickly as Japan over this period and more than five times as rapidly as leading European economies such as Germany, France and Britain. And nearly all the job growth in the US was in the private sector. Until the mid-1980s, when private sector employment began to expand slowly, most European jobs were created by public-sector agencies and thus financed by higher taxes. Yet the Clinton administration draws little comfort from this impressive record. Far from considering his own labour market as a paragon of virtue, Mr Clinton frets that: The jobs miracle may be over - US employment has barely increased in three years; Real wages have grown very slowly for two decades, raising doubts about the quality of jobs; Pay differentials are growing, leading to unprecedented inequality of family incomes. Behind these specific worries lies an inchoate fear: that increasingly fierce competition from east Asia and parts of Latin America is reducing the proportion of Americans that can afford the trappings of a 'middle-class' lifestyle, such as a vacation home and college education for their children. The point was brought home in a recent speech by Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. He recalled visiting a Sanyo plant in Tijuana, Mexico, which manufactures circuit boards for TV sets. The workers apparently achieved higher quality and productivity than their counterparts in Sanyo's Japanese or US plants, yet earned only about Dollars 1 an hour. The moral he drew was that Dollars 1 an hour labour in countries such as Mexico or China 'can equal or surpass our labour in simple or very complicated manufacturing tasks'. In other words, in an intensification of the trends of the 1980s, foreign competition might drive down the wages even of highly skilled American factory workers. Worries about the quantity - as opposed to the quality - of US jobs seem exaggerated. By the standards of past business cycles, jobs are admittedly being created slowly during the present recovery: employment has only just surpassed the pre-recession peak reached in the summer of 1990. But many pundits forget that labour force growth has also slowed down. Provided wages can adjust, in a market economy there is usually a close relation between the growth of the labour force (the numbers seeking jobs) and growth of employment. Between 1971 and 1990 the US created far more jobs than any other industrial economy, largely because of unusually intense demographic pressures: the arrival in the workforce of the outsized 'baby boom' generation, the shift of women into paid employment and substantial immigration - 6m people entered the US in the 1980s alone, the largest influx since the early years of the century. The most striking difference between the US and Europe today is that few Americans fear severe structural unemployment. Most forecasters - including the Clinton administration - expect a cyclical economic recovery to reduce the unemployment rate to 5.5-6.0 per cent by 1996, which is not far above most estimates of 'full employment'. In some respects such projections create a misleading impression. Jobless rates in the US tend to be below those in Europe partly because only about 60 per cent of the jobless qualify for unemployment insurance. Benefits are worth only about a third of previous earnings, compared with more like two-thirds in continental Europe. And they last only six months, except in recessions when temporary extensions are granted. This means that many jobless Americans drift out of the labour market and are classified as 'economically inactive' rather than unemployed. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has calculated 'non-employment' rates (which consist of the officially jobless plus the inactive) that cast a less favourable light on US labour markets. During the 1980s, 12 per cent of men aged 25-54 were not in the formal labour market, compared with an average of just over 11 per cent in 16 large industrial countries. Withdrawal from the labour market is an especially severe problem for poor young men in inner cities. But if the availability of jobs (except in recessions) is often taken for granted, nearly all US pundits are preoccupied with two alleged manifestations of the low quality of much of the service-sector employment created in the 1980s: the slow pace of real wage growth and the rising inequality of family incomes. Since 1973, hourly compensation (wages plus fringe benefits) has increased by only about 11 per cent after allowing for inflation, or little more than 0.5 per cent a year, a far slower pace than in most other industrialised countries. The disappointing performance of real wages has to be seen, however, as a quid pro quo for the exceptional growth of employment since the early 1970s. In some ways it is surprising that real wages rose at all. Nevertheless, the US is the only leading industrialised country where many low-income workers have experienced substantial real pay cuts. After adjusting for inflation, the hourly wages of men with 12 or fewer years of schooling fell about 20 per cent between 1979 and 1989. During the same period comparable workers in the UK experienced a 12 per cent increase in inflation-adjusted earnings. According to a study by Mr Lawrence Katz, chief economist at the US department of labour, and Mr Richard Freeman of Harvard University, the growing discrepancy between the wages of high- and low-skilled workers in the 1980s has contributed to levels of income inequality unprecedented in postwar US history and without parallel in other advanced economies. During the 1980s, the real incomes of the richest 20 per cent of families rose about 20 per cent while those of the bottom 40 per cent were static. The UK was the only other country to experience a sharp rise in inequality. Katz and Freeman found no evidence of increasing wage inequality in Germany or the Netherlands and only a slight increase in differentials in countries as diverse as France, Sweden, Japan and Australia. Yet all industrialised countries have had to cope with the same structural changes, such as a secular shift in the composition of output from manufacturing to services and stiffer competition from low-wage producers in the developing world. So why has wage inequality risen faster in the US (and to a lesser extent Britain) than elsewhere? Part of the answer may lie in differences on the supply side of labour markets. In both the US and the UK, the rate of expansion of higher education slowed significantly in the 1980s as compared with the 1970s. So the rate of growth in the supply of highly educated workers declined. Yet the relative demand for highly educated workers if anything grew faster, reflecting the export of low-skilled jobs to developing countries. In the US, the supply-demand imbalance contributed to a sharp increase in the wage premium for college-educated workers. In countries such as Germany and France, where the relative supply of highly educated workers was better maintained in the 1980s, the pay of college-educated workers did not rise to anything like the same extent. Katz and Freeman also note that the US and Britain saw a much sharper contraction of union membership than most other industrialised countries. In the US, where unionised workers enjoy wage rates 20-25 per cent above those in non-organised plants, the decline in union membership in the 1980s may have accounted for as much as a fifth of the total rise in wage inequality in the decade. But this is not the whole story. In the US pay has grown more unequal even among employees with the same qualifications in the same industries subject to the same labour laws. For example, pay rates for lawyers vary more than they once did. This broader trend may reflect attempts by US companies to become more competitive by linking pay much more closely to individual performance, which is often only loosely related to formal qualifications and job titles. In most other countries, there are many formal and informal obstacles to such an individualistic approach: in effect the more productive are obliged to subsidise the less productive. For many Europeans, US labour markets will seem an unattractive role model. Stagnant real wages, rising inequality and limited job security will strike many as a high - perhaps unacceptable - price to pay for relatively low jobless rates. Many Americans are deeply troubled by such trends: Mr Clinton won last year's presidential election in large part by capitalising on the feelings of insecurity created by the Darwinian labour markets of the 1980s. His formula for restoring the 'American dream' of steadily rising living standards for middle-income families involved heavy reliance on 'social democratic' policies that in the EC are now increasingly seen as the cause of labour market rigidities. Mr Clinton signalled he would help low-income families by raising the minimum wage substantially and debated the merits of new payroll taxes to pay for social reforms, such as universal healthcare and more extensive industrial training. His agenda also included giving workers a stronger 'voice' in corporate decision-making, especially in the non-unionised sector. Yet as he learns more about the potential costs of interventionist labour market policies in the EC, Mr Clinton may find himself counting the blessings of the US's more flexible system. If he borrows from Europe it will be in uncontroversial ways, for example by upgrading US vocational education, easing the school-to-work transition for non-academic students and improving 'active labour market policies', such as counselling and retraining services for the unemployed. But the EC can possibly learn a great deal from the US. The most important lesson is that in a dynamic, open market economy, some sectors will always be in relative decline. There will thus always be downward pressure on the relative (and sometimes absolute) wages of some groups of workers. If these pressures are resisted indefinitely, it is hardly surprising if the result is an insupportable level of structural unemployment. If there is a cure for pain inflicted by low-wage competition from the likes of China and Mexico, it probably lies in a policy that all governments endorse yet on which few can show much tangible progress: improvements in the quality of education and training that raise the productivity of the workforce. But as the timescale involves decades rather than years, such improvements cannot be expected to serve as a substitute for greater wage flexibility.</p>

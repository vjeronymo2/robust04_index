			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A complex deal to secure the future - The rescue package agreed with Postel for Greycoat POSTEL's proposed rescue package for Greycoat is a complicated deal involving a placing, an issue of warrants, two rights issues, a property sale and the restructuring of two bonds. The complexity of this refinancing mirrors the traditionally complex nature of Greycoat's funding arrangements. Until recently, Greycoat prided itself on the sophistication of its finances as much as the quality of its buildings. Greycoat stood out among property companies for its innovative, carefully structured funding arrangements. It used deep discount bonds to defer interest payments during the early years of a development's life. It was confident that rents would increase sufficiently to provide the income to pay the increased interest bill when it fell due. But the collapse in property values undermined its assumptions. It became increasingly clear that it would have problems repaying a Pounds 50m zero coupon bond in 1995 and paying an additional Pounds 9.375m annual interest to holders of stepped interest bonds from September 1996. Greycoat's increasingly parlous financial position forced it to sell property in an attempt to reduce gearing. In the past year it sold Pounds 197m of properties, often below their March 1992 valuations. This effort to reduce its gearing did not go far enough. Greycoat said yesterday that if Postel's proposals were not approved 'there is a risk that at any early stage the group would face serious difficulties which would jeopardise its future.' If the company went into administration, its value would be diminished by the need to sell properties on a forced sale basis, the cost of unwinding long-term finance and the acceleration of the repayment to bondholders. Payments to unsecured creditors 'would be seriously at risk and, therefore, there would be no surplus available for distribution to either preference or ordinary shareholders,' it said. The deal proposed by Postel involves sharing the pain between shareholders, bondholders and preference shareholders. Under the deal, Postel will underwrite a 4-for-1 rights issue at 12 1/2 p per share to raise Pounds 58.9m. It will also underwrite a further rights issue of one new ordinary share for each existing preference share at 12 1/2 p to raise Pounds 6.25m. The deal also involves Greycoat placing 30m shares with Postel at 15p per share to raise Pounds 4.5m; Postel receiving 37.5m warrants convertible into ordinary shares in Greycoat at any time up to 2000 at 25p per share. In addition, Greycoat will buy a property called Hill House from Postel for Pounds 58.5m in the form of 125m 9 per cent cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 40p and a cash payment of Pounds 8.5m. Greycoat needs to win approval from its bondholders to defer its obligation to pay the Pounds 50m zero coupon bond due in 1995. It proposes exchanging these bonds for Pounds 40m 7.5 per cent bonds due 2003, secured on Hill House. Greycoat has also proposed that the holders of the Pounds 150m Britannic Bond pass control of Britannic House to a new non-recourse vehicle, subject to option that Greycoat can buy back the property at any time prior to April 2002. Bondholders will be asked to defer any shortfall in interest for three years to 2002. Greycoat is also asking its preference shareholders to waive their accumulated dividends and reduce the nominal value of their shares from 100p to 40p and reduce the coupon from 9.5 per cent to 9 per cent. The deal is subject to approval by Greycoat's shareholders, lending bankers, bondholders and preference shareholders as well as the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel. City analysts were divided yesterday on whether to recommend shareholders to take up their rights. Many said no decision should be taken until the company publishes its results, together with a detailed circular on the deal, in six weeks time.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Chancellor 'losing ground in E Germany' A poll by the German news magazine Der Spiegel shows German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) losing ground both to the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) and the far-right Republicans in eastern Germany, AP reports from Bonn. The poll, which asked voters whom they would vote for in the federal election if it was held next Sunday, shows the CDU would not be able to form a coalition government on the state level with its partners, the Free Democratic party (FDP), in any of the eastern German states. In Saxony, which the CDU won outright with 53.8 per cent of the vote in the 1990 election, Mr Kohl's party is at present polling only 38 per cent, while the FDP is attracting only 3 per cent of the vote, down from 5.3 per cent. In contrast, the SPD is polling 30 per cent, up from 19.1 per cent; the Republicans are supported by 3 per cent of the voters, up from no measurable support in 1990. The former communists, the PDS, are polling 12 per cent, against 10.2 per cent in the last federal election; support for Bundnis 90/Greens has risen to 10 per cent from 5.6 per cent in 1990. In Saxony-Anhalt, the CDU's support has diminished to 20 per cent against 39 per cent in 1990, while the SPD's support has ballooned to 36 per cent from 26. The FDP's support is at present 7 per cent, down from 13.5 per cent, while the Bundnis 90/Greens attract 13 per cent, compared to 5.3 per cent. The PDS polls 14 per cent, up from 12 per cent; the Republicans are supported by 4 per cent of the voters, up from 0.6 per cent in 1990.</p>

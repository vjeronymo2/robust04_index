			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Canada near decision on constitution talks MR Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, and his cabinet are expected to decide today whether to call a full-scale constitutional conference, in the hope of concluding negotiations on the country's political future. The conference, which would probably take place next week and be attended by leaders of all 10 provinces, two territories and aboriginal groups, would be a last-ditch effort to bridge differences remaining between Quebec and the rest of the country. Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, has indicated he would attend, after boycotting national-unity negotiations for the past two years. He said after an informal meeting with Mr Mulroney and the other premiers on Monday that there were 'some attitudes (and) proposals which clearly have a purpose to take into account the priorities of Quebec'. Mr Bourassa is committed to holding a national-unity referendum in Quebec by the end of October. He would like to have a deal in place by then which could be presented to Quebecois as the best way for the Francophone province to gain extra powers while remaining part of the federation. The latest initiative comes barely a month after the nine English-speaking provinces cobbled together a package of constitutional proposals which they hoped would find favour in Quebec. But Mr Bourassa has indicated he cannot accept some key elements.</p>

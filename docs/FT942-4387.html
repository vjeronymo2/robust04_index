			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Gonzalez waits for the judgment of Spanish - Sunday's European vote is critical for fate of Socialist government If the opinion polls are right, Sunday's European parliament ballot will give the conservatives of Spain's Popular party their first victory in a nationwide election since General Franco's death in 1975 and the restoration of democracy. How much damage the governing Socialists sustain in the aftermath of recent corruption affairs will crucially affect the fate of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government, re-elected a year ago for a fourth term. Mr Gonzalez's vital ally, Catalonia's regional president, Mr Jordi Pujol, has promised continued backing irrespective of who wins on Sunday - 'unless something spectacular happens'. Mr Pujol's Convergencia i Unio party has just enough deputies in the national parliament to make a combined majority with the Socialists and shore up the government. For the moment, this arrangement is convenient for Mr Pujol. He gains leverage in Madrid, and may see the Socialists as less of a danger to him in Catalonia while they hold power nationally than they would be in opposition. Also, he could not easily switch allegiance to the Popular party, which has queered its pitch in Catalonia my making a fuss over the language issue. However, many of his party's grass-root supporters fail to understand why they should help a discredited government in Madrid. The more the government's credibility is undermined - either by further disclosures or by a heavy defeat on Sunday - the more fragile this informal alliance will become. Opinion polls have been remarkably consistent. The Socialists, fighting for the centre ground with both the PP and mainstream regional parties, are generally given only about 31 per cent of the vote, compared with almost 39 per cent in last year's general election and 40 per cent in the 1989 European election. The PP comes ahead of this in all the polls, mostly in a range of between 37 and 40 per cent, improving on its score last year of just under 35 per cent. This would give the conservatives 26 or 27 seats compared with the 15 they won in 1989. The Socialists would lose up to six of their 27 seats. The Communist-led United Left is predicted to show strong gains with up to 15 per cent of the vote. With the same consistency, the Socialists are seen losing ground in their stronghold region of Andalucia, where regional elections are being held on the same day - maintaining their lead but losing their outright majority, and therefore probably being forced to seek an alliance with the United Left. Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the PP leader frustrated in his bid for power last year by a margin of 1m votes, believes his party could finish 2m votes ahead - and within the next year win a general election. But there are dangers in drawing too many conclusions from the polls. Firstly, Sunday's vote cannot necessarily be translated into a likely general election result. Many observers see it as a cost-free way for voters to punish the government. The 'useful vote', which last year enabled the Socialists to pick up part of the United Left's electorate to stave off a right-wing victory, does not apply. Secondly, pre-election polls in Spain are often misleading. Mr Fernando Moran, the 68-year-old former foreign minister who heads the list of Socialist candidates, says there has always been a 'hidden vote'. In previous elections, this has involved supporters of the traditional right who were reluctant to declare their sympathies to pollsters. This time, he says, the same may apply to Socialist supporters. The professorial Mr Moran, whose signature stands on Spain's 1986 European accession treaty, leads the personal popularity stakes among the candidates. He believes the Socialists could still end narrowly ahead but says an advantage of one or two seats for the PP would be an 'acceptable' result. Predictably, Socialist politicians have again conjured up the spectre of the authoritarian right. Mr Aznar has tried to remove his reformed PP from any associations with Francoism, which put a ceiling on the party's vote-winning potential when it was under the leadership of Mr Manuel Fraga, former information minister under the Franco regime. However, some close collaborators of Mr Fraga still figure on the PP list. A star young PP candidate, Ms Mercedes de la Merced, provided a godsend for the other parties by speaking favourably of Franco as 'a person who cared about the weaker classes' and who 'built a whole lot of houses for the poor'. Up to eight of Spain's 39 lists of candidates - almost twice the number in France - stand a chance of returning an MEP. Less likely contenders include the traditionalist Carlist Communion, two Falangist parties and the Spanish branch of Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, whose candidates include a bullfighter. Businessman Jose Mara Ruiz-Mateos, who helped stave off trial on falsification charges by getting elected on his own ticket last time, is standing again. His posters show him in a hard-hat with the slogan 'Spain for the Spaniards, work for everyone.' But the omens are not good. The football club he bought has just been relegated to the second division.</p>

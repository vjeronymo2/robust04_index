			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Border Violations Do Occur"] </F>   [Text] During yesterday's press conference, Interior  Minister Frckovski was asked on the current situation on the  northern border. He answered this was primarily a question for  the Ministry of Defense, but did confirm the number of border  violations has increased lately. He stated the following facts:    -- 24 May, unauthorized crossing of border by 17 Serbian  soldiers and 2 officers, who entered about 150 meters deep into  Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  territory and threatened UN Protection Force units;    -- 27 May, Macedonian air space violated by a Serbian  military plane;    -- 30 May, unauthorized crossing of border by two solders  and  going 200 meters deep into Macedonian territory;    -- 1 June, border again crossed by two Yugoslav soldiers,  and    -- 8 June, tent put up and a trench dug near Kriva Palanka,  on Macedonian territory by [passage indistinct].    The situation is the same even as we speak, Frckovski said,  and again pointed out the Defense Ministry is more competent to  say more on this. In the Defense Ministry, however, they said  Minister Vlado Popovski was out of town and no one else was  authorized to issue statements on this. The same answer was  given by Macedonian Army General Staff officials.</p>

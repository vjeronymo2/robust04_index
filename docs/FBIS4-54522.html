			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> Karl-Peter Schwarz; place and date not given: "Closing Down  Bohunice Is Just a Matter of Time"]    [Text] [Schwarz] Mr. Prime Minister, for two years you  were a minister in Meciar's government, and now you are heading  the new government. What is the actual difference between the  new and the former Slovak Government?    [Moravcik] We continue what was positive--namely, the  transformation of our economy, and we want to implement that as  quickly and as consistently as possible. The previous  government also had to put its relations with the IMF in order,  and we want to do that, too. However, the precondition for that  is that the budget deficit be not more than 4 percent of the  GDP. Last year it was 7 percent. The former government also  declared speedy privatization as one of its goals. In reality,  however, it slowed down the privatization process. We want to  accelerate it and, at the same time, depoliticize it.    [Schwarz] In your government, very different forces are  represented, that are bound together by their opposition to  Vladimir Meciar. Can such a coalition last beyond the elections?    [Moravcik] I believe so. However, for this purpose, we need  an election result that enables us to continue our work. The  precondition for lasting political stability is stability of the  political parties, and these parties, for their part, must  correspond to the large political parties in Europe. The  cooperation of the parties plays a very important role at the  European level. In our coalition, we have such parties: a  leftist party, a rightist party, and one party of the liberal  center. Rightist-leftist coalitions are nothing unusual. In  Austria this is working very well.    [Schwartz] At the moment, former Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar is more popular than ever. His ouster was obviously  either too early or too late....    [Moravcik] The problem is the date of the new elections. We  wanted to postpone the elections for a few months, until spring  1995. By then the government would have had more opportunity to  present itself to the voters as a viable alternative. It looks  as if the elections in the fall will not change much about the  structures in parliament. The problems will remain.    [Schwarz] Meciar's HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]  obviously fears that you might drag out the election period.    [Moravcik] The election period--30 September-1 October--is  definite. We have no intention of changing it, even though  developments so far have confirmed our opinion about a later  election date. The ouster has given Meciar sympathy. But, when  the government ensures a calm and busy atmosphere, which the  people want, it will convince the voters.    [Schwarz] After the elections, too, your government would  need the support of the parties of the Hungarian minority.    [Moravcik] Yes, this is very likely. The opposition is  using this against us. However, we need a rational relationship  with the minority parties to be able to solve the minority  problem.    [Schwartz] Do you expect that after the elections in Hungary  it will be easier to defuse the smoldering conflict with  Budapest over that?    [Moravcik] We have the political will to improve relations,  and this is in our mutual interest. After all, both countries  want to join the European Union as quickly as possible. We  cannot afford the conflict.    [Schwarz] Can you adopt the Hungarian position that the  minority issue involves not only individual rights but also  collective ones?    [Moravcik] We do not think that territorial autonomy would  be good for the Hungarian minority. On the contrary, it would  create unrest.    [Schwarz] Relations with Austria are attributed particular  importance in your government program, in particular with regard  to Austria's forthcoming accession to the European Union.  However, they are overshadowed by the quarrel over [the nuclear  power plants of] Bohunice and Mochovce. What is your position  on nuclear energy?    [Moravcik] We would be vary happy if we could free ourselves  of the burden of the Bohunice nuclear power plant. For us, this  is primarily an economic problem. Bohunice produces a lot of  energy, which we need, and we cannot afford changing to another  fuel. The government has not yet closed this issue and is still  looking for the best possible solution. I am convinced that we  will find it.    Closing down Bohunice is only a matter of time. For  Mochovce, we want to choose a partner that can guarantee enough  safety.</p>

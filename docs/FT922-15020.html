			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Associated Fisheries dips to Pounds 1m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Associated Fisheries fell from Pounds 3.39m to Pounds 1.02m in 1991, and there was a Pounds 5m loss at the attributable level. However, the dividend total is held at 7p. Mr Keith FitzGerald, chairman, said that taking account of the satisfactory financial position and the non-recurring nature of certain factors last year, the final will again be 6p. Earnings slumped from 12.64p to 2.86p. The group has decided to provide an extraordinary Pounds 5.5m because it feels it may have to withdraw from the investment in Macfish, following Geest's announcement that it intended to seek withdrawal in respect of its 50 per cent shareholding. Attributable pre-tax profit from Macfish collapsed from Pounds 340,000 to Pounds 2,000. Turnover dipped to Pounds 83.6m (Pounds 85.1m) and operating profits fell to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 4.05m).</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] On 25 May, ROK vernacular newspapers  carry articles reacting to remarks made by Yi Hong-ku, deputy  prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board,  at the National Assembly on 23 May to the effect that the ROK  will reconsider the joint declaration on denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula if North Korea continues maintaining its  radiochemical laboratory.    On page 2, the conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 700-word  article by reporter An Hui-chang which says that the unification  minister's remarks reflect the government's strong will to see  that "the nuclear transparency of North Korea is secured by any  means." The article quotes Minister Yi's remarks made on 12 May  in a confab with the members of the Korean Newspaper Editor's  Association of Korea, where he said that "the declaration on  denuclearization will be nullified if it is internationally  confirmed that North Korea possesses even half a nuclear  weapon...." The article says that his remarks have presented  our somewhat disoriented nuclear policy with a clear-cut  direction policy. The article quotes Minister Yi as saying that  the joint declaration has virtually been nullified in any sense,  adding that the ROK Government has been coping with North  Korea's nuclear issue from the standpoint of sticking to the  joint declaration--although North Korea has violated it--with a  view to preventing a nuclear domino phenomenon while, at the  same time, taking the U.S. position into consideration. The  article stresses that our government cannot concede on the point  of securing nuclear transparency and that our government is  sending a message to the international community, including the  United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],  that they should pay attention to this point. The article says  that this is a message indicating that "the ROK Government will  not just sit idle" if North Korea continues to ignore the joint  declaration and the United States tolerates this in the process  of their negotiations. The article concludes by saying that his  remarks seem to indicate that the ROK Government is seriously  considering the nullification of the joint declaration and that  this may have a ripple effect on the third round U.S.-North  talks.    On page 3, the CHOSON ILBO carries an 800-word editorial  which says that Minister Yi's remarks are "a diversionary  message" and showed concern over the United States trying to  seek a settlement with North Korea while allowing it to possess  one or two nuclear bomb. Adding that the remarks are bringing  North Korea's attention to the possible ripple effect that the  nullification of the joint declaration will create, the  editorial says that if North Korea guarantees nuclear  transparency, it will be possible for both South and North Korea  to have nuclear technological sovereignty in the peaceful use of  nuclear energy, adding that Minister Yi's remarks are a sign of  change in the ROK Government's policy toward North Korea's  nuclear issue. The editorial stressed that the cooperative  system between the ROK and the United States should be further  consolidated.    On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries an 800-word  article by reporter Pak Che-kyun which says, in essence, that  the ROK Government has been trying to put out the fire which was  ignited by Minister Yi's remarks. The article cites Article  Three of the joint declaration which says "the South and North  shall not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities and uranium  enriching facilities," quoting experts' worry about the possible  difficulties the ROK might face in case it should give up  reprocessing facilities, while adding that "the United States,  which has potential fears for the nuclear weapons development of  North and South Korea, had applied strong pressure on  stipulating the clause of 'giving up reprocessing.'" The article  continues to say that "the ROK Government is now in a position  to flatly negate the minister's remarks on reconsidering the  joint declaration" because both the ROK and the United States  are basing their opposition against North Korea's nuclear  development upon that declaration. The article concludes by  saying that "if the United States takes issue with his remarks,  there will be a great stir."    On page 5, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 1,100-word  article by reporter Yu Sung-u which says that the ROK  Government's foreign affairs-national security team led by  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong- ku has been boldly taking issue  with the efficacy of the joint declaration. The article says  that his remarks are based on a matter-of-course principle in  view of Article Three of the joint declaration, saying that the  ROK Government's attitude of making an issue of the efficacy of  the joint declaration has been necessitated by the present  circumstances under which the ROK is entrusting the United  States with the negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear  issue. The article says that his remarks are "a conditional or  a passive declaration of nuclear sovereignty to the United  States and Japan as well as to North Korea," adding that an  imbalance between the South and North exists in that the ROK  side has given up even the development of nuclear reprocessing  technology while North Korea's extraction of plutonium is an  issue. The article concludes that it is high time that a  serious examination of the merits and demerits achieved since  the signing of the South-North Basic Agreement and the joint  declaration by South and North Korea.    On page 4, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a  1,300-word article by reporter Ku Pon-yong which is essentially  the same as other vernacular dailies of 25 May. The article  says that the unification minister's remarks make a point of  ensuring that bargaining is not disadvantageous to the ROK and  sends a warning to Japan whose nuclear potential is growing.  The article concludes that his remarks have been made to  express the government's long- term position in response to some  people's views for advocating possessing reprocessing facilities  for peaceful purposes under the circumstances in which the power  generation with atomic energy constitutes 43.2 percent of total  power generated.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "The Condition for the  Reconsideration of the Denuclerization on the Korean Peninsula."  Referring to the significance of remarks made by Yi Hong-ku,  deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification  Board, at the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification  Committee some time ago regarding the nullification of the  South-North Joint Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean  peninsula, the editorial says, "it must be true that Deputy  Minister Yi's view of North Korean policy has been based on the  denuclerization on the Korean peninsula, but he has maintained  that the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development must be  dispelled. In this respect, we have no objection to his  remarks. It is the basic framework of the government's  consistent policy toward North Korea. The reconsideration of  the joint denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula  means, however, that we can revise the North-South agreement  that prohibits them from possessing a nuclear reprocessing  facility, as well as a uranium enriching facility. When this  happens, great changes may occur in our government's nuclear  policy. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to it."    Describing Deputy Prime Minister Yi's such remarks as a  proposal indicating that North Korea should suspend the nuclear  development program and, surely, guarantee the transparency of  its nuclear development in order to ease tensions on the Korean  peninsula, the editorial says, "he once said in a meeting with  editors that if North Korea possesses even half of a nuclear  bomb, the denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula  will become virtually null and void. This is a clear and firm  expression of the government's policy regarding the North Korean  nuclear issue."    The editorial says, "it is certain that the competitive  nuclear development between the North and South will bring about  a great disaster to our nation by making this land become a  place for nuclear confrontation. Therefore, we must concentrate  diplomatic efforts on making North Korea abandon its nuclear  ambition, thus further strengthening the ROK-U.S. cooperative  system.    KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by  reporter Kim Pong-son entitled "A Subtle Stir in the Country by  Deputy Prime Minister Yi's Remarks on the Reconsideration of the  Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean Peninsula." Referring  to the contents of the denuclerization declaration, the article  reports, "some domestic scholars say that the joint  denuclerization declaration must be revised because it abandons  its rights to even possess nuclear reprocessing facility or  enriching facilities for peaceful purposes."    Noting the remarks by Kim Si-chung, minister of the Ministry  of Science and Technology, regarding the need to revise the  joint denuclerization declaration, the article says, "the  government has clearly expressed the position that it will not  revise it." Also, referring to the remarks by a spokesman of  National Unification Board indicating that North Korea's  operating a radiochemical laboratory is a violation of the joint  denuclerization declaration, the article reports, "North Korea  provides justification for South Korea to reconsider it. Also,  its future operation of the radiochemical laboratory is a  nullification of the declaration. Therefore, it must close the  laboratory to avoid the dispute between the North and South."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a  1,000-word editorial entitled "The Principle of the  Denuclerization Declaration Must Be Observed." Referring to  Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks that we cannot but discuss  the North-South Joint Denuclerization Declaration in a different  way if North Korea continues operating the radiochemical  facility, the editorial says, "if his remarks mean that the  government will carry out its future nuclear policy based on the  fact that the declaration is already null and void, we cannot  but counter his remarks, because the joint denuclerization  declaration, in addition to the North-South agreement, is an  important agreement between the North and South to secure peace  on the Korean peninsula and to achieve national reunification."    Noting the background of the formulation of the declaration  between the North and South and the contents of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, the editorial says, "North Korea's  operation of the radiochemical laboratory is not a violation of  the treaty, even if it is a nuclear reprocessing facility,  because the treaty does not prohibit the country concerned from  possessing or operating it." The editorial also says, it is not  easy to determine whether Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks  "are intended to prevent North Korea's nuclear development or to  find justification for South Korea's nuclear development."    HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 2 a 700-word article by  reporter Kang Tae-ho entitled "The Expression of the  Government's Dissatisfaction at the U.S. Position Toward North  Korea." Referring to the background of Deputy Prime Minister  Yi's remarks and other government officials' remarks on need to  revise the joint denuclerization declaration, the article then  added, "some people believe that his remarks are a kind of an  expression of the government's dissatisfaction at the U.S.  Government's negotiation attitude toward North Korea with the  approach of a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks."</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 203m puts Corning Dollars 121m in red Corning, the US glass and high-technology manufacturer, yesterday revealed a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 120.9m after taking a Dollars 203m charge related to breast-implant litigation. The provision represents the company's share of the best estimate so far of the costs associated with thousands of lawsuits brought by women who claim to have been injured as a result of silicone implants supplied by Dow Corning, a joint venture with Dow Chemical. If special charges were excluded, the company would have posted net income of Dollars 82.2m, or 42 cents a share, up slightly from Dollars 79.9m, or 42 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992-1993. Including extraordinary items, earnings were Dollars 41.2m, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Corning's share price, which had recovered somewhat after dipping as low as Dollars 26 last autumn, dropped Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 31 1/8 yesterday. The company attributed its flat performance to lower prices and the impact of sluggish worldwide economic conditions on its consumer products business and other facets of its operations. The kitchenware division, Corning's original business, has struggled for years, while fibre optics and medical products and services have assumed increasing importance to its bottom line. The trend was evident in sales during the most recent quarter. Revenues were up 8.7 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn, but growth primarily reflected the acquisition of Damon, a clinical testing business, and Costar, a plastic laboratory equipment concern, in the second half. For the full year, Corning turned in a net loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 9 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 12.6m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. Net sales were Dollars 4bn, an 8 per cent improvement from 1992-1993, when revenues reached Dollars 3.7bn.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Patriotic feel to Elgar's 'Caractacus' - Concert The echoes of the final chorus might have reached Westminster, if not Brussels. For Elgar's long-neglected oratorio Caractacus the time may have come: this patriotic work tells the story of the ancient Britains' resistance to Roman conquest and in its final peroration hymns 'the text of Britain's teaching, the message of the free'. One has a vision of local Conservative Party choirs up and down the country suddenly deciding to do the piece and the publishers running out of copies. As far as Sunday's performance at the Barbican Hall was concerned, however, the timing was fortuitous. Richard Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra have been pursuing a series of Elgar's choral works for some time, of which this welcome revival was the most recent. Ironically, one of the shadows lurking in the background is the decidedly un-British example of Wagnerian music drama. A couple of weeks ago the BBC performances of The Kingdom reminded us how close Elgar came to Parsifal when he composed scenes like the breaking of bread. In Caractacus it is the trappings of the drama that are Wagnerian: the sacred oak tree, the Druid maiden who foretells the future, the heroes in battle. The music itself admits less of an influence. Even though his mature work was all still to come at this point, there is no mistaking Elgar's hand in the music that describes the peace of the Malvern Hills or the sun rising over the forests below. In a few passages he even leaps ahead to those sinking, melancholy harmonies that were to characterise his most personal statements, notably in Caractacus's Lament after his defeat. The soloist in that inspired portion of the score was David Wilson-Johnson, a lively interpreter, although his voice loses power at the top just when it is needed. Judith Howarth dealt confidently with Eigen's music, but Arthur Davies sounded unhappy as Orbin. The tenor part is improbably high in the Siegfried mode and hits a mini-forging song within the first few minutes. Stephen Roberts sang the Arch-Druid and Alastair Miles was a fine, firm Emperor Claudius. There is a far wider range of lyrical, pastoral and mystic music in Caractacus than the common view of it would have us believe and Hickox mostly did it justice, even if he has never mastered the art of allowing Elgar to speak naturally. The London Symphony Chorus also put on a decent show. Nothing could easily live up to the ending, unless it be a massed choir of Thatchers and Tebbits in full cry.</p>

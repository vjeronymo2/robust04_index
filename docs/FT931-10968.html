			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Christopher to visit Mideast MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will travel to the Middle East in two weeks' time, in an attempt to revive the stalled negotiations between Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestinians. Multilateral talks, which had been scheduled to begin next week in Rome and Washington, were formally postponed this week because of the continuing dispute over Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians suspected by Israel of links to the Hamas terrorist movement. Mr Christopher's efforts to broker a solution to the deportation crisis resulted in Israel's agreement this week to take back 100 of the Palestinians who are now languishing in no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon. Israel's decision was enough to ensure US support against any UN attempt to impose sanctions, but it has not been enough to calm Palestinian anger at the deportations. Mr Christopher is expected to meet Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Washington before leaving for the Middle East, and is expected to arrive in Israel on February 17. He will remain in the region - visiting Jordan, Syria, Egypt and possibly Lebanon - until February 24, and then stop in Europe on his way home. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: An Israeli foreign ministry official said Mr Christopher had indicated yesterday to the foreign minister that the Middle East peace talks might resume in mid-April.</p>

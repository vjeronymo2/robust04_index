			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Importance of a shared memory / A look at the potential of Intel's relationship with Sharp THE decision by Intel, the world's leading microprocessor maker, to share its most advanced memory technology with a Sharp company is bound to raise eyebrows in Washington, where America's loss of industrial leadership to Japan has become a controversial political issue. Yet Mr Robert Reed, Intel's senior vice-president, was yesterday in no doubt about who his main constituents were: Intel's shareholders. And for them, he argued, the industrial and financial logic of the deal was compelling. Intel now supplies 85 per cent of the world market for flash memory devices, easily eraseable and recordable semiconductor chips that retain electronic information after power is switched off. They are a natural replacement for many magnetic recording devices, such as disk drives and tape recorders, because they are smaller, lighter, use a fraction of the energy, and provide faster access times. They are also becoming cheaper. Flash memory devices are used now in some computers. Mr Richard Pashley, general manager of Intel's memory component division, says they will become generally available in portable computers in about a year. Intel is having trouble now meeting the rapidly- growing demand in the computer field, which is the mainstay of its business. Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, will provide capital to expand manufacturing capability and a research capability to advance the technology. More importantly, however, it will give Intel a way in to the consumer electronics industry, where it has no experience. Mr Atsushi Asada, Sharp senior executive vice-president, yesterday outlined a range of ideas for new products, including tiny voice recorders with no moving parts, digital still cameras, hand-held electronic magazines, and cellular fax machines that store and display transmissions electronically. For Sharp, having access to Intel technology puts it instantly ahead of the pack in Japan, although the companies would not disclose how much Sharp is paying for this privilege. Mr Reed said Intel would have difficulty retaining its technological and market leadership without a strong partner. Intel has a current capital expenditure budget of Dollars 1bn a year; Mr Reed argued that to spend an additional Dollars 500m on a new plant for flash memories would not be prudent. This is particularly true as competition in the industry could become bruising as the market grows, and Intel is going against large Japanese companies such as Hitachi or NEC, which have much greater resources. It expects to see its market share scaled back sharply, perhaps to 30 per cent, while sales blossom. And while flash memories may provide an important complement to Intel's core business, leadership in microprocessors will remain its central focus. 'There are only so many things you can do well at the same time,' he said. 'And I think we are close to the limit. The deal raises the long-term prospect of Intel's success in flash (memories).' Intel has already tripled its production of flash memories at its plant in New Mexico in the past six months. The devices use 1-micron process technology. A micron, one millionth of a metre, refers to the size of the line width etched into a silicon wafer. Production of 0.8-micron devices is beginning now on behalf of Intel by NMB Semiconductors, the Japanese company. Sharp and Intel plan jointly to develop manufacturing technology for 0.6 and 0.4-micron devices with an aim of starting production in 1994 at a Sharp facility in Fukuyama, Japan. Intel said it had no plans to manufacture the smaller, more powerful devices in the US, although it could decide to upgrade its New Mexico production to the more advanced technology. While Intel considered a US partner, it selected Sharp in part because demand for flash memories was expected to be strong in Japan. Datastream says the worldwide market may grow from about Dollars 130m a year today to about Dollars 1.5bn by 1995. Yesterday there was talk of a Dollars 10bn market by the turn of the century, one that may rival the market for dynamic random access memory (Dram) devices in size. Mr Pashley says that, per unit of memory capacity, flash devices are fundamentally cheaper to make because they are less complex. As manufacturing volume accelerates, Intel expects price per unit of memory to match Dram chips by 1994, and then decline. As for mini hard disk drives, a 40-MByte flash card is expected to be cheaper than a 1.8-inch drive by 1995. Smaller capacity cards are already competitive. As a taste of things to come, Intel this week halved the prices of its memory cards already on the market. The price of a 4-MByte card was cut to Dollars 492 in the US.</p>

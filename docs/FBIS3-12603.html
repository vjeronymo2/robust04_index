This stand which placates Israel is a continuation of the  U.S. policy adopted for decades by the successive U.S.  administrations. This has encouraged Israel to pursue its human  rights violations in the occupied territories, and has placed it  above the law, and out of reach of any possible international  inquiry.    Following the Hebron massacre that has been condemned by the  entire international community, the current U.S. Administration  under the pretext of not endangering the peace process, adopts a  stand that lacks wisdom and far-sightedness when it seeks to  prevent the implementation of the international community's will  and the UN Security Council from responding to these calls which  demand some kind of international protection for the  Palestinians.    Does the Clinton administration need more than this torrent  of innocent blood that was shed in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip last Friday to be convinced that a defenseless people need  some kind of international protection, especially since  Israel--army, border guard, and fanatic settlers, persist in  shedding the blood of children, elderly people, and women  without remorse and without fearing any possible international  inquiry?    The issuance of a UN Security Council resolution providing  the Palestinian people with international protection is another  test of the seriousness of the U.S. role as a fair mediator in  the Middle East crisis, how ethically credible it is, and how  genuine are its continued claims that it defends human rights  throughout the world.</p>

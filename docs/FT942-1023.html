			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Pressure on Spain to allow ferry line Spain must this week respond to formal complaints by the European Commission that it has disobeyed the rules and spirit enshrined in the EU's single market in refusing a UK shipping company access to the ferry route between Spain and Morocco. The Commission has launched the first stage of infringement proceedings against Spain following the country's refusal to allow Cenargo, the UK shipping line, to start a car ferry service between ports on the southern coast of Spain and Nador in Morocco. Spain has until Thursday to respond to a letter sent by the Commission three weeks ago, although the Spanish authorities were saying before the weekend they had not yet heard from the Commission. The case has been compared to the recent and much publicised British Airways dispute with France over access to Orly airport in Paris. Under single market regulations that came into force on January 1 1993, a ship owner in one EU member state is allowed to start a service between any other member state and a non-EU country. But the Spanish Interior Ministry has blocked efforts by Cenargo to start a service between Spain and Morocco since the UK shipping line - its arguments now backed by the UK government - identified a gap in the North Africa route, used regularly by thousands of EU-based Moroccans. When Cenargo tried to sail from Nador to Almeria in May last year, it was prevented from docking by armed Spanish militia and naval craft. Subsequent attempts by Cenargo to start the service to the alternative Spanish ports of Malaga and Alicante were also frustrated. The Interior Ministry says neither Almeria, Malaga nor Alicante has international port status and it is up to Spain to decide where its entry points should be. It argues that none of the ports has the necessary facilities for customs and immigration. Cenargo points out that as late as summer 1992, a service operated between Malaga and Tangier in Morocco, and Malaga remains a destination for a number of international cruise lines. The Spanish state-owned company Transmediterranea - now being prepared for privatisation - has a monopoly on car passenger ferry services between Spain and Morocco east of the straits of Gibraltar. All existing ferry services dock at Melilla, the Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco, just 5km north of Nador. A new service to Nador could deprive Melilla of much of its trade.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. PAROLE VIOLATORS STAY FREE UNDER COURT'S ORDER;  </P> <P> JAILS: AS MANY AS 70 A WEEK WILL REMAIN ON STREETS IN MOVE TO RELIEVE THE  SEVERE CROWDING OF COUNTY'S JAILS.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Sheriff, responding to a court order to reduce the number  of inmates held in county jails, has stopped admitting as many as 70 parole  violators each week, who before had been held in county jails before being  transferred to state prisons.  </P> <P> Although law enforcement officials will try to jail parole violators considered  a threat to the public, most of the others will remain free.  </P> <P> El Cajon Superior Court Judge James A. Malkus ordered the county last month to  no longer hold parole violators who in the past were jailed "as a courtesy" to  the state Department of Corrections, Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Glenn  Revell said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This is part of our attempt to hold our (jail) population at what the court  has described as a constitutionally acceptable level," Revell said. "We don't  have room or funding" to house parolees. If we had one or the other, we'd make  adjustments. But, the way the judge's order reads, we're not legally obligated  to take them."  </P> <P> A Department of Corrections spokesman said Wednesday that local law enforcement  officers are prohibited from transporting parole violators directly to the  state's correctional facility in Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "It's not feasible for local law enforcement to directly book people" at the  Donovan Correctional Facility in Otay Mesa, the spokesman said. "It's something  that was considered and rejected. It's a complex issue."  </P> <P> San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen on Monday ordered his officers not to make  arrests that are based solely on warrants issued by the state Department of  Corrections or the state Youth Authority Department. Burgreen on Wednesday  described the situation as "ludicrous."  </P> <P> "Parolees who are in violation of their parole from state prison and who are on  the street cannot be booked into San Diego County jails," Burgreen said  Wednesday. "Our officers must allow them to continue walking on the street,  even if they have violated parole, because there is no room in jail.  </P> <P> However, authorities at the city, county and state level on Wednesday  maintained that law enforcement officers will continue to arrest dangerous  parole violators who are a threat to society.  </P> <P> "We're really going to look at (warrants) on a case-by-case basis," said John  Dowling, a Corrections Department parole administrator whose staff oversees an  estimated 3,800 parolees in San Diego County. "When we know that a person is  capable of really doing some harm, we're going to get them off the street as  soon as possible," Dowling said.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials on Wednesday agreed the court order would take some  teeth out of the parole program.  </P> <P> "It's not something we like to see," Dowling said. "The threat (the state holds  over parolees) is returning them to prison . . . and the first step toward that  is usually putting them in jail and then moving them from jail to prison at a  rapid rate. Unfortunately, we're losing that ability."  </P> <P> "Now there's no serious consequence" facing many parole violators," said Revell  of the Sheriff's Department. One East county parole officer complained to  Revell that "we used to be holding a medicine ball over (parolees). Now we've  got a nerf ball."  </P> <P> Malkus' order means that 50 to 70 parole violators each week won't be jailed  after warrants are issued for parole violations, Dowling said.  </P> <P> While state, county and local law enforcement officers will continue to arrest  the most dangerous parolees, parolees guilty of lesser offenses won't be  arrested.  </P> <P> Arrests will probably not occur, for example, to parolees who fail to report to  a parole officer, submit a "dirty" urinalysis and fail to take part in required  occupational or social service program, Dowling said.  </P> <P> The decision to no longer house parole violators in county jails was the most  recent example of how crowded jails are threatening to incapacitate the  county's criminal justice system.  </P> <P> Malkus has issued an order requiring the county to reduce the number of inmates  jammed into its severely crowded jails throughout the county.  </P> <P> The county previously had held parole violators for two working days while  parole case workers prepared paper work needed to transfer prisoners to state  prisons.  </P> <P> But in July, Malkus ruled the county was "not obligated" to house parole  violators because they are the state's responsibility, according to Alex  Landon, an attorney who is representing the American Civil Liberties Union in  two court suits that generated the court order to reduce inmate populations.  </P> <P> Although the county's jails continue to house inmates arrested for felonies,  most people arrested on misdemeanor charges are freed. The county, however,  does jail people arrested on misdemeanor crimes such as domestic violence and  some narcotics violations.  </P> <P> Although crowding is a problem at county jails around the state, the Department  of Corrections has not been forced to release inmates from state prisons  because of crowding, Dowling said. "We're not yet in a position where we've  been told to stop holding people," Dowling said.  </P> <P> Burgreen said jail crowding has stymied attempts to reduce crime because many  criminals "know nothing will happen to them. We have a difficult situation . .  . in the city with the most overcrowded jails in the country."  </P> <P> The court order "is going to have an obvious impact on the morale of officers,"  said San Diego Police Department spokesman Dave Cohen. "They know certain  people deserve to be behind bars so the judicial system can determine their  fate."  </P> <P> But, with the court order in effect, parole violators who are stopped for a  minor traffic infraction will no longer be arrested and jailed on the parole  warrant, Cohen said.  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / The ball's back in his court: Felipe Gonzalez may have to seek partners in his bid to revive Spain's ailing economy There is surprise on a lot of Spanish faces as the scale of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's election victory on Sunday sinks in. To have won 159 seats in parliament, given the combination of economic recession and political attack he was facing, is a mighty achievement. Nobody came anywhere near predicting it. Yesterday, the political analysts and experts were being unusually cautious. Having predicted a closer race and possible defeat for the prime minister, few were brave enough to guess what he might do with his fourth successive term in office. The best lead came from the foreign exchange markets, where the peseta strengthened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday morning, and closed at Pta76.84, from a previous Pta78.27. The markets reacted warmly because of the widespread assumption that the Socialists, with enough seats to form a stable coalition or minority government, would not rush into a series of interest rate cuts. Had the opposition People's Party won, the markets would have expected a quick dash towards lower rates. But the rise in the peseta - devalued for the third time in nine months just three weeks ago - also carries an inherent danger. Unless the government takes tough economic action to tackle the country's chronic unemployment, deepening recession and investment drought, the peseta could again come under pressure. Aware of the potentially delicate position of the peseta, and of the loss of his overall majority in parliament, held since 1982, Mr Gonzalez will try to move swiftly on both the economic and political fronts. Despite losing 26 seats, the Socialists are still 18 clear of the PP, headed by Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the conservative challenger who increased his share of the vote by 10 per cent. With more people - 9.08m - voting Socialist this time than in 1986 or 1989, In voting left of centre, Spaniards have made it clear they are comfortable swimming against the political tide in Europe, for the time being. More accurately, they still have confidence in Mr Gonalez as their leader. His victory should make it easier for him to bring the powerful left wing of the Socialist party to heel at a special party congress expected later this year. Party officials have prevented Mr Gonzalez from implementing tough fiscal policies and labour reforms since 1989. As economic and social policy choices have become starker over the past four years, and as the economy has deteriorated, he needs a united party more than ever. The recession has narrowed his options. Tax revenues are down and any serious cuts in infrastructure spending would be unpopular. Not surprisingly, both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar agreed, separately, during their campaigns, that the only way to promote growth would be to negotiate a pacto social - a social pact - between the trade unions and employers to help hold down wage increases and remove rigidities from the labour market. Nobody knows quite how such a pact would work, and the only man who has tried (and failed) to implement one, the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, may leave the government. Mr Gonzalez is convinced that if he can stem wages growth, running at about 7 per cent this year, the downward trend in interest rates can be accelerated as inflation, at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent, is brought more firmly under control. To achieve wage moderation, however, he must bring two large trade unions, hostile to the conservative thrust of his economic policies, together with the employers federation, which campaigned for his defeat after the party watered down a controversial anti-strike law drafted by the government. Both the socialist UGT and the communist Comisiones Obreras national unions are interested in recovering the political influence they had before Mr Gonzalez began moving sharply to the right in the mid-1980s, so they may support him. Mr Gonzalez is likely to attempt a rapprochement at least with the UGT, which split from the Socialist party in the late 1980s. Engineering a social pact will not be easy. To have any chance of meeting the Maastricht treaty's economic convergence targets - which Mr Gonzalez is determined to do - the labour market would require reforms to make it easier to hire and fire workers, something the unions would oppose. But there would be trade-offs in the form of apprenticeships and training. On the employers' side, the prime minister may try to persuade them to make specific commitments to plough back profits into their businesses. In return, the government could perhaps offer tax concessions. Discussions involving unions and employers might also make it easier for the government to begin running down and even closing loss-making public sector companies and, perhaps, privatising those which could be profitable. Without a pact, Mr Gonzalez's fourth term threatens to become as bereft of achievement as his third. The two biggest drains on the public purse continue to be unemployment benefits and health care, neither of which can be contained - beyond trimming waste - without serious political damage. In essence, the pact would be a way of diverting effort from the unsolvable to the solvable. Mr Gonzalez has a breathing space. The country does not expect a rapid escape from the recession or from high unemployment - 3.3m people are officially out of work - and it has been primed during the campaign for the tough austerity programme necessary for recovery. Such a programme, plus the pact, and a tough 1994 budget, are all politically feasible. Sunday night changed Spanish politics not simply because the vote ended the country's tradition of outright parliamentary majorities but because Mr Gonzalez himself says he has changed. 'I have understood the message of the people,' he said. That message is to get off his pedestal and compromise. He could do this by bringing fresh faces into the government, along with non-party members. For many Spaniards this is an alluring prospect, promising a more open administration. By pinpointing the areas of waste, inefficiency and illegal political financing, Mr Aznar may have done Mr Gonalez a favour during the campaign. But as he begins to manoeuvre the unions and employers to his negotiating table, Mr Gonalez must also decide whether the 159 seats the Socialists have won are enough to allow him to govern as a minority, making long-term pacts with the conservative ruling CiU in Catalonia and perhaps the PNV in the Basque country. Or he could form a coalition government with one or both of them. No doubt he would wish to go it alone, but in the CiU at least, there is a debate over whether to enter national government. Mr Miguel Roca, parliamentary leader of the CiU, is close to the Socialists and has ministerial ambitions, but the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, worries that helping the Socialists to govern might cost him support during Catalan elections, which the Socialists also contest. Given the economic obstacles the next government will have to overcome, the PP will want to see life made as difficult as possible. A proliferation of regional parties in the national government would work in its favour because if anything should go wrong, they would share the blame. The PP believed it would win the election and in many cases lost close races to small conservative regional parties. Somehow, the PP has to find an accommodation with the scattered regional right or seek to capture the regional vote. Both would take time. The result was a bitter blow for the conservatives. The PP is a vituperative party and conceivably could blame Mr Aznar. But that would be reckless. He has raised the PP's game to the point where Spain, for the first time in more than a decade, has a worthy opposition. Mr Aznar repelled some voters with his arrogant style but in conceding defeat on Sunday he was gracious and generous, finally revealing two impressive qualities when it was too late. The next time, provided he does not hide his humanity away again, he will be a real threat to Mr Gonzalez. Until then, Mr Gonzalez has been given an unprecedented opportunity to tackle the weaknesses in economic policy and in his relationship with his party that were exposed during his third term. The last Socialist leader in the European Community, he will be keen to prove that the key to growth does not lie on only one side of the political spectrum. He faces some big tests, but he has more than 9m Spaniards rooting for him.</p>

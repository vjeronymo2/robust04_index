			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / People: Insurance moves John Engestrom, 50, is to take over the reins as chief executive at Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, in an appointment which may underline the commitment of M&amp;G's parent, the Prudential, to reinsurance, a business it has been in since the early 1970s. Engestrom was head of worldwide reinsurance operations with Skandia Re, the reinsurance subsidiary of Sweden's biggest insurer. And while both the Pru and Skandia have been tipped to withdraw from the volatile international reinsurance market in order to concentrate on lower margin but more stable general insurance and life assurance business, Engestrom obviously feels M&amp;G is the better bet to last the pace. Skandia came close to selling Skandia Re to Norway's Unistorbrand earlier this year. Engestrom, who has an MBA from the University of Geneva, succeeds John Lock, retiring after 37 years with M&amp;G. ***** John Ramplin is retiring as chairman of ENGLISH &amp; AMERICAN GROUP, but remains a director; Philip Evans becomes group chairman and Chris Keeling deputy chairman. Anthony Taylor succeeds Evans as group chief executive.</p>

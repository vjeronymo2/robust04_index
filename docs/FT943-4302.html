			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Banks set derivatives disclosure guidelines International banks yesterday responded to growing pressure for better information about the risks they run by using financial derivatives by suggesting new standards for disclosure. The Institute of International Finance, an association of 180 international banks and securities firms, published a set of guidelines for disclosure in annual reports. Mr Charles Dallara, the institute's managing director, said that greater transparency would be 'in everyone's interest'. The guidelines were drawn up by a working group including most of the leading firms selling over-the-counter derivatives - contracts sold by banks to companies to help them control the risk of movements in currency and interest rates. The institute said there was no adequate method of quantifying the risks banks run from market movements leading to falls in the value of derivatives such as swaps and options, and recommended instead that banks provide a description of risk management methods. Concern that banks do not make detailed enough disclosures about derivatives has grown because of losses by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble. As the contacts derive from the value of other securities and indexes, they do not appear on balance sheets. This has led to legislative pressure in the US for improved disclosure, and tighter regulation of securities firms' derivatives trading units. Although banks and securities firms in the EU and US are required by accounting rules to disclose information on derivatives, if the guidelines were adopted by all banks it would give a clearer picture of the global market. Ms Barbara Matthews, an associate banking adviser of the institute, said banks had pressed for guidelines in order to establish the size of the market. There was no requirement for members to follow them, but several had indicated they would. The working group suggested that banks and securities firms should disclose three things: The total replacement value of contracts - the amount they would have to spend to buy new derivatives contracts if companies defaulted on existing ones. This would be divided into contracts with companies of various credit ratings. The value of contracts in each category of derivatives, such as currency swaps and interest rate options, and a breakdown of maturity profiles, or the length of time contracts have to run before expiry. Analysis of their methods of accounting, risk management, netting of contracts, and limits on trading. They would also have to describe management controls, an aspect of risk management which many supervisors have highlighted. Ms Matthews said that although many banks and securities firms complied with individual aspects of the new guidelines, none yet complied with them all.</p>

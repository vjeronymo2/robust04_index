			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUTTON CHANGES HIS MIND, QUITS AS KENTUCKY COACH  </P> <P> Twenty-four hours after saying that resigning would be an admission of guilt,  Eddie Sutton on Sunday announced his resignation as Kentucky basketball coach.  </P> <P> He insisted he was not forced to resign and that he is innocent of any  wrongdoing in connection with 18 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. allegations  against the program.  </P> <P> Rumors of Sutton's resignation, or possible firing, had circulated since last  October, when the NCAA announced its charges.  </P> <P> Sutton, who Saturday had repeated his intention to remain as coach, said he  changed his mind because of the increasing rumors about his status. One such  report, which surfaced last Friday, said Sutton had offered to fire his  assistants if he would be retained.  </P> <P> "These instances have popped up and I think they will continue to do that, and  I think people are going to get hurt and I can't see doing that," he said.  </P> <P> During a news conference, Sutton said he made his decision Saturday night after  consulting with his family and doing "a lot of praying."  </P> <P> He met Sunday with university president David Roselle, who, according to the  coach, accepted the resignation and expressed thanks for Sutton's dedication to  the program.  </P> <P> During his own news conference Sunday night, Roselle said the question of  Sutton's resignation had come up in a meeting last Wednesday at the president's  residence on the Kentucky campus.  </P> <P> "We talked about it (resignation) -- what was good for the program," Roselle  said of the session, which also included acting athletic director Joe Burke and  university lawyer James Parke Jr., among others.  </P> <P> Roselle praised what he called Sutton's "willingness to recognize that his  resignation is a necessary step in the process of rebuilding our basketball  program."  </P> <P> Roselle added that the university athletics board was scheduled to meet Tuesday  to discuss the basketball situation.  </P> <P> Asked if his leaving might soften any possible punishment meted out by the  NCAA, Sutton said, "I would hope they would take it into consideration."  </P> <P> Roselle added: "One hopes that it does, but one does not do it for that  reason."  </P> <P> Roselle said Parke and Burke were en route to NCAA headquarters at Mission,  Kan., to meet with investigators.  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, during an interview on CBS-TV, Sutton said he was resigning  "for one reason -- the love I have for the University of Kentucky, for the  Kentucky basketball program and the people of the commonwealth."  </P> <P> He cited recent "vicious" rumors about his status that he said had hurt and  would continue to hurt a lot of people.  </P> <P> "I know how important basketball is to the people of the state, and I've  decided for the good of the program, for the fans, for the players and most of  all for my family, I should resign at this time.  </P> <P> "I've had 30 wonderful years of coaching. I've always tried to run the programs  in the right way and I've done the same thing here. But I just feel like if  this continues, it's going to hurt more and more people and I don't want the  University of Kentucky basketball program to suffer anymore."  </P> <P> Sutton said he had informed most of the players, who were on spring break this  week, and his assistants of his decision. Casey and assistants Jimmy Dykes and  James Dickey could not be reached for comment Sunday night.  </P> <P> Casey's lawyer, Joe Bill Campbell of Bowling Green, Ky., said he and Casey  would not have a comment on the resignation or Casey's status until today.  </P> <P> Under the 53-year-old Sutton, Kentucky had a 90-40 record, including two  Southeastern Conference titles, but slumped to 13-19 this season, the first  losing season at the school in 62 years.  </P></p>

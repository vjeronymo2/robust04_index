			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: MONOLOGUES AT COMPANY OF ANGELS; 'WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?' AT 2ND  STAGE; 'NIGHTMARE' AT BELIEVERS REP; 'CHATEAU' AT CALLBOARD; 'TOUR' AT CLUB  WONG  </P> <P> The boundaries crossed in these two top-notch monologues at Company of Angels  aren't fraught with danger, nor do they concern cataclysmic events. They are  simple, human, affecting boundaries over which the two protagonists traverse in  playing the best game they can with the cards they've been dealt.  </P> <P> Brad Bailey's "Crowning Glory" concerns the non-steel magnolia who owns  Annette's Beautyrama in an unspecified town presumably in the playwright's  native Alabama. Annette is nice, in the best sense of the word.  </P> <P> She doesn't even hold much anger for ex-husband Ray, who beat her up and then  cut off the bountiful head of hair her mother called her "crowning glory."  </P> <P> Annette even understands why the words don't appear in the Bible as she had  always thought, because, after all, men wrote the Bible, and "men don't know  much about hair. Or crowns. Or glory." So she wrote them in herself with an  "ink pen."  </P> <P> Actress Suanne Spoke is a delight as Annette discovering that on the other side  of her early boundaries she can be self-sufficient, fulfilled and happy.  </P> <P> She's a charmer.  </P> <P> Jean Colonomos' "The Waiting Room" is a deeper, richer piece of writing, and  the performance of Joan Darling as a woman in her 50s, visiting her autistic  husband at his hospital to deliver an unsettling piece of news, is a gem.  </P> <P> Ethel Rosen really loves Melvin and always has. She encouraged him in business  and totally shared his love for their daughter Thelma. But Ethel has never been  able to understand his withdrawal from reality, just because of the one  failure, the bankruptcy which cost him his business.  </P> <P> Now she has something important to tell him, that she is about to cross her own  boundary to rejoin the living -- and the loving. It is a difficult dramatic  transition handled by Darling with ease and finesse. Even Ethel's thoughtful  silences are rich in the detail of this fine characterization.  </P> <P> Both pieces are directed with insight into what makes women tick by Mary Lou  Belli, who understands that a moment of quiet can be as dramatic as a crack of  thunder.  </P> <P>  At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, today and Saturday, 7 and 9 p.m.; ends  Sunday, 2 p.m. Tickets: $10; (213) 664-6598.  </P> <P> 'What Can I Tell You?'  </P> <P> What can I tell you? Siobhan Fallon is a very funny lady.  </P> <P> In her evening of one-woman sketches at 2nd Stage she manages to explore the  same territory Lily Tomlin and Whoopi Goldberg inhabit with equally funny  results.  </P> <P> Fallon's art is characterization, and that's exactly what allows her to use  some well-worn cliches as springboards and make them look brand new. Her Valley  girl clone of "High School Harmony" erases memories of lesser Valley girls,  just as her platitude spouting, time conscious group therapist gives a new  comic edge to that stereotype.  </P> <P> Each of her sketches springs from an unerring comic sense. Fallon thinks funny,  therefore she is. There is heart behind her humor. In a business surfeited with  unfunny would-be comics, she's an original.  </P> <P>  At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, today through Sunday only, 8 p.m.  Tickets: $9.99; (213) 874-9399.  </P> <P> 'A Waitress Nightmare'  </P> <P> Scratch a waiter or waitress and you'll probably find an actor. Apparently you  might even find a playwright. In "A Waitress Nightmare" at Believers Repertory,  Nancy D'Aleo puts her experiences to use in a slight sitcom about a contest  between waitresses in the coffee shop of the Swaying Palms Hotel (at least  Janet Stout's costumes say coffee shop).  </P> <P> It's not a high-class joint (mustard instead of horseradish is served with the  roast beef) and it's not a very high-class comedy. Although her characters are  well drawn (Christina Miller as a dyed-in-the-wool Baptist who lies about being  a writer, and Leslie Brooks as a new mother with a lactating fixation stand  out) they mostly just sit around and schmooze.  </P> <P> Bekah Dannelley's direction is bright enough to catch most of the humor but not  deep enough to erase the feeling that a commercial is just around the corner.  Larry G. Welch almost saves the evening with a spiraling comic performance as  the frenetic kooky cook Flash.  </P> <P>  At 9025 Cynthia St., West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.,  indefinitely. Tickets: $7; (213) 463-6480.  </P> <P> 'Chateau in Sweden'  </P> <P> Author-playwright Francoise Sagan has cast her certain smile on many an odd  situation in her work and doesn't stint in her examination of the definitely  odd goings-on at this definitely odd chateau in Sweden. A number of interesting  Gallic theater pieces have been presented by producer Yasmine Golchan and this  strange comedy at Callboard Theatre is another apt choice.  </P> <P> Sagan borrows the sexual games of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" and a bit of  Pirandello (an actor jumps out of the action into the audience to cries of  "unfair"). It is all very stylish and theatrical, though its staging here tries  to deny the fact, under Pierre de Moro's plodding, insensitive direction. His  company is decidedly American and doesn't have the delicacy the work demands.  </P> <P> Valerie Armstrong as the sister who owns the chateau, Robert Snively as the  tippling butler and Patrick Hauser as the sexual dupe from Stockholm come  closest to the sincerity, if not the spirit, of Sagan's writing. But the others  are doing Preston Sturges.  </P> <P>  At 8451 Melrose Place, West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.;  Sundays, 7 p.m.; through Dec. 17. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> 'Comeback Tour'  </P> <P> Fifties' blond starlet Peggy Judy is making her comeback at the Club Wong,  where she began her illustrious career many years ago (her resume includes such  films as "Cigarette Girls From Hell" and "The Thing With Two Backs"). She is  accompanied by her lounge lizard ex-husband Buddy Judy and her two dancing  boys, exiles from the San Francisco Ballet.  </P> <P> That's the joke. There isn't much more than that in this mercifully brief  evening, filled out with weak satires of dingy club performances and cliched  Hollywood ribs.  </P> <P> Lee Magnuson and Don Oscar Smith get the biggest laughs as the backup dancers  ("special choreography" by Geoffrey Webb and Corky Omine is really laughable).  </P> <P>  At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, today and Saturday only, 10:30 p.m.  Tickets: $6; (213) 653-5871.  </P></p>

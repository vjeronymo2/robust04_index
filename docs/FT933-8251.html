			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Powers of an invisible man: Peter Schmidhuber, EC budget commissioner, talks to Lionel Barber about the cash crisis Throughout his five-and-a-half years as European Community budget commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber has been virtually invisible to the public eye. A master of the long and winding subordinate clause, his ponderous manner and penchant for grey suits fit the popular image of the German public servant dedicated to fulfilling the most thankless tasks, in his case super-vision of the annual Ecu68bn budget. Yet there is another side to Mr Schmidhuber, which belies his reputation as one of the least inspiring members of the European Commission. A native Bavarian, he has a stubborn streak which bursts into occasional declarations of independence. He boycotted the emergency session called by Commission president Mr Jacques Delors 12 days ago to discuss the exchange rate mechanism debacle. He let it be known the meeting was more a talking shop than a decision-taking forum, and remained in his vacation home in the Austrian Alps. Mr Schmidhuber's independent character also means that he is receptive to ideas which might be shunned by some commissioners. For instance, he has long been an advocate of Austria's entry into the Community, arguing that membership would strengthen its ties with south-eastern Europe, including the Balkans. He has also suggested that the 17 commissioners should be elected directly by the European Parliament, a step which would diminish national patronage but would make the Commission more accountable. What is most striking about Mr Schmidhuber's EC career is how he has exploited his low profile to accumulate power in the Brussels bureaucracy. Mr Schmidhuber plays several important roles. His main job is chief financial controller, monitoring how and where the Community budget is spent. But he is also in charge of the Community's fight against fraud. And last year he took over responsibility for the Cohesion Fund, which will hand over more than Ecu15bn to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain over the next seven years to enable these poorer EC member states to meet Community environmental standards and improve their transport and communications infrastructure. His immediate task is to tackle the latest EC financial crisis, triggered by lower-than-expected growth and the recent debacle in Europe's currency markets, which has led to a devaluation of the Ecu - the currency in which most of the Community's budget is denominated. Spending constraints have forced the Commission to freeze 965 posts and rigorously enforce expenditure limits. Staff have started complaining that broken-down equipment such as photocopiers are not being replaced, while core activities such as trade missions are suffering because of travel cuts. The squeeze is set to continue next year because of a surge of almost 20 per cent in pension costs. The reason: young Eurocrats who entered the European Economic Community in 1958 after the Treaty of Rome are now approaching the retirement limit of 60. 'We are already feeling the pinch,' said Mr Schmidhuber in an interview before the effective collapse of the ERM, 'but there is a saying in Germany: 'He who bears the cross will attain salvation'.' Mr Schmidhuber's designated cross is the European Parliament. MEPs are pressing for more influence over the budget, partly in anticipation of new powers on 'co-decision' which the parliament will gain once the Maastricht treaty is ratified by all 12 member states. But the present impasse also points to unfinished budget business at last December's summit in Edinburgh. Although EC leaders agreed to a seven-year budget deal which raised spending from 1.2 per cent of Community gross domestic product to 1.27 per cent by 1999, parliament is withholding approval. MEPs are sticking to two demands: an increase in influence in shaping non-discretionary spending, such as the Ecu35bn farm budget; and a 'revision clause' allowing for a fresh look at spending levels on January 1 1995. This is the somewhat ambitious date set for the entry of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway into the EC. Mr Schmidhuber points out that it would be a natural point at which to re-examine the Edinburgh budget assumptions. If the Nordic newcomers turn into net contributors, this could create fresh resources for those areas, such as EC foreign policy and research spending, which were short-changed, he says. The call for more money falls into familiar categories. First, the Community budget, at only 2.4 per cent of the total public expenditure of member states, is small; second, the EC continues to take on new tasks, such as aid to eastern Europe; third, the Common Agricultural Policy, though nearly 50 per cent of the total budget, is declining and remains modest. Critics counter that the Community continues to suffer from a cultural bias in favour of spending. This stems from its traditional role of launching policies in partnership with member states, without a corresponding mechanism for measuring their success. This is particularly true of the Structural Fund, the development aid programme which with a budget of Ecu141.5bn between 1994-99 is designed to help the EC's poorer regions; but it also explains why billions of Ecus have been wasted in the agricultural budget in various milk, olive oil and tobacco scandals, mainly in the Mediterranean countries. Mr Schmidhuber says studies on Structural Fund spending are carried out every three years, but he concedes that clear answers are elusive. 'If you run a bicycle shop, you can tell after a year whether it was a good idea or not. You can tell if you made a profit or a loss. But it is not that easy with public investment.' Yet the Maastricht treaty's emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - devolving responsibility from Brussels to national and local level - must surely force the Commission to develop new types of management skills and better information flows to establish whether EC policies are working. Mr Schmidhuber suggests that the increasing use of external consultants shows the Commission is moving in the right direction. But even the low-key commissioner admits that much more needs to be done.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Ukraine"]    [Text] Speaking on Ukrainian television, Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko stated that the inability to find the necessary  ways of solving imminent problems of Ukrainian-Russian relations  "does no credit to either Ukraine or Russia." However,  according to Zlenko, Russia for Ukraine is a special strategic  partner, and therefore the result of bilateral talks "always  determines the desire to find ways to settle differences that  crop up." Anatoliy Zlenko also stated that he values highly the  efficiency of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev while  always openly criticizing him for inconsistency. Characterizing  his relations with the current Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, Zlenko  stated that they are businesslike because the deputies had  passed a number of documents elaborated by the Ukrainian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular the guidelines of  Ukraine's foreign policy. Zlenko expressed the wish that a  future parliament of Ukraine would consist of professionals,  honest people who would not so often revile Ukraine, a country  which they intend to serve. The foreign minister listed among  Ukraine's accomplishments last year the establishment of the  first stage of foreign policy, the creation of the basis for  expanding relations between states, the establishment of an  embassy and consulate infrastructure abroad, and the acquiring  by his agency of new premises and new diplomatic cadres.  Anatoliy Zlenko pointed out as the main event of last year the  fact that the Ukrainian people "showed patience, wisdom, and  good sense, and we have come to the New Year in peace and  accord."</p>

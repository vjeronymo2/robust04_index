			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japanese investors forced to watch bottom line - Yield is guiding funds abroad THE European and US companies still agonising over that first, tentative investment in Thailand or Malaysia have been left far behind by Mr Toshihiko Sekimoto, Asian general manager at Itochu, the Japanese trading house. 'We may be reducing our projects in Thailand. We have found it difficult to transfer technology and know-how to our Thai factories. We are very interested in Vietnam. India could be interesting,' Mr Sekimoto says. His comments reflect the changing emphasis of Japanese foreign direct investment, often motivated by a ill-defined desire for expansion or in the hope of reducing trade friction and elevating the corporate profile. Now, earnings are falling at home, capital costs are rising, and the stress is on profitability. These changed circumstances are behind a 27 per cent fall in investment last fiscal year and a further 12 per cent in the first half this year. Companies are reviewing locations and project types - the US and continental Europe are out of favour, developers are selling not buying property, and manufacturers' priority is cheaper production of or assembly of components. Figures compiled by the ministry of international trade and industry show that the average return on sales for Japanese investment projects in Asia has been 3 per cent and in Europe 1 per cent, while investments in the US are showing a return of -0.1 per cent. For manufacturing projects, Asia is showing a 5 per cent return, Europe 3.2 per cent and the US -0.9 per cent. Poor yields on foreign investment could be easily tolerated in the late 1980s, when sales were surging at home, and the gravity-defying Tokyo stock market provided funds at close to zero cost and allowed companies to supplement core earnings with quick profits on stock sales. However, Nikko Research estimates that manufacturers' operating profit margin this year will average 3.1 per cent, down from the previous lows of 3.2 per cent in 1986, post-Plaza Accord (which caused a sharp rise in the value of the yen), and the oil shock-affected 4.5 per cent in 1975. One side-effect of the 'bubble era' was an expansion of investment within Japan by the electronics, machine tool, and car industries, which have suffered some of the largest falls in profit over the past year and are under extreme pressure to relocate facilities in lower-cost countries. Mr Yuji Hosoya, deputy director of international business at Miti's industrial policy bureau, says the erosion of core profits has forced manufacturers into 'survival' investment elsewhere in Asia. That trend can be seen in the jump in Chinese projects from 165 in 1990 to 246 last fiscal year. Over the same period, Asian countries' share of new Japanese direct investment rose from 12.4 per cent to 14.3 per cent, the US share declined from 45.9 per cent to 43.3 per cent, and Europe from 25.1 per cent to 22.5 per cent - the UK share fell from 12 per cent to 8.6 per cent. The pace of change has quickened markedly this year. Investment in China is likely to double from the Dollars 579m of 1991, while investment in continental Europe is expected to be about 30 per cent lower, with a smaller decline in the UK. Asia is generally an increasingly popular site for new projects, but companies are more strategic in choosing a site for investment, and no longer motivated by the desire for a factory in every country. In emphasising the need for better returns, Mr Sekimoto explains that Itochu has a textile spinning mill in Thailand and another in Vietnam. The Thai plant has about 2,000 local employees and requires 22 Japanese specialists, while the Vietnamese plant has 1,700 staff and no permanent Japanese managers, but is 2.5 times larger than the Thai factory. He says lower salaries in Vietnam add to the attraction of that country as an investment site: 'A monthly salary in Thailand is between Dollars 70 and Dollars 80, but in Vietnam it is Dollars 20. The Vietnamese are twice as productive, which makes them eight times cheaper than Thai workers.' Japanese companies are keen on China because of increasing access to the flourishing domestic market and because it is suitable low-cost centre for assembly or components production for the international market. They are not rushing to sign contracts in Hanoi, as concerns remain about infrastructure and legal protection, but Vietnam will experience a long-term increase in investment while the flow of money slows to other countries. The resumption of Japan's official development assistance to Vietnam last month provided extra encouragement to investors. Mr Sekimoto provided another clue to the future flow of Japanese funds in Asia. He has devised a rough scale of worker productivity, based on his experience with projects in the region - Indonesia and Malaysia are at the bottom, rating a 1, India and Sri Lanka 1.5, Thailand 2, Japan and China 3, Korea 3.5, and Vietnam 4. 'One thing I found in Bangkok is that some workers would leave us after only a year and boast that they had been trained by a genuine Japanese company. It is important that workers want to go on learning,' he said. 'If you go to Vietnam, there are a lot of book shops. They are always wanting to learn.'</p>

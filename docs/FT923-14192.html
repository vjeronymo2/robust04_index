			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hickson pays Pounds 22m for Irish chemicals group HICKSON International, the specialist chemicals group, yesterday announced the acquisition of Angus Fine Chemicals, based in the Irish Republic, for IPounds 24.1m (Pounds 22.4m). The acquisition will be financed by the issue of 12.75m new shares, placed by Smith New Court yesterday at 175p each. Holders will be free to claw back shares at the same price on a 1-for-12.57 basis. The acquisition will give Hickson an entry into the supply of fine chemicals to pharmaceuticals companies, an area of the fine chemicals market where it lacks a substantial presence. Mr Michael Rowley, finance director, said the market for these fine chemicals was growing by 5 per cent a year, but was confident it could expand between 6 and 8 per cent. The group had considered organic investment at its Castleford plant but had chosen the acquisition route for a number of reasons, including the chance to buy a plant that was already approved by the US Federal Drug Administration.</p>

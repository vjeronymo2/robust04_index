			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to direct fire at Labour over-spending: Local Elections TODAY's expected announce-ment of the proposed replacement for the poll tax will signal a Tory bid to fight the second half of the local election campaign on their own terms - by directing attention at high-spending Labour councils. Foreshadowing the new phase of the campaign, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, yesterday launched a document giving examples of Labour 'mismanagement, inefficiency, failure and lunacy', such as the non-collection of council rents, and high levels of debt per head. 'They don't collect the money owed to them, they fritter away funds on pointless projects, and they obstruct competition for local services,' he said. Tomorrow's press conference - only the party's second of the campaign - will see Mr Patten, together with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, emphasise the claim: 'Conservative councillors cost you less.' The Tories' determination to put their poll tax troubles behind them was underlined in a speech by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, as he called on the party to unite behind the prime minister and the party's central beliefs. 'The Conservatives united are an almost unbeatable force; the Conservatives disunited are not long off the opposition benches,' he said. Labour, however, remains confident that the method of financing local government will continue to be the main issue in the campaign, and that the government's proposals are still vulnerable. The opposition has changed its earlier tactics of attacking the new charge as the 'son of poll tax'. It has tacitly admitted that the new tax is different by publishing a range of ministerial criticisms of a property tax, to indicate the likely extent of disagreement among Tory MPs over the basis of the system. 'There is root and branch opposition to any form of property tax from the top to the bottom of today's Tory party,' Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary said yesterday. While Labour officials acknowledge that the party may not be able convincingly to accuse the new charge of being a form of poll tax, they believe it will still be attacked as unfair and too complex. The opposition will point, in particular, to the way in which a banding system will reduce the progressive nature of the tax, the use of capital values alone to determine the band into which property falls and the fact that the single-person discount is not linked to ability to pay. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, also cast doubt on the trustworthiness of the amounts for projected bills under the new system, claiming they were 'fairy-tale figures'.</p>

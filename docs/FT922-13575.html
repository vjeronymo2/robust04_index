			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Events in Germany mean tough year ahead for British economy THE ECONOMIC strains caused by rising inflation, aggressive trade unions and an uncompromising monetary policy in Germany will make the remainder of 1992 a tough time for the British economy, regardless of the election result, writes Edward Balls. Germany is currently suffering the kinds of industrial strife experienced in the UK in the late 1970s. The expansionary effects of German unification have pushed up German inflation, while the public sector unions are threatening to strike if their demands for higher pay settlements are not met. None of which is good news for the UK, France or other European countries whose interest rates are tied to those of Germany in the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK and France would both like to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. But the Bundesbank looks set to keep German interest rates high for the rest of this year. The winners of the UK election will have to endure slow economic growth throughout 1992. The combination of high real interest rates and heavy household debts will continue to discourage consumers from borrowing and spending. The result is that already high UK unemployment will have to rise further. One positive side-effect of the depth of the recession is that UK wage inflation might fall to European levels this year. The cost in terms of lost output and jobs will have been high. But unless wage inflation does fall, the competitiveness of UK exports will continue to deteriorate and Britain's current account will remain in deficit. This will not be a good background on which to fight a second election this year. No wonder both parties were praying for a clear majority.</p>

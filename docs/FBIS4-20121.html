			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a debate between Labor Party leader Wim Kok and </F> Democrats 66 leader Hans van Mierlo by Arnold Koper and Co  Welgraven; place and date not given: "You Have No Partner and  Neither Do I"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The subject is the purple  coalition and the mini-system for social security advocated by  the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] that such a  government is preventing. Or is it? Kok reproaches Van Mierlo  for having made concessions to the VVD too early on. It is no  secret that the D66 [Democrats 66] will go far to ensure that a  coalition is formed without the CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal].    [Van Mierlo] Wim, never again may you say that I am starting  to embrace the minisystem. It is simply not true! We are  virtually the first people in the country to have rejected the  minisystem.    [Kok] There is an ugly discrepancy between what you say one  day and what you say the next. First I hear you say to the VVD  that you want a purple coalition, but that there can be no  minisystem. That is hard talk, words after my own heart. Then,  two days later I hear you say to Bolkestein: "Naturally we  fulfill a bridging function; it is a matter for discussion." In  actual fact what you are saying is that there can be no  minisystem, but that you will have to talk about it. That is  making too major a concession to Bolkestein on a subject that is  very close to my heart.    [Van Mierlo] How can you listen to someone so maliciously?  Our election platform clearly states that we reject the  minisystem. That is it. Then I said to the VVD: "You are the  only ones who want such a system." To the PvdA [Labor Party] I  said: "You are the only people in the country who are telling  me that nothing has to be changed in the social security sector.  My conclusion is that you will both have to shift your opinion,  and I expect that you will end up somewhere in the neighborhood  of our ideas. And naturally I intend to make concessions. In  this country you cannot make coalitions without making  concessions." [passage omitted]    [Kok] This is an historic moment in Netherlands relations.  The CDA's position of power is being considerably limited.  Also by the fact that the major parties are no longer excluding  each other. The CDA can therefore no longer divide and rule and  manipulate things so that it remains at the center of power  after all. We are all going into these elections without  partners. Hans, you have no partner nor do I. We have shaken  off our chains.    [Van Mierlo] And arms. How long ago was it that you said  that the government must be the stake of this election?    [Kok] I am still the only person to defend this government  policy. Our partner has turned his back on us. The CDA is so  confused and embarrassed that it is common knowledge that the  party needs to create a kind of image of the enemy just outside  the door for the sake of restoring harmony within itself.    I am going openly into the elections, with an open mind  regarding the coalition possibilities thereafter. Personally,  the preference for a purple coalition does not rank in first  place. For me, the most important question is this: How can we  secure the best platform outcome for a government in which the  PvdA and D66 can lay a firm, progressive foundation? I am quite  clear about its contents, less clear about the color. Hans is  quite clear about the color, and less clear about the contents.    [Van Mierlo] Mind what you say. The content is plain to see  in our election platform. I remember when we were reproached  for never making any choices in advance. Now we are the only  ones to do so. And with good reason. I believe that there  really is a need for change in this country. Nothing is working  any more. No. You have been busy for four years and not one  single major operation has taken off. Do you know what has  taken off? The mobile air brigade. Provided that you at least  throw Ter Beek the pennies he needs to set it up.    Our first option is a purple coalition. That is what we are  betting on. And I shall not say what our second option is. My  lips are sealed. Because then you would know exactly what and  whom you have to sabotage. I am not going to play right into  your hands.    [Kok] Are you thinking of a government including the CDA,  VVD, and D66?    [Van Mierlo] I am not thinking of that in particular at the  moment.    [Kok] But you are not ruling it out either?    [Van Mierlo] I have not ruled out any government  configuration whatsoever.    [Kok] Interesting.    [Van Mierlo] Come now! Do stop that nonsense! I have been  saying that for a full year!    [Kok] Extremely interesting. For it is well-known that you  are entertaining the possibility of proceeding to form a  government with two right-wing parties.    [Van Mierlo] I want that particular purple coalition, and I  am fighting to obtain it. So I am not going to answer your  question, because that would mean me losing my opportunity for  such a coalition.    [Kok] And yet you did give your answer, because you did not  rule it out. [end Kok]    Whichever coalition comes about, it will have to place  employment at the top of the agenda, definitely now that  unemployment is rising at such an alarming rate. Is full  employment still a feasible objective? PvdA leaders like Van  Dam and Kalma, two of the authors of the election platform, have  their doubts. Neither Kok nor Van Mierlo wants to lay claim to  that analysis. [passage omitted]    [Kok] Will it be possible to achieve full employment in the  medium term? The answer is "no." That is clear, but do not  forget that despite the very high unemployment figures we are  seeing an annual flow of some 400,000 unemployed people. So  there are still prospects for many of them. The real problem  lies in long-term unemployment. That is why two weeks ago I  launched a new social norm for the upcoming government term:  Long-term unemployment must be brought back down to two percent.    [Van Mierlo] I do not think that anyone can predict what  effect technological processes have in terms of unemployment in  West Europe. Moreover, no one knows whether we will succeed in  reforming the Netherlands economy. Nevertheless, I do not think  that you must assume that full employment is no longer possible.  Even if there were talk of jobless growth (economic growth  without growth in jobs), it is still important for social and  psychological reasons to strive for full employment, because the  effort you deploy to combat unemployment will be all the greater  if you assume that full employment is still possible.    [Kok] The idea of economic growth without growth in jobs  only  applies for part of the economy. In major industry, and in the  banking and insurance sectors, the developments are indeed such  that in the medium term we will not see much growth in  employment. In addition, the possibilities of what was  previously called redistribution of work often remain  underexposed. That is a bit of an old-fashioned concept, too  much of a "macro term," but individual decisions to make work  shorter hours and in a different manner have a place in the  pattern for new generations on the labor market. Lastly, I think  that we must create new opportunities for the large group of  long-term unemployed people, who have no prospects at all. In a  future government term a minister or state secretary should be  able to make an innovative, unorthodox project of this --  reforging benefit payments to help the long-term unemployed find  a job.    D66 also wants to create "cheap" work, but Van Mierlo is  afraid that the PvdA will place the burden of creating it on  those in the middle income bracket. On balance, that could be  counterproductive.    [Van Mierlo] If you want to improve the structure of the  economy -- telematics, environmental technology, biotechnology  -- then you must not levy unnecessarily heavy taxes on the work  that must be carried out to do this. According to the PvdA  platform, of each extra guilder earned by the middle income  groups (43 to 90 thousand guilders), 66 cents will go to the  collective tax burden, whereas with us the figure is 55 cents.  In the long term, that will create better conditions for growth  in employment in those sectors where the people on the underside  [of society] can also benefit by being pushed through. [end Van  Mierlo]    Nevertheless, the fight against unemployment will not become  a breaking point between the PvdA and D66. Things are more  difficult with social security. Is not the PvdA making the same  mistake as at the last elections. Is it not once again making  promises it cannot keep?    Van Mierlo points ironically to the WAO (Occupational  Disability Insurance Act) debacle. "I will never accuse you of  social betrayal. However, the way in which you attacked  occupational disability has ruined the whole climate."    Wim Kok admitted that mistakes have been made regarding  presentation, but he said that he still stands behind the  content of the new WAO. "Indeed, the results are beginning to  show. I have trouble understanding how someone who now says  that things cannot go on like this with social security can at  the same time think that in 1991 and 1992 we just let the WAO  take its course. On one occasion we should have started  earlier, while on the other we should just wait."    The question was whether the PvdA had not once again  promised  too much. Are the voters to be surprised once again with  unannounced interventions in social security?    Kok responded with irritation: "If the use of a social law  increases to the extent that we saw in the early 1990's with the  WAO, then that creates new circumstances. If the call for help  grows because the application of a law can no longer be  controlled, then that can force adjustments. If the economy  stagnates, as it has done over the past two years, then that has  drastic consequences for everything. And if new circumstances  arise following the appearance of a electoral platform, then it  is a question of logic and purity for the leadership to talk  about the consequences of this with the people."    [Van Mierlo] What you are now saying is not in your  platform.  It suggests that enough has been done, and that further  intervention would not be necessary. In your last platform you  came up with the link.    [Kok] Hans, you must not caricature this. That so-called  link was never an objective, merely a means to an end. An  instrument -- and here we have a difference of opinion -- for  ensuring that the people on the underside of society are looked  after somewhat more than people with higher incomes.    [Van Mierlo] Yet nothing has come of this over the past four  years. Benefits have fallen in terms of buying power. I do not  want to blame this on you. All I am saying is that your  platform is not a reliable policy indicator for the next four  years.    [Kok] We are simply not living in a command economy. In some  companies, where things are going somewhat better, people are  receiving pay raises that are higher than we would have actually  wanted. The market that we are so fervently wishing upon other  countries has an influence of its own on the development of  wages.    [Van Mierlo] So that means that you can allow yourselves the  illusion of an electoral platform as long as the practical  aspects do not get in the way.    [Kok] That is true for all parties, including yours.    [Van Mierlo] With the difference that we make less promises.</p>

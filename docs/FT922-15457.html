			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Ruhe emerges from the old guard MR Volker Ruhe, the new German defence minister, has long been seen as a rising star of the new generation in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He is a staunch Atlanticist and has a wide range of political friends and contacts in London and Washington. Mr Ruhe, 49 and a fluent English speaker, is the man most credited, alongside Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the party, with giving a sharp edge to political campaigning. That has helped revive CDU fortunes since last year, when the rising costs of unification caused a slump in the polls. Mr Ruhe has used the issue of asylum-seekers, a real public concern, to outmanoeuvre political rivals. As former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, lower house of the German parliament, he has made no secret of his ambition to succeed Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister. In accepting the post of defence minister, he has been forced to settle for less, although since he is a keen supporter of Nato, the appointment will reassure the US that Germany is not drifting away from the alliance.

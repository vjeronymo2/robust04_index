			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INJURY TO A KEY PLAYER AGAIN LETS AIR OUT OF CLIPPER SAILS  </P> <P> The season-ending knee injury to Ron Harper is only the latest setback the  Clippers have had with key players. Snakebitten is a word mentioned more than  once in the past, and Wednesday's announcement just as the Clippers were in  their best run in years won't do anything to deter such continued talk.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in curses or jinxes, but this is the closest thing to it,"  said Coach Don Casey, who has spent six years in the organization, some of that  time when the team was in San Diego.  </P> <P> Some of the other memorable lowlights:  </P> <P>  -- TERRY CUMMINGS. En route to being named rookie of the year for the San  Diego Clippers, he collapsed with two weeks remaining in 1982-83 with what was  later diagnosed as an irregular heart beat. He was traded to Milwaukee, where  he developed into one of the best forwards in the game.  </P> <P>  -- MICHAEL BROOKS. A No. 1 draft choice in 1980, he suffered a severe knee  injury 47 games into the 1983-84 season and never played for the Clippers  again.  </P> <P>  -- DEREK SMITH. The Los Angeles Clippers had a 5-0 start in 1985-86, thanks  largely to Smith's scoring. Then he suffered torn cartilage in his knee in the  ninth game, returning for only the final two games. He had continued knee  problems and never played for the Clippers again.  </P> <P>  -- MARQUES JOHNSON. After averaging 16.4 and 20.3 points in consecutive  seasons, he collided with teammate Benoit Benjamin and ruptured a disk in his  neck 10 games into the 1986-87 season. Johnson missed the rest of the season  and all of the next.  </P> <P>  -- NORM NIXON. The Clippers sent rookie Byron Scott to the Lakers in a package  to get Nixon, and the veteran responded with three years of 14.6 points or  better. Then, he missed all of 1986-87 with a knee injury suffered while  playing softball. After rehabilitation, he missed all of 1987-88 with a  ruptured Achilles' tendon suffered during the next-to-last preseason practice.  </P> <P>  -- DANNY MANNING. Twenty-six games into his rookie season, he suffered a torn  anterior cruciate knee ligament Jan. 4, 1989, and was not able to return until  after this season started.  </P> <P>  -- RON HARPER. Twenty-eight games after he was acquired from Cleveland, he  suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and cartilage damage and will need  surgery. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIA RATES EASTERN EUROPE'S PROSPECTS;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: IT LOOKS FOR SHORT-TERM PAIN AND LONG-TERM GAIN. THAT'S MORE  OPTIMISTIC THAN A SIMILAR REPORT ON THE SOVIET UNION LAST MONTH.  </P> <P> Eastern Europe's emerging democracies face daunting problems, including the  likelihood of deep recession, in shifting to a free-market economic system, but  their long-term prospects are good if they can surmount these difficulties, the  CIA said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A similar report on the Soviet Union, prepared by the CIA and the Pentagon's  Defense Intelligence Agency in April, said the Soviet economy was so unstable  that it could collapse in the face of any serious shock.  </P> <P> But the agency's special report to Congress on Wednesday spoke of optimistic  prospects for East European countries over the long run and praised governments  such as Poland's for embarking on "unprecedented" reforms, even though they are  likely to prove painful in the short term.  </P> <P> It warned, however, that even countries that undertake needed restructuring  face years of slow growth and high unemployment that could spawn serious social  disruption and a severe political backlash that could set back reform efforts.  </P> <P> Despite all the near-term pessimism, the CIA report was decidedly more  optimistic than the one issued on the Soviet economy. It said that the response  to reform efforts in Poland show that "an entrepreneurial spirit survives --  there are . . . risk-takers" left.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the document cautioned that "the realities of the economic  situation facing the region are daunting," and "performance may be poorest in  those countries pushing reform the hardest" -- at least until the harsh  economic medicine has time to take effect.  </P> <P> The agency also expressed optimism about the likely impact of the impending  reunification of West Germany and East Germany, saying that it would "help  jump-start" East Germany's economic recovery and could boost incomes there by  5% a year.  </P> <P> And it predicted that, with the Soviet presence now diminished, former East  Bloc countries will begin cutting defense spending sharply, providing a kind of  "East European peace dividend" that ought to free up needed resources to help  finance economic reforms.  </P> <P> Wednesday's report is expected to bolster calls in Congress for added aid to  Eastern Europe, although that was not necessarily its intent.  </P> <P> Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the panel's subcommittee on national  security, said the CIA's findings show that many East European countries "are  in for a period of recession and economic crises.  </P> <P> "I hope our own long-term policy will help provide stability and the necessary  investments to work through these problems," Bingaman said.  </P> <P> The White House has been urging caution in providing such help to make sure  that the new governments undertake the proper reforms. But the lawmakers have  consistently voted more money for Eastern Europe than the Administration has  requested.  </P> <P> The 45-page report compiled for Congress' Joint Economic Committee said that  despite "real progress" in moving toward a free-market economic system, most  countries in the region lag behind in carrying out planned reforms.  </P> <P> It said Western governments can play a major role in getting the region on its  feet but that much of the help will have to come from private investment. Most  lending from commercial banks already has dried up.  </P> <P> And it predicted that the key to stability in the region will lie in how much  hardship East European voters are willing to tolerate as they move toward a  more productive economies. That "remains largely untested, even in Poland," the  document said.  </P></p>

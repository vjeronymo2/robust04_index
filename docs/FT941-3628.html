			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: China consolidates in electronics China has consolidated the cream of its electronics industry into a single consortium to meet foreign challenges after the country rejoins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The China Electronics Corporation (CEC), formed last week with assets of Dollars 894m, draws together 62 subsidiaries into one company. CEC will concentrate on micro-electronic and telecommunication products at its plants around China. It plans to generate revenues of more than Dollars 2bn by the year 2000. Electronics is regarded by Chinese government as one of its four 'pillar industries' along with motor vehicles, machinery and construction. Revenues from the electronics industry exceeded Dollars 20bn last year, occupying 5.2 per cent of the country's total industrial output. China's re-entry into GATT, expected to take place within the next year or so, would expose its fledgling electronics industry to potentially devastating foreign competition under a lower tariff regime. China's electronic exports reached Dollars 8.11bn in 1993, 18 per cent more than 1992. Imports reached Dollars 10.6bn, an increase of 32 per cent over the previous year. Chinese officials expect the electronics industry to grow 20 per cent this year, and exports to exceed Dollars 10bn.</p>

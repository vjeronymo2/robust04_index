B. Bulgak] </F>   [Text]In Russia, the current level of telecommunications  development corresponds overall to the state of the Russian  economy. Quantitative indicators for the industry rise steadily,  although the rate of their growth has somewhat slowed down  recently.    However, there is no cause for complacency. The industry  does  not permit market structures to function with certitude. Quality  is not high, and the volume of the industry's main services is  limited. The most modern types of these services are poorly  developed.    New requirements for communications services and the gradual  formulation of a market economy made it necessary to develop a  new state policy in the industry.    Recently, the Russian government adopted ``A Concept for a  Russian Federation Program in the Communications Field.'' This  concept determines strategic approaches for the industry to move  ahead in the forthcoming period, including stages and ways to  move ahead.    On the basis of this document, specific programs for  individual types of telecommunications are being developed,  including regional programs and programs for specific  sub-branches of the industry. These programs provide for:        -  Prioritizing the development of the communications  industry and establishing an incentive-based state policy in  this area;    -  Optimally combining state investments in the industry with  the combined resources of enterprises, as well as drawing on  private domestic and foreign capital;    -  Using all forms of private property in the industry, and  eliminating monopolies which provide communications services;    -  Creating the legal means for developing communications in  the country, as well as legal guarantees drawing domestic and  foreign enterprises into investments;    -  Converting the communications field, including the  conversion of the radio frequency spectrum;    -  Establishing a new tariff policy for communications services;    -  Licensing by the state for the activities of individuals and  organizations in the field of communications and certifying  communications equipment and services;    -  Creating new types of communications services;    -  Integrating domestic communications networks with foreign  ones;    -  Gradually eliminating disproportions in the development of  communications region-by-region, by taking into account the  state of their economies;    -  Restructuring the industry.       In order to implement the ``Concept for a Russian Federation  Program in the Communications Field,'' a regulated  telecommunications market must be created.    The regulating role of the state involves concentrating  efforts on key trends for developing the industry, creating  conditions for satisfying the needs for communications services,  conducting a coordinated technical policy, coordinating  communications networks, and creating a civilized community of  communications operating companies in the country.    The incentive-based state policy for developing  communications calls for a preferential taxation and credit  system. These preferential terms should be implemented when  dividing land parcels for enterprises and communications  facilities, when renting spaces, when local authorities allot  subsidies, and when reducing taxes being charged to  communication industries. The funds which are received should be  used to invest in the communications industry.    The investment policy should be designed to attract foreign  capital from all over the world, and this policy should  primarily be implemented on the basis of the individual and  combined resources of enterprises, associations, banking and  other organizations, and individuals. Appropriations from the  state budget are intended for use to implement the largest state  programs.    Creating the legal basis so that the industry can function  calls for the adoption of legislative acts of the Supreme  Soviet, decrees of the President, and mandates of the  government. These will ensure conditions for the development of  communications in the country and provide legal guarantees for  the functioning of the industry, including the protection of  subscriber's rights, property protection, licensing and  certification.    All the interrelated communications networks of Russia are  public networks, department networks, and private networks. They  form the Interrelated Communications Network of Russia, and they  are created and developed using the principles of organizational  and technical unity and mutual redundancy. The Russian  Communications Administration particularly focuses on regulating  the technical and organizational aspects involved in  interrelating the various communications networks.    Enterprises in the industry are created on the basis of the  similarities and differences in forms of property under  competition. Networks and communications equipment may be state  property (federal property, the property of subjects of the  federation, or municipal property), or it may be the property of  individuals or organizations, including foreign ones.    In order to improve the management of the communications  industry in the new economic conditions, the industry is being  restructured. Three independent subgroups in the industry are  being identified: telecommunications, television and radio, and  postal. At telecommunications enterprises the stock auctioning  process has already begun. The creation of non-state companies  is also being supported, including those involving foreign  capital.    The new tariff policy in the communications field is  characterized by its liberalization, and as the economic  situation in the country stabilizes and market forces are  adopted in the industry, it will also be characterized by a  gradual reduction in interference on the part of the state in  setting tariffs for communications services. Elements of state  regulating are intended to retain social access to the main  communications services while economic restructuring takes place  in Russia.    Destroying the monopoly on providing communications  services calls for the provision of these services by several  operating companies. A license issued by the Russian  Communications Ministry gives the right to provide  communications services, and this ministry controls the quality  of the services. Some services call for a competition to issue  the license, which also serves the interests of the consumer,  and serves to create an effective telecommunications system in  the country.    In order to ensure high quality in the services being  provided, and to preserve the compatibility of the  communications networks and equipment, existing and future  networks should be guarded against the appearance of equipment  which does not meet the standards established for Russia in  these networks. Therefore, each type of equipment to be  installed must have a certificate issued by the Russian  Communications Ministry on the basis of the results of testing  conducted in specially created certification centers.    New types of communications services which are being  created by competition, primarily for fulfilling the needs of  market economy organizations, include the following:        -  high quality digital communications networks;    %data transmission networks with packet switching;    %high quality facsimile systems based on digital networks  and/or modern data transmission networks;    %systems for receiving information from data banks;    %message processing systems, which permit  telecommunications text retrieval services to be united into one  automated system for message traffic between subscribers;    %mobile communications systems for document and speech  traffic.       Calculations show that solvent demand for similar  communications services is fairly high. For example, the demand  for digital telephone communications services is approximately  3.0- 3.5 million telephone sets, and for telecoded  communications services (data transmission, message processing,  and high quality facsimile communications) it exceeds several  thousand connection points. At the same time, the potential  exists for quickly fulfilling this demand by creating commercial  organizations.    An important aspect of the Russian state policy in the  communications field is international cooperation, which should  become one of the ways for this industry to get out of this  difficult position under modern conditions. This cooperation is  developing in the following areas:        -  Attracting foreign investments to carry out national  and regional programs;    %Creating joint enterprises to introduce advanced  technology and new equipment into Russian communications  networks;    %Expanding existing international communications networks,  and increasing the volume and quality of services provided to  subscribers of the public networks in order to more fully  integrate the national communications system with communications  systems of the world community;    %Carrying out major technical projects with foreign firms;    %Purchasing imported equipment for the Russian  communications network; %Initiating scientific and  technical exchanges, and attracting foreign specialists to  provide an expert's analysis of national programs and projects;    %Participating in the work of the International  Telecommunications Union;       Adapting the communications industry to new economic  conditions and new subscribers' demands will require a certain  amount of time and can be carried out in stages. During stage  one, the critical situations in the industry have to be stopped  with extreme measures, since the crisis in the country's economy  is continuing. This stage began in 1992 and also encompasses the  current year of 1993.    The main measures to be carried out during stage one are  the following:        -  Liberalizing the tariff policy in the industry in  order to increase enterprises' revenues, primarily by providing  new and higher quality services to commercial market  organizations. During this stage, elements of state tariff  regulation will be maintained for the population and  organizations funded by the state;    %Improving the industry's management structure, which was  already discussed, and privatizing enterprises;    %Carrying out projects which will be implemented in  relatively short time periods and will receive moderate capital  investments will allow a fast return to be obtained. By the same  token, this will make it possible to obtain the means for  developing subsectors of the telecommunications industry with  low profits. Such projects primarily include the creation of an  international communications system in Russia, and the  development of systems which will allow new, highly profitable  services to be provided (for example, honeycomb radiotelephone  service or data transmission with packet switching);    %Introducing new mechanisms for payments between  communications enterprises. This will ensure the proportional  distribution of revenues received by the industry among the  participants in the information transmission process. This will  give all enterprises the chance to develop by using their own  resources;    %Increasing the performance of existing communications  equipment and networks.       The second stage calls for a set of measures for  supporting the functioning of the industry at the level which  has been achieved, for stabilizing the economic situation in the  industry and for preparing it for accelerated development. In  terms of time, this stage corresponds with the transitional  period associated with overcoming the crises in the Russian  economy (approximately 1994-1995).    During this stage, the structural changes previously begun  in the industry will be completed, issues of improving standards  will completely be resolved, conditions will be created to  broadly attract domestic and foreign investments into the  industry, the integration of modern communications equipment and  the development of new types of services will continue, market  mechanisms will be improved, and eliminating the monopoly in the  industry will continue.    Stage three (probably in 1996-2010) calls for measures to  accelerate development of the industry after the crisis is  overcome, and the evolution in the country's economy progresses.  This stage presupposes significant investment growth in  communications, a qualitative jump in converting networks with  modern technologies for the transmission and processing of  information, and increased integration of the telecommunications  networks of Russia into communications systems of the world  community.    It will be possible to increase the capacity of the public  telephone network to 63-78 million basic telephone sets, and  raise telephone density to 40-50 units per 100 inhabitants. New  country- wide networks will arise. They will provide modern  services which will be available to a broad range of  subscribers, as well as high quality and expensive services for  a more narrow group of subscribers. A general national data  transmission network will appear, as well as a Russian  intelligent network, and a digital network with integration of  services. This will permit the creation of a telecommunications  organization that will fill the demands of developing market  relations.    As far as prospects for foreign partners participating in  developing communications in Russia is concerned, this is  already being carried out in many areas.    Our relationship is developing with communications  operating companies, investment firms and international banks,  with whom we are implementing major projects, both international  and national in scope. An example of such successful cooperation  is the construction of Russia's first international underwater  fiber-optic line from Russia to Denmark in a system with digital  radio relay links and three international switching stations.    One of the first examples of cooperation with foreign  operating companies inside the country in the field of public  networks is the project to create a modern communications  network in the Kaliningrad region. A branch of the France  Telecom Company is taking part in the project. The joint  enterprise organized by this firm and its Russian partners  already has a license for the creation of a dedicated line, and  a permit to build a network integrated with the general  telephone network is now being processed. Foreign partners are  participating heavily in the creation of modern data  transmission networks in Russia. Many networks with packet  switching which are successfully functioning and dynamically  developing have a foreign operating company partner, for  example, the SPRINT network, INFOTEL, POCHET, and others.    Another important trend in developing cooperation is for  domestic factories, primarily those which have been converted,  to organize joint enterprises with foreign firms which  manufacture communications equipment. Among them are firms such  as IZHTEL, which are expanding into the production of modern  switching equipment, which is extremely necessary now in Russia.  Moreover, since there are limited currency resources, we prefer  this form of cooperation to direct acquisition of communications  equipment overseas.    An important mechanism for the state to regulate the  industry market is licensing. Licenses for the right to provide  many of the most economically attractive services are being  competed. In this way, there is a selection of the most fully  developed proposals which are the most effective and convenient  for subscribers, and which provide effective use of limited  resources, like the radio- frequency spectrum, the resources of  satellite communications systems and telephone numbering.    Consequently, licenses are issued on a competitive basis  for communications networks which have independent access  overseas, and for honeycomb communications networks with  NMT-450N and GSM-900 federal standards.    The first such competition for the GSM-standard networks  has already taken place for 12 areas, regions and republics in  the Russian Federation. US West, our partner of long standing,  has won this competition with its Russian partners in 8 regions.    In order to issue a license to organize regional honeycomb  systems for which the 800 MHz range has been identified, support  of the regional administrations is necessary.    The state is interested in developing networks which  provide local and long-distance in-country telephone service.  However, these networks require larger capital investments than  small networks having international access, and they are less  profitable. Therefore, in order to provide incentives to  operating companies working within the country, more favorable  conditions for connecting with the public networks have been  established for them.    If private international communications networks must  interact with the country-wide network at the international  switching center level, then local and long-distance operating  companies can be connected to local and long-distance public  networks.    Russia is a colossal market in the communications area both  for operating companies and for equipment manufacturers, and  Russia is trying to enter the global telecommunications society  as a worthy member, having not only the most extensive  communications network, but striving to build this network on a  modern technical level.    We invite all our partners from the countries taking the  place of the former Soviet Union and from neighboring countries  to cooperate with us as equal partners in a mutually profitable  manner.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision related to withdrawal of the enforcement exemptions on the basis of certification by California of a gasoline formulation that does not meet the federal reformulated gasoline standards has been modified in several ways. First and most importantly, the withdrawal will only apply to the refiner, importer or blender of the non-complying formulation, not to all California gasoline. Second, any party whose gasoline is certified under either the predictive model or vehicle testing provisions of the California regulations will be required to notify the Agency within 30 days of such a certification and to submit a written demonstration that the gasoline formulation is in compliance with federal standards. If such a demonstration is not timely submitted, the exemptions are automatically (and immediately) lost. If a submitted demonstration is determined to be incorrect by the Agency, EPA will notify the party (by first-class mail) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that its enforcement exemptions will expire on a certain date. Third, the date on which these exemptions will expire has been extended to no earlier than 90 days from the date of the EPA notice, to provide additional time for compliance. The Agency believes that this additional time is needed to comply with all of the many enforcement requirements that will become applicable if a California exemption is lost. In particular, requirements such as the independent analysis requirements (section 80.65(f)) and the compliance attest engagement requirements (subpart F) may require the negotiation of contracts with third parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the loss of the enforcement exemption will apply to only a single party (rather than to all producers and importers of California gasoline), the Agency does not believe that there is a need for a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notice announcing a determination of non-compliance (as proposed in the NPRM) and has deleted this provision from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date for the withdrawal of the enforcement exemptions on the basis of a reformulated gasoline penalty assessment has been extended to 90 days, and this provision has been revised to make clear that this grace period does not begin until any interim administrative appeal has been completed. Once a final penalty assessment has been made by an agency or a district court, the 90-day period will begin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provision related to compliance with standards on average for an averaging period that is partly before and partly after March 1, 1996, has been clarified. Under the final rule, producers and importers who elect to demonstrate compliance on average with any federal reformulated gasoline standard <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be required to demonstrate such compliance for two overlapping averaging periods: January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995; and March 1, 1995, through February 29, 1996. The proposal could have been interpreted to require compliance with these standards for a two-month averaging period in early 1996, which would be very difficult for refiners to meet on average and which was not intended by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of refiners and importers using the simple model, the standards that may be met on average are the RVP, benzene, oxygen, and toxics emissions performance standards. For parties using the complex model, the standards that may be met on average are the benzene, oxygen, and toxics and VOC emissions performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision intended to prohibit the averaging of ``very clean'' California reformulated gasoline with ``less clean'' federal reformulated gasoline has been clarified in the final rule. In addition, it has been made applicable to producers and importers of all gasoline subject to the California program, not just to refiners and importers located outside the State (as was proposed). Section 80.81(d) now provides that producers and importers of such gasoline must exclude the volume and properties of California reformulated gasoline from all conventional gasoline and federal reformulated gasoline sold elsewhere, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with standards specified in section 80.41 and 80.90. An overall demonstration of compliance for all gasoline (California and non-California) produced or imported is also still required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exemption from the federal recordkeeping requirements has been modified to require the retention for five years of records mandated by section 2270 of the California reformulated gasoline regulations (which require retention for two years). This requirement, along with other enforcement provisions for which an exemption is not being provided, will provide the Agency with the capability of performing audits of compliance with federal requirements by parties who produce California reformulated gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, more detailed information on the modifications made to the proposed rule and the comments on which they are based is contained in the separate ``Responses to Comments'' document. That document also responds to comments that did not result in changes to the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Testing Methods and Testing Tolerances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule, in section 80.46, sets forth test methods regarding reformulated gasoline parameters. EPA has carefully considered all comments concerning proposed test methods and related issues and many of those comments have been incorporated in the final rule. The test methods are those that provide for the best balance of accuracy, cost effectiveness and ease of use for competent lab technicians. The final rule generally provides for one regulatory method for each parameter in order to assure accuracy and to avoid problems with biases between different methods. However, in two cases (regarding oxygen and aromatics) the regulation provides for an alternative method for industry to use, if desired, until January 1, 1997, to provide lead time to acquire equipment necessary for the primary test method and to become familiar with its use. Where American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods have been adopted, any future updated version of the ASTM methods will not automatically be adopted. EPA will use appropriate procedures if it desires to adopt any updated methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

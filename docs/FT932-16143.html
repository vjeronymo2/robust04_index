			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tesco Tesco's results betray the forced cheer one would expect from a retailer that is selling French champagne at less than Pounds 8 a bottle. Operating profits were up 17 per cent on a 52-week comparison basis, but the company admits the recession is not over. Its customers are still trading down and volume in existing stores fell by 0.9 per cent last year. Weekly revenue per square foot in newly-opened stores is approaching Pounds 14.50. Though a marked improvement on a year ago, that is still significantly below J. Sainsbury and the company is vague about the extent of follow-through increases on stores opened in 1991. This is not to belittle the 0.5 point increase to 7.6 per cent in Tesco's operating margin. Since Sainsbury's margin is about a point higher, there ought to be room for more productivity gains, although Tesco will always be dragged down to some degree by the relatively large share of petrol in its total sales. The real difference between the two is that Sainsbury has been able to increase both volume and margin during the recession. Tesco's fortunes depend on how quickly it can build volume. According to the charitable view, its clientele suffered more than Sainsbury's during the recession, so Tesco should be rated a recovery stock. That ignores the arrival of the discounters and the renaissance of Asda. The risk remains that Tesco will have neither the brand image nor the price competitiveness to compete in a mature market. Until it can prove otherwise, its shares will not look cheap, even on a prospective multiple some four points below the market.</p>

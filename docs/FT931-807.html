			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Property: Sssh, green shoots - Cadogan's Place HAS SPRING come to the property market? Not quite, but it looks as if it is on the way. After a disastrous autumn for UK sales, estate agents are quietly optimistic that the worst is over. The winter brought many more viewings and - more significantly - exchanges of contract than in 1992, especially in London, where lower prices and a lower pound have lured foreign buyers. CLEA, the co-operative of Central London Estate Agents, reports that contracts for sale rose by 30 per cent in January and February compared with October and November. In the country it has been more quiet but new buyers are appearing, sometimes with enough money in hand to move quickly. New to the market are two superb Grade I houses in Hertfordshire, both of the late 1720s. Much Hadham Hall is probably the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor (or possibly John James, Wren's master carpenter). The Rev William Stanley, the rector and a Canon of St Paul's, who was involved in rebuilding the cathedral after the Great Fire of London in 1666, decided to give himself this village palace when he failed to become Bishop of London - he knew it would irritate bishops who used the village as their country seat. Much Hadham Hall is unusually intact for a house of this period. Built of brick with a tiled roof, it has large, light rooms around a black and white stone central hall. In the Georgian coach house a stack of Victorian striped awnings lurks in a loose box. It also has 6 1/2 acres and an old-fashioned prep school-type swimming pool. Mullucks Wells (0279-755400) and The London Office (071-439-3900) offer this gem at around Pounds 950,000. William Kent did the panelling and decoration in the other jewel, Odsey House, in Baldock. It is an extraordinary place to find in the country, as it is a red brick box with a handsome sash-windowed front but plain sides. It ought really to be part of a terrace in Richmond, Surrey, rather than deepest Hertfordshire. The second Duke of Devonshire built this piece of urban sophistication. He copied his town house in Manchester Square as a racing lodge for use when he went to Odsey Racecourse. It is a warm, attractive, manageable house, hardly known until the relisting in the 1980s took it from nowhere to Grade I. The Devonshires sold it in 1793 to the Fordhams, who kept the house until 1978 when they sold it to the present vendor. Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris in Cambridge (0223-323130) and The London Office offers it with three acres at around Pounds 500,000. To rent a Regency villa by John Nash (complete with a 'pepperpot' tower) without paying Regents Park prices, ring the National Trust at Attingham Park in Shropshire (074-377343), where a house called Cronkhill is on the estate. Nash grafted it on to a brick and timber farmhouse. Proposed terms are a six months assured shorthold, giving trust and tenant a chance to see if they get on, followed by a seven years assured shorthold. The rent is Pounds 1,200 a month. At a guide price of Pounds 395,000 Savills (0491-579990) is selling the Wharfe Boathouse, at Henley-on-Thames, built in the 1890s in chalet style, with a balcony overlooking the regatta course and the finishing line. You live upstairs and keep your boats below in an enclosed dock. If you are entitled to wear the famous pink of Leander Club, this could be your dream home.</p>

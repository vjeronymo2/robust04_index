			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: New issues show declining trend NEW COMPANIES last year raised more money through flotations than in any year since 1987 but the number of new issues continued to decline, according to KPMG Corporate Finance. The number of full listings fell from 81 to 64 and entrants to the USM were down from 10 to six. The total raised in-creased from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 2.3bn. KPMG's figures exclude the effect of the Abbey National flotation in 1989 and government privatisations. Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG, said the larger average size was further evidence that the Stock Market was not serving the interests of smaller companies. Almost all USM companies and 58 per cent of listed companies had market capitalisations of less than Pounds 30m and faced problems of liquidity in their shares. While flotation remained an excellent route for some companies, smaller quoted companies and some non-quoted companies were increasingly short of access to new capital. 'There are well run, smaller companies which need access to equity if they are to grow,' he said. 'Often they are not yet big enough to generate the interest needed to have a liquid market in the shares after flotation.' Development capital was not always an option. Mr Austin called for institutional investors to consider setting up a secondary market which could be restricted to 'sophisticated investors', who might be made insiders, and who did not need the same degree of protection that the general public required.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A POET'S LEGACY IS STORED IN FOLGER SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY  </P> <P> If William Shakespeare were to come back to life and resurface here, he would  feel very much at home in the neoclassic white marble building across from the  Library of Congress.  </P> <P> Shakespeare would be 426 years old.  </P> <P> Nine large bas-reliefs by sculptor John Gregory depict scenes from  Shakespeare's plays on the exterior of the imposing structure. In a nearby  garden, carved on the base of Brenda Putnam's statue of Puck, is the line from  "A Midsummer Night's Dream": "Lord, what fooles these mortals be!"  </P> <P> Inside the building, the Folger Shakespeare Library, is the world's largest  collection of plays and poetry by William Shakespeare, as well as America's  pre-eminent collection of English-language publications from the 15th through  18th centuries. Holdings include two-thirds of all known titles published in  England or in English before 1640.  </P> <P> In addition, the library houses a virtual history of Shakespeare productions  during the past four centuries, thanks to its vast collection of playbills,  promptbooks, paintings, costumes, correspondence, critical reviews,  manuscripts, books and films.  </P> <P> Scholars throughout the world come here to do serious research on Shakespeare,  his poetry, his plays, his times, the origins and influence of the Elizabethan  Age, the Renaissance in general, and the literature, economics and politics of  15th-through-18th-Century Europe.  </P> <P> Researchers pore over rare books and manuscripts dating from the 15th Century  in the stunning Elizabethan Reading Room. Visitors with no connection to  academia come to see the treasures on exhibit in the 130-foot-long Great Hall,  with its oak-paneled walls and hand-carved Elizabethan doorways, a re-creation  of a Tudor gallery.  </P> <P> There are midday poetry readings. The Folger Consort, an Elizabethan music  ensemble, performs frequently. There are seminars, symposiums and lectures  year-round.  </P> <P> Here, too, is a reproduction of a theater typical of Shakespeare's day, modeled  after an inn with balconies. Artistic director Michael Kahn's 1990-91 season  opens Sept. 11 in the Folger Shakespeare Theatre with "Richard III," starring  Stacy Keach in the title role of the "murderous charmer who schemes and seduces  his way to the English throne."  </P> <P> The best flavor of the Elizabethan Age to be found anywhere in America is at  the Folger Shakespeare Library.  </P> <P> It was a lecture on Shakespeare by Ralph Waldo Emerson at Amherst College in  1879 that triggered Henry Clay Folger's interest in the playwright.  </P> <P> Folger was a descendant of Peter Folger, a Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,  schoolmaster who emigrated from England in 1635. Peter Folger's daughter,  Abiah, was Benjamin Franklin's mother.  </P> <P> After he graduated from Amherst (the same year he heard Emerson's lecture),  Folger was hired as a clerk by Standard Oil Company of New York, where he rose  through the ranks to become president. His wife, Emily Jordan, wrote a master's  thesis at Vassar based on her study of various editions of Shakespeare's plays  published from the 16th to 19th centuries.  </P> <P> Both were hooked on the Bard for 60 years and devoted all of their spare time  to collecting related material. That devotion culminated in their decision to  build the library.  </P> <P> Folger died two weeks after the cornerstone was laid. President Herbert Hoover  dedicated the library on Shakespeare's birthday, April 23, in 1932. Folger's  wife was involved in its financial support and operation until her death in  1936.  </P> <P> The Folgers had no children. Their fortune was spent on the Shakespeare  collection, the library and the endowment to operate it. The Folgers left the  library in care of the trustees of Amherst College. Their ashes are in the  Elizabethan Reading Room.  </P> <P> "There are things here that scholars come from England to see because they  cannot be found in Shakespeare's homeland," said Ann Greer, library public  affairs coordinator, as she opened the 1568 personal Bible of Queen Elizabeth  I, a volume bound in its original red velvet.  </P> <P> She turned the pages of a 1502 Latin book that belonged to Henry VIII. As a  student, he scrawled in large, bold hand: "Thys boke is myne. Prince Henry."  Greer also showed a letter written by Queen Elizabeth to Henry IV of France in  1595.  </P> <P> Among the library's remarkable treasures are 79 copies of the First Folio  edition of Shakespeare's plays, published in London in 1623 by two of his  fellow actors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, seven years after the  playwright's death. The British Library has the next largest collection of the  First Folio -- five copies. There were 1,000 printed; 240 are known to exist.  </P> <P> The title page of the First Folio reads: "Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies,  Histories &amp; Tragedies" and contains the best-known portrait of the author,  one of only two authentic likenesses known to exist.  </P> <P> "What a privilege to be allowed in these hallowed rooms, to be able to have  access to the rare books and manuscripts and to use them for research," said  Bernice Kliman, 56, who teaches Shakespeare at Nassau Community College on Long  Island. She has spent a month every summer since 1976 in the library working on  her own books.  </P> <P> Her book "Hamlet -- Film, TV and Audio Performances" was researched here. She  is now doing a history of 18th-Century Shakespearean actors. "I thumb through  pages of books written in the 1700s full of descriptions of actors, their  acting traits, face, eyes, voice, expressions, detailed accounts of their  performances," she explained.  </P> <P> At another table sat Peter Blayney, 46, of London, a scholar-in-residence who  has been working for six years on a book about the book trade in London from  1590 to 1610. "I'm here every day. My work is supported by a grant from the  National Endowment for the Humanities. This project is likely to take me 20  years," Blayney said.  </P> <P> "No one has ever covered this before. I'm reviewing 8,500 books published in  London during those two decades. Yes, I'm obsessed with the subject. You have  to be slightly unhinged to get involved in something of this magnitude," he  said.  </P> <P> Two other scholars met here seven years ago while doing research and decided to  collaborate on a book about Shakespeare's Caliban, a character in his plays who  is the symbol of the exploited native. They have since married -- Alden Vaughn,  a professor of history at Columbia, and his wife, Virginia, a professor of  English at Clark University. The book is to be published next year.  </P> <P> This summer -- from July 23 through Aug. 20 -- for the first time, 25 American  and 15 British secondary-school Shakespeare teachers will spend two weeks at  Stratford-on-Avon and two weeks at the Folger to study with some of the  best-known Shakespeare scholars, actors and directors in an program put on by  the Folger and the Royal Shakespeare Company.  </P> <P> "This is the first collaboration between the two, considered the two most  significant Shakespeare repositories in the world," said Peggy O'Brien, 42,  education coordinator for the Folger. The American teachers are being funded by  a $200,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  </P> <P> She explained that each summer the Folger sponsors an institute for  secondary-school teachers of Shakespeare who come to the library. "We generally  have 30 to 40 teachers selected from 700 who apply. It is one of many  educational programs sponsored by the Folger. There is also an annual  Shakespeare Festival for Washington-area fourth- to 12th-graders.  </P> <P> "We send 14 trainees to 187 schools in 12 states to teach more than 19,000  students each year all about Shakespeare. We're doing more with Shakespeare  than anybody. We turn the lights on with kids. The best way to teach them  Shakespeare is to have them get up on their feet and enact the roles in his  plays."  </P> <P> O'Brien said, "There is something about this guy that captures them, no matter  who or where they are -- in rural schools, inner-city or affluent schools.  Shakespeare can really make a difference to many young students."  </P> <P> Werner Gundersheimer, 53, an Italian Renaissance scholar and author of six  books, has been director of the Folger since 1984. He did his undergraduate  work at Amherst and his graduate work at Harvard. He previously taught at the  universities of Wisconsin, Johns Hopkins, Pennsylvania and Tel Aviv, and at  Swarthmore College.  </P> <P> The library has a staff of 75 and operates on an annual budget of $4.4 million,  with $250,000 spent each year on acquisitions.  </P> <P> "When the library opened 58 years ago, it was universally recognized as the  world's pre-eminent repository of materials concerning Shakespeare. Today, it  is also one of the world's leading centers for research in the continental  Renaissance and early modern European literature and history," said  Gundersheimer, who added:  </P> <P> "I'm sure William Shakespeare and Emily and Henry Clay Folger would be pleased  and proud of this national treasure that carries their names, the Folger  Shakespeare Library."  </P></p>

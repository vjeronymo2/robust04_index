			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAND-SWAP BILL FOR DUMP DEAD FOR NOW  </P> <P> A complex land-swap bill that could meet Los Angeles' need for a new garbage  dump will not be passed by Congress this year because city, county and federal  officials have failed to reach agreement, the measure's sponsor said.  </P> <P> "We are essentially past the time when we can move something through Congress,"  said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). "If we can work something out, we  can get it through early next year."  </P> <P> The sweeping bill could open the way for a new landfill in Elsmere Canyon. It  could also provide the city with a third of its future electric power, improve  the run-down Hansen Dam recreation area in the northeast San Fernando Valley  and preserve scenic canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Despite their disappointment in the delay, city and county officials expressed  optimism that they have made enough behind-the-scenes progress in recent weeks.  Berman will revise the land-exchange bill, a preliminary version of which he  first introduced last February, when Congress reconvenes in early 1990.  </P></p>

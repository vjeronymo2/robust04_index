			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> * The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or  (714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;  Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays till 10 p.m., Saturdays  till 10:30 p.m., and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Cafe El Cholo, 840 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-4600 or (714)  525-1320. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays  from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> The Cat and Custard Cup and Cafe El Cholo are located across a La Habra parking  lot from one another and their themes couldn't be more divergent. One is a  lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy Continental menu and dark,  medieval trappings. The other is bright, festive and Mexican, with fajitas,  guacamole and frosty margaritas. Both are charming, cheerful, and worth a wide  detour.  </P> <P> * 3-6-9 Shanghai, 613 N. Euclid St., Anaheim. (714) 635-8319. Open daily except  Sundays from 11:30 a.m., Mondays through Thursdays till 9:30 p.m., Fridays and  Saturdays till 10.  </P> <P> One of the best small Chinese restaurants in the heavily ethnic San Gabriel  Valley, 3-6-9 Shanghai has opened this storefront sister in an Anaheim shopping  mall, bringing nearly all of its popular dishes. Handmade breads and savory  dumpling preparations excel here along with such exotic cold appetizers as tea  smoked chicken and braised baby bamboo. The restaurant is cheap and basic; tell  them to tread lightly on the MSG. The steamed pork with rice powder is a  revelation.  </P> <P> * The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point.  (714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience,  but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amidst the  beautiful surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice  Canelle has introduced a creative, eccentric but imperfect cuisine, a blend of  French, Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes  have a tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and  outstanding desserts are the hallmarks.  </P> <P> * Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166.  Open Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through  Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a  combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson  turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck  and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied  menu, and given proper notice the chef will even make a cheese souffle. Salads,  pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely.  </P> <P> * Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714)  240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight, Fridays  and Saturdays till 2 a.m.  </P> <P> Heritage Brewing Company has the somewhat dubious distinction of being Orange  County's only brewpub, a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young,  party crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all one could even call the  place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and  Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the  best of which is beef on wick, wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The  burgers aren't bad.  </P> <P> * Kotobuki, 24356 Avenida de la Carlota, Laguna Hills. (714) 587-0290. Open  Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays  from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Totally awesome. That's how Hiro Watanabe, sushi-maker extraordinaire,  describes most of his creations at Kotobuki, his pint-size, big-hearted new  Japanese restaurant. Hiro-san's food has a quirky appeal -- from Philadelphia  roll (crab, avocado and cream cheese) to the more authentic preparations such  as uni (sea urchin) and hamachi (yellowtail). Put yourself in the chef's hands  and let him do his thing. He probably will anyway.  </P> <P> * Panda Inn, 2 Center Point Drive, La Palma. (714) 522-6082. Open daily from 11  a.m. to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Panda Inn, an upscale Chinese restaurant chain, recently arrived in La Palma.  It can credit its success to its attractive, mildly Americanized  interpretations of traditional Mandarin cuisine. Purists beware. Shy away from  the complicated fare (lemon this, orange that) and stick to basics: the  well-crafted soups, the excellent lamb and pork dishes, and the first-rate  sauteed vegetables. Don't go home without a serving of mango pudding for  dessert. It is a real palate cleanser, with a refreshing taste.  </P> <P> * Ciao, 1730 E. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 972-3101. Open Mondays through  Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturdays from 4:30 to 9:30.  </P> <P> Ciao is one of those indistinct little neighborhood restaurants you can drive  by 100 times without noticing, but it happens to be an exceptional one. Bina  Crivello, a Sicilian mater familias who runs the restaurant with the help of  her five sons, makes most of the food herself: crusty pizzas, earthy pastas,  and a good rich tomato sauce to go with them. Bring a hefty appetite, and leave  room for the excellent tiramisu -- intense, mocha rich, and drooling mascarpone  cheese.  </P> <P> * Morell's, in the Irvine Hilton, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 863-3111.  Open daily except except Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., 6 to 10.  </P> <P> Morell's is one hotel restaurant making an obvious effort to keep up with the  times, but one still comes away with the impression that instituitional  practices die hard. It's a quietly elegant room done up in various shades of  pink, and there is a formal quality to the service. Appetizers such as  sweetbreads and smoked salmon are among the strong suits. Desserts are visual  stunners. The basically sound main dishes suffer occasionally from a desire to  impress.  </P> <P> * Singapore Corner, 1401 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-0787. Open  Tuesdays through Sundays from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Albert Tan and Ruby Barkineyn, Singaporean and Indonesian respectively, serve  up credible versions of their native dishes at this hole-in-the-wall breakfast  joint. Satay, the region's most famous dish, is grilled skewers of various  meats eaten with spicy peanut sauce. Nasi rames is a quintet of pleasantly  unfamiliar dishes surrounding a mound of white rice. Ask Tan about specials,  which range from yellow rice noodles to various things eaten from banana  leaves. Laughably inexpensive.  </P> <P> * Emperor's Fortune, 3820 Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 850-9008. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturdays till 11.  </P> <P>  Emperor's Fortune is the latest incarnation in haute Chinese, a Hong  Kong-elegant dining room designed with obvious expense. Everything is  well-crafted, even if the taste spectrum tends to be on the bland side, and  there is considerable imagination in the presentations. Peking duck, with an  amazingly crispy skin, is the big hitter, and you will want to try such dishes  as Shrimp Go Nuts, mussels in garlic sauce, and any of the wonderful desserts  (from Grand Finale). Expect to have your wallet lightened considerably.  </P> <P> * Showley-Wrightson, 2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 760-9700. Open  Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays from  6 to 9:30.  </P> <P>  Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely little gem of a restaurant, hidden away in a  tony Newport Beach shopping center (the owners have tried to infuse the place  with atmosphere, but it still looks like an upscale grocery store with tables).  Wonderful breads like fougasse and a dense walnut loaf begin the proceedings,  and there is a wide array of entrees and desserts to choose from, all made on  the premises. Don't miss risottos, grilled smoked beef, or the flourless  chocolate cake. They pack picnic baskets, too.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] This is a report on the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and the people routing the second  military operation launched by troops of the Vietnamese  communist puppets and two-headed government at Anlung Veng.    1. At the end of January, the Vietnamese communist puppets  and two-headed government which oppose national reconciliation  and the five-point advice of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  mobilized a large number of troops, tanks, armored personnel  carriers, and war materiel to launch an offensive in the  direction of Anlung Veng. But the NADK and Cambodian people  routed this large-scale military operation on 31 January.    As a result, the NADK and people killed or wounded over 100  troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed  government, captured seven tanks, and destroyed 36 military  trucks and armored personnel carriers.    2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as well as the  Cambodian nation and people have drawn many experiences in  dealing with enemies, old or new. That is, whether they are  old or new enemies, they will always make another attempt after  suffering a defeat.    As a matter of fact, on 3 and 4 February, the Vietnamese  communist puppets and two-headed government mobilized another  batch of 3,000 troops consisting mostly of routed troops from  the 286th Division, 4th Military Zone, Kompong Thom Provincial  unit; 5th Division; 41st and 43d Independent Regiments of the  Vietnamese communist puppets; and Para forces, including those  from ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] and other Para  groups from the 11th, 9th, and 3d Divisions and from the new 7th  and 8th Divisions. All these infantrymen were escorted by many  military trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery,  and multiple rocket launchers.    This second large-scale military operation launched under  the  direct command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum  Samen, and Keo Pisit, who are star-spangled Army chiefs, and a  number of other generals with second-hand stars was aimed at  pushing into Anlung Veng once again. These high-ranking  officers directly commanded the offensive because the two-headed  government's troops from both the Vietnamese communist puppets'  group and American-supported forces were ordered by the  Vietnamese communists and their allies and the two-headed  government that they must overtake Anlung Veng.    Their slogan is to mobilize tanks, artillery, and troops to  launch a blitz and then take pictures of Anlung Veng for use in  their propaganda in the international arena. They told their  troops to attack and withdraw at once and open the way (?to move  backward).    3. On 3 and 4 February, the attacking forces of the  Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government began  their second offensive on Anlung Veng.    The NADK and Cambodian people prepared to welcome the  criminal aggressors in advance. As soon as they arrived, the  NADK and people immediately attacked and smashed them for the  second time.    As a result of the attack and routing of this second  military  offensive, the NADK and Cambodian people destroyed four tanks  and a multiple rocket launcher, killing or wounding over 300  troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed  government, and totally smashing the command headquarters of  Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, and Keo Pisit. Moreover, the hundreds  of Vietnamese communist puppet, ANKI, and other Para soldiers  who have continued deserting the battlefield in groups for fear  of the combat, malaria, and especially being unable to endure  the shortage of food, water, and medicine and their daily  exposure to the sun and the dew have fled in the direction of  Route 68 and Siem Reap Province. Most of those deserters were  very weary and could hardly walk. Some others dropped dead as  soon as they reached Route 68 and Siem Reap. [passage omitted]</p>

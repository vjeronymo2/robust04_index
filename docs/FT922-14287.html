			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Steep fall in new car sales UK NEW vehicle sales fell steeply in March as tax cuts introduced in last month's Budget failed to halt the industry's 2 1/2 -year recession. Car registrations fell by 15.2 per cent and commercial vehicle sales by 11.5 per cent from the same month a year ago. This was in spite of the chancellor's measures to help the industry, notably by halving the rate of special car tax from 10 to 5 per cent. The figures are not as bad as they seem, however, since sales for last March were distorted by advanced purchases ahead of the increase in VAT. Nevertheless, new car sales this March suffered the 29th consecutive monthly year-on-year fall, while new commercial vehicle sales were 44.4 per cent lower than three years ago. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, claimed the figures confirmed that 'Britain is still stuck in recession with the Conservatives unwilling to take the action necessary to ensure recovery.' Carmakers remain uncertain about the underlying sales trend, with demand distorted by important tax changes in the last two Budgets and consumer confidence at a low ebb in the run-up to Thursday's general election. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said first-quarter car sales were only slightly down on the depressed level of last year's final quarter. Sales in the first three months this year were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.46m, but Ford forecasts a recovery in demand, with new car sales for the full year of 1.65m-1.7m against 1.59m last year. 'This year sales were sluggish ahead of the Budget, and the welcome boost from the chancellor's reduction of car tax has now been counteracted by uncertainty over the general election,' said Mr Geoffrey Pelling, general manager of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said he was confident that car sales had 'now bottomed out'. Imported cars accounted for 57.3 per cent of the UK new car market in March against 54.7 per cent a year ago. Details, Page 11</p>

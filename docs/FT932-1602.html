			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Friends reach out to divided island  -The MPs with a special interest in northern Cyprus one Tory and two Labour - made a week-long visit to northern Cyprus at the invitation of the Turkish government. Since then the Friends of Northern Cyprus parliamentary group has grown into a sizeable and influential body with about 60 members from both houses of parliament. The group - registered with parliamentary authorities and structured like scores of similar all-party bodies focusing on particular countries or territories - campaigns for a settlement to the island's problems based on the equal treatment of Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Sir Keith Speed, the Conservative MP for Ashford who is the group's chairman, said: 'Our aim is to try to bring a fair and just settlement for all communities.' The group's position is broadly in sympathy with the Turkish Cypriot cause. The group has helped arrange visits by parliamentarians to northern Cyprus, with expenses paid by the northern Cyprus authorities. The most recent was during this year's Easter recess. Twelve MPs from four parties took part in the Easter trip, which was led by Mr Andrew Faulds, a vice chairman of the group. The visit - described as a 'perfectly standard trip' by Mr Faulds - combined meetings with senior politicians with visits to archaeological sites, a brewery and an orange juice factory. Mr Faulds hopes to arrange a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to report on the trip. He hopes there will be more trips. The most recent register of MPs' interests indicates that four Conservative MPs - Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mr Terry Dicks (Hayes &amp; Harlington), Mr Peter Fry (Wellingborough) and Mr Robert Jones (Hertfordshire West) - visited the island in September last year as guests of the northern Cyprus authorities. Sir Keith is one of at least three MPs with property in northern Cyprus  - a three-bedroomed bungalow he bought in 1987. 'I spent more money doing it up than on the property,' he said. It had been owned by the same Turkish Cypriot family since 1955. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, lists two cottages in northern Cyprus in the register of MPs' interests. He bought the property from an Austrian before the island was divided and has 'been there' for 22 years. Sir Dudley Smith, Tory MP for Warwick and Leamington, has leased a house in north-ern Cyprus for eight years. The group released a 220-word statement following Mr Asil Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus urging him to 'consider his position and voluntarily return to Britain where he can face the charges alleged against him'. The statement went on: 'We cannot condone the breaking of bail by anyone to flee from British justice.' But, alluding to Britain's refusal last year to extradite a Turkish Cypriot woman who fled to the UK to avoid drug charges, it argued that the government could not 'have it both ways'. It added: 'The reason why there is no extradition treaty is because the UK government will not recognise the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus.' MPs belonging to the group express concern that Mr Nadir's action has made the prospects of an acceptable settlement more remote. Sir Keith said he had never met or spoken to Mr Nadir but admitted to thinking on 'one or two occasions' it might have been 'a good idea' to try to do so. He said he once met Mr Nadir's sister at a reception attended by 300 people. He said his personal view as chairman of the group was that it would be best to 'let the dust settle' before further trips to northern Cyprus by parliamentarians were arranged. 'But it would not stop me from going on holiday there.' The chairman of the home affairs select committee last night hit back at the 101 Labour MPs who signed a 'silly' early day motion attacking him over an expenses-paid visit to northern Cyprus. Sir Ivan Lawrence said the MPs were 'shooting themselves in the foot' by putting down such a motion, since those who went on the visit included some 'very highly respected' Labour MPs.</p>

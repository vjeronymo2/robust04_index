			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTOR FINED FOR DRUNK DRIVING  </P> <P> Film star Gerard Depardieu was fined $1,800, and his license was suspended for  six months for driving while drunk. He was arrested after a car accident that  injured two people.  </P> <P> Depardieu, who won best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival this year for  his title role in "Cyrano de Bergerac," was also sentenced this week to a  two-month suspended prison sentence.  </P> <P> Depardieu, 41, did not attend the court proceeding in Riom. His lawyer, Serge  Teillot, said the actor "fully acknowledged his responsibility" but felt the  proceedings would be more calm if he did not attend.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Depardieu's blood contained twice the legal alcohol limit of  0.08% after the July 20 accident, which occurred as the actor drove to a hotel  after shooting scenes for a new movie.  </P> <P> His car collided with another on a country road near Puy-de-Dome, slightly  injuring the wife and daughter of the other driver.  </P> <P> Depardieu told police he was trying to answer a call on his car telephone and  was blinded by the setting sun when the crash occurred.  </P></p>

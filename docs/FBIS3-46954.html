"If our nation who has lived as a homogeneous one for more  than 5,000 years from the days of Tangun unites firmly as one  under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of  the whole nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea,  political view and religious belief, it can found the  pan-national unified state without difficulty while leaving the  two systems and two governments existing in the North and South  as they are," he said, and stressed:    "The present South Korean authorities, however, broke off  all  the dialogues of both governmental and nongovernmental level  between the North and South which had been held even in the days  of the preceding military fascist 'regimes', saying they 'cannot  shake hands with the partner possessed of nuclear weapons', and  did not hesitate to commit such a treacherous act as trampling  upon the historical North-South agreement and joint declaration  on denuclearization which had already been adopted and brought  into effect, like sheets of waste paper.    "What our nation wants is national reconciliation and unity,  not confrontation and war.    "All the Koreans in the North, in the South and abroad  should  turn out more vigorously in the struggle for national  reunification."</p>

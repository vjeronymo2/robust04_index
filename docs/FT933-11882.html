			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia is not giving up on natural gas 'pipe-dream' - Problems hindering development of a giant field in the South China Sea THE POTENTIAL Dollars 20bn development of the Natuna field has kept the gas industry enthralled since its discovery 20 years ago in the South China Sea, about 1,100km north of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. With 45 trillion (million, million) cubic feet of recoverable hydrocarbon reserves, the field could support long-term contracts for 14m tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas, equivalent to nearly 25 per cent of 1991 world LNG production. It would confirm Indonesia - which last year shipped 23m tonnes of LNG worth Dollars 3.7bn to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - as the industry's world leader. In early July, however, Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas company, pulled out of more than two years of negotiations with Exxon Corporation of the US for Natuna's development. Pertamina and Exxon both have a 50 per cent stake in the field. Exxon requested at the weekend that negotiations be reactivated. But there are many people within the gas industry who consider Natuna a pipe-dream project. Mixed with its recoverable gas, the field has 70 trillion cu ft of carbon dioxide, which would need to be separated and reinjected into the sea-bed. Offshore facilities - the field is in water 145 metres deep - would total 700,000 tonnes of steel, 910 km of pipeline and 2.6m horsepower of turbine machinery. Industry officials say, however, that the sticking point of negotiations has not been the project's technical feasibility but fiscal terms such as the production split after cost-recovery and the tax regime under which the field would operate. Exxon is also report to have requested a sovereign guarantee for its investment to cover force majeure risk, a first for an oil and gas project in Indonesia. As a Jakarta oil executive explains, 'If Natuna were to go sour, even for a company as big as Exxon it would have a dramatic effect'. With the project facing potentially insuperable problems, Indonesia must now assess the future of its gas sector without Natuna. Jakarta has been deft at marketing LNG in Japan, where its exports of over 18m tonnes last year accounted for 60 per cent of the market. Demand is expected to rise further as Japan replaces its nuclear power stations with gas-fired plants. South Korea is also a growing market with an increase in demand forecast from 4m tonnes this year to nearly 12m tonnes by the year 2000. As an industry executive in Jakarta notes, in Asia 'all the indicators point to pretty good growth potential'. Indonesia, however, may not be able to capitalise fully on the growing market. Last year, Pertamina's Arun plant in North Sumatra produced about 12m tonnes and a further 11m tonnes came from its Badak facilities in east Kalimantan. Oil companies say proven reserves in Kalimantan dedicated to Badak are about 30 trillion cu ft. Improvements to Badak, including completion of a Dollars 750m sixth unit or 'train', will boost its capacity to 14m tonnes next year. A seventh train, with a capacity of 2.4m tonnes, is under consideration. Reserves at Arun, however, are running down. Industry officials forecast a gradual decline in production from a peak of 1.8bn cu ft a day in 1989 to 1.5bn cu ft by 1998 and then a sharp fall to less than 900m cu ft daily in 2000. Arun supplies on long-term contracts that begin to expire in 1999 and will be concluded by 2008. After that date, industry officials expect only minimal production from Arun. The failure of Pertamina and Exxon to reach agreement does not signal an immediate crisis for Indonesia's LNG industry, for, as one Jakarta oil executive notes, even 'without Natuna, Indonesia does have some reserves which do buy them time'. Unless significant new reserves can be brought on stream, however, the forecast rise in LNG production to 28.5m tonnes a year by 1997 would be followed by a decline toward 20m tonnes by 2010. Some oil companies are bullish about the prospects of finding new gas reserves but say, despite incentives being improved three times in the last five years, that the fiscal regime covering Indonesia's oil and gas sector stifles exploration. The government may improve incentives again, however, to prevent a long-term decline in LNG exports and to guarantee supplies for the fast-growing domestic market. By 1997 at least eight gas-fired power plants with a capacity exceeding 6,000MW are planned on Java and a gas network in the industrial city of Surubaya in East Java is being constructed. A recent government study proposed exploiting 79 small and medium scale fields with reserves totalling about 8.4 trillion cu ft to feed the domestic market. But these are expected to be depleted by 2004 and, should new reserves not be discovered, the government might have to redirect gas from the export- to the domestic-market. This further underlines the importance of the Natuna field which, in addition to servicing exports contracts, could provide a fall-back position for the domestic gas sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent Ian Graham] </F>   [Excerpt] The Belfast headquarters of the IRA's political  wing Sinn Fein was damaged in a rocket attack today. Local  people said a rocket was fired from a car parked across the  street from Connelly House in the Andersonstown Road.    Sinn Fein said the missile went through an upstairs window  and exploded in an office, parts of the warhead imbedding  themselves in a wall. No one was in the building at the time,  but a Sinn Fein spokesman said a meeting of party members had  been due to start there soon afterwards.    Last Monday, a booby-trapped grenade, planted by the  loyalist  Ulster Freedom Fighters, was defused at the security gate  outside the building. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams visited  the scene soon after the attack and accused the security forces  of collusion in today's attack and others on Sinn Fein members  in recent years.    "Loyalist death squads are operating with a high degree of  intelligence information on individuals, offices and the  movement of Crown forces patrols," he said. He insisted Sinn  Fein would not be intimidated or deterred by the attacks from  its search for peace. He claimed recent attacks were carried out  with weapons provided to loyalists by British intelligence.  [passage omitted]</p>

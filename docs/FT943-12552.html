			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Railtrack confident of imminent end to RMT strike action Railtrack remains optimistic that a deal with the RMT transport union can be agreed in the next fortnight in spite of the start tomorrow of the first 48-hour strike in the dispute over signal workers' pay, David Goodhart writes. A senior Railtrack representative said at the weekend that it was 'unthinkable' that the weekly strikes would still be occurring on August 12, the earliest date by which the 500 RMT signal supervisors could join the strike. The supervisors are being balloted on joining the strike and the result is expected by August 4. If they do so it will become much more difficult for Railtrack to maintain the 25 per cent to 30 per cent service it hopes to run over the next two days. Railtrack said: 'We believe that a combination of parliament being on holiday and the greater pain felt by RMT signal staff at losing two days' pay will make it easier to get a deal.' Railtrack's optimism was not shared last night by the RMT, however. The union accused Railtrack of preparing to call in supervisors with no experience in signal boxes. Railtrack denies that unsuitable staff are being used.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO CREATE ORANGE COUNTY'S BIGGEST BANKING FIRM DROPPED  </P> <P> Officials for Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills and Landmark Bancorp in La Habra  said Wednesday that they have canceled their merger plans, scuttling what  bankers had thought would be an ideal marriage.  </P> <P> Both banking companies said basic operational differences proved too difficult  to reconcile, and directors and officers at both institutions agreed to drop  the deal.  </P> <P> "When you sign a letter of intent, you think you know everything you need to  know. But you don't," said J.B. Crowell, president and chief executive of  Eldorado. "We didn't know each other as well as we thought we did, and we both  concluded that maybe this wasn't going to work."  </P> <P> Under the tentative agreement reached in mid-November, Landmark would have  merged its company into Eldorado, with Landmark shareholders getting one share  of newly issued Eldorado stock for every share of their own company's stock --  an aggregate 36.6% stake in the surviving entity.  </P> <P> A merger would have created Orange County's largest banking firm with $400  million in assets, 310 employees and 12 branches in four counties.  </P> <P> Like any company, Eldorado, which operates eight branches of Tustin-based  Eldorado Bank, has tried to maximize profits in the last few years. But that  emphasis led to one of the areas of disagreements with Landmark.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get in the top 10% of banks statewide in terms of return on  equity and return on assets," Crowell said. Reaching high returns on both of  those standard measures of bank profitability means "you have to watch your  expenses," he said.  </P> <P> With about $248 million in assets, Eldorado expects to announce in the next few  weeks that it posted record profits for 1988, Crowell said. Based on the firm's  9-month results, it could top $3 million in earnings. Citing the expected good  results, directors Wednesday declared a 10% stock dividend, payable Feb. 24 to  shareholders of record as of Feb. 10.  </P> <P> Landmark, which operates Landmark Bank and has about $148 million in assets,  also expects to post record profits -- more than $1 million -- for last year  when it releases its results next week, said Craig D. Collette, the company's  president and chief executive. But Landmark reached its peak performance  differently.  </P> <P> Although Eldorado Bank, for instance, is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday  through Friday, Landmark is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and a half-day  on Saturdays, Collette said.  </P> <P> The dilemma, he said, was that cutting back hours would have meant losing  customers at Landmark. Yet increasing Eldorado's hours would have meant more  expenses and would have cut into that bank's profits.  </P> <P> A host of similar differences in such areas as prices for services, customer  relations and marketing showed that the two banking companies had "very  divergent philosophies" of operating banks and that the differences were "deal  killers," Collette said.  </P> <P> In addition, Crowell said, each bank had misperceptions going into the deal.  Eldorado, for instance, figured Landmark was heavily involved in commercial  loan activity, but it learned that Landmark's commercial loan portfolio was no  bigger than its own.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how different each of us are," Collette said. "We suspected it,  but we thought we could work something out. It wasn't a question of one side  backing down. Neither of us wanted to lose customers or profits."  </P></p>

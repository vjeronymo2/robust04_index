			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EXPERIMENT IN SMOG TANK IS LIKE A BREATH OF FOUL AIR  </P> <P> Even on those rare days when the air in the Los Angeles Basin is pristine, some  people may still be suffering from a second-stage smog alert -- in an  8-foot-by-8-foot room in Westwood.  </P> <P> In an unassuming office on the periphery of the UCLA campus and across from the  sprawling National Cemetery, people are hermetically sealed inside a chamber  pumped full of enough ozone, sulfur dioxide and other crud to make the lungs  scream for mercy.  </P> <P> Dr. Henry Gong Jr., a UCLA professor and respiratory researcher, envisioned and  built his "smog chamber" earlier this year to "try to simulate what happens on  a typically smoggy day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Filtered Air  </P> <P> The chamber, formally called an Environmental Exposure Laboratory, is an  airtight cube of Plexiglas and plastic foam insulation fed by a $40,000  air-conditioning system that allows Gong and his two assistants to "dial in"  the temperature and humidity. The incoming air is first filtered to a pure  state, then mixed with such smog ingredients as ozone, sulfur dioxide or  "whatever you like," Gong said.  </P> <P> He can mix up a stew of pollutants that corresponds with the air during a  first-stage or second-stage smog alert. He keeps the artificial smog to a  "real-world range," however, because "we don't want to overdose anybody."  </P> <P> Volunteers spend one or two hours in the chamber, alternately resting and  exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill.  </P> <P> Other studies have measured and drawn conclusions about the long-term health  detriments of smog, but Gong wanted to see what happens to people as soon as  they get a hefty dose of pollution, particularly during exertion on a warm day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Common Experience  </P> <P> The results should sound familiar to anyone who has worked out, or even taken a  brisk walk, during a brown-air day.  </P> <P> Most test subjects experience "chest tightness, a little pain on inhalation.  (Some get) a dry cough, because ozone is a very strong irritant of the airways.  Some people may develop wheezing," Gong said.  </P> <P> Test subjects have their breathing measured when they emerge from the smog  chamber. Gong said most bounce back to normal range within an hour.  </P> <P> Data is still being analyzed from a series of tests on people who also were  part of a 10-year study on the long-term effects of smog. The subjects were  among 345 adults from the smog-afflicted San Gabriel Valley community of  Glendora.  </P> <P> The long-term study found the Glendora group had a faster decline in lung  function than a matching group of residents in relatively smog-free Lancaster  in the high desert.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Testing Predictions  </P> <P> The whole point of subjecting the same people to the acute effects of smog in  the chamber "was to see if we could predict who would have a rapid decline in  lung function," Gong said.  </P> <P> State and federal pollution regulators are funding Gong's smog chamber studies  and he said the results will have far more than academic interest.  </P> <P> By precisely measuring how much smog does how much damage to people's lungs,  Gong provides regulators with the data they need to evaluate the accuracy of  current smog-level criteria and whether the threshold for smog alerts should be  raised or lowered.  </P> <P> And, he points out, any tinkering with the notion of how much smog is bad smog  could have massive implications for industry, transportation and life styles as  regulators begin imposing their 20-year Air Quality Management Plan to clean up  the air in Southern California, typically the foulest in the nation.  </P></p>

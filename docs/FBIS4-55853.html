			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Text] Intense diplomatic activity in international  metropolises, prompted by the crisis in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, do not for the time being offer any [word  indistinct] solutions, although -- so to speak -- diverse  activities are being undertaken. In addition to the activity of  the recently established contact group for Bosnia, comprised of  high-ranking representatives from the United States, Russia,  United Nations, and the European Union, attention should be  given to last week's meeting of diplomatic heads from the United  States, Russia, Great Britain, and France in Geneva, including a  three-member delegation of the European Union which included the  former, current, and future presiding members of this  association from Belgium, Greece, and Germany.    Judging by everything, at this meeting, the Bosnian hot  potato was again passed into the hands of the Europeans, who,  after all, lit the fire underneath it, but the Unites States has  retained the cooking utensils and the spices. Representatives  of the European Union did not hide their satisfaction with the  fact that a consensus was reached on the territorial division of  the former Bosnia- Herzegovina -- 51 percent for the  Croat-Muslim federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs --  with the mighty ally across the ocean. Actually, this  constitutes a return to its earlier plan. At the meeting of the  seven ministers in Geneva, the warring sides were called upon to  begin negotiations on a four month cease-fire within the next  two weeks. On this occasion, it was established that the  Bosnian conflict could not be solved militarily, but rather  through negotiations. The agreement also envisaged the  maintenance of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union within the  internationally recognized borders.    All of these positions have their flaws, regardless of the  concepts behind them; they were called into question precisely  by those who proposed them. Namely, it is known that official  Washington quickly rushed to placate the powerful Islamic lobby  by saying that it would not pressure the Muslims, but that it  would rather attempt to compel them to be more realistic in  their demands. The Russians, however, were given the far more  thankless role of convincing the Serbs to accept the plan as a  whole and all the details. Strange criteria for justice and  chivalry. In the history of warfare so far, there is no record  of the defeated side dictating terms to the victor, even going  so far as to expand territories, which is what is being  authorized for the Bosnian Muslims who started the brawl in the  smoke-filled, Balkan tavern.    It is certain that the diplomacy of unequal treatment of the  warring sides is incapable of changing the situation on the  ground in the direction of peace. It can only worsen it. There  can be no doubt that such treatment has encouraged the Muslim  leadership to insist on the war option, because it has perceived  this as a green light for a new offensive against Serbian  positions in central Bosnia, Posavina, and Podrinja, which is  gaining momentum in full view of the UN forces and numerous  observers. The latest Muslim offensive has made ridiculous the  international media's lamentations of the allegedly dreadful  fate of the poorly armed Bosnians which is what Alija's  mojahedin are also called. The foreign press is proof that the  arms embargo imposed on all the states in the region of the  former Yugoslavia by the United Nations back in September of  1991 does not concern them. [Words indistinct] has recently  informed its readership about a large shipment of arms for the  Muslims in Bosnia that was flown into Zagreb Airport by an  Iranian Jumbo Jet.    Aware of the danger of armed conflicts flaring up if the  Serbian Republic Army is forced to launch a counteroffensive,  even the most loyal of U.S. allies in Europe are threatening to  withdraw their blue helmets from the Bosnian vortex, and are  sincerely -- or so we believe -- striving for a definite,  peaceful end to the conflicts. [Word indistinct] also suits  Russia, so that it can devote more attention to potential crisis  flashpoints in its own country and in the immediate  neighborhood, in the area of the former Soviet Union. Therefore,  it is up to the United States to make the next move. Washington  is expected to finally clearly warn its proteges in Bascarsija  [part of Sarajevo] that by continuing the war, they cannot get  more than they have been offered at the negotiating table.</p>

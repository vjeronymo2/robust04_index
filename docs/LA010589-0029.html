			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRANE KNOCKS OUT POWER TO 800 IN UNIVERSAL CITY  </P> <P> A construction crane accidentally knocked down several power lines that  narrowly missed an RTD bus Wednesday, interrupting power to 800 customers in  the Universal City area, authorities said.  </P> <P> There were no injuries in the 4:30 p.m. accident in the 4100 block of Cahuenga  Boulevard, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells.  </P> <P> The passengers and driver of the bus got off the vehicle without incident,  Wells said.  </P> <P> Ed Freudenberg, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Deparment of Water and Power,  said service to the 800 residential and commercial customers was restored an  hour after the accident. Utilities workers were trying late Wednesday to  restore power to a sewage pumping plant nearby, Freudenberg said. He was not  certain when that would be done.  </P> <P> Details of the accident were sketchy, but Freudenberg said that the crane  belonged to a movie crew that had been filming in the area at the time of the  accident.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F> the Hungarian Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent on  29 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Our subject for discussion now is  foreign policy. If a country is small and, what is more,  one-third of its nation [allamalkoto nemzetisegenek] lives  beyond its borders, it must conduct a particularly active and  sensitive foreign policy. Let us now see what the  representatives of the parliamentary parties expect from the new  government. Here are some recordings:    [Szekeres] I think the new government--provided that it is  formed by the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]--will have three  simultaneous foreign policy tasks. First, to speed up Hungary's  participation in European integration. Second, to settle our  relations with neighboring countries. Third, and this is an  issue that ranks equal to the first two, to represent the  interests of the Hungarian minority living beyond the country's  borders, including support for their efforts to achieve various  types of autonomy.    I think that these three foreign policy goals are  interdependent. In other words, neither can succeed without the  other. I think this presupposes on the part of the new  government a very serious and very firm and proactive foreign  policy.    [Correspondent] What does the Balladur conference that took  place earlier this week indicate?    [Szekeres] [passage omitted] It has become clear that in  East  Central Europe and in the Baltics, where such problems create  serious tensions between countries and within countries, and  unsolved situations, some kind of coordination process has  started now.    We have no illusions. Such a process will be very long and  will mean very complicated negotiations, but all opportunities  must be exploited to permit Hungary and the Hungarian nation  that lives inside and outside the borders to be able to digest  at last the trauma of the Trianon Treaty, to find at last the  modus vivendi in which the Hungarian nation, inside and outside  the Hungarian border, can live its Hungarianness to the full and  be able to find the balance that must necessarily come about  between the majority nations and the Hungarian minority of the  other countries.    [Correspondent] How will the MSZP address the Hungarian  community [magyarsag]?    [Szekeres] In accordance with European norms, the new prime  minister of the Hungarian Government will be the prime minister  of 10.5 million Hungarians. However, at the same time, he will  be a representative, in some form, of the other 3.5 million  Hungarians living outside the borders. I would very much  dislike it if the past four years repeated themselves and the  Hungarian organizations beyond the borders were used as a  backdrop. I would very much dislike it if the interests of  Hungarians became a party political question, for this affects  the whole of the nation. Therefore, every element of the issue,  that is people acting in cultural life, in government or in the  economy, have a role in this. We would like to coordinate and  integrate this work.    [Correspondent] Will there be a need in the future for the  office dealing with the matters of the Hungarians beyond the  borders?    [Szekeres] We have not been working on concrete government  drafts like this yet. However, I think that the cultivation of  links -- cultural cooperation and economic links between the  mother country and the minority Hungarians -- have to be  integrated by all means. An agreement has to be reached about  the structural forms of this. In my view, it is not the  priority but rather the quality of this task that is important.    [Correspondent] Our viewers worry about the future of Duna  Television.    [Szekeres] No decision has been made yet about television  issues, naturally, but I think there is a need for a broadcast  that can reach the Hungarians beyond the borders and if  possible, the Hungarians spread across Europe. As to the form  of editing and method of operation involved, this has to be  settled with the profession.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The President of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov yesterday received  the leadership of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity];  the President Ljupco Georgievski, the Secretary General Boris  Zmejkovski, and the Vice-President Dosta Dimovska, at their own  request. They explained that they wanted to inform him about  the attitude of the State Security Service toward the  opposition, and to hand him document proof of that. Namely,  according to their assertions, they have evidence of wiretapping  and an operative action of the Service for State Security  involving several VMRO-DPMNE deputies.    According to the announcement from President Gligorov's  cabinet, at the beginning he emphasized that in accordance with  his constitutional and legal competence and authorization, he  had no jurisdiction to directly investigate the accusations of  involvement of the State Security in the internal-party  relations. In compliance with the clear constitutional and  legal authorizations, Gligorov expressed full conviction that  questions of this type should be raised and settled within the  framework of the determined legal procedure.    In that sense, President Gligorov underlined that the only  competent place, according to the Constitution, which should  deal with any kind of realizations or suspicion regarding the  attitude of the State Security Service toward VMRO-DPMNE is the  Commissions of the Macedonian Parliament for control of the work  of the Security Service. Also, a procedure should be initiated  before the competent organs -- the public prosecutor sand the  appropriate Court, in relation to any kind of document  concerning that. That is the only way to avoid any kind of  speculations or mystifications regarding such serious  accusations. Also, that is the only way to maintain the  principles of democracy, the respect of the laws and the  functioning of the government authority in the Republic.    President Gligorov added that the building of a democratic  atmosphere and the respect of the laws, as a lasting political  orientation, had a special important in the present pre-election  period in the Republic. That will contribute to the  strengthening of the feeling that the basic national interest  are respected, both in the country and abroad, and that the  integrity of our country will be protected, both from internal  conflicts and outside aspirations. The VMRO-DPMNE leadership  agreed with the President on these points.</p>

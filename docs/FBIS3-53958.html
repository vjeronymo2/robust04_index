			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has reiterated his  disappointment with Syria's position and with remarks made by  President al-Asad in Geneva.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January,  adds: "Rabin expected al-Asad to give a warmer expression to his  desire for peace. The prime minister said he did not want  President Clinton to answer in al-Asad's place when asked this  question during the Geneva news conference."]    Mr. Rabin said that if we fail to reach an agreement with  Syria this year the alternative will be political stalemate.  Rabin made these remarks in a meeting of the Labor Party Bureau  in Tel Aviv this afternoon. Mr. Rabin noted that Israel may  agree to a Syrian demand to make progress with it conditional on  simultaneous progress with Lebanon, but Israel will under no  circumstances agree to any additional linkage.    Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that referring to the  issue of a referendum, Mr. Rabin said that Hafiz al-Asad must  convince the Israeli public--just as Egypt's al-Sadat did when  he came to Jerusalem.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January  adds:  "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres this evening said he does not  take the reports concerning al-Asad's severe health problems  seriously. Mr. Peres said this is not the first time such  reports concerning al-Asad's medical state have been aired, only  to turn out to be baseless later. This was reported by our  correspondent Sefi Hendler."]</p>

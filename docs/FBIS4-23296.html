			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa's future role in the southern African  community is one of the major topics being discussed at meetings  of the Global Coalition for Africa and the Frontline states in  Harare today and tomorrow. President Mandela is representing  South Africa officially for the first time at both meetings.  Estelle Pienaar filed this report:    [Begin Pienaar recording] Key developmental issues for  Africa, and in particular southern Africa, tops the agenda in  Harare. The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting  of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the  venue for the meeting of the Frontline states. The body was  founded as a front of neighboring countries against South  Africa. Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden,  and is back with a vengeance in the international community and  the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost  the very reason for its existence.    However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the  establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline  states. But other parties feel that such a body would have  little value as most of the issues affecting southern African  countries could be dealt with by the Southern African  Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that  the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in  preference for something that sounds less confrontational.  Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of  southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past.    In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back  on  Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the  rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace,  stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to  prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper.

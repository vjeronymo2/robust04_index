			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ARAB POINT OF LIGHT THAT BUSH SHOULD NURTURE  </P> <P> I met President Saddam Hussein in late August, 1979, at the Ninth Non-Aligned  Heads of States conference in Havana. I was a political adviser to the Iranian  delegation. It was during that meeting that representatives of revolutionary  Iran first encountered the Iraqi leader.  </P> <P> Although the talks were largely useless, they provided some glimpses into the  nature of Hussein's personality and leadership. Twice in the course of the  two-hour discussion, he lifted a cigar from his breast pocket. Instantly, his  two interpreters, each flashing a fancy cigarette lighter, jumped to their feet  and vied to be the one who lit the president's cigar. At another time, I  noticed two Iraqis walking backward and sideways when they left and returned to  the room -- in an effort to avoid turning their backs to the exalted leader.  Throughout, Hussein appeared disdainful of the Iranian delegation's uninhibited  mode of expression.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein is a modern dictator, par excellence. The country he rules is  aptly described as the "Republic of Fear." The delusion of grandeur that sent  Iraqi soldiers into Kuwait again highlights the primary and lasting cause of  the state violence that plagues the Middle East and threatens world order:  dictatorship.  </P> <P> Since World War II, not a single Arab head of state in the Middle East has  retired or limited his tenure to a fixed term. They have either died in office,  been assassinated or deposed. The pro-Western dictators rationalized their  repressive rule by invoking the communist threat, and Washington was all-too  willing to assist them with training and equipment. Radical nationalist despots  justified their brutality in the name of fighting imperialism or Zionism.  </P> <P> Now that the Cold War is over, the United States cannot credibly continue its  support of Arab dictatorships under the guise of protecting them against Soviet  intrusion. Moscow's unambiguous condemnation of Hussein's aggression should  convince remaining skeptics that obstacles to peace and civility in the Middle  East lie not beyond the region's border but within its atavistic political  systems.  </P> <P> U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East has been devoid of any concern for the  general lack of democracy there. In the post-Cold War era, such concern need  not contradict legitimate U.S. interests in the region. In fact, it may well be  the least costly way of safeguarding those interests.  </P> <P> In Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, a preference for political  pluralism is, in various degrees, an element of U.S. diplomacy and trade  policy. With American lives on the line in the Arabian sand, U.S. policy-makers  must abandon their static view of the region's politics and political cultures.  The tribal roots of Arab dictatorship make the road to democracy more difficult  than some other parts of the Third World, but the region's natural resources  could enable its peoples to overcome the material impediments to democratic  behavior with more speed than many other societies.  </P> <P> Washington frequently makes observance of human rights a condition of doing  trade or aid business with it. It has never done so in the Middle East. But why  shouldn't the Saudi government permit its citizens to monitor its tolerance for  human rights in exchange for U.S. arms? Why shouldn't the sale of grain or  communication technologies to Iraq be tied to the regime's treatment of its  Kurdish minority? The grievances of secularists in Saudi Arabia, and of Kurds  in Iraq, are at least as serious and legitimate as those of the anti-communists  in China or Jews in pre-Gorbachev Russia.  </P> <P> Every year the State Department publishes the details of extreme and pervasive  human-rights violations in the states of the Middle East, and the White House  responds as if the information were from another planet. The pro-democracy  forces of many Third World dictatorships have their defenders in the U.S.  Congress -- but not a single Arab country is among them. If the United States  goes to war with Iraq, it would be the first time that American soldiers would  die on foreign soil without the honor of dying for democractic ideals.  </P> <P> The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait presents the United States with a historic  opportunity to include a pro-democracy objective in its Middle East policy.  Doing this would not require a sudden change of direction or abandonment of  allies. Forces for democracy, to be sure, have to emerge from within society.  But Washington can foster them by encouraging the growth of a political culture  that protects dissident voices.  </P> <P> This approach would help to blunt the appeal of Hussein's demogogic tactic of  emphasizing the double standards in U.S. foreign policy. It would also head off  his attempts to project a Robin Hood image of himself, which can resonate with  the Arab masses. Hussein is probably the most brutish of Arab leaders, but his  rule is no less legitimate for being so. His expansionist drive can be readily  comprehended if we remember that nothing produces more hubris in the mind of a  dictator than success.  </P> <P> Thus, while Iraq's aggression must be rolled back, restoring the Sabah dynasty  to power in Kuwait can hardly make the American people feel proud. Siding with  a tribal family who arrogated to itself an eternal right to rule and exploit a  country's oil reserves as its private property is not exactly an envious  position for a nation that takes pride in championing democracy throughout the  world. The U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf ought to have a more  worthy purpose than safeguarding a "lifestyle." A stated preference for  democracy can be this purpose.  </P> <P> Hussein's despotism should be countered by its antidote. Internationally  supervised elections have been held in Namibia, Nicaragua, Cambodia and  Afghanistan. Why not in Kuwait? It would be difficult to reach such an  agreement but not impossible.  </P> <P> His rhetoric aside, Hussein does not relentlessly adhere to any dogma. While at  war with Iran, he portrayed himself as the protector of the gulf sheikdoms'  sovereignty. Today, he wants to terminate their autonomy and special status.  For 10 years, he ridiculed Khomeini's preachings and claimed to be the defender  of secular politics against Islamic fundamentalism. Today, he calls for a holy  war.  </P> <P> He is not oblivious to means and ends. He is both high-risk gambler and  ruthless realist. He simply wants to expand his domain as the all-powerful  leader, but he is unscrupulously flexible in choosing his means of reversing  his course, particularly when the survival of his regime is at stake. In short,  Hussein can be forced to retreat sooner than it is generally believed.  </P> <P> War between the United States and Iraq will aggravate our Middle East problems  and intensify the fragmentation and repressiveness of Arab states. Only a  movement toward democratization can ease the dilemmas and frustrations that  underly the spread of violence and adventurism in the region.  </P></p>

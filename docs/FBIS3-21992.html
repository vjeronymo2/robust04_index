			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada </F> by Stella Ruffinelli; from the "Coordinates" program; place not  given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ruffinelli: You have  said that consensus represents a basic element for strengthening  our democratic processes. Before your election, you had to  achieve a mini-consensus to guarantee your second attempt to  become president. How do you view this now you are president?  How can a consensus be achieved?    Sanchez: Well, political dynamics, especially as  we see it in Europe, involves opposition politics, that is, the  opposition, the ruling party, and all that.    Nevertheless, there comes a time when a consensus must be  reached, and many criticized me over this when I was in the  opposition.    Through fraud and the fact that the second placed party  voted  for those placed third, if a majority vote is not achieved in  Bolivia, you have to resort to Congress. It is almost  impossible to achieve an absolute majority.    Ruffinelli: You were elected by Congress.    Sanchez: Yes, even though my election, my victory,  was overwhelming -- I received 15 percent more than the second  placed candidate. In a proportional representation vote system,  it is impossible to receive more than 50 percent of the votes.  Yet the Bolivian Constitution states that if you do not receive  an absolute majority of the votes, you have to resort to  Congress.    Ruffinelli: Do you have the support of two thirds  of the Senate?    Sanchez: Yes.    Ruffinelli: And a good portion or a significant  portion of the Chamber of Deputies?    Sanchez: We have an absolute majority in the  Chamber of Deputies. A consensus is required when you draft  significant measures to really transform society.  Privatizations, the people's participation program, and  education reform are revolutionary measures that the people  eagerly want, but many people, especially the teachers, oppose  it. When you design significant measures to transform society,  a consensus is required. This does not mean it must be  unanimous, but a consensus is essential because it is not enough  to have a majority in Congress. All parties must decide that  the time to reach an agreement has come. We will never agree on  every measure because a government has to rule. These are  significant measures which involve the changes and  transformations required by current times -- because these are  times of change--and we must try to achieve a consensus.    Ruffinelli: Emphasis has also been placed on the  corruption issue and how to handle it. You have drug  trafficking and other fairly difficult measures to solve. How  are you handling the corruption issue?    Sanchez: We believe the privatization program  will help to solve the corruption problem. Under a pluralist  democratic process, we believe it is incompatible for the state  to manage economic activities. If you manage state-owned  enterprises well, you may not lose votes because you will be  firing people and running the operation very efficiently. If  you manage them poorly, if you start hiring your fellow party  members, the enterprise will perform poorly and the services  will be lousy. This is also bad.    We believe it is necessary to radically decentralize our  country, to remove the state from economic activities,  transferring them the private area. We must do it through  privatizations in which the enterprises are not sold to foreign  capital or directly to private capital, but in which the people  themselves participate.    Second, with this participation of the people, certain roles  will be transferred to the municipal governments and others to  rural communities and urban neighborhoods. Like this we believe  we will achieve the dynamics needed to exercise control. When  the people control, there is no corruption. In a neighborhood  or a small town, the people know exactly what is being done and  who is doing it. We believe this mechanism of decentralization,  through the people's participation in privatizations, will allow  them to control. This is not merely a moral or personal  problem, it is an institutional problem.    When there is excessive centralization, it is very difficult  to control, regardless of the government's good intentions and  efforts.    Ruffinelli: I want to return to the trafficking  issue, because it also is somewhat linked to what is happening  here. Concerning the coca issue, you are, let's say, free to  grow it, but not to process it. But the United States wants it  eradicated.    Sanchez: There are regions in Bolivia where coca  was being grown before the arrival of the Spaniards. This coca,  however, is very special. It is grown in high-altitude regions.  This coca requires hard work. It is carefully grown,  harvested, and dried.    There are other new regions where another type of coca is  grown, a coca that is unsuitable for the traditional purpose of  chewing or in typical Bolivian rites. This coca is used by  traffickers.    We are now trying to control it and convince Bolivians to  voluntarily replace coca with alternative development crops. It  also involves paying them for each hectare they eradicate. It  is not easy because it is not easy to find a crop that will  really replace coca production. Nevertheless, we must wage this  war because, thank God, the narco-guerrillas and drug cartels  have not yet reached Bolivia. We are very scared because we had  a military government that was totally at the service of drug  trafficking.    Ruffinelli: [Former Bolivian President Luis]  Garcia Meza's detention in Brazil has probably created a little  problem for your government. Even though it is a relief, it  also represents a little problem. In Brazil, he said he did not  govern alone. Coming from a former president, this is  politically significant. What does this mean to you?    Sanchez: We believe corruption cannot be concealed  and, if he has something to say, I would be pleased to hear it.  It is also necessary to be very careful about reports from a  man sentenced by the Supreme Court to 30 years in prison, and  who has been at large.    Ruffinelli: But there still are pockets of  authoritarianism and corruption that have not been removed from  the Bolivian society.    Sanchez: Obviously. There are many, but I want  to tell you that my party, the Nationalist Revolutionary  Movement, reached the government in 1985, through our leader and  founder Victor Paz Estenssoro. We inherited a 23,400-percent  hyperinflation ...    Ruffinelli: [interrupting] Was it your program or  was it a program ...?    Sanchez: Well now, a program ... [pauses] He  transferred me from the Senate presidency to the Planning and  Coordination Ministry, and we were able to curtail  hyperinflation.    I have become president and there is hyper-corruption. I  will not be able to totally wipe out corruption, because it has  been imbued in humanity since Eve gave Adam an apple. This will  not ... [pauses] We do not want hyper-corruption. We want  single-digit corruption, controllable corruption in which  coexistence is possible.    Ruffinelli: You do not want it to become a  standard.    Sanchez: Correct. As I have just said, we do not  want hyper-corruption. We do not want such serious corruption.  Yet, it is not easy. As with hyperinflation and inflation,  corruption must be reduced with very radical, clear, and  unrelenting measures. By the time I leave the government, I  hope to leave a country in which corruption has not entirely  been wiped out, but where it has been reduced to a level that  can be managed and controlled by the courts and society.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Doubts emerge on union merger TGWU members voted by 82.1 per cent in favour of retaining a political fund on a turnout of 29 per cent. The TGWU's political fund is the second largest in the union movement, raising Pounds 3m a year. All unions have to vote on retaining a fund every 10 years. In this second round of voting two other unions have backed retaining a fund  -the AEEU engineering and electrical union and the STE telecommunications union.</p>

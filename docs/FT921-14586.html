			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Port sale may be re-examined THE GOVERNMENT was last night preparing for an embarrassing reappraisal of its plans to privatise the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool, Britain's second biggest cargo port. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, shipping minister, told MPs that no 'final decision' on the Pounds 180m offer for the port from Teesside Holdings, a newly-formed consortium, would be taken until representations concerning the bid had been looked into 'very carefully'. Fresh criticism for the government came last night from both sides of the House of Commons. This followed a storm of protest from rival bidders and port employees. Last month Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said he was 'minded' to give his formal consent to the deal as soon as the Commons had approved a technical order paving the way for the sale. In a Commons debate last night, Ms Joan Walley, a Labour environment spokeswoman, said there was 'general despair' at the government's 'wholesale mis-handling' of the trust ports' privatisation. She added that there were 'serious allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the Tees and Hartleepool bidding'. Mr Roger Moate (C Faversham) said the government should look at the situation thoroughly 'perhaps even with a view to going through the bidding process once again'. Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend east) complained that the technical order was defectively drafted. The motion was eventually passed with a government majority of 108 after several calls for an adjournment to enable more MPs to speak had been rejected. It will implement a clawback to ensure that when trust ports are privatised, their new owners cannot immediately sell their assets without paying a penalty. The sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool - the first of about 15 large trust ports destined for privatisation - was conducted by the non-executive members of the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority. They rejected the Maritime Transport Services, operator of the Thamesport container terminal, which bid Pounds 210m, and the management-employee buy-out team, which bid Pounds 150m.</p>

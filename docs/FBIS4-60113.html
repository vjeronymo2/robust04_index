			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colonel Haj Isma'il, commander of </F> the Palestinian police forces in Jericho, in Jericho, by Ramadan  Husayn, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Husayn] What are the Palestinian police's tasks  in Jericho in general, particularly today on 'Id al-Adha?    [Isma'il] [passage omitted] As for the civilian tasks of the  police, since they arrived, the police assumed their duties in a  normal way in the area. In Jericho, they assumed their full  duties to ensure security and safety and maintain order. Things  here are proceeding normally and the police are running the  affairs according to their program.    [Husayn] You are aware that many settlers reside in the  Jericho area and will be subject to Palestinian police  protection. Do you think they might cause any trouble for the  Palestinian police forces?    [Isma'il] Since the beginning we have been working hard to  avoid trouble with the settlers and with religious people in  particular. As you know, they have a small synagogue here in  Jericho, and agreements stipulate that religious people can  visit the synagogue once a week or at any time they like on the  condition that they be unarmed. They still enter the synagogue  with their arms and refuse to abide by the agreement, causing  trouble and problems for us; and they pass through the city,  too. We are trying hard to overcome the problems with the  Israeli side through the liaison committee. We are still  suffering from this problem because the religious settlers are  persisting in these acts in a provocative way.    [Husayn] Regarding Palestinian people visiting Jerusalem,  Israel imposes a special system according to which advance  permits must be obtained. Does this apply to the Jericho  residents, or has the situation changed?    [Isma'il] The Israeli stand on Jericho residents visiting  Jerusalem has not changed; we have a problem here. We discussed  the matter with the Israeli side but the Israeli stance has not  changed. They insist that any one wanting to visit Jerusalem  must have a permit, but we told them that Jerusalem is part of  the Palestinian land. We will visit Jerusalem soon, God  willing, and we are working hard to lift the blockade and  rescind the Israelis' measures concerning Jerusalem.    [Husayn] Another question, regarding preparations to receive  President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] in Jericho, the  headquarters of the transitional self-rule authority.    [Isma'il] Here in Jericho we are anxiously waiting for his  arrival. All our people in the West bank and Gaza Strip (?look  forward) to President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival. We are preparing  for his arrival but the date is left for the president to decide  on. [passage omitted]    [Husayn] Concerning the supervision of traffic to and from  Jericho over the Allenby Bridge and the crossing between Jericho  and Gaza Strip, what is the position of the Palestinian police  forces?    [Isma'il] The Israeli side is preparing the necessary  installations for the three crossings, in accordance with the  agreement, and will soon complete building the terminals. After  that we will begin to implement all the measures concerning  traffic at the crossings according to the provisions of the  agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

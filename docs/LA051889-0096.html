			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO IMMEDIATE THREAT FOUND FROM ROCKWELL LAB POLLUTION  </P> <P> Chemical and radioactive pollution at Rockwell International's Santa Susana  Field Laboratory southeast of Simi Valley appears to be confined to the site  and poses no immediate threat to nearby residents, according to a preliminary  report by the U.S. Department of Energy.  </P> <P> But the report, furnished Tuesday by DOE to Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi  Valley), called for more environmental tests since inadequacies in the plant's  "groundwater monitoring system make it difficult to characterize the nature and  extent of contamination."  </P> <P> Officials of DOE, which has contracted for nuclear work at the isolated  research complex, predicted that additional testing and some cleanup work will  be needed.  </P> <P> Still, DOE officials gave the site a qualified bill of health.  </P> <P> "The public has no reason to fear any hazard to human health as a result of the  contamination" found to date, said Richard H. Nolan, chief spokesman for the  DOE's operations office in Oakland.  </P> <P> However, a DOE critic who worked on the report as a private consultant said  there has been too little ground water testing at the lab for the public to  feel reassured.  </P> <P> And Gallegly said he will "push for additional monitoring wells to be dug as  quickly as possible so we will know for sure if there is any reason to be  concerned. . . ." He was briefed Tuesday by DOE officials after demanding a  copy of the report in response to news stories.  </P> <P> "They told me there's no radioactive contamination in any of the water they  tested," Gallegly said by telephone from his Washington office. "I hope there's  not fear out there to the point where people are thinking of picking up and  moving to Northern California -- there's no cause for that."  </P> <P> The lab, operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division in a rugged area of the  Simi Hills, for several years has been on the state Superfund cleanup list  because of high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a chemical solvent, in  ground water under the complex. Rocketdyne has been pumping and treating ground  water in one part of the property where TCE has been found at levels of up to  11,000 parts per billion, 2,200 times the drinking water standard.  </P> <P> The DOE report acknowledges, apparently for the first time, that some  radioactive contamination also exists in soil and structures from nuclear  operations and spills.  </P> <P> But agency officials Tuesday characterized this contamination as moderate,  saying radiation levels a short distance from the hottest spots do not exceed  natural background levels.  </P> <P> Rocketdyne officials said they have tested 16 wells and springs, off the site  but nearby, over the last four years without detecting chemical or radioactive  pollution.  </P> <P> And DOE officials, contradicting published news reports, said radioactive  pollution has never been found in ground water, either under or off the site.  </P> <P> But James Werner, the former consultant who worked on the report and now is an  environmental scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an  environmental group, said it "isn't surprising" that no radioactive elements  have been found in ground water "since they haven't looked for them to any  extent."  </P> <P> Werner said, for example, that ground water has seeped in and out of a  contaminated building -- but that the nearest test well is uphill from the  building, or in the opposite direction of the ground water flow.  </P> <P> Werner said that when he surveyed the lab in May, 1988, Rockwell "had not even  gone through the process of identifying" areas of potential contamination in  parts of the site devoted to DOE work.  </P> <P> Virtually all data for the report were generated by Rockwell itself, but DOE  officials said this did not pose a problem.  </P> <P> "The independent survey team found that the data was credible enough that it  didn't feel the need to do independent sampling," Nolan said.  </P> <P> Under pressure from Congress, DOE more than three years ago began surveying 35  labs and production sites where weapons or energy development was done for DOE  or its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.  </P> <P> In a report to Congress due in December, DOE officials will rank the sites,  establishing which will be first to get funds for more tests and cleanup. The  Santa Susana lab will probably appear near "the bottom of the list," said DOE  spokesman Wolfgang Rosenberg.  </P> <P> DOE officials said that in one area of the plant, known as the sodium burn pit,  soil tests revealed levels of radioactive cesium as high as 700 picocuries per  gram of soil -- about 10 to 30 times higher than normal background radiation  for the area.  </P> <P> In a sewage leach field where radioactive water was spilled in the 1970s, the  highest radiation level found was 4,900 picocuries per gram of soil, officials  said.  </P> <P> Opened in 1947, the Santa Susana lab had the first nuclear reactor in the  United States to produce power for supply to a commercial power grid. The  small, experimental sodium-cooled reactor went on line in 1957, producing power  for Southern California Edison Co.  </P> <P> The plant was crippled by a serious accident in July, 1959, when 13 of its 43  uranium fuel rods ruptured or suffered partial meltdown. The plant was repaired  and operated until 1967. But the accident remained virtually unknown to the  public until 1979, when it was finally described in news reports.  </P> <P> A 1983 Rockwell report to DOE described the removal and cleanup of the sodium  reactor without discussing the 1959 accident.  </P> <P> According to the report, the cleanup work, which took from 1974 until 1983,  involved removal of 136,411 cubic feet of radioactively contaminated buildings,  soil and rock, which were hauled to nuclear waste dumps at Beatty, Nev., and  Hanford, Wash. The cost of the cleanup was $16.6 million, according to the  report.  </P> <P> Studies later showed that the area was "decontaminated to levels that allow  unrestricted use," the report said, suggesting that remaining radioactivity was  caused by later work at the lab.  </P></p>

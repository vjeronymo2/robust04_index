			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Ratings agencies complete merger IBCA and Euronotation, the rating agencies, yesterday announced the completion of their planned merger, the first step to a possible Europe-wide agency to compete with US giants Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The merger, under discussion since early this year, also involves the sale of 70 per cent in the new group to Centenaire Blanzy, a diversified French group. The remaining shares remain with the managers of the two firms. Centenaire Blanzy intends to sell on part of its shareholding to other European investors, broadening the base of the group to cover other European markets, principally Germany. Discussions have been held with Bertelsmann, the German publishing giant, and other media companies, IBCA said yesterday. The plan to use IBCA and Euronotation as the base for a Europe-wide agency has developed in parallel with a separate move within Germany to create a rival to the US-based agencies. That project, launched by a series of German banks and commercial companies, has yet to lead to a hard proposal for a new agency. IBCA yesterday refused to comment on whether there had been discussions between the German and Anglo-French groups about the possibility of a link-up. Centenaire Blanzy was controlled by the Suez Group and Victoire, the insurance croup, until 1989, but no formal links remain, IBCA said. IBCA yesterday downgraded Barclays from AA+ to AA, citing the UK banking group's high loan loss provisions in the US and UK and exposure to the UK property and construction sectors. Last week, Moody's, the US agency, announced that it had put Barclays and National Westminster under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's had already cut Barclays from a AAA to AA1 in May this year.</p>

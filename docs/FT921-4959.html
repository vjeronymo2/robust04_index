			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Heavy selling halts dollar rise TEMPTATION proved too much for some investors who decided to take profits once the dollar hit DM1.68 after another day of climbing, writes Neil Buckley. The morning had seen the US currency take a rest after its surge in the previous three days, but in the afternoon it powered through resistance at DM1.6740 and DM1.6780 until its arrival at DM1.6800 triggered heavy selling by investors anxious to guarantee profits before today's US payroll figures. These will be the focus of attention, with dealers looking for further evidence of US economic recovery, although nervousness persists that the figures may disappoint. The dollar retreated at the close to DM1.6725/30, little changed on the day. Against the yen, it slid back from a Y132.43 high to Y132.10/20, but was still above its 132.05/15 start. In New York last night it fell back slightly to DM1.6707 and Y131.80/90 at midsession. 'There were no economic fundamentals yesterday so the market had nothing to focus on, but there was still a lot of short-term speculative buying,' said an economist with a UK bank. 'We're seeing whippy trading in the course of a longer-term bull run.' In Tokyo, the dollar had continued upwards, supported by active technical demand after it broke through key resistance at DM1.67 and Y132. It closed at DM1.6725 and Y132.00. Japanese investors were said to be buying large amounts of dollars which they sold last month, and while some fears about Bank of Japan intervention remained, dealers believed this would be ineffective. The D-mark's four-month low against the dollar did not stop it from continuing its long climb against the Swiss franc, reaching SFr0.9112/24, up from SFr0.9097/0.9109 on Wednesday. The Swiss currency was the centre of attention in Europe as rumours abounded that the Swiss National Bank was holding an emergency meeting. No intervention took place, however. The SNB also refused to comment on speculation that it was about to create a new Lombard rate two percentage points higher than the present rate, a rumour which helped lift the Swiss franc from its lows. The German currency fell slightly against the French franc and lira, but was steady within the EMS at around 31 per cent above its central rate. This was partly due to a strong performance against sterling, which fell on nervousness induced by an opinion poll that was favourable to the opposition Labour party. Sterling closed at DM2.8700/03, down more than a pfennig from the might before. It remained pinned to the foot of the EMS table, slipping to 44 per cent below its central Ecu rate from 39 per cent on Wednesday, and sparking fears that a UK base rate cut might now be too risky. Against the dollar, sterling weakened to Dollars 1.7165 from Dollars 1.7235.</p>

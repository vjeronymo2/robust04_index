The requirement for clear floor space for a front approach does not refer to the circulation route to these areas. However, clear floor space must be provided within each work area to allow a person using a wheelchair to position themselves at the work station in a forward position. The interim final rule clarifies the location of the clear floor space requirement for a front approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested clarification of whether all or only a percentage of judges' benches are required to be adaptable. Other commenters recommended a requirement for 100 percent accessible judges' benches in new construction as required by the State of California. Commenters stated that once a design is proposed for providing adequate space for full accessibility, there is no reason to require adaptability. Several commenters requested that the provision should provide examples of adaptability and require the purchase of lifts or ramps for future installation to ensure that it is not an undue burden to make judges' benches fully accessible at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The legislative history of the ADA states that areas used only by employees as work areas are covered by the guidelines, but individual work stations are not required to be constructed in a fully accessible manner. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt. 3, at 63. The requirement for adaptability for judges' benches and other work areas is consistent with the legislative history and ADAAG 4.1.1(3) (Areas Used Only by Employees as Work Areas) which requires areas used only by employees as work areas be designed and constructed so that individuals with disabilities can approach, enter, and exit the area. This provision requires all judges' benches and clerks' stations to be either accessible or adaptable and describes how adaptability is applied to these areas. Adaptability means that maneuvering clearances and other features (e.g., fixed controls) shall be designed into the space so that accessibility can easily be provided at a later date. For example, an adaptable judge's bench which is designed for a future installation of a ramp or lift would have the required maneuvering clearances to approach, enter, and exit the ramp or lift, to maneuver at the bench (e.g., knee clearance), and to reach any fixed controls (e.g., alarm buttons) already designed into the space. If adaptability is provided, the installation of a ramp or lift at a later date should not require any additional structural modifications and therefore should not be an undue burden. An appendix note further recommends that equipment such as a ramp be available so that accessibility can be accomplished to at least one judge's bench and clerk's station to accommodate court proceedings. Unlike typical office work stations, judges' benches and clerks' stations are typically elevated 6 inches to 21 inches. Due to the complexity of courtroom and legislative chamber design and the difficulty of accommodating subsequent physical change, the Board believes that requiring either accessible or adaptable judges' benches and clerks' stations will significantly facilitate a reasonable accommodation for an employee in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested clarification that where doors or gates are provided at a lift, maneuvering space is required by ADAAG 4.13 (Doors), and controls and operating mechanisms must comply with the reach ranges in 4.2 (Space Allowance and Reach Ranges).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As previously discussed, ADAAG 11.2.1(1) requires doors or gates designed to allow passage into the well of the courtroom, the witness stand, the jury box, and the speaker's rostrum and other areas to comply with ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). Gates provided at lifts must also comply with the applicable provisions of ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). Additional maneuvering clearances may need to be provided to ensure that the lift is accessible and usable by persons with disabilities. For example, many persons using wheelchairs entering and exiting a platform lift in one direction can be accommodated on a minimum 30 inch by 48 inch lift. However, if a person is required to make a 90 degree turn either entering or exiting the platform lift, additional maneuvering clearances at the lift gate, and an increase in the platform size will need to be provided. Applying the minimum maneuvering clearances at doorways and gates illustrated in Figures 25 and 26 show that the required clear floor space depends on whether the lift door can be approached straight on or at right angles, and whether the door has both a latch and a closer. For a direct approach, straight through the lift, Figure 26 shows that a lift platform with a minimum clear space of 48 inches in the direction of travel is required. If a right angle turn must be made on the platform to exit, Figure 25(b) shows that a minimum clear width of 54 inches perpendicular to the direction of approach is needed to accommodate the turn. However, these minimum clearances only illustrate the clearances needed to operate the gate from a front approach, assuming the gate has an operating mechanism. A front approach is preferred but would not necessarily be required at lift doors that automatically unlatch, since they do not have operating mechanisms. However, the referenced clearances above do not take into account the difficulty of making a 90 degree turn while backing out of the lift, a particularly difficult maneuver for a person who uses a motorized wheelchair. Ideally, the platform lift should allow sufficient space for a person to make a 360 degree turn in order to approach the gate from a forward position. Widening the gates to provide a 36 inch to 42 inch clear width will provide additional maneuvering clearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter thought that providing accessible judges' benches might ``significantly alter the nature or design of the facility'' and therefore should be exempt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters provided architectural plans illustrating fully accessible courtrooms. Accessible judges' benches do not significantly alter the nature or design of the facility.

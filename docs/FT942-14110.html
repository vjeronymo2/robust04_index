			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT lifted by better economic conditions ITT, the US conglomerate, reported a 28 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, powered by higher income in its insurance, automotive parts and hotels businesses. The group made Dollars 219m, or Dollars 1.67 a fully diluted share, against Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.30, a year earlier. Sales and revenues from ongoing businesses totalled Dollars 5.5bn, up 7 per cent. Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said the performance reflected 'improving US economic fundamentals and the benefits of previous and continuing cost improvement programmes'. The financial and business services group made Dollars 237m, up from Dollars 231m, due to a jump in income to Dollars 190m from Dollars 156m at the Hartford insurance subsidiary. Hartford's rise came in spite of the the Los Angeles earthquake and the severe US winter, which helped produce catastrophe losses in excess of expectations at Dollars 40m after tax, or 31 cents a share. Hartford was the primary contributor to group portfolio gains of Dollars 35m, or 27 cents. The manufactured products group made Dollars 88m, up from Dollars 45m, with income at the automotive business rising from Dollars 32m to Dollars 60m, defence and electronics at Dollars 11m compared with break-even, and fluid technology up from Dollars 13m to Dollars 17m. The automotive improvement was attributed to higher sales, mainly in North America, and cost reduction programmes. The Sheraton hotels group had income of Dollars 29m, up from Dollars 16m. Much of this was due to gaming operations at the Sheraton Desert Inn in Las Vegas, which exceeded expectations in its first full quarter under Sheraton control.</p>

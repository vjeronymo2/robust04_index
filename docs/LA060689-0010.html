			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PAKISTAN MAY BUY U.S. JETS  </P> <P> The Administration is considering the sale of 60 F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan  at a cost of $1.4 billion and may make an announcement of an agreement during  the current visit to Washington of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,  U.S. officials said. Bhutto is to hold talks today with President Bush and  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and an official said the sale "will  certainly be discussed." But he refused to comment on any timetable for the  purchase. The wisdom of the proposed sale has already been questioned by some  members of Congress who fear it will only add more fuel to the arms race under  between Pakistan and India and divert Pakistani resources from needed economic  investment at home.  </P></p>

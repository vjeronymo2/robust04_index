			<p>BFN     [Text] Two East Jerusalem papers today carry a decree by  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat which orders that the civilian and  religious courts in the areas of the autonomy are to reinstate  the laws that prevailed in the territories before June 1967.  The PLO Executive Committee will announce the names of the 24  members of the autonomy's Administrative Council tomorrow. Our  Arab affairs correspondent Oren Kohen reports:    [Kohen] The decree cancels most of the military laws that  pertain to civilian matters, and restores the situation to that  which prevailed in the territories before the Israeli  occupation. This was stated today by Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn  from Gaza in reaction to a decree PLO head Yasir 'Arafat  published today. According to the decree, as of 20 May, the  courts in the area of autonomy again follow the laws that  existed there before June 1967. 'Arafat published the decree in  East Jerusalem newspapers today. He calls on the civilian and  religious courts to again function in the manner they did before  June 1967. Egypt has not changed the laws that prevailed in  Gaza since the days of the British mandate and Israel added  military regulations to them. At the same time, the Jordanian  law is still valid in Jericho.    The step 'Arafat has taken stands in contradiction to the  agreements he signed with Israel, or at least this is the  Foreign Ministry's view. The ministry claims that any change  made in the laws in the autonomy areas require an a-priori  Israeli agreement.    The legal situation in the territories is not yet  sufficiently clear because Israel has not yet transferred the  administrative powers to the council that 'Arafat was supposed  to be name three weeks ago. The PLO Executive Council is slated  to announce the final composition of the council tomorrow,  assuming that 'Arafat's attempts to nominate them do not fail  once again.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 24 May  adds:  "Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said today that if  indeed 'Arafat announced the cancellation of the laws Israel had  applied in the territories, it is a gross violation of the  agreement Israel and the PLO signed. 'Arafat's declaration,  Singer says, is tantamount to making the entire agreement null  and void. The legal adviser told our correspondent Shlomo Raz  that 'Arafat has no legislative authority in Gaza and Jericho.  Only the Palestinian Authority has such powers, and it has not  yet arrived and has not started operating; furthermore, this  power as well is subject to an Israeli veto." A similar report  by Shlomo Raz on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on  24 May adds that "'Arafat's decree is legally meaningless."]</p>

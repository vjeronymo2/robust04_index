			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CHASE VEHICLE FLEEING AT 7 M.P.H.  </P> <P> A man was charged with stealing a forklift after leading police on one of the  slowest chases on record.  </P> <P> "I guess you could say we had a high-speed chase at 7 m.p.h.," police Lt.  Ronald Waugaman said.  </P> <P> Clinton J. Gandy, 48, of Greensburg, allegedly hopped on the forklift Thursday,  turned the key, which had been left in the ignition, and drove off. An employee  of Overly Manufacturing Co., which owns the vehicle, called police, and a  cruiser quickly caught up with the driver.  </P> <P> "When he saw the car, he just turned around, smiled, waved and kept on going,"  Waugaman said.  </P> <P> Gandy finally pulled over and was arrested. He was arraigned on charges of  theft, receiving stolen property and drunken driving.  </P></p>

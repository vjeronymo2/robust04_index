			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (2): Read the questions first] MANY EXAM candidates find it a tiresome instruction, but most pupils accept that it is wise to 'read the examination paper carefully before attempting to answer the questions'. If only all of the 500 head teachers who participated in our survey had done the same when filling in our questionnaires . . . Some returns made very strange reading. Twenty schools claimed to be commanding fees in excess of Pounds 15,000 - twice that charged by Eton. And several we thought had excellent academic records barely scraped into the top 200 on the data they supplied. We telephoned those schools with major anomalies and corrected their entries. One headmaster dismissed school league tables based on A and B grades as 'crap' at a meeting of the Headmasters' Conference (later dispelling alarm at his schoolboy language by explaining that this stood for Cumulative Ratio of Academic Performance). There was even talk of boycotting newspaper surveys. Another head talked of foul play. Some schools, he claimed, had excluded failed A levels when working out the percentage of top grades. Although we have no evidence to support these claims we were disturbed by the many discrepancies between our own figures for the percentage of A and B passes, which we calculated from raw data, and those published elsewhere. Differences of 2 or 3 per cent were common. Some were as high as 7 per cent, and this made a considerable difference to a school's final rank position. And 20 schools in our top 100 have been omitted from other league tables of similar size. Another area of concern expressed frequently by educationalists is that league tables ignore the question of 'value added' (see article on Page 4). Independent schools cater for children with a very wide range of abilities. League tables of examination performance suggest that a selective school with outstanding A level results is better than one achieving average results with less-than-averagely academic pupils. A level results do, nevertheless, provide an objective measure of a school's academic performance. While schools continue to provide details of their A levels results in a form that is neither easy to interpret, nor to compare with other schools, league tables such as the FT 500 are an invaluable information source for parents. This supplement is the culmination of six months' intensive research. The first two months were spent testing the water. What did parents want to know? How much information were schools able and willing to give? How could we ensure the information we received would be representative and comparable? And how could we ensure a good response rate? We started by circulating a draft questionnaire to 50 experts, including all members of the Independent Schools Joint Council, head teachers' and teachers' associations, examining bodies, educationalists, the Department of Education and Science, plus individual head masters and head mistresses, teachers and parents. Head teachers of schools that had performed well in league tables in the past were quick to reply. Others were pleased to be included for the first time. Peter Owen, headmaster of Rushmoor and chairman of the Independent Schools Association, best summed up the problems of school league tables: 'Two C grades and a D grade from one pupil may be a far greater achievement for the individual and the school than a very bright pupil getting three A grades. And a pupil with good grades from one school may have received a very narrow education compared with another pupil with the same grades from a different school. 'In the end, a good school academically is not the one with the best results. It is the one that gets the most out of their pupils in all ways, whatever the ability of those pupils may be.'</p>

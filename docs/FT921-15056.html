			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Estimates of global warming scaled down ESTIMATES OF global warming over the past century due to greenhouse gases may have been 'somewhat exaggerated', according to a draft report to be presented to a meeting of scientists tomorrow. The report, by the science group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), also says its original forecast of the pace of global warming due to industrial activity may need modifying. But it says that the main conclusions of its 1990 report remain unchanged: emissions from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouses gases. The document updates the 1990 IPCC report on global warming in the light of new research from more sophisticated computer models. The IPCC was established by governments to investigate global warming in preparation for the Earth Summit conference in Rio de Janeiro in June. The science group, led by Sir John Houghton, former head of the UK Meteorological Office, meets in Guangzhou, China, tomorrow to finalise the report. It stands by its original conclusion that if business and industry continue operating as usual, global temperatures would increase by 0.3 degrees Celsius per decade, within an uncertainty range of 0.2-O4C. The new scenario sees a rise below 0.3C but still within the range of uncertainty. The report says that by reducing the ozone layer, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) have offset the effect they have as greenhouse gases. 'Consequently estimates of warming over the last century due to increases in greenhouse gases made in the original report may be somewhat exaggerated.' However, the report says there is more evidence of warming taking place.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Extra Fish for Bornholm"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- Bornholm's fishermen yesterday received  compensation for the fish catches they would have lost as the  result of a "technical error" during the negotiations on Swedish  membership of the European Union [EU].    It would seem that it was the Greek presidency that, in the  nocturnal negotiations with Sweden earlier this month, made the  mistake by forgetting to consult Denmark before Sweden was  allowed to increase its cod quota in the Baltic Sea from 35 to  40 percent.    Danish diplomatic circles reject the notion that the error  could be on the Danish side. The Danes saw no document that  quoted the figure of 40 percent, and they had therefore only  approved an offer of 35 percent, the diplomats say.    The result of yesterday's discussions in the Council of  Ministers was that the Council has committed itself to buying  fishing rights in the Baltic from other countries -- the Baltic  countries and Russia, for example -- corresponding to what has  been lost by Bornholm's fishermen because of the concessions to  Sweden.    "With this agreement we have protected Bornholm's  fishermen's  interests, and I view this as an important result," Foreign  Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party) said  yesterday evening. "An error had unfortunately occurred, and I  do not know precisely how this happened."</p>

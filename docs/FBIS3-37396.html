While in Washington, Nazarbayev met leaders of some major  international financial organisations. On Tuesday he received  World Bank President Lewis Preston at Blair-House, the official  residence of heads of state and government visiting Washington.  Later in the day he met managing director of the International  Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus. Nazarbayev also had talks with  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and First Deputy  Secretary of the Treasury Roger Oltman.    "Good relations are shaping up between the international  financial organisations and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev told  ITAR-TASS. Thanks to the influence of the International Monetary  Fund and the U.S. Treasury, representatives of Western  donor-countries have decided to grant Kazakhstan financial aid  amounting to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, thrice the expected sum.  During the meeting with the U.S. secretary of commerce, the  sides discussed the possibility of setting up a joint  commercial-economic commission, which could be headed from the  American side by the U.S. secretary of commerce, and from the  Kazakh side -- by the minister for foreign economic relations.  The talks with first deputy secretary of the treasury focused  on the problem of expanding American aid to Kazakhstan.    President Clinton announced on Monday that the United States  would allocate to Kazakhstan 311 million U.S. dollars as  compared to 91 million dollars last year. "I believe our  relations will develop normally," Nazarbayev stressed.    The Kazakh leader received later in the day James Baker,  former U.S. secretary of state, and Zbigniew Brzezinski,  prominent American political scientist and former presidential  adviser on national security. Then Nazarbayev met  representatives of U.S. science and the arts in one of the  Washington hotels. He told them about the results of his talks  and the agreements reached with the American administration. He  also replied to questions, particularly on the situation in the  region where Kazakhstan is located, on his country's relations  with Russia, and on cooperation in space research. The Kazakh  president called at the embassy of his country in the United  States.</p>

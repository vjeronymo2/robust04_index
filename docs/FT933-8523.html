			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: Adult comics grow up - Now that Doris Lessing has turned to the graphic novel, will publishers and the public take them seriously? SUPERMAN is dead, Batman has taken early retirement, and I'm beginning to feel a little dizzy myself. Readers everywhere who regard their literary taste as fully formed are experiencing anxiety attacks with the advent of the graphic novel. Opinions of the newly established genre vary widely. Aficionados and promoters hail graphic novels as a highly expressive and versatile medium midway between the video and the printed page, with images and words dovetailing to mutual advantage. Detractors deride them as expensive adult comics for those of limited attention span and questionable taste. Literary snobs have long been at best bemused, and at worst contemptuous, of intelligent grown-ups who confess an interest in so-called comics, however disguised. But now that video animations of Shakespeare are sold alongside Hollywood celluloid blockbusters, the barriers between high art and popular entertainment are blurring. When a writer of Doris Lessing's stature turns to the graphic novel, an overhaul of preconceived ideas about the relative merits of different media is clearly in order. 'I have always hated putting things in boxes - conventional novels good, graphic novels or science fiction bad, for example,' says Ms Lessing, whose first venture into the genre of 'sequential art', Playing The Game, is to be published by HarperCollins. An iconoclast by temperament, she helped bring respectability to science fiction with her five haute SF works in the Shikasta series, written between 1979 and 1983. She hopes that her latest work will have a similarly positive effect. Not only has she set out to explode the perception that graphic novels form a sub-class of literature unworthy of serious attention, but she also has a hidden philanthropic agenda. She wants to open the door of the empowering kingdom of books to the dispossessed. 'It sounds sentimental, I know, but I am haunted by the vision of all those kids out there who are disqualified from the whole of culture, who perceive it as 'not for us'. It troubles me that they are unnecessarily excluded by those who don't even know they are doing it,' she says. An Australian artist friend whose background mirrors the audience she aims to reach was the inspiration for her own exploration of the graphic novel: 'He came from a working class home which had no books in it, but he did read comics. One day he dropped into a picture gallery and decided there and then to become a graphic artist. It seems a very casual link but his example has stayed with me.' The genre has evolved far beyond the early 'Zap, Pow' imagery associated with superhero titles. The superhero has in fact been largely superseded. Today's graphic novels are of a different order entirely. Ms Lessing explains: 'I have deliberately used verse, and a more elaborate and interesting language, to try to broaden the range of the genre in terms of the words.' Her characters, too, are deliberately designed to shatter stereotypes: one is an eyecatching mix of black girl with ginger hair and blue eyes. The only limitations, she argues, are the imaginations of creators - of the writers and artists themselves. 'There is nothing to stop the graphic novel taking off now in all kinds of unexpected directions.' Anecdotal evidence suggests that demand for graphic novels is also taking off in unusual directions: booksellers have complained that copies are being stolen in quantity and Southend-on-Sea Central Library is progressive enough to boast a graphic novels lending section. Can graphic novels buck the recessionary trend within book publishing internationally? Gone are the days when a publisher had only to sell 4,000 copies of a paperback original in order to break even. A typical print run for the more lavishly produced graphic novel is 15,000 copies. And high quality printing is all-important, as Malcolm Edwards, HarperCollins publishing director, ruefully observes: 'If you're asking someone to pay Pounds 7 or more for a comic, you'd better produce it well'. Gone too are the days when the most competitive production quote invariably came from the Far East. Although Hong Kong continues to offer keen prices, graphic novels are now frequently typeset and printed in Spain, Scandinavia and Scotland. Encouraged by worldwide sales of the graphic version of The Hobbit and by the intuitions of their US partner Eclipse, a specialist comics publisher, HarperCollins is gambling heavily by making the necessary investment. Its programme is to bring out two dozen by December 1994, for publication on both sides of the Atlantic, with big print runs and consequent cost savings. Titan Books, the publishing arm of the Forbidden Planet specialist bookshops, was created expressly to capitalise on a prospective demand for graphic novels. Its commercial judgment vindicated, Titan has now broken into mainstream bookshops, notably WH Smith. Smith's carried The Death of Superman - in which the progenitor of all superheroes dies protecting Metropolis from the villain Doomsday - in large quantities for the pre-Christmas sale. While it is clear that worldwide sales of graphic novels do not yet represent a significant fraction of sales compared to mainstream publishing, they do have all the signs of an emerging force. Whatever happens, superhero art will never be the same again. Frank Miller, an American pioneer in the field, deserves mention for his almost singlehanded achievement of steering the remaining superhero comics away from the simplistic moral polarities of the 1940s and 1950s, when Captain America grappled with the Nazi Red Skull and Green Lantern mopped up gangsters in the big US cities, into the muddied moral universe of today. Between the early Batman and Superman plot-lines and Miller's ageing maladjusted crimefighter in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, published by Titan, there yawns an uncrossable gulf. Comic art has now, for better or worse, come of age. The brief history of graphic novels publishing has already had several high points. In the UK, first among titles striving to extend the repertoire of the more socially-aware graphic novel stands The Minotaur's Tale, written and illustrated by Al Davison, published by Gollancz. According to its editor, Faith Brooker, it is 'about a disabled man's struggle to survive in the community as it is now.' The plotline cannot really support the numerous visual allusions to Greek mythology, Joyce and Robert Graves, but such overambition is an acceptable fault. The Yattering and Jack, published by HarperCollins and written by Clive Barker with John Bolton and Hector Gomez as illustrators, concerns a character (with a striking visual resemblance to Philip Larkin) whom a minor demon is ordered to drive insane. It is funny, scary, and contains some thought-provoking theology. If Neil Gaiman's and Dave McKean's Signal To Noise, published by Gollancz, about a terminally ill film director working furiously to complete a script which he will never see screened, is not a work of high art, I am a samovar. KlingKlangKlatch, written by Ian McDonald, illustrated by David Lyttleton, also on the Gollancz list, is a sharply observed serie noir thriller whose chief protagonist is a streetwise teddy bear police inspector trying to stop a serial killer on the loose in Panda Town. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but who would have predicted that the adventures of a colony of rabbits or of a community of moles would have attracted a cult following and topped the adult fiction bestseller lists, as Richard Adams' Watership Down and William Horwood's Duncton Wood have done? Is this the end of civilisation as we know it, or are we privileged instead to be witnessing the birth pangs of a genuinely new medium? Picture it: a virulent, powerfully addictive art form filters through language barriers to colonise imaginations worldwide, covertly influencing readers for good or ill. It sounds like a promising opening for the plot of a graphic novel.</p>

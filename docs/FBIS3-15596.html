			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Volynskiy report: "A Political Joke From the Times </F> of Yevno Azef"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- A shocking report was issued by  the antiterrorist service of the St. Petersburg Administration  of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS]: A group of  terrorists were intending to kill city mayor Anatoliy Sobchak  and organize an attack on Government House in Moscow! The  report was immediately picked up by the press and television.    A few days later, the same service circulated reports and a  video about its operation to capture another "villain" --  Russian Party Chairman Nikolay Bondarik, who was a candidate for  the city assembly. It turns out that he too was preparing  various terrorist acts. A report on the Independent Television  channel said that Bondarik's people had already killed someone.  A group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks were  shown seizing Bondarik, who was maintaining the calm of an  Ancient Egyptian. The fighters were fearlessly twisting the  arms of some weedy youth, a partner in crime, who had "offered  resistance" to a dozen splendidly armed staffers of the  antiterrorist service.    All this information, reported to the press at a news  conference specially called by the FCS administration, has  generated a mass of questions. The "Great Russia" pre-election  association, which the candidate for the city assembly belonged  to, has issued a protest over his arrest and expressed the hope  that a mistake was made. For several days I tried unsuccessfully  to meet with A. Kuznetsov, leader of the antiterrorism service.  There must obviously be a really large number of terrorists  spread around town.    But if we are talking about a specific case -- the arrest of  five individuals who had seized some weapons, then the question  arises, like in the well-known joke about Cowboy Joe: "How can  someone need uncatchable Joe?" For the very reason that he is  "uncatchable." Any high official of the FCS administration or  the Internal Affairs Main Directorate with whom I have discussed  the possibility of an attempt on Sobchak has responded with an  ironic smile.    However, let us assume that the five, headed by retired  Captain A. Bogdanov, as the FCS Administration reports, did  nevertheless take it into their head to deprive the St.  Petersburg population of its beloved mayor. From the clinical  point of view, how right in the head are they? After all, they  had also hatched another terrible plan: to carry out an attack  on the government building in Moscow, which could be seized by  terrifying a few thousand professionals from the Kremlin  security guard.    The five, as has been officially reported, tried to seize  some weapons. They attacked the security room of the "Zarya"  science and production association, where (I quote VECHERNIY  PETERBURG) "they tied up the female security guards and took  several revolvers and several thousand cartridges for them from  a safe. As they were leaving the security department the  bandits found people waiting for them who were certainly not  elderly women. The operation to capture them took a few  seconds."    "We had them under surveillance for quite a long time," A.  Kuznetsov said, reporting the sensational details of the capture.    But, excuse me, if the surveillance took a long time, does  that mean that an agent of the FCS administration had been  infiltrated into the group? Meaning that the agent behaved like  the unforgotten Yevno Azef, who was leader of the Combat  Organization of Socialist Revolutionaries and simultaneously the  most valued agent of the Czarist police department. And  objectively speaking, the role of the FCS administration agent  was a provocative one, since measures were not taken to put an  end to the preparation of the crime. In this episode the crime  was carried through. Consequently, those who were carrying out  surveillance of this group "for quite a long time" were  interested in it being committed. Which leads to the conclusion  that the episode involving the arrest of the five putative  capturers of Government House in Moscow is a political card,  pure and simple, played at a time of a deterioration in  relations on the political Olympus. This is also informed by the  persistent repetition in the FCS that all five were allegedly  involved in the October (1993) events in Moscow, sided with the  defenders of the House of Soviets, and decided to avenge the  defeat of the lawful authorities.    Equally surprising questions arise when you analyze the  arrest of N. Bondarik, who has also been declared to be a  terrorist. Who was killed by Bondarik and his accomplices has  not been reported, yet this is a factor of most fundamental  importance.    In connection with Bondarik's arrest, Independent Television  showed some object resembling a sawed-off shotgun and said that  Bondarik and co. had been illegally hoarding weapons. Had this  shotgun killed some state figure?    And what about the theft of revolvers and cartridges from  the  "Zarya" science and production association? Some 2,000 rounds  (some newspapers talk about "several thousand") taken from a  place where the elderly lady guards are most often issued with  revolvers which -- to prevent unpleasantness -- are completely  rustfree?    But if the conclusions from the inevitable questions are  correct, the verdict is equally correct: The operations  described above were pretty crude! In general all these matters  are quite a long way removed from counterintelligence tasks.  They are much closer to the political surveillance whose  elimination was announced by President Yeltsin when he  dismantled the Russian Federation Ministry of Security, in the  probable belief that his stupid subjects would believe that the  state can manage without political surveillance. Surveillance  there is, but it looks like it is guided not by state tasks but  by the whims of its immediate boss.</p>

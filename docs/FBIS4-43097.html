			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mehmet Ali Citak] </F>   [Text] Ankara--National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has  supported Chief of General Staff General Dogan Gures' statement  that "Russia is a major threat."    Golhan said Russia, which is experiencing the travails of  transition to democracy and a free market economy, is unable to  tolerate those states that gained their independence after  remaining under Russian control for 70 years.    In a statement to YENI GUNAYDIN, National Defense Minister  Mehmet Golhan indicated that it would be very difficult to say  that the Russian Federation has endorsed the newly independent  states. Recalling that this was the impression he got during his  visit to Russia and during the NATO conference on 24 and 25 May  in Brussels, Golhan said:  <H5>  "It Has Assumed an Air of Big Brother" </H5>   "Russia has assumed the air of `I am your big brother, I am  the leader of the CIS, you line up behind me, let me provide  military and other assistance to you and establish bases  vis-a-vis the small states. As such, Dogan Gures' statement is  correct if we assess the situation from Turkey's angle.    "Russian Defense Minister Grachev said something like this  during the NATO meeting: `We need to send more troops to  Transcaucasia.' I replied: `You might like to send troops, but  will the independent states there not get worried by that?' He  replied: `There are bilateral agreements. I am sending the  troops at their request. Besides, the West has turned its  attention on Bosnia-Herzegovina and is sending troops there. It  is sending no troops elsewhere.' Yes, this is correct. He also  added: `I am sending troops to Georgia and Azerbaijan. If the  West wants, it could also send troops. It could even send  commanders and I will place my troops under their command.'  Although there is some truth in this, what could be said with  certainty is that even if the Russian Federation desists from  exerting pressure on these countries by taking advantage of  internal conflicts and friction, it is trying to subjugate them  under the guise of troop deployment. Therefore, the existence  of [Russian] troops there is not suitable to Turkey. These are  independent states and they themselves must solve their own  military and democratic problems.  <H5>  "The West Is Spoiling Them Too Much" </H5>   National Defense Minister Golhan also indicated that there  is  the worry that faced with economic difficulties, such as 1,000  percent inflation, Russia might redirect its attention abroad  and that the former Communist Party will gain further strength  if things do not develop as the people wish. Stressing that  such a development will create major difficulties for Russia in  its present democratic appearance and in its attainment of  desired objectives, Golhan said: "The West is quite indulgent  toward them. We often tell the West: `You spoiled them too  much.' This is a fact."    Remembering that we share a 500-year history with Russia and  that the ties have always been friendly, Golhan said that at  present there is no problem but that it is not possible to  predict future intentions.  <H5>  UN Umbrella for the Troops </H5>   Asked "what will happen if Russia becomes more active in  Azerbaijan," Golhan replied: "We discussed these matters with  the Russian defense minister. We told him that if there is a  need to send troops then this should be done under the UN  umbrella. At least they requested CSCE and UN observers. If  troops are to be dispatched, then this should be done not on the  basis of bilateral agreements but under the UN umbrella."</p>

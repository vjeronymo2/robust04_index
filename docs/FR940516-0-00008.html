			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;12&hyph;35274A, Revision 1, dated December 15, 1993, which describes procedures for installation of an eductor plate over the exhaust port of the engine air intake system. Accomplishment of this installation will increase the air flow rate down the exhaust port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Temporary Revision No. T/33, Issue 1, dated November 1, 1993, which revises AFM Document No. ATP 004. This temporary revision describes revisions to the Limitations and Normal Procedures sections of the FAA-approved AFM to introduce procedures for operation in icing conditions. The changes include a ground inspection of the engine inlet prior to flight, staggered selection of the left- and right-hand engine de-ice systems to ensure that the likelihood of simultaneous engine rundown on final approach is minimized, and a small increase in the final approach speed to ensure safe landing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream also suggests two other alternatives that would provide an adequate level of safety, wherein the proposed AFM limitation could be removed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Modification of the engine inlets, in addition to accomplishment of the interim measures discussed previously (a life limit on the engine igniter plugs, installation of a bypass duct outlet eductor, and certain changes to the AFM). Jetstream indicates that these modified engine inlets demonstrate a significant improvement in de-icing effectiveness in the range of temperatures and airplane speeds in which power rollbacks have been experienced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream service bulletins that relate to the engine inlet modification are described as follows: Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;13&hyph;35274B, dated October 9, 1993, describes procedures for installing engine air inlet ducts that incorporate electrical de-ice heaters with increased power and area. The service bulletin also describes procedures for performing associated electrical system changes. The installation involves installing engine air inlet ducts that incorporate an enlarged heater mat with revised electrical power densities adjacent to the engine intake flange. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;14, dated October 14, 1993, describes procedures for repetitive visual inspections of the heater mats for damage, and replacement of the engine air intake, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Accomplishment of special operating procedures, not specifically defined by the commenter. Jetstream considers that requiring such operating procedures is a proven and acceptable means of providing an adequate level of safety, as generally demonstrated by the operation of aircraft throughout their flight spectra, in accordance with AFM's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream submits one final suggestion in the event the FAA proceeds with requiring the proposed operating limitation. In this case, the commenter suggests that the actions described in Jetstream Service Bulletins ATP&hyph;54&hyph;13&hyph;35274B and ATP&hyph;54&hyph;14, in addition to the interim measures discussed previously (a life limit on the engine igniter plugs, installation of a bypass duct outlet eductor, and certain changes to the AFM), be accomplished as an alternative method of compliance for the proposed operating limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs partially. The interim measures proposed by the CAA and Jetstream were based, to a large extent, on the flight crew performing special operating procedures to ensure a safe landing after one or both engines had run down due to ice ingestion. However, the FAA considers that requiring the flight crew to perform such special operating procedures over a long term period may not provide the degree of safety assurance necessary for these airplanes. The FAA has determined that requiring the proposed operating limitation to prohibit flight into certain meteorological conditions known to cause engine rundown will provide an acceptable level of safety until additional hardware modifications can be identified and installed on these airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FAA concurs with Jetstream's suggestion that the accomplishment of the interim measures and modification of the engine inlets may be accomplished as optional terminating action for the operating limitation. Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Jetstream has issued Temporary Revision No. T/38, Issue 1, dated February 16, 1994, which revises certain pages of Temporary Revision No. T/33 (discussed previously). Temporary Revision No. T/38 amends the Normal Procedures section of the AFM as related to operation of engine continuous ignition during flight in icing conditions. The FAA finds that this new information must be included in the AFM for Model ATP airplanes in order to assure continued reliability and to prevent unnecessary wear on engine ignition systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to include a new paragraph (b), which includes the following optional terminating action:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Revising the Limitations section and the Normal and Abnormal Procedures sections of the FAA-approved AFM, to include the information specified in Temporary Revision No. T/33, Issue 1, dated November 1, 1993, and Temporary Revision No. T/38, Issue 1, dated February 16, 1994, to introduce procedures for operation in icing conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to place a life limit on the engine igniter plugs and to replace those parts at specified intervals in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;80&hyph;06, Revision 1, dated October 22, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Installing an eductor plate over the exhaust port of the engine air intake system in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;12&hyph;35274A, Revision 1, dated December 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Installing engine air inlet ducts that incorporate electrical de-ice heaters with increased power and area, and performing associated electrical system changes, in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;13&hyph;35274B, dated October 9, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to include repetitive visual inspections of the heater mats for damage; and, if any damage is found, replacement of the engine air intake; in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;54&hyph;14, dated October 14, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

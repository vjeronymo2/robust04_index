			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Fengzhen (7806 7685 3791)] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- During a meeting here  today with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation Wu Yi, Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said he  hopes Japanese-Chinese friendly relations will always develop.    Hata said he was very glad to have met with President Jiang  Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese leaders when he, in  the capacity of foreign minister, accompanied former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on a trip to China not long ago. He  believes that visit to China was of great significance.    Hata said that a member of his cabinet had made an improper  appraisal of history after he assumed the post of prime  minister, and that he had taken action to deal with it.    Hata said: According to statistics compiled by Japan, the  volume of trade between the two countries topped $38.6 billion  last year. Japanese investment in China also grew rapidly last  year. He was glad to see this and hopes for further development  in Japanese-Chinese economic relations and trade.    Wu Yi said: Given a push by Sino-Japanese friendly relations  and cooperation, bilateral cooperative relations in trade and  economics have shown a favorable trend of development and  entered a new stage. She stressed: Separated only by a trip  over water, China and Japan enjoy the favorable conditions of  climatic, geographical, and human closeness. Friendly relations  and cooperation between China and Japan are important to Asia  and the world.    During her visit to Japan, Wu Yi met with Japanese Foreign  Affairs Minister Koji Kakizawa. She also held talks with  Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata to  discuss the development of bilateral cooperative relations in  trade and economics, bilateral textile trade, China's accession  to GATT, and other issues. Eijiro Hata said Japan supports  China's GATT entry.    Headed by Wu Yi, the delegation of the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation arrived in Japan on 31  May for a goodwill visit at the invitation of Japan's Ministry  of International Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Grimm Tales - Theatre There are few tales in the Brothers Grimm more unlikely than the history of the Young Vic over the past year. Since salvaging the artistic directorship from a crisis of confidence that eventually heralded the departure of his co-director Julia Bardsley, Tim Supple has drastically re-scored the theatre's signature tune. Supple has put commercial credibility back on the agenda with a little less of the inconvenient ideals, and a little more populist nous. Hot on the heels of John Byrne's The Slab Boys Trilogy, the theatre's first major critical success this year, comes Grimm Tales, a selection of eight disparate rumbles from the 201 stories the Brothers managed to collate from the dark ages of European folklore. The striking feat of Supple's devised production is that it spans the adult/child age gap. A predominantly older audience might have preferred a grimmer night - some of the real gamey ones have been left on the shelf - but Carol Ann Duffy's adaptations have taken off many of the Disney filters that have domesticated the stories since the first edition in 1812. When the cast first spill out onto Melly Still's slatted stage in Hansel &amp; Gretel, dressed as if headed for one of Bruegel's peasant orgies, there is little to disguise the atmosphere of desperation that winds through the characters as they spin in and out of the story as narrators or in character. With Chris Davey's lighting spiking the gloomy atmosphere through the floor, and Adrian Lee's mesmeric triumvirate of acoustic musicians kneading eerie medieval rhythms, this is no frothy ride from backwoods poverty to an MGM Oz. Rather it is a dark and disturbing journey through childhood fears harnessed compellingly by Linda Kerr Scott's Mother, who transforms from hard-edged Scottish drabness to the skeletal short-sighted crone. Even when Sarah C. Cameron's Gretel bundles her down a stage trap into the oven, her grasping hands with six-inch fingernails continue to rear out of the stage smoke, forcing Gretel to dispatch her with a kitchen knife. If more epic tales, like Iron Hans, fail to grip with the same direct expediency as Hansel &amp; Gretel or the seminal Ashputtel (Cinderella), this is because they lack their rough-hewn, gothic immediacy. Similarly The Golden Goose, though obviously emblematic, is a lesser, more pantomimic force. But Ashputtel is undoubtedly Supple's tour de force in this highly physical staging. There is little on the evening's menu to equal the moment when Linda Kerr Scott and Sarah C. Cameron as Ugly Sisters wincingly slice off their toes and heels to fit the feted shoe; until, that is, Dan Milne's Mother Spirit plucks out both Sisters' eyeballs on the day Natasha Pope's cindered Ashputtel marries her Prince. But the most vindictive scenes are shared by Alan Perrin's improbably lugubrious Step Mother, when she hands out the scissors to her daughters, and Paul M. Meston's creepily aloof Father who rebutts the Prince with 'there's only a grubby little kitchen maid my wife left behind'. Retribution is rarely so sweet in Grimm. With such uncomplicated sentiments and spoken fears, Grimm Tales has a rare potency that usefully challenges the relentless numbing violence of a video age. Grimm Tales continues at the Young Vic until January 21</p>

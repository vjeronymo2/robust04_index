			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol Fears that Burmah Castrol's lubricants business had matured were confounded by yesterday's results. Skilful marketing and geographical expansion into fast-growing markets helped the division achieve 24 per cent growth in operating profits and an 8 per cent increase in sales. Margins were a healthy 10 per cent - not bad for what was supposed to be a mature business. Given lubricants' success, the continuing failure of the group's diversification into speciality chemicals was all the more disappointing. Synergies between lubricants and specialities have proved hard to discover. Like other lumbering groups lured into the fast-moving speciality chemicals business, Burmah has found decent margins hard to achieve. Despite massive cost-cutting, the chemicals division's 5.8 per cent operating margins during the half year to end-June are still worse than those in 1991 - just after Burmah bought into the business. That compares with the 14 per cent achieved by focused speciality groups such as Allied Colloids and Laporte. Burmah should stick to what it does best - selling lubricants. Ideally, it would divest its chemicals division. It could achieve a decent price as its important continental customer base starts to recover. The worst scenario would be if, once the chemicals businesses had benefited from the cyclical upturn, the company compounded its error by making further acquisitions in the sector. For the moment, management is thankfully stressing the need for organic growth.</p>

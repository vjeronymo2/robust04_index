			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] After being beaten up by a policeman in Beijing  last year, Yan Zhengxue, a well-known deputy from the People's  Congress of Zhejiang province, has been sentenced to two years  in a labour-education camp for allegedly stealing a bicycle.    The sentence came just two weeks after the police officer  who  beat up Yan was given just a one-year suspended sentence. Yan's  detention has been cited by Beijing's dissident community as yet  another effort by the authorities to muzzle pro-democracy  activists, who had championed the legislator.    The Beijing Municipal Labour-Education Administrative  Committee handed down Yan's sentence on Tuesday after he had  been found guilty of stealing a new Forever-brand bicycle, worth  about 400 yuan (HK$355), from outside a Beijing University  canteen on September 17 last year. The committee did not say  why Yan had been given such a severe penalty for a relatively  trivial offence but yesterday's BEIJING DAILY described the  legislator as an "inveterate evil-doer" who basically deserved  everything he got. The newspaper said that the outrage  expressed by many people at the lenient treatment of the police  officer who beat up Yan reflected an inadequate understanding of  the law.    The officer acted strictly within the law in forcibly  detaining an "unreasonable and argumentative" Yan after he  "caused chaos" on a public bus by demanding to be let off in  between designated stops, the paper said. Yan, a painter  associated with the artistic community at Beijing's Old Summer  Palace, had become something of a cause celebre in the capital  after he took the police officer to court last year. Analysts  said the sentencing of Yan and lenient treatment of the police  officer was probably designed to act as a warning to the people  of Beijing not to challenge the authority of the police and the  Government.    In January, more than 300 of the nation's leading  intellectuals put their names to a petition addressed to  National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi demanding an  investigation into the abuse of police power as evidenced in the  Yan case.    Leaders of the petition included Beijing University law  lecturer Yuan Hongbing and law graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who  were arrested in early March for masterminding another petition  demanding improvements in labour rights.    "The authorities are taking it out on Yan because the  Yan-related petition is seen as the one that galvanised the  pro-democracy movement this Year," a source said.</p>

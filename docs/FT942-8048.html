			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Lilley to probe National Insurance avoidance claim Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has ordered an investigation into allegations that some companies are avoiding National Insurance contributions by paying staff bonuses in diamonds or wine and even through life insurance schemes. The move comes only seven months after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced moves in his Budget to stop employers legally avoiding the 10.4 per cent National Insurance they pay on staff bonuses. However, by insisting that National Insurance was due on any bonus paid in the form of 'a traded commodity on a recognised exchange' Mr Clarke left a loophole. There are no such exchanges for diamonds or wine. The Mail on Sunday drew attention to the issue again yesterday and also pointed to a new avoidance scheme using life insurance in lieu of bonuses. This involves a company taking out life insurance policies which are then signed over to employees. The company pays premiums into the policies and the employees cash them in after a short time. National Insurance avoidance schemes are particularly attractive to City companies that pay large annual bonuses. The newspaper claimed that 70 per cent of the Pounds 500m paid in this way by City organisations this year made use of avoidance schemes, thereby costing the government Pounds 36.4m. A Department of Social Security official said yesterday: 'There will be an investigation. Clearly, if there are still loopholes and significant sums of revenue are being lost we will take it very seriously.'</p>

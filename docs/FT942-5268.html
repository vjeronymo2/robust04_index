			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Consett revamp Work starts this week on the Pounds 3.9m redevelopment of the heart of a town eroded by industrial dereliction. The scheme at Consett, County Durham, is the latest part of the Pounds 100m Genesis project to regenerate 700 acres of wasted land left in the wake of the 1980 shutdown of the town's steelworks. The redevelopment is claimed to be unique in Europe because of its 'environmentally-sound' framework.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- It is not easy to count  every change in Chinese peasants' lives since reform was  launched. Although it has only been 15 years, it is 15 years of  earthshaking changes.    Though the Chinese are world famous for their cuisine,  Chinese peasants had not been able to stuff themselves with food  until the last dozen of years or so during which the household  contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to  output was practiced. Here are two peasant "food lists": one  for 1978, in which Chinese peasants' per capita consumption of  grain was 247.8 kg, vegetables -- 141.5 kg, meat -- 5.75 kg,  eggs -- 0.79 kg, and fish and prawns -- 0.84 kg; the other for  1992, in which per capita consumption of grain, vegetable, meat,  egg, fish and prawn were 250 kg, 129 kg, 11.83 kg, 2.85 kg, and  2.25 kg, respectively. This has fully shown the improvement in  peasants' diet structure.    In terms of calorie and protein criteria, which are a common  practice in the world, the amount of energy taken in by Chinese  peasants has risen above the average for developing countries  and is close to the 2,630-kilocalorie [da ka 1129 0595] mark of  the world average. However, their quantity of energy and  protein taken from animal food is equal to those of the world's  low-income countries. This means that their diet structure still  awaits further improvement.    We cannot ignore drinking water when talking about food. In  1980, 500 million people in the nation's rural areas were  drinking water not meeting hygienic standards; among which, 150  million people drank contaminated ground water, 60 million of  them drank bitter and salt water, and 45 million of them drank  water containing high levels of fluorine. Fifteen years after  the inception of reform and opening up, the state, collectives,  and individuals have worked together and invested an  accumulation of 13.3 billion yuan (over 70 percent from  peasants) to build 330,000 waterworks around the country, and  one-third of the peasants now have access to tap water.    Despite the fact that millions of people in old liberated,  minority, border, and poor areas still need donated clothing  from other areas to pass the winter, an overwhelming majority of  peasants have resolved the clothing problem once and for all and  are beginning to set higher standards for their dress.    Presently, over 98 percent of peasants buy their clothes  from  markets. Those hand-woven cloths and hand-made printed calicos  of peasants, which used to be their articles of daily use, have  turned into valuable handicrafts because of their scarcity and  are found in stores.    With large and medium-sized cities as the centers, urban  residents' ideas about buying clothes are beginning to spread to  rural areas. A peasant in a Western suit is no longer something  new; the clothing and temperaments of those middle-age and young  peasants, who spend a long time at work and in business, are no  difference from those of urban citizens.    If we term the dress of peasants in villages of Guangdong,  Shanghai, and Beijing as a "suburban effect," the life of  Tibetans in the grasslands in western Sichuan should be more  convincing. On this great grassland, young Tibetans who become  prosperous from running businesses turn their fortunes into  clothes and ornaments they wear according to ethnic customs; it  is nothing new for young girls and boys to wear clothes or  ornaments worth over 10,000 yuan.    Speaking about the things they use, peasants' "dreams" were  limited before 1978 -- nothing but watches, bicycles, sewing  machines, and radios, or the so-called "three things that turn  and one thing that makes noise." Not many of them could turn  their dreams into reality then. Now that the "three things that  turn and one thing that makes noise" are within reach, they are  now called the "four old objects." Presently, every peasant  household has more than two watches or clocks and more than one  bicycle, whereas every two households have one sewing machine  and one radio around the country on average.    At the moment, the "seven new objects" have come into vogue  in rural areas; they are: televisions, electric fans,  videocassette recorders, refrigerators, washing machines,  cameras, and motorcycles. Over 60 percent of peasant households  around the country own televisions and electric fans; over 20  percent of them have videocassette recorders, whereas  motorcycles, refrigerators, washing machines, and cameras are  becoming prevalent in villages in economically developed areas.    As living standards are rising as a whole, peasants are more  and more willing to spend their money on cultural activities.  Acquiring literacy and scientific knowledge are becoming  conscious pursuits for peasants. In 1983, there was the news  that a peasant in Beijing's suburbs bought a piano. In 1984, 50  peasants in Hebei organized a tour to Japan at their own  expense. This year, a resort for peasants appeared in Guangdong  and some peasants used their money to buy automobiles, renovate  airports, and run postal agencies. Every piece of such news is  exciting. The peasants' world is becoming wider and their lives  richer.</p>

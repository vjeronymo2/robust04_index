			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Maxwell City adviser gives fund Pounds 50,000 WATSON'S, the actuarial consultancy firm that acted as adviser to the Maxwell Communication Corporation pension scheme, has donated Pounds 50,000 to the compensation scheme set up to aid the Maxwell pensioners. It is the first City firm to make a donation. The fund has received only one other donation so far, a Pounds 120,000 contribution from the National Association of Pension Funds. Mr Alan Chaplin, a partner, said the firm decided to make the donation after assurances that such a move would not imply any guilt or liability Sir John Cuckney, a leading City figure and former chairman of 3i, the venture capital group, has been seeking donations to the fund from firms that had dealings with Robert Maxwell. The scheme was set up nearly two months ago by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who said that those who had profited from their dealings with Maxwell should help to cover the shortfall in assets from pension schemes he controlled. More than Pounds 400m is missing from those schemes. Mr Chaplin said that Watson's first became aware of 'serious irregularities' in the MCC pension scheme on December 3 last year after a meeting it had sought with the pension scheme manager. Watson's immediately contacted the Occupational Pensions Board to advise them of the situation, he said. Watson's most recent actuarial valuation of the MCC pension scheme was made as of March 31 1988. Another was due to be completed as of March 31 last year, but while membership data required for the exercise had been received, information on assets had not. Watson's said that in addition to actuarial valuations, it advised MCC itself on matters such as the pensions aspects of sales and purchases of subsidiaries.</p>

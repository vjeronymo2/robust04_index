			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Ana coffee growers and professionals are  urging the Armed Forces to conduct an operation against gangs of  kidnappers and thieves that operate in that region, some of  which include mercenaries.    Families of the victims and farmers, who have paid large  sums  of money for their release, continue to receive threats and  letters in which they are warned "their days are numbered."  Some of those who were threatened showed EL DIARIO DE HOY a  letter signed by a certain "Commander Oscar," the self-styled  leader of the "New People's National Liberation Army." In the  letter "Commander Oscar" announces that starting next Monday a  new war will be waged against the coffee growers and landowners,  who will also have to pay a war tax of 2,000 colones per month.  Likewise, the criminals say they have a list of 400 persons who  will be kidnapped and warn people to be prepared.    The same sources report that gangs of former rebels who use  military weapons -- such as M-16 and AK-47 rifles, as well as  other weapons that were in vogue during the war -- operate in  the region. Because of this they doubt the police can do much to  stop them for two reasons: First, because the PNC [National  Civilian Police] does not have adequate equipment, and second,  because a large part of the police is made up of former FMLN  members.    They claim the gangs operate from the base of Santa Ana  volcano and that some are led by foreign mercenaries, because  black men and men with European traits have been spotted. A  column of men was seen near Lake Coatepeque a few days ago.  Former captives of these gangs say these men use olive-green  camouflage uniforms and tennis shoes. Also, they communicate by  radio with other gangs that operate in Cerro de Guazapa (San  Salvador), Los Naranjos (Sonsonate-Santa Ana), and San Miguel  volcano. They also claim the gangs have their own camps at the  entrance of Santa Ana volcano, in El Milagro ranch, and in other  places that are already known to the authorities.    One of those threatened sent the note from the presumed  "Commander Oscar" to Defense Minister General Humberto Corado.  He says he received a reply that the "peace accords" have  limited the role of the Armed Forces. As to the Army's  patrolling of the roads, the coffee growers say these steps are  not sufficient because the soldiers will not enter the coffee  plantations as they have been prohibited from doing so.    Among those kidnapped are Ricardo Planas, whose family paid  500,000 colones as ransom,; Mauricio Lopez Parker, 25,000;  Carmen Martinez, 30,000; Guillermo Martinez H., 30,000; Lola  Giammattei, 150,000; Ernesto Escobar Pacas, 125,000 colones,  among others. "Santa Ana is an inferno, because gangs of thieves  and kidnappers operate with complete impunity," they said in an  alarmed manner. A few days ago some distinguished ladies were  leaving the Santa Lucia Church, following a mass for Dona Alicia  Valiente de Hernandez, mother of Dr. Rene Hernandez Valiente,  and all were robbed of their belongings. Because of this, they  are asking President Alfredo Cristiani to authorize the Army to  conduct an operation to rid the zone of criminals because many  of the farms have been abandoned by their owners and overseers.    When General Corado was asked about this, he said the  institution is ready to obey any order issued by the commander  in chief of the Armed Forces, that is, by President Cristiani.</p>

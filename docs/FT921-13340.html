			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Restructuring at Coke bottler expected to bring Dollars 91m deficit COCA-COLA Enterprises (CCE), the leading US bottler of Coca-Cola, expects to report a 1991 loss of Dollars 91m as a result of a wide-ranging restructuring of its distribution network, writes Alan Friedman. The loss - which compares with a Dollars 93.4m net profit for 1990 - will be struck after Dollars 152m in 1991 restructuring charges, which were taken in the fourth quarter. The restructuring is part of a broader effort by Coca-Cola - which owns 44 per cent of CCE - and its bottling affiliates to consolidate the overblown US bottling system in order to achieve economies of scale. CCE, chaired by Mr Donald Keough, the president of Coca-Cola, controls about 55 per cent of the US soft drink maker's bottling system. The restructuring includes a reconfiguration of its sales and distribution centres, changes in its information systems and severance and relocation costs. CCE was merged with Johnston Coca-Cola Enterprises last year, in a deal which resulted in an after-tax gain of Dollars 18m for Coca-Cola on CCE shares. Hellenic Bottling Company (HBC), the Cypriot-controlled company which holds the Coca-Cola franchise for Greece and Ireland, has signed a joint venture agreement to produce Coca-Cola in Bulgaria, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. HBC is taking a 53 per cent stake in the venture with Texim 90, a bottling plant belonging to a union of co-operatives in Plovdiv which already produces Coca-Cola in small quantities. Similar agreements are being negotiated with four other soft drinks bottlers around Bulgaria. A company official said HBC would provide an injection of capital and would manage the plants. Its total investment is estimated at Dollars 25m over the next three years. HBC, which was listed on the Athens Stock Exchange last year, is forecasting earnings of Dr10bn (Dollars 55m) for 1991, a 30 per cent improvement on the previous year.</p>

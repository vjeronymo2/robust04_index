			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ELEPHANT JOINS THE RIDE-SHARE PARADE  </P> <P> Promoters of ride-sharing among Irvine Spectrum business complex workers are  using a live elephant this week to get their message across.  </P> <P> Adorned in tent-size signs proclaiming "Beastly commute?" and "Don't forget to  ride-share," the elephant named Speck is part of California Ride-share Week.  </P> <P> Orange County activities for Ride-share Week range from luaus in company  parking lots to competitions between rival firms.  </P> <P> "Well, if an elephant doesn't get people's attention, nothing will," said  Charity Gavaza, executive director of Spectrumotion, the Irvine Spectrum's  transportation management association.  </P> <P> More than 1.5 million pledge card-sweepstakes forms have been distributed  through major employers, which qualify car-poolers for prizes including trips  to Europe, Hawaii and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Commuters can pledge by calling the Orange County Transit District's Commuter  Network at (714) 636-RIDE.  </P> <P> Local firms have scheduled transportation fairs at their facilities, including  Lucky's in Buena Park, Disneyland in Anaheim, Hughes Aircraft Co. and the  Marriott Hotel, both in Newport Beach, ITT Cannon in Fountain Valley, Emulex,  State Farm Insurance and the Archive Corp., all of Costa Mesa, Humana Hospitals  of Huntington Beach, JVC Co. in Cypress, and Alpha Beta Markets in La Habra.  </P> <P> Most of the fairs will have representatives from bike shops, health and  wellness clinics and sporting goods stores, OCTD General Manager James P.  Reichert said.  </P> <P> "If everyone in Orange County stopped driving to work alone just one day each  week, we would reduce our freeway traffic congestion by 20%," Reichert said.  </P> <P> Caltrans and OCTD will continue to monitor ride-sharing on Wednesday "Keep  California Moving Day" to see if bus, van-pool and car-pool use increases.

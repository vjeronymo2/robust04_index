			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Inspections Improving Product Quality"] </F>   [Text] Intensified government supervision has effectively  improved product quality in the market, inspection officials  said yesterday.    Briefing reporters on product quality inspection work, the  State Bureau for Technical Supervision confirmed that China has  already established a comprehensive quality inspection system.    First initiated in 1985, the system covers inspection of  product design, sampling, data collection, specialist analysis,  publishing inspection results, and advising producers on quality  problems to improve and reexamination of products.    The inspection system now comprises 233 State-level quality  centres, more than 700 ministerial-level inspection centres, in  addition to 1,700 provincial or regional stations.    The centres and stations are responsible for regular and  irregular inspection, and have played a vital role in improving  product quality and protecting the legal interests of both the  consumers and producers, the bureau said.    Results have indicated that State inspections have produced  positive results in improving Chinese product quality.    Among the products checked in the last quarterly inspection  of 1993, 49 which were inspected before had better records than  21 products checked for the first time.    The average satisfactory rate of phosphate fertilizer  improved from 66 percent in 1989 to 81.9 percent last year,  while the average satisfactory rate of fire engines and drainage  pipes rose from 63 and 5 percent in 1991 to 80 and 82 percent.    Another typical example was the rapid improvement of  disposable infusion syringes, whose poor quality brought many  public complaints over past years.    In 1992, the satisfactory rate of these syringes was only 42  percent but last year it rose to 83 percent, thanks to  intensified quality inspection and improved production  management.</p>

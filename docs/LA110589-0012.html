			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: ALICE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN MALIBU  </P> <P> It looked for awhile as if the story was going to be "Alice Doesn't Live Here  Anymore."  </P> <P> About a year and a half ago, Alice's Restaurant, on the state-owned Malibu  Pier, announced that it was going to vacate its longtime waterside site. The  new holder of concessions for the pier had raised the rent, and the restaurant  was planning to move to a new, unspecified location. Since that time, though,  that concession holder has relinquished control of the facility -- and Alice's  is still in its original location, with no further plans to decamp.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, restaurant co-proprietor Peter Palazzo says he and his  partners are in the final stages of negotiating a 20-year lease for the site --  and simultaneously a deal by which they themselves would become concession  holders for the entire pier. (Palazzo's partners are Bob Yuro and Andre  Guerrero, through their Japedemy Inc., which owns both Alice's and Brio in  Tarzana.) "We haven't formulated all of our plans yet," says Palazzo, "but when  the deal is signed, there will be some necessary reconstruction of the whole  pier, with new retail facilities out at the end of it, including sportfishing  facilities of some kind.  </P> <P> "We'd also like to redo the restaurant, including the kitchen, and maybe add an  outdoor deck overlooking the water. There's been a restaurant on this spot  since at least the 1940s, since long before Alice's, and the structure has  really taken a beating over the years. We'd like to get it back to a style of  place that I think everybody would like to look at."  </P> <P> TEA WITH A TWIST: Cucumber sandwiches and petits fours aren't the only thing  you can eat with your tea in Los Angeles these days. Two new teatimes in town  offer some more interesting choices. City Restaurant on La Brea serves what  co-owner/chef Susan Feniger describes as "an Indian teatime menu," weekdays  from 3 to 5:45 p.m. That means homemade pooris, samosas and other Indian  delights -- plus a large selection of teas, loose, with nary a tea bag in  sight. . . . And Pane Caldo Bistrot in Beverly Hills serves tea Monday through  Saturday from 3:30 to 5 p.m., featuring not only assorted Italian-style sweet  cakes but also a selection of savory pastries flavored with walnuts,  prosciutto, or anchovies.  </P> <P> CONSIDER THE OYSTERS: The "Oysters on Ocean" festival starts today at Ocean  Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica, featuring the largest selection of oysters in  Southern California. About 10 varieties of oysters will be served on the  half-shell (Kumamoto, Olympia, Belon, Fanny Bay), plus several hot oyster-based  dishes (i.e., Hangtown Fry and oyster stew). The festival will run through the  end of the month.  </P> <P> DON'T CALL IT SPEEDO: San Francisco restaurant star (and proprietor of Stars  restaurant) Jeremiah Tower has renamed his new restaurant, from "Speedo 690" to  simply "690." Although Tower had drawn the original name from the Speedo  Carburetor Shop that used to occupy the premises, the Speedo swimwear company  had filed a copyright infringement complaint against him alleging misuse of  their trademarked moniker. Tower decided, he says, that he'd rather switch than  fight.  </P> <P> GAME PLAN: Trattoria Toscana in Brentwood features a selection of wild game  dishes, prepared Tuscan style, in addition to its regular menu, from Nov. 12 to  19.  </P> <P> CHANGES: Cafe Connection in Beverly Hills, which has featured some Brazilian  dishes in the past, and has catered numerous Brazilian-themed banquets around  town during the last two years, has gone 100% Brazilian -- serving dishes from  that country exclusively now, with live Brazilian music added on Thursday,  Friday, and Saturday. . . . David Cecchini, former chef at Genio's in Burbank  and at his own Cafe Casanova in Glendale, has gone into partnership with Leo  and Jane Damian to open Jane's Cucina Italia (which, somewhat strangely, means  "Jane's Italy Kitchen (or Cuisine)" at the Safari Hotel in Burbank . . . .  Giancarlo Zaretti has sold his 8-year-old Pontevecchio in Santa Monica. The new  proprietor is Mary Lou Barilla, whose family has owned several Italian  restaurants in Pittsburgh. She plans to refurbish the place and introduce a new  menu -- but Pontevecchio will remain open while the changes are in the works. .  . . Rex II Ristorante, downtown, has at least temporarily abandoned its  longtime (and unusual) policy of not opening for dinner until 7 p.m. Service  now starts at 6 p.m. Why? To accommodate diners who are going to see "Phantom  of the Opera" at the Music Center, says Rex boss Mauro Vincenti.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY OF NEWGRANGE STONES MAY BE IN THE STARS  </P> <P> Few places in Ireland are as mysterious as Newgrange, the ancient hilltop stone  chamber 30 miles north of Dublin in the Boyne Valley.  </P> <P> Newgrange, which dates from 2,000 BC, was built by the country's original  neolithic inhabitants. Unlike Stonehenge, the well-known series of  free-standing stones in England, Newgrange is an enclosed structure of  highly-decorated stones with an earthen roof.  </P> <P> It is accessible from Dublin in summer by daily bus service. The bus leaves  Dublin's Busaris Station on Amiens Street at 10 a.m. and returns at 6:30 p.m.  every day between May and September. The round-trip journey costs 10 Irish  (about $16 U.S.).  </P> <P> On my November visit there was no direct service to Newgrange, so I settled for  the morning bus to the nearest town, Slane, about five miles away.  </P> <P> I got off the bus a few blocks from the center of Slane, a picturesque town  with restful pubs and gracefully curved stone bridges that span the Boyne  River.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slane Castle  </P> <P> Across the street from the bus stop, Slane Castle peered out from behind  stately trees. Privately owned by Lord Henry Mountcharles, the castle has been  the site of Ireland's biggest summer concerts, including those of David Bowie,  the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Queen and Bruce Springsteen.  </P> <P> U2, Ireland's highly successful band, recorded its fourth album, "The  Unforgettable Fire," in a makeshift studio inside the castle. But on this  chilly, overcast morning, Slane was quiet.  </P> <P> As I walked up a lonely country road it began to rain. Cars passed infrequently  and I started to wonder if anything of real interest even existed in this  deserted countryside. While most of Ireland is well marked with directional  signs, few indicated the way to Newgrange.  </P> <P> More popular tourist attractions such as the Ring of Kerry and the Blarney  Stone lie in the opposite direction from Dublin.  </P> <P> As I walked a couple of more miles, the rain invaded my raincoat and penetrated  my clothing. I tried to shake off the chill, pulling my hood down over my  forehead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disc-like Promontory  </P> <P> What I saw in the field to my left sent a shiver along my spine. On top of the  gently rolling green field was a sight that I will never forget: a disc-like  promontory of land, outlined in white.  </P> <P> Newgrange was larger and more imposing than I had ever imagined. The stone  structure looked at once old and new, like a '50s sci-fi version of a flying  saucer.  </P> <P> The small visitor center at the entrance to Newgrange was staffed by a former  schoolteacher who now worked as a guide.  </P> <P> Surprised to see me arrive on foot, she explained that I was her first  English-speaking visitor of the day; she had had only French and German  tourists, who arrived by car.  </P> <P> As I entered the front gate she told me to explore the hill on my own and that  she would join me in a few minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Curved Earthen Roof  </P> <P> Rough white rocks, interspersed with occasional round black rocks, cover the  exterior of the 150-foot circular mound. The walls rise 15 feet from the ground  and then angle inward, where they join the curved earthen roof.  </P> <P> Newgrange is encircled by a series of rocks, 10 feet long and 3 feet high,  uniformly laid end to end to form a low wall around the structure. All these  large stones are intricately cut with repeated designs of concentric circles,  wavy lines and abstract images.  </P> <P> A few yards downhill from the entrance a series of standing stones, some as  high as 12 feet, stand like sentinels. Despite their rough surfaces the stones  seem to arch gracefully toward the sky, like young plants seeking the sun.  </P> <P> The cavelike entrance is covered by a large rock slab, with a small windowlike  opening directly overhead. A modern wooden stairway has been built to allow  access over the large stones to the entrance. Another modern addition is an  iron gate, which the former teacher had come to unlock for me.  </P> <P> Newgrange did not seem to be designed for tall people. I had to crouch to get  through a twisting, 50-foot passageway. In the very center of the structure the  ceiling vaulted up to a stone roof that was at least 20 feet high. It would  have been dark inside, except for one electric bulb.  </P> <P> The room had an eerie, unsettling quality. Despite the dim light it was easy to  see the deeply carved rock walls and ceiling that had many of the same designs  as the outside rocks. The structure had been built without the use of mortar or  support beams; the rocks had been carefully fitted together.  </P> <P> Newgrange faces toward the winter solstice that occurs Dec. 21. When the sun  rises on that date its rays shine through a small opening above the entrance  way and reach the stone floor in the center of the structure.  </P> <P> To its builder, these 20 minutes or so of light inside Newgrange signified the  start of winter. The other megalithic mounds face the sunrise (and in some  cases, moonrise) at its various solstices.  </P> <P> The people who built Newgrange remain a mystery. They obviously knew something  about astronomy and science and must have had some understanding of  mathematics.  </P> <P> It is believed that the intricate stone inscriptions at these sites are maps of  the sun, stars and planets.  </P> <P> Many designs occur in a series of 31, possibly representing the charting of the  sun or moon over a one-month period and forming an early stone calendar.  </P> <P> At one time Ireland had more than 100 similar structures in Ireland. Many  smaller mounds were destroyed by farmers clearing fields.  </P> <P> Newgrange, however, was undisturbed for thousands of years and is the best  preserved megalithic structure open to the public.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The national bus company of Ireland offers round-trip tours of the Boyne Valley  from Dublin through Oct. 12, Sundays and Thursdays. These tours include  Newgrange and Slane.  </P> <P> The Hill of Tara, southwest of Newgrange in Navan, is the ancient seat of the  high kings of Ireland and offers spectacular views. Today Navan, capital of  County Meath, is known for greyhound racing and a newly discovered zinc mine,  the largest in Europe.  </P> <P> In the area are ruins of many old monasteries and castles, as well as the  largest concentration of megalithic structures. Archeological research is in  progress at Knowth and Dowth, which are thought to be companion mounds to  Newgrange and will likely be open to the public next year.  </P> <P> On the return trip to Dublin the bus stops at Malahide Castle just north of  Dublin Airport. The castle is the ancestral home of the Bowe family, which lost  15 of its members in the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.  </P> <P> Two years ago the Bowe family gave the castle to Ireland, and it was turned  into the magnificent Irish National Portrait Gallery. Its oversize paintings of  Ireland's nobility of the 16th through 19th centuries are well suited to the  large halls of the castle, which is open daily. There is also a tearoom.  </P> <P> The Boyne River is known for its trout and salmon fishing, and the area offers  excellent hunting. There are some very good country-style hotels that have  provided accommodations for centuries.  </P> <P> The Headfort Arms Hotel in Kells, County Meath, is adjacent to Headfort House,  once the home of Lord Headfort. For a double room, the per-person price is  about $32.  </P> <P> In Slane, the Coyngham Arms Hotel is adjacent to Slane Castle and once served  as a guest house for the Coyngham (pronounced Cunningham) family. Double rooms,  with breakfast included, are about $24 a night, singles $29.  </P> <P> Both hotels are small, 12 bedroom lodges that are open year-round and offer a  taste of the aristocratic life.  </P> <P> For further information, contact the Irish Tourist Board, 757 3rd Ave., 19th  Floor, New York 10017.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rights curtailed In contrast to the late 1980s, there are not many company chairmen grumbling that their shares are undervalued. In a week when the FT-SE 100 index broke the 3,000 barrier, industrialists were distinctly downbeat. Companies which have reported recently have not shown much sign of economic upturn, and there are clearly risks that the September interim reporting season will be disappointing. There is also the possibility that companies will view the recent market rally as an opportunity to raise cheap equity through rights issues. Some Pounds 7bn was raised in the first half of the year, putting 1993 on course to top the record Pounds 10.7bn raised in 1991. Admittedly, the current quarter has been quiet, but that can be explained both by the summer lull and the backwash from the large BT3 and Zeneca issues. Yet the number of companies which may seize the opportunity is dwindling. Balance sheets have strengthened markedly since 1989 - average gearing has fallen from 36 per cent then to 22 per cent now. Of those which want funds, it seems that the only companies who have not had a rights issue are those who have had two. Banks passed up the opportunity this time, some insurers and property companies came in the first half and many of the consumer companies swinging back into fashion have no great need for funds. Cyclical engineers and some hotel and leisure companies remain the most likely candidates. Even those issues which do come seem unlikely to trouble the market. Interest rate cuts, rising gilts and a search for yield are driving shares hard, though the nervous may suspect too hard.</p>

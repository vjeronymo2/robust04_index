			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / A new world impasse: Ukraine is increasingly seen by the west as a 'spoiler' republic The Moscow Club, billed as America's first 'post-cold war thriller', posits a nightmare scenario: a passionate Ukrainian nationalist works his way to the top of the Kremlin and from there, with the help of some Americans, tries to topple the country's democratic leader in an effort to liberate Ukraine. In real life, of course, no one is concerned about a covert Ukrainian plot to destabilise the Russian government. But, from the vantage point of western, and particularly American, foreign policymakers, Ukraine is increasingly being seen as the 'spoiler' republic of the former Soviet Union which is jeopardising western efforts to aid reform in Russia. On a variety of issues - from nuclear disarmament to rescheduling the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union - Ukraine has stood in the way of agreements preferred by both the west and Russia. The sorest point - Ukraine's hesitation over nuclear disarmament, and its reluctance to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1), has come to the fore this week. Warren Christopher, US secretary of state yesterday discussed the problem of Ukraine's nuclear weapons at a meeting in the Kremlin. Mr Strobe Talbott, the top US policymaker on the former Soviet Union, will visit Kiev at the weekend to step up pressure on Ukrainian leaders to ratify the Start 1 treaty. The irony is that Ukraine has no desire to become what one western diplomat in Kiev only half-jokingly described as 'the North Korea on the edge of Europe'. Ukraine's natural political orientation is towards Europe. However, the west risks undermining Ukrainian aspirations through what the government sees as an exclusive focus on Russia and lack of sympathy over Kiev's national security concerns. Some officials in Kiev fear Moscow will try to regain control over Ukraine, having ruled it for more than 350 years before 1991. They argue that the west, concerned that Ukraine might upset the network of international disarmament treaties, is more inclined to join forces with Russia in an effort to pressure Ukraine. 'I don't think this (the nuclear issue) is a real problem, but the world community, and most of all the US, is helping to create a real problem,' said Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian prime minister. The real problem, he says, is that the 'west is indifferent as to whether we are independent'. Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, a senior political adviser to the Ukrainian president, adds: 'There are forces in Russia which will never reconcile themselves to Ukrainian independence and will force any Russian government to put pressure on Ukraine.' Ukrainian officials have reason to be concerned. The Russian parliament and the vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi, continue to express territorial claims towards Ukraine. Moscow has refused to sign a treaty with Kiev recognising its neighbour's borders as inviolable. Russia's ambassador to Ukraine has gone so far as to say said that Ukrainian independence is an ephemeral stage, unlikely to last more than 18 months. The US has appeared unsympathetic to Ukraine's fears about Russia and has been much more concerned about nuclear arms. Washington fears that if the Ukrainian parliament fails to ratify Start 1, last year's Lisbon protocol which covers the 46 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed in Ukraine but not included in the treaty, and refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the network of international disarmament accords could unravel. 'The whole arms control structure that we have worked on for 20 years will fall down,' says one US official. America's reaction to the foot-dragging in Kiev has been, as another US diplomat puts it, 'to beat up on Ukraine'. American diplomats and technical advisers to the Ukrainian government say Washington is considering a freeze on existing funding, such as financing for privatisation auctions. This tough American stance is playing into the hands of Ukrainian hardliners who hope to retain nuclear weapons. The west gives Ukraine little financial assistance and thus has little leverage. But the perception of growing western hostility is making Ukrainians feel beleaguered, and strengthening pro-nuclear sentiment. Although President Kravchuk is committed to a non-nuclear Ukraine, he faces an increasingly tough battle in pushing the treaties through parliament where a minority pro-nuclear lobby could force a stalemate. As a result, it is increasingly likely that the legislature will fudge the issue. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and a power-broker in Ukrainian politics, is putting together a compromise: Ukraine would ratify the Start treaty, but delay ratification of the Lisbon protocol and accession to the NPT. Such a deal would leave the 46 ICBMs on Ukrainian soil for an unspecified interim period before they are destroyed. Yet why should Ukraine retain a few dozen long-range nuclear missiles, which Mr Pavlychko admits would be of little military value? The missiles have symbolic importance, he says: 'It is like having a gun displayed on your wall. It may have no bullets but when your neighbour comes to dinner he is afraid of it.' To avoid painting Ukraine into an anti-western corner, some American foreign-policy specialists are counselling a shift in approach. Mr Zbigniew Brezinski, a former head of the National Security Council, has been the most prominent advocate of a two-pronged strategy in which America would continue to back reforms in Russia but simultaneously forge a closer relationship with Kiev. Winning Ukraine's friendship could be simple: Ukrainian leaders are pragmatic enough not to expect admission into bodies such as Nato or the EC anytime soon. What they want is to be treated as a significant regional power - a desire which could be satisfied by including Ukraine in American - Russian arms talks, for example - and to receive economic aid, such as balance of payments support to help the economy adjust to paying world prices for Russian oil. For now, American policymakers reject such an approach because they fear it might antagonise Moscow. Many US officials still hope that Ukraine will fall under the sway of a democratic, reformist, Russia. But that is not an acceptable option for Ukraine's leadership. The west thus faces a dilemma: it can either choose to develop a stronger relationship with an independent Ukraine, and risk the continuation of regional tensions with Russia, or it can rebuff Ukrainian aspirations and leave a nuclear power to seek allies where it can find them.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Complacency breeds contempt - The Environmental Protection Agency's inability to solve the US's pollution problems is losing it the respect of everyone Since the day he took office as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1989, William Reilly has been caught in the crossfire between competing enthusiasts. On one side are the environmentalists who see the EPA as inexcusably slow at implementing hard-won laws to protect the nation's land, water, and air. On the other is much of the business lobby and the anti-regulatory zealots in the White House, ardently battling a nightmare of costly paperwork and pollution control requirements. International attention focused on the clash between the adversaries at the Rio Earth Summit, where Reilly sought to save face for Bush, who is finding his claim to be 'the environmental president' increasingly ridiculed. A White House leak of a Reilly memo on discussions over a biodiversity treaty killed all chances of compromise. It was in character for Reilly to attempt a settlement in Rio where the overwhelming sentiment was on the side of the environmentalists. In his years as president of the Conservation Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund, two leading conservation groups, he built a reputation as a conciliator, and he brought to the EPA his bias towards negotiation rather than confrontation. It is in character for Bush to try to appeal to both sides of the debate, wrapping himself in the flags of environmentalism and anti-regulatory activism at the same time. In the controversy over preserving the Northern Spotted Owl at the expense of logging jobs, he explained his position in typical fashion: 'We want to save the little furry feathery guy and all of that, but I don't want to see 40,000 loggers thrown out of work.' Reilly's moderation has disappointed many environmentalists who had hoped for a champion rather than a middleman at the EPA. They believe it is his job to represent environmental causes in the administration's inner councils where business interests are supported by the Energy and Commerce Departments and Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness. With 17,000 employees - about 15 per cent of whom are political appointees - the EPA has a 22-year track record. Created by Richard Nixon in 1970 when environmentalism was in its infancy as a political force, the agency was a composite of federal regulatory groups welded together to attack the degradation of the nation's resources. Since then Congress has passed a series of far-reaching laws to protect air and water quality, to control pesticides and toxic substances, and to clean up wastes. However, the regulatory process which has developed to implement the laws is appallingly complicated. Usually on the orders of Congress - which has taken to mandating deadlines to speed the rulemaking process along - the EPA proposes a regulation, takes public and other agency comments, holds public hearings and proclaims a final regulation. The rules are challengeable in court, and in the litigious society of the US today, three-quarters of the regulations get challenged. At the very least, the court action adds about 18 months to the process, so that it takes the agency at least two years to create a regulation. Jim Bovard, a former analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, says the EPA creates rules which give the agency more power over industry and the US economy than is justified. Legislation requires thousands of pages of regulations and stacks of paperwork; an Eastman-Kodak application for a permit to handle hazardous waste was seven feet tall. With the need to appear to be doing something about the economy, the White House deregulators increasingly have been getting the upper hand in disputes with the EPA. Last month, Bush ruled in favour of the Council on Competitiveness to allow companies which buy 'emissions allowances' to increase their toxic air pollution by up to 80,000 pounds a year without notifying the public. Rick Hind, legislative director for Greenpeace's toxics campaign, expresses his frustration with an administration which still claims to be environmentally conscious. 'Bush will crow about the Clean Air Act, but he can't make up his mind. He wants to be the environmental president but he doesn't want to protect the environment.' Senator Max Baucus, one of the forces behind the Clean Air Act, in March released a stinging indictment of the administration. Critical regulations had been languishing for months at the White House along with overdue regulations controlling 189 toxic chemicals. 'Rules that implement the pollution control requirements in the Act are being stalled, weakened and quashed while rules that provide exemptions, waivers or bail-outs move quickly,' the senator said. Even the attempts Reilly makes to push the administration on environment get little appreciation. 'Reilly was brought in to put a pretty face on the agency, but lately the EPA has been getting even worse than during the Reagan years,' Hind says. Somewhere in a corner of EPA is William Sanjour, a 'whistle blower' who has served the agency for 20 years and has been isolated by his superiors for calling attention to the agency's failings. The administrator, he says, is invariably a 'team player' who 'can make all the speeches he wants about cutting down Brazilian forests and environmental ethics, but he must not do anything to make waves.' Sanjour says employees who like to see 'concrete results' do not last long at EPA. 'When it comes to drafting and implementing rules for environmental protection, getting results means making enemies of powerful and influential people,' he said. 'No, they don't usually get fired, but they don't get advanced either, and their responsibilities are transferred to other people and they usually leave the agency in disgust. 'The kind of people who get ahead are those clever ones who can be terribly busy while they procrastinate, obfuscate and can consistently come up with sufficiently plausible reasons for not accomplishing anything.' Sanjour talks about one deadline for action after another missed with little notice. Enforcement cases against influential polluters are started, not by the EPA, but by a combination of environmental organisations, the media or local citizens, he said. It often takes years of badgering before the agency will act. When fines are ultimately imposed, they are less than the polluter earned by breaking the law. Another agency critic, Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, insists that the EPA 'wildly misspends its resources' and is entirely driven by politics. 'It pursues issues that get them on page one,' he said. 'If there is a public outcry about something, it jumps and solves the problem whether the science is good or not.' The agency's own independent science advisory board issued a report saying that its most pressing concerns are given the least amount of attention while the most unimportant are given the most, Taylor said. The EPA itself admits to a 'mixed' record of accomplishments, but its critics say the most noteworthy gains have come on the heels of court rulings which required it to act. Although the car and human populations have grown, the air has become cleaner. Substantial progress has been made in phasing out sulphur dioxide emissions, but emissions of nitrogen oxides have grown. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions have dropped by 28 per cent and 38 per cent respectively, but 110 urban areas failed to meet the national ozone standards set for 1989. While many waterways have been cleaned through wastewater treatment and controls on industrial plants, toxic chemicals are a continuing problem. Fish have returned to some lakes and rivers, but they are disappearing from others. Population pressures are increasing the sources of pollution and at the same time leading to increased demand for clean water. Polluters are now considered not only harmful and irresponsible but criminal, and enforcement has improved. The EPA is now focusing on prevention of pollution; efforts are being made to redesign manufacturing processes, substitute harmful materials for less dangerous ones and recycle wastes. 'Most people in the environmental community would say the EPA is not strong enough,' says Blake Early, director of the pollution and toxics programme at the Sierra Club. 'But relative to other environmental agencies around the world, the EPA is probably doing a reasonable job.'</p>

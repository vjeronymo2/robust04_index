			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Employment Minister Michel Giraud by Gerard </F> Desportes, place and date not given: "The Employment Act --  Michel Giraud Maintains Course on Turbulent Sea" -- first  paragraph is LIBERATION introduction]    [Text] Employment Minister Michel Giraud will no doubt have  a difficult time this afternoon in Parliament. "His" five-year  Employment Act is to be attacked by both opposition, which has  filed a motion of censure against the government's employment  policy, and majority representatives. To be sure, the act  remains in force; a new decree to implement the new measures is  expected within a week. A few days after the withdrawal of the  CIP [job training contract] Michel Giraud speaks out and reacts  to the criticisms on his bill, while opposition from unions and  employers remains strong.    [Desportes] Today the opposition will attempt to "censure"  your five-year Employment Act. How do you feel about this  avalanche of criticisms both from the Left and the Right?    [Giraud] Beyond the CIP, there is a combination of several  factors. The various economic partners even have more  reservations now than they used to have about anything that  questions tradition and habits. Odd as it may seem, there is  precious little acceptance when it comes to adjusting policies  and resources to a world that changes every day. On the other  hand, waiting for a return to growth obviously makes people even  more impatient. Finally, the impending presidential election  has intensified rivalries. So I'm facing a more or less  permanent state of confusion which, it seems to me, too often  lacks serenity and objectivity. I repeat that my goal is to  channel all my energy into the fight against unemployment. And  although I think that criticisms are often unjustified, I will  not let them prevent me from pursuing the mission I have been  entrusted with by Edouard Balladur.    [Desportes] What if you could do things all over again?    [Giraud] There are two mistakes I readily acknowledge. The  message from the National Assembly's Social Affairs Commission  was clear and strong enough that more heed should have been paid  to it. Second, insufficient explanations were given, which  complicated matters. I do say explanations, not consultation,  because there was never such a thing as the bombshell mentioned  by some people. We provided the economic players with all the  information they needed.    [Desportes] Will the CIP affair slow down the implementation  of the five-year act?    [Giraud] I will be even more cautious as a result of it, but  the act will not, repeat not, be put on the back burner. It  brings many solutions which we sorely need with regard to the  organization of labor: preserving work contracts, giving  businesses more flexibility, but also giving employees more  freedom to choose their own lifestyle.    [Desportes] On this issue, there will be three major  criticisms when the act's "working time" section is implemented.  The first has to do with the annualization of working time.  Are you still willing, as a tradeoff, to grant a reduction of  working hours?    [Desportes] I would remind you that before the bill was  voted we had agreed that an annualization of working time would  be linked with reduced working hours. This was a formal request  by the CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], which  employers agreed to. The idea was to negotiate the cuts. This  is what was voted in Article 38 of the Act, which provides for  an easier shift to annualized working time by businesses, but  also requires them to reduce the overall work time. Let me  repeat this: It requires them to reduce work time.    [Desportes] The CGT [General Confederation of Labor] and FO  [Workers' Force] condemn the fact that you are making working  time more flexible.    [Giraud] One issue has to do with integrating a training  component into the job. A young worker can expect to switch  occupations three of four times in the course of a lifetime.  How can an employee be expected to adjust to new activities  without being given the time to prepare for them? Second issue:  There is a demand for more time to be reserved for leisure and  family life. Therefore we need to rethink the structure of work  life. We also are terribly behind in terms of part-time work,  especially with respect to the female population. In short, I  consider that a shift to annualized work arrangements which  leads to a reduction in working hours deserves some effort on  the part of the economic players. I would add that everything  will be negotiated between employers and unions.    [Desportes] Critics also condemn the annualization of  part-time work which you pushed through Parliament. Do you want  to turn these people into intermittent workers?    [Giraud] The act includes a series of safeguards. Here,  too, consultations will have to be held within companies. This  measure will not be an arbitrary one. In the catering sector,  for example, this arrangement will make it possible to pay  employees, who were paid only six or seven times per year, on a  monthly basis. From the point of view of the company,  annualized part-time work increases the flexibility it needs to  adjust to the current context.    [Desportes] Third criticism, unions believe that, due to all  these measures, overtime will become a thing of the past, since  working hours are now viewed over a year instead of a week.    [Giraud] Wrong. But I do recognize that the relevant  article (Art. 42) is not all that easy to understand. Overtime  payments on top of a regualar salary remain possible, but  compensation time arrangements will be improved. However, it  will be made more difficult for companies to have employees work  overtime. One needs to know what one wants -- what we want is  to create jobs.    [Desportes] Do you expect tangible results of the "working  time" section?    [Giraud] Of course. First of all, a reduction of working  hours so that a number of unemployed can find a job. Second, an  incentive to negotiate, including within small- and medium-sized  businesses. I am perfectly aware that there are objections on  various levels. We must find ways to overcome them, but, on the  other hand, unfounded accusations must stop.    [Desportes] Nevertheless, such objections are numerous, for  example with respect to weekend labor. When will the new  measures come into force?    [Giraud] This is not a measure that is part of the act, but  of one that dates back to 1982. On this subject, I am prepared  to allow enough time for sector-by-sector negotiations. As for  the act, I said that the regulations would be ready on 31 March,  and they are; however, the government has decided to wait before  introducing them so that consultation and explanation may  continue.    [Desportes] You said that you did not want to be the  "minister of 4 million jobless people": Do you still stick to  this statement?    [Giraud] Indeed. But one must understand that the five-year  act is based on an overall approach. I therefore do not intend  to single out one particular measure. I did say that I hoped  that 400,000 jobs would be created in the course of one year  from the moment the act was completely implemented. This  estimate must be viewed in relation with the level of economic  activity. I would also like to say that tangible results can  already be seen right now. Apprenticeship and mixed teaching  and training formulas are booming; part-time work and gradual  preretirement schemes have preserved a number of jobs. Compared  with last year, the unemployment rate has slowed down  considerably. I believe that the increase in unemployment is  about to come to a standstill.</p>

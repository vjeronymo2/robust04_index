After the meeting, the Slovenian diplomat told journalists  that Prime Minister Pawlak had expressed interest in closer  cooperation with Slovenia, in particular in the economic field.  According to Peterle, both sides spoke in favor of strengthening  economic cooperation in the whole of Central Europe, at the same  time admitting that there was still a lot to be done "with  regard to economic reforms."    The Slovenian minister confirmed the willingness to conclude  an agreement on free trade with Poland. Slovenia already  concluded similar agreements with the Czech Republic and  Slovakia and will soon sign one with Hungary. "It seems that the  expansion of the free trade zone is necessary, as it makes our  access to the European Union easier," he said.    Peterle announced that Polish-Slovenian political  cooperation  would concentrate on the forum of the Central-European  Initiative. He said that there were good foundations for this  cooperation, as both states had similar views on Europe and the  issue of security.</p>

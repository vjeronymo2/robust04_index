			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Gusyakov, head of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F> "documents department," under "KURYER Documents" rubric: "What  KURYER Carries"]    [Text] In accordance with an edict of the Russian  president, normative acts of central organs of state management  are published for the first time only in ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI. Moreover, documents registered by the Ministry of  Justice but not published in our newspaper do not entail legal  consequences and are deemed not to have come into legal force.  The reader of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI can find in the pages of the  KURYER weekly supplement normative acts of Russian Federation  ministries and departments which have undergone state  registration. Before all other newspapers KURYER notifies  Russians of the most recent changes to tax legislation, informs  them of the procedure for floating shares, privatizing, and  buying and selling private and state property, and publishes  banking regulations, customs tariffs, and examples of  departmental documentation.    Economic leaders, jurists, representatives of commercial  structures, employees of financial and tax establishments and  law enforcement organs, and also ordinary citizens whose rights,  freedoms, and legitimate interests we are entrusted with  representing by presidential edict can find in KURYER the  answers to many topical questions, particularly those concerning  the regulation of market mechanisms. KURYER has become their  reliable guide in the legal and economic area which changes  rapidly day by day. KURYER also ensures very prompt access to  the "hottest" exclusive information from the norm-creating  kitchen of ministries and departments. In short, those people  who have not yet made out their subscription have an opportunity  in the new year to think once again about their choice of  publication. Those who have not had time to do this today will  not be too late to do so tomorrow.</p>

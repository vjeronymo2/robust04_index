			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Rural Finland holds out against EU: Finnish farmers have a worse deal with Brussels than the Germans and Danes Mr Vesa Rantala farms 40 boggy hectares carved out of the Finnish forest by his great-grandfather. Like the vast majority of Finland's agricultural community, he is going to vote No in Sunday's referendum on joining the European Union. He expresses his opposition with a farmer's characteristic bluntness. 'The deal with Brussels on Finnish farming is crazy,' Mr Rantala declares, raising his voice to be heard above the noisy lowing of his small herd of dairy cows, already brought inside the cattle shed for the long Nordic winter. Although opinion polls signal the outcome on Sunday will be a yes to EU membership, the determined opposition of Mr Rantala and his fellow farmers has formed the core of a no campaign which has unsettled the pro-EU political establishment in Helsinki. Farmers make up only 7 per cent of Finland's 2m workforce and agriculture accounts for less than 3 per cent of economic output. But their influence extends far beyond the limits suggested by such figures in a country where more than 35 per cent of the 5m population still live in rural areas and many more believe it is important to avoid rural depopulation, in part to protect the nation's security on its long border with Russia. The farm community is the bedrock of support for the Centre party, which under the leadership of Mr Esko Aho, the present prime minister, became the country's biggest political party in the last general election and leads the ruling coalition government. The party is split over the issue and several senior party figures are campaigning for a no vote. The angry opposition to the EU by the farmers, orchestrated by their union, the MTK, is therefore the most serious obstacle facing the government, and the main opposition Social Democratic party, in their efforts to win Sunday's referendum. What makes the farming issue awkward is a feeling among many Finns - even those who do not believe the EU vote should be decided on agriculture - that the EU farm deal is unfair on Finland. Under the terms for Finland's accession to the EU, the Union rejected Helsinki's demand that the whole country be treated as a special agricultural case because of its severe Arctic and sub-Arctic climate. Instead, a complex map was drawn up dividing the country into areas which qualified for differing grades of agricultural and regional subsidies and support. The majority of the country qualifies at least as a so-called Less Favoured Area, or LFA, eligible for subsidies on a per-hectare basis on top of normal EU price support. But 15 per cent of Finland - the most southerly regions where most of the country's cereal and vegetable production is based - does not qualify. Mr Rantala's farm, in the district of Elimaki about 110km north-east of Helsinki, falls some 15km outside the LFA limit. This means that he does not qualify for any extra subsidies, despite the fact that thousands of farms in more productive regions of the EU well to the south of southern Finland do fall within LFAs. The MTK says its studies show that farms in LFA-designated regions of Germany may receive up to three-times the EU subsidy available to farmers like Mr Rantala, despite having land with average cereal yields  - at almost 7 tonnes per hectare - twice as high as in Finland. This is because their higher yields trigger higher payments under the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme and they receive LFA payments. 'This is the problem,' says Mr Rantala, a Centre party local councillor whose 40 hectares is divided between pasture, hay and cereals. 'When they are sowing spring seed, our land is still snowbound. We cannot sow until May. The quality of our soil and climate is so different. It is ridiculous that I am put on a worse basis than farmers in Germany and Denmark.' The other furious complaint by the MTK is over the EU insistence that Finland must adjust immediately on joining the union next January to the CAP price regime - and open its previously restricted market to agricultural imports from the rest of the community. With the EU already under strong international pressure to cut its existing price supports, Finland can hardly expect to escape reforms of an agricultural system even more heavily subsidised than the Union's. But as Finland has maintained producer prices at levels up to 60 per cent higher than those prevailing in the EU, this implies a big shock for Finnish farmers. The government in Helsinki has negotiated the right to soften the impact through a five-year programme of transitional aid worth FM4bn (Pounds 500m) next year. But farmers complain it is still not clear how this will be implemented and they say that, in any case, they will face reductions in income of between 10-45 per cent next year, depending on where their farms are located. Mr Rantala says the average price he receives now for the 113,000 litres of milk he produces per year - his chief source of revenue - is FM2.70 per litre. The EU price, he says, is around FM1.90 per litre. He does not yet know for sure what price he will get if Finland joins the union. 'We had the minister of agriculture up here last week and he promised decisions. But it's still not clear. None of the figures seem final. I don't know what the price will be on January 1, but I have to vote on Sunday.'</p>

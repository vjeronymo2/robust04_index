			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States maintains its hopes that progress  can be achieved on the confidence-building measures, but doubts  whether this progress can be achieved by the end of April, as  stipulated in the latest report from UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and the Security Council's letter to the secretary  general. This position was expressed by a U.S. official to a  CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent in New York.    In the meantime, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's  special coordinator on Cyprus, will meet Saturday [23 April]  with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, to review the proximity talks on the  confidence-building measures. The meeting will take place in  view of Clark's visit to Nicosia next week.</p>

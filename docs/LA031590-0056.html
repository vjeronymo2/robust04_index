			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP CASE  </P> <P> Richard Reeves claims he was trained as a mechanical engineer and respect for  numbers is his "professional religion." He might have written a better column  about Northrop if he had been well-trained as a reporter, with a respect for  facts (Op-Ed Page, March 2).  </P> <P> He might have avoided smearing "a lot of engineers" at Northrop and elsewhere  if he had reported that the failure to perform certain tests was the failure of  three or four people, as the record shows; that when Northrop discovered what  they had done, they were fired; that Northrop promptly disclosed the problem to  the public and reported in great detail to the military services using the  equipment; that Northrop offered to redo the tests and repay the government for  the cost of the tests what weren't performed. Reeves might also have been less  alarmed and alarming if he had reported that both armed services have found the  equipment is operating satisfactorily.  </P> <P> The company pleaded guilty because under the law it accepted responsibility for  the unauthorized and unacceptable acts of three or four of its employees --  even though they had acted on their own, and even though it had fired them  nearly three years before when their behavior was discovered.  </P> <P> If Reeves had a respect for facts as well as numbers he might also have  reported that the government's decision, once it had achieved agreement on a  guilty plea, to call a halt finally to a number of criminal investigations it  had dragged on for years was endorsed by a federal court. If Reeves had a  respect for words, he could not have falsified information to proclaim, as he  did without substantiation, that the company overcharged the government on the  Stealth bomber. Had he not been so mechanically engineering in his diatribe, he  might have considered the possibility that it was precisely this lack of  substantiation for these and other issues that led the government to stop its  investigations, and led the federal court to agree.  </P> <P> More than 40,000 men and women work at Northrop around the country. They work  hard, and responsibly and with justifiable pride in their achievements in  delivering quality products to our military services. They have every right to  be outraged at what the acts of a few individuals might have caused, and what  those acts did cause for their company and their reputations. And they have an  equal right to be outraged at Reeves' willingness to throw away the facts in  favor of a few false phrases, and, indeed, at The Times' willingness to print  them.  </P> <P> LES DALY  </P> <P> Senior Vice President  </P> <P> Public Affairs  </P> <P> Northrop, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.P.: "Rightism--Statehood"] </F>   [Text] "We can free Croatia of the burden of fascism, but  it is impermissible to say that we want to free it of the burden  of Ustashism, because the meaning of Ustashism and Rightism is  the creation of a Croatian state," said Ante Prkacin, member of  the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] and Assembly deputy, at a formal  forum that was organized by the HSP's Split branch on Saturday  on the occasion of 10 April. Emphasizing that the NDH  [Independent State of Croatia] had extraordinary significance  for the Croatian people, which gained its own state after 830  years, Prkacin emphasized that how 10 April was treated today  was very important, because Croatia was in the most unfavorable  position of all the newly independent states, since it  controlled the least of its own territory, and to a considerable  extent the international community was deciding its future.    "The key thing is whether Croatia will occupy a place among  the countries of Western civilization, or whether it will stop  half way and resemble the South American banana republics," said  Prkacin, recalling that the NDH disappeared because of the new  world order, but also because of the romanticism of the Croatian  communists who are called antifascists today, and he emphasized  that certain lessons should be learned from 10 April, because  the NDH knew who its friends were and who its enemies were.    Tomislav Opacak, member of the HSP's Headquarters, presented  a report on the subject of "The Truth About 10 April and the  NDH," asserting that the NDH was the result of the will of the  Croatian people, and not of Italy and Germany. "The Croatian  people's struggle was a necessary defense," Opacak said,  emphasizing that the Ustasha movement was not anti-Semitic,  since there were Jews among high NDH officials, and he concluded  the report with the words: "As long as there is no deed without  a defect, we cannot blink over an action like the NDH and 10  April."</p>

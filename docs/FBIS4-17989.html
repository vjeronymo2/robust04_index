			<p>BFN     [Text] A border demarcation agreement between Kazakhstan  and China crowns their bilateral ties, Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev declared at farewell ceremony for the  Chinese Premier Li Peng in Alma Ata [Almaty] Thursday [28 April].    "Not a single former USSR state, including Russia, has  legally demarcated frontiers with China," Nazarbayev stressed.    In his opinion, the bilateral accords on transport give  Kazakhstan access to all Chinese provinces and to Central Asia.  He spoke highly of his talks with Li Peng on global issues, on  the situation in CIS, and on Kazakh-Chinese relations.    He called fruitful the exchange of reform-making experience,  which has, as he put it, an Asian flavor. Nazarbayev was  pleased with Li Peng's support of his initiatives to build up  trust and set up a common market in Asia.</p>

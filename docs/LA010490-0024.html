			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAFFITTE IS FINALLY ON A ROLL, AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR USIU  </P> <P> Demetrius Laffitte, who is called "D-Train" by his U.S. International  basketball teammates, is back on track.  </P> <P> Laffitte, who led USIU in scoring and rebounding last season, has things going  again after a slow start. And that is exactly what the Gulls will need if they  are going to get back in the season. Laffitte scored 23 points on 10-of-12  shooting Wednesday night to help lead the Gulls to a 102-77 rout of Central  Connecticut State at Golden Hall.  </P> <P> Kevin Bradshaw, the fifth-leading scorer in the country, had 35 points and  Steve Smith added 26 for USIU (6-10). Kevin Swann scored 20 points to lead  Central Connecticut State (1-9).  </P> <P> Laffitte had 17 points in the first half as the Gulls took a 45-32 lead. They  never trailed, and the closest Central Connecticut State could get in the  second half was 50-41. Coach Gary Zarecky then put the starters back in, and  USIU easily pulled away for the victory.  </P> <P> Laffitte was a Street &amp; Smith preseason independent All-American for  1989-90 but was averaging 15.3 points per game and shooting just 57% from the  free throw line after USIU's first 11 games.  </P> <P> In his past five games, Laffitte is averaging 22 points, shooting 70% from the  field and 78% from the line. He is also leading the team in rebounding for the  season with nine per game. Against Central Connecticut State, he had eight  rebounds, four assists, two steals and a blocked shot.  </P> <P> "He is the key to our winning," Zarecky said. "We're having to learn to play  with Kevin (Bradshaw). Last year our chemistry was such that we didn't have the  so-called superstar. Kevin, in turn, has to get his teammates involved,  especially Demetrius. We're going to need a solid Demetrius to win on the  road."  </P> <P> That is where the Gulls have seven of their remaining 13 games.  </P> <P> Laffitte was not coming up with these kinds of complete performances at the  beginning of the season.  </P> <P> "I felt there was a lot of pressure on me," Laffitte said. "I wasn't  concentrating. I was just coming out here and playing. I thought everything  would fall for me."  </P> <P> Very little fell, except perhaps for Laffitte's scoring and rebounding  averages.  </P> <P> "I'm coming out of it right now," said Laffitte, who played at Monte Vista High  School. "Well, I am out of it."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Invitation to Democratic Governments </F> To Recognize the Will of the Albanian People"]    [Text] Istanbul, April -- Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime  minister of the republic of Kosova, spoke at the Balkan  Conference held in Istanbul on 7-10 April. We publish here the  closing section of his speech at this meeting that was attended  by many statesmen from the Balkan countries and at which the  main topics were Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosova.    ``... What do the Kosovars want? Nothing more and nothing  less than to be allowed to freely exercise their will as a  people. The Kosovars ask to realize their aspirations in a  peaceful way. A peaceful movement of this kind is something new  in the Balkans and, if it brings results, can only increase the  hopes of the Balkan peoples for a brighter future. It will be a  clear and fair sign that conflicts even in the Balkans can be  solved in a civilized manner before resorting to force.    "Many people suggest that the Kosovars should accept  autonomy, similar to that created in 1974. Those who support  this idea seem to forget that such a thing was tried in the  past. It did not work. The Serbian regime succeeded in revoking  Kosova's autonomy even at a time when Yugoslavia possessed a  complex structure that all the constitutive people might have  hoped would protect them. Autonomy would now be entirely in the  hands of Serbia."  <H5>  To Ask For Autonomy for the Kosovars Is To Ask Them To </H5> Remain Under Greater Serbia    ``To suggest autonomy for Kosova is as if to ask Slovenia to  return to what used to be called Yugoslavia, to ask Croatia to  forget the war visited upon it by the Serbian aggressor, its  cities turned to dust and ashes like Vukovar, the bombardment of  Dubrovnik, and the forced migrations, and to return to  Yugoslavia. To ask Kosova to accept autonomy is as if to ask  Bosnia to forget its 200,000 dead, its thousands upon thousands  of women raped, and the millions of people ethnically cleansed,  and to return to Yugoslavia. Those who suggest autonomy for  Kosova must realize clearly that this is the same as asking the  Kosovars to remain under Greater Serbia, under Serbian  dictatorship, always oppressed, persecuted, harassed in every  possible way, and treated as a colony. Those who suggest  autonomy only show that they are not ready to grapple with the  regime of a dictator.    ``The people of Kosova are not asking for independence just  like that. Their case is not simply one of secessionism. The  state of which they are once a part has disintegrated and no  other state that may subsequently arise can incorporate them  within its borders against their will. When the problems in  Yugoslavia started, Kosova asked simply for equality. All that  Kosova asks now is to enter as an equal partner into  negotiations and for a satisfactory solution to be found. What  is wrong with equality? The Serbs should never be frightened of  equality. The demands of the Albanians of Kosova are in no way  directed against the Serbs, and are not directed against Serbian  cultural monuments, or against Serbian civilization, in spite of  the fact that it has been these same Serbs who, in the last two  or three years, have mercilessly destroyed the civilization of  non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, and elsewhere.    ``The Albanians of Kosova do not possess the argument of  force. They cannot compel the international community to take  sufficient measures against Serbia. Nevertheless, we insist on  certain steps that the international community should urgently  take.    ``One step that must be taken immediately, in our view, is  to  tighten the international sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro, and to make the eventual lifting of these sanctions  conditional upon achieving a satisfactory solution for all the  problems of the Yugoslav crisis, including Kosova. This is in  the spirit of the decisions of the London Conference on the  Former Yugoslavia. It must be underlined that Kosova is  suffering the effect of these sanctions for no fault of its own.    "The people of Kosova are nevertheless ready to continue to  endure these sanctions, although they are an additional  difficulty, in the hope that these sanctions, however inadequate  they may be, may have some effect in halting Serbia."  <H5>  Kosova Is a Regional Problem </H5>   ``Kosova must then be demilitarized and its democratic  institutions restored. A form of international protectorate  must be established in Kosova. Because Kosova is a regional  problem and not Serbia's internal affair, the neighboring Balkan  countries must play a more constructive role, because peace is  endangered in these countries, too. The worst thing that can  happan is for Balkan countries to take the side of the aggressor.    ``The presence of observers and the maintenance of sanctions  can only normalize the situation and reinforce the people's  constant belief that their situation can be alleviated only by  peaceful means. This is the only way in which the necessary  conditions can be created to enable us to take part as equals  and without preconditions in negotiations on Kosova. Otherwise,  the future will be unsure and unpredictable. Let me underline  once again, on behalf of the government of Kosova, that we have  a mandate to act upon the will of the people, and we will  continue to do this. Self- determination is not an exclusive  right of the Serbs, but a principle applied throughout the  world. In this context and in this spirit, we appeal to the  United Nations Security Council, the CSCE, the United States,  and Russia, and all democratic governments, to help Kosova to  avert conflict and to achieve a normal life for its people.    "We invite all democratic government to recognize the will  of  the people of Kosova for a free and self-determined existence.  Only justice can be eternal," Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister  of the republic of Kosova, said in conclusion.</p>

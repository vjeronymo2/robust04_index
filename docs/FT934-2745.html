			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Camouflage to be seen in - Jane Mulvagh takes to the moors and finds a colourful variety of hunting attire To the moors to admire a man's leg] How rarely we see it and what a joy to behold if well-turned under a pair of breeches. If a girl wishes to take on this spectator sport she must also take on the elements, for the moor is one of the last public places, apart from the swimming pool, where the male limb, 'clean as a fork with the wind whistling through its prongs' (as Mrs Mountstart Jenkinson wrote of Sir Willoughby Patterne in the 18th century) can be admired. Panting up behind a keen stalker, his breeks blown tight against his rump, his prongs defined in peaty, ribbed stockings, is all enough to send her heart racing and her lungs burning - or is it the interminable climb? They call such attire 'camouflage' but I'd call it the most glorious adorning of the male species. Camouflage. People define it in such curious ways. Surely the aim is not to be seen: by stag, grouse, salmon or hare. And yet there seems little camouflage afforded, as most, save for the locals, attempt to flaunt, not camouflage, their prosperity and their physical prowess. Surveying the huntin', shootin' and fishin' fraternity around Perthshire one can almost predict who will come home with a full bag just by looking at their attire. The locals naturally, look the most convincing in a colour span that ranges suitably from lovat and Sherwood greens to peat and bogwood browns; for barely half way up the drive they disappear into the similarly-hued terrain. The Germans come a pretty close second: a sober and military lot who, like the Scots, approve of parsimony, and so favour weathered Loden hand-me-downs. But those Italians just can't help adding a dash of peridot or scarlet cashmere to their sensitive limbs. Like baboons on heat, they announce their eager and colourful presence. By far the most extraordinary camouflage is displayed on two American lady falconers, ankle-deep in heather in search of grouse. One is in a clashing concoction of Bay City Rollers' tartans, which she has crowned with a waxed cotton Indian turban; the other, built like a sturdy ram, is in a midi-length black distressed leather coat inset with a panel of plastic panther pelt along her spine. That an amorous local wild cat has not compromised her is quite remarkable. Three Texan sisters hunting rabbits through the rushes seem not to have heard of sporting camouflage and still to believe that flaunting it is all. The trio are identically kitted out in champagne-coloured leather field-boots from Schneiders, and a fawn suede jacket and matching breeks tailored to the slenderising millimetre. The buttermilk cashmere polo-necks and taupe stetsons atop their bottle-blonde locks make them look like brittle bamboo canes about to snap in the gales of an unsuitable climate. The dry-cleaning bills alone for those sodden suedes trumpet their affluence. But even the pros are occasionally tempted from their green-brown camouflage, probably out of boredom. The suitably sober falconers setting off with Harris hawks could not resist the chicken-yellow stockings shown to them by their Japanese clients. There they stand, proud but silly, in lovat to the knees, their lower legs mimicking the yellow talons of their hunting machines and the plumage of the one-day old chicks stuffed into their pockets. The gap between tradition and high fashion is too large to bridge when hunting and just as the Leander Club oarsmen bemoaned the colour of their flamingo-pink socks earlier this year at Henley - too bright to convey the correct provenance - so the ageing snobbery persists north of the border. But for the newcomer who wants to appear authentically barbarous, all is well. I hear that a London firm has set up a service to ensure instant eligibility: they will distress and age your new waxed jacket] Now that is keen camouflage.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The James Moody Quartet - Jazz Something has happened to saxophonist James Moody, in residence at Ronnie Scott's club all this week. Late in a long career the 68-year-old American seems to have found a more acerbic edge to his sound and a less predictable technique with both alto and tenor. The quartet is the regular one: the sometimes detached sounding Marc Copland at the piano; the appropriately named Todd Coolman on upright bass and Billy Drummond in the traps. Out front Moody, hamming up the vocals in a quavering falsetto, is clearly relishing the limelight. Having spent the summer on the road with Lionel Hampton as one of his Golden Men (alongside trumpeter Clark Terry and trombonist Al Grey), he is digging hard now into the quartet's book of bluesy standards and pianist Copland's originals. A tough reading of 'Birk's Works', a blast from the leader's past with Dizzy Gillespie, follows a twisting blues original 'Mutt and Jeff', solos taken by rote. The ballad 'I Can't Get Started' begins with some arty alto squealing, where Moody seems to be only half joking about his new found interest in harmolodics, eventually easing into more familiar territory. Pianist Copland, an apparently cerebral character, picks up Moody's line tentatively, the dislocated rhythm of the left hand driving a careful right. Like Coolman, who might shorten the length of his quiet solos, Copland struggles to be heard at times. Moody is the focus of course and the comical, shouted stream of banter with the audience, probably picked up during his sojourn with Las Vegas showbands in the 1970s, silences the rowdiest table.</p>

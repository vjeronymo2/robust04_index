			<p>BFN     [Text] An official spokesman in New Delhi today denied  reports appearing in a section of the press that the Indian  security agencies have sought an assurance from the LTTE  [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] regarding the prime  minister's security during his recent visit to Britain. He  termed the reports as mischievous and baseless. The spokesman  said there is absolutely no basis for reports of an alleged deal  between the LTTE and the government in this regard. He said  there is no question of lifting the ban on the LTTE imposed two  years ago under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.</p>

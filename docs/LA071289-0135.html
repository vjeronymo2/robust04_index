			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GANG CRIME IN VALLEY NEARLY TRIPLES  </P> <P> Gang-related crime in the San Fernando Valley nearly tripled during the first  six months of the year, the Los Angeles Police Department said today.  </P> <P> Gang crime, including murders, assaults, robberies, rape and other crimes, rose  from 201 reports in the first six months of 1988 to 578 reports in the first  half of this year, police said.  </P> <P> Detective Cliff Ruff, head of a Valley gang task force, said the 188% increase,  primarily led by major jumps in felony assaults and robberies, was believed to  be caused by increased gang membership and drug activity. He estimated that  there are 7,500 gang members in the Valley. Last year, the department had  documented about 6,000 members.  </P> <P> The crime comparison between the first six months of each year showed that  homicides rose from 11 in 1988 to 15 this year, felony assaults rose from 116  to 350 and robberies went from 27 to 145, Ruff said. The department's  statistical report also showed that rapes involving gang members rose from one  to four during the period, arson went from one to two, battery on a police  officer rose from four to 11 and cases of witness intimidation rose from two to  five.  </P> <P> Only attempted murders dropped during the comparison period, from 37 in 1988 to  35 this year, Ruff said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "LIBERATION Banned in Tunisia"] </F>   [Text] Once again LIBERATION has been banned in Tunisia for  an indefinite period. Tunisia's Agency for External  Communications (ATCE) formally notified us yesterday of this  without further details. Explanations were to be found in the  previous day's issue of the government-controlled daily LA  PRESSE. Under the headline "Tunisia's Dignity and Its People's  Honor Foremost," the paper attacked, without quoting it, an  article by a Tunisian intellectual that was published in  LIBERATION's "Rebounds" section on 23 March. The article's  author, who lives in exile in France, was expressing his  reaction to the reelection of head of state Zine el Abidine Ben  Ali with 99.92 percent of the votes. Condemning the absence of  "a democratization process" in his country, he gave his support  to the former president of the Tunisian Human Rights League,  Moncef Marzouki, who had not been allowed to run in the  presidential election.    Contrary to LA PRESSE's allegations, the Tunisian Government  did not use its right of reply in LIBERATION, but prompted  instead a representative of a "Confederation of Tunisian  Associations in France" to submit two texts. LIBERATION was  unable to publish these texts due to the personal nature of  their attacks as well as a total lack of sound arguments. We  need not remind readers that the "Rebounds" section is an  opinion column reserved for outside contributors. In any case,  our Tunisian readers were denied any opportunity to read the  offending article, as LIBERATION was not made available in  Tunisia that day, as is the case every time the paper deals with  that country's political situation.    The ban on LIBERATION is but the latest in a long series of  measures against foreign media. The BBC correspondent for  Tunisia was expelled in mid-February, and the offices of Kuwaiti  agency KUNA were closed down temporarily. [French] newspapers  LE MONDE and LE MONDE DIPLOMATIQUE as well as British daily THE  GUARDIAN were banned in turn. Last week, the Tunisian  authorities turned back the lawyer of "Reporters Without  Frontiers, an international organization working to preserve the  freedom of the press. As to Moncef Marzouki, whose candidacy  had caused an uproar in Tunisia, he is currently in jail.</p>

Leader President Saddam Husayn learned  about and explained this to April Gelaspie, the U.S. ambassador  in Baghdad, in late July 1990.    The economic and political conspiracy al-Sabah had  coordinated with the U.S. Administration and the CIA to subvert  the entire Iraqi national system, as clearly established in  Kuwaiti documents, had already pushed Iraqi-Kuwait relations to  the maximum state of tension, poisoned the entire political  atmosphere in the region, and encouraged al-Sabah to go ahead  with their plans.    The al-Sabah defense of the dividing line, which British  colonialism had created with the stroke of a pen by its  political resident Percy Cooks, was not the least of their aims  in stirring up the conspiracy and trying to establish a fait  accompli in the Iraqi side of the "patrols line", which the Arab  League had defined during the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis in the  sixties; the line which the president considered a determining  factor for those violations. The al-Sabah set up on the Iraqi  side of that line oil installations, border posts, and farms, as  also mentioned in his excellency's talks with Gelaspie.    Given the al-Sabah's mobilization of their armed forces and  the insistence on prejudicing Iraq's national and political  honor, and the fact that Kuwaiti economic and U.S. political  plotting had reached a serious stage, Iraq had to respond  equally by moving its forces and using its legitimate right to  foil the new plot, after its political efforts from 1989 until  July 1990 met with deaf ears and strong stubbornness. Those  efforts were wasted when al-Sabah did away with Arab fraternity  and cooperation and resorted instead to the spirit of hostility  and fighting.    It also became clear to Iraq that al-Sabah's attitude was  not  just a stubborn stand to carry out their wishes within Kuwait's  limits, but a coordinated stand with the United States and its  allies to plan a new war and to achieve what the plot of the  Iranian aggression could not achieve. The aim of the new war  was the same as that of the Iranian war, which was to push Iraq  to scientific, industrial, and social backwardness, weaken it  before the growing Zionist power, and force it to make political  concessions which would restrict its free, independent course,  end its advancement plan, and compel it to make concessions on  its national soil and resources and stop opposing Camp David and  its effects and any other similar step leading to the  liquidation of the Palestine question.    Those were the demands the U.S. Administration had declared  openly more than once, on an official level and in the  U.S.-Zionist propaganda and news media.    What Iraq already knew was confirmed by the official  correspondence between the director general of the State  Security Department in Kuwait and the Iraqi interior: There was  agreement and coordination with the CIA that al-Sabah and  Washington would work together to put pressure on Iraq at the  highest levels, pressure which would exploit Iraq's economic  conditions after 8-year war. This was clearly mentioned in an  official statement dated 22 November 1989 which Iraq deposited  with the United Nations, which also considered it a correct,  unblemished statement and included it among its documents    That agreement and coordination explain Jabir al-Sabah's  arrogance and haughtiness in insisting on going to Jeddah under  his own terms and asking Sa'd al-Sabah not to listen to anything  else, because, as he said, "this is the opinion of our friends  in Egypt, Washington, and London."    The position taken by Jabir and Sa'd was also that of the  the United States, and Zionism, of course. The al-Sabah were  used as pawns on the conspiratorial chess board.    As for Husni Mubarak, who used his good offices as a  coverup,  he played the mean role of escalating the tense, critical  situation to the point of explosion, as ordered by those hostile  quarters. This was obvious when he conveyed to Jabir al-Sabah  an incomplete version of what the leader president confided to  him when he said: "So long as the talks remain between Iraq and  Kuwait, then I will not use force. But brother Husni, do not  say this to the Kuwaitis since it will only make them more  arrogant." The words conveyed by Husni that "Saddam Husayn will  not attack Kuwait" were a clear plot to encourage the al-Sabah  to go ahead with their hostile stand to spark off the  U.S.-Zionist plot.    Due to the reassurance generated by Husni Mubarak's remark,  Jabir al-Sabah went ahead with his conspiracy. His  recommendations to Sa'd al-Sabah in his talks with the vice  chairman of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council during their  famous Jeddah meeting on 30 July 1990 were stubborn, like a  solid, jagged rock. Husni Mubarak's remark, plus Jabir  al-Sabah's determination to ride the conspiratorial train, which  was backed by U.S. engines and military might, was the main  reason for the failure of the Jeddah talks and al-Sabah's  defiance and threat that international forces would compel Iraq  to respond to their demands.    That was the visible part of the conspiracy, which had other  hidden parts. The political observer could not but note these  serious, major developments, especially the political propaganda  campaign which Western governments and world Zionism had waged  in the media against Iraq in general and leader President Saddam  Husayn in person since 8 August 1988. The aims of this  propaganda were summed up by a U.S. Congressional delegation led  by Senator Dole in April 1990, as follows: Iraq should revise  its scientific program and industrial advancement on the pretext  that it threatens Iraqi interest and peace in the region; stop  making threats to the Zionist entity, although it threatened  Iraq; and contribute actively and constructively toward the  current peace process between Israel and the representatives of  the Palestinians.    Those exactly were the hidden reasons behind al-Sabah's  insistence on riding the train of the oil conspiracy, which  steamed off with U.S. motivation and Zionist instigation under  the slogan of demanding: 1) Demarcation of the border according  to the new violations. 2) Payment of debts!    In all cases, the aim was one, namely, enforcing the demands  of U.S.-Zionist policy as summed up by Senator Dole. But what  was not secret to analysts, and it must not remain secret to  anyone now that the war took place with the 30-state aggression,  was what the hostile circles had decided, which was to push Iraq  to the state of the blockade it is in now. This blockade  actually began with the decision of the U.S. Congress earlier in  1990 to cancel the food deals with Iraq. This was followed by  the imposition of the scientific and technological embargo,  whether or not the war took place, rather whether we behaved in  a manner that befitted free men, or followed the path of  defeatism and cowardice.    What was required in all cases was to stop Iraq's  advancement project and thus affect people's progress and  prosperity, spoil the peace and victory the Iraqi people enjoyed  after 8 August 1988, and block the growing popularity of Iraq  which, with time, would become a popular unity base. This was  what the imperialist states and Zionism had feared because it  meant foiling their infinitesimal plan against the unity of the  Arab homeland, ending the divisions, and consolidating the march  of confrontation against Zionist aggression and its settler  arrogance. That was what Iraq had achieved in a striking  manner, particularly after 8 August 1988.    Therefore, al-Sabah's insistence was not spontaneously based  on a balance of power or a demand for legitimate rights. Any  observer could easily see that al-Sabah's small size and  challenge was no match to Iraq's new weight. The fact is, the  insistence stemmed from the opinion of Egypt, Washington, and  London!    Consequently, the Jeddah talks had to fail, and Iraq found  itself compelled to crush the den of sinful plotting which  sought in every mean way to involve Iraq in a war of starvation  and humiliation, similar in results to what we are in now,  especially after Iraq had proved its competence in the armed war  against the Zionist entity in 1973 and against Iran from 1980 to  1988. The al-Sabah were in no position to engage in one percent  of such a war and still remain on their thrones, even for a few  hours.    On 2 August 1990, while the Arab foreign ministers were  meeting in Cairo, Husni Mubarak, to quote Muhammad Hasanayn  Haykal, was reading a situation report prepared by his office  with the cooperation of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and  General Intelligence. The main points and recommendations of  that report were as follows:    - Iraq's entry into Kuwait was a blow to Egyptian interests  on more than one level, both with regard to its direct interests  and its leading position in the Arab World; a position which the  Egyptian Government was determined to hold on to, even if in the  disgraceful Camp David abyss.    - It was necessary for Egypt to mobilize the entire Arab  world in order to exercise maximum political pressure on  Baghdad. This could be done through a meeting of Arab foreign  ministers.    The report, which gave tacit approval to U.S. intervention  in  advance, also reached other conclusions. It said, verbatim:    - It is better for U.S. intervention in the crisis to be  carried out, step by step, otherwise it will give Iraq the  chance to arouse the Arab public, which was what the U.S.  Administration had actually done throughout the six and one-half  months before the military aggression.    - A clear message must be sent to the Zionist entity asking  it not to get involved in the crisis to avoid complicating  matters, making the solution difficult. This point was made  several times and recommended for implementation.    While Husni Mubarak was reading these recommendations, which  seem to have been drawn up before 2 August 1990, Tel Aviv radio  was lamenting the loss of "fraternal Kuwait." The Zionist  entity was holding contacts with Washington to coordinate on how  to face the situation, especially since Tel Aviv had its own  aggressive plan against Iraq, which was to have been implemented  before July 1990 if it had not been for the deterrent Iraqi  threat made by leader President Saddam Husayn in April 1990, and  had it not also been for Washington's fears about its "vital  interests" in the region in case of an outbreak of war sparked  by Zionist aggression. The Zionist entity's cabinet held an  emergency meeting in the same afternoon to discuss urgent  matters. Thus, the Zionist entity and Husni Mubarak seemed to  be pursuing the same line, carrying out the economic plot by  armed force under the cover of double-dealing and the policy of  selective revenge    At the time when the Zionist entity was hoping military  action against Iraq would be carried out by the big powers on  behalf of the small states, contrary to previous practice, Husni  Mubarak was preparing the atmosphere in the lobbies of the Arab  League to find a "legal" cover for the entry of U.S. forces and  its allies in the Arabian Peninsula, which would be the base for  aggression on Iraq. Without such a base, the United States  would be fighting a war similar in results to the war in  Vietnam, according to Bush and his followers. Wiping out the  Vietnamese complex had been Bush's obsession for some time. It  occupied a significant place in his inauguration speech. In  fact, he often mentioned the subject after 2 August 1990 and  during the armed aggression. Husni Mubarak gave him this  priceless opportunity when he violated the Arab League Charter  by resorting to a formal vote instead of the unanimous vote  required by the charter in such cases. That was his biggest  crime against the entire nation, as certified by all Arab  delegations.    Egyptian Housing and Reconstruction Minister Hasaballah  al-Kafrawi was very clear in his statement to AL-MUSAWWAR on 29  March 1991 when he admitted the importance of the treacherous  role played by the Hafr al-Batin allies and the sinful  aggression they committed against Iraq, and therefore the Arab  nation. He said, verbatim: "Were it not for the position taken  by Husni Mubarak, there would not have been any Kuwait or UN  Security Council resolutions today. Kuwait, the Gulf, and Saudi  Arabia would have complained to the Security Council and entered  into endless complications and interpretations, as in the case  of the Palestine question, which has been in the United Nations  since 1948, and will be, perhaps, forever. Were it not for  Mubarak also, the United States -- the biggest power in history  and in our modern world -- would not have been able to intervene  under any excuse. And if it did, there would have been another  Vietnam or a Crusader war. The one who gave it legality was  President Mubarak! And the one who made King Fahd invite the  U.S. forces was President Mubarak."    There is no doubt then that Husni was the one who gave  legality to the United States and the allied forces to intervene.    Whoever claims that Egypt's role was marginal does not  understand the course of events. Egypt was the one that created  the Gulf war and the one that returned Kuwait.    This dirty role the Egyptian housing and reconstruction  minister boasted about was, in fact, a treasonous role that  Husni Mubarak played, and is still playing, for Washington and  Camp David.    As for the story about the United States canceling Egypt's  debts, which amounted to $7 billion, those debts were actually  repaid from Arab oil money, not by the U.S. Treasury, according  to a decision by war criminal Bush and other members of his  coalition and agents.</p>

This action is necessary to establish harvest limits and associated management measures for groundfish during the 1994 fishing year. NMFS is also closing specified fisheries consistent with the final 1994 groundfish specifications. These measures are intended to carry out management objectives contained in the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective February 10, 1994 through 24:00 Alaska local time (A.l.t.), December 31, 1994.

A discussion of each of these measures follows. The process of determining TACs for groundfish species in the GOA is established in regulations implementing the FMP, which was prepared by the Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fishery at 50 CFR parts 672 and 676. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii), the sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons (mt) established for these species in &sect;672.20(a)(1). Under &sect;&sect;611.92(c)(1) and 672.20(a)(2)(i), TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves. The DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen typically deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea. TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii) establish initial reserves equal to 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flounder target species categories, and ``other species.'' Reserve amounts are set aside for possible reapportionment to DAP and/or JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not reapportioned to DAP or JVP may be reapportioned to TALFF according to &sect;672.20(d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council met on September 21&hyph;26, 1993, and developed recommendations for proposed 1994 TAC specifications for each target species category of groundfish on the basis of the best available scientific information. The Council also recommended other management measures pertaining to the 1994 fishing year. Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), 1994 specifications were proposed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 60575, November 17, 1993). No JVP or TALFF amounts were specified because GOA groundfish are fully utilized by the DAP fisheries. Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), one-fourth of the preliminary specifications and gear apportionments and one-fourth of the Pacific halibut PSC amounts were effective January 1 on an interim basis and are now superseded by the final 1994 specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

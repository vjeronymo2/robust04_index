			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banking sector switch TURNOVER in the banks sector of the market was given a substantial boost by a series of big switching operations involving Abbey National and Lloyds Bank. The switch involved heavy selling of Lloyds Bank and buying of Abbey National with institutions said to have been keen on buying Abbey because of its defensive qualities and a perceived pick up in the UK housing market. The market was said to have been happy to accommodate the selling pressure in Lloyds because of follow through buying interest in the bank triggered by the recent bullish note on the bank published by BZW. By the close, Abbey shares were only marginally up at 409p but easily outperformed a generally easier banks sector and a notably weak FT-SE 100 index. Turnover in Abbey reached 2.7m Lloyds Bank, sustained by BZW's positive stance, held at 580p with turnover an above-average 4.5m.</p>

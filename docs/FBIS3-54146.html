			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Progressive Socialist Party leader Minister Walid  Junblatt has paid tribute to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's  wisdom, position, and insistence on the rights of the Arabs,  particularly the Lebanese. He said: President al-Asad conveyed  the Arab demand clearly, rejected separate deals, and regarded  every such deal as a failure. He held talks with the U.S.  President from a position of strength, if one can say so. He  promoted Arab prestige in this meeting. He proved that the  Arabs have a legitimate right to wage a struggle and regain  their land in Lebanon, Palestine, the Golan, and other areas.  He held talks between two equals. The United States will have  to act as an unbiased mediator to fulfill the Arab demand  regarding the confirmation and implementation of UN resolutions.  The ball is now in the court of the Americans and the Israelis.    In an interview published by AL-SHIRA' magazine today,  Minister Junblatt said that President al-Asad discussed  Lebanon's case on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution  425, which Lebanon is seeking to implement. President al-Asad  emphasized the need for the Lebanese and Syrian tracks to be  harmonious. If the Americans are able to give the Golan back to  al-Asad or Syria and ensure the implementation of Resolution 425  for Lebanon, the situation will, of course, be better.    Minister Junblatt called for a plan to improve the domestic  situation to deal with normalization with Israel. He said: If  normalization takes place, the Zionist presence will increase.  Therefore, what is needed is a plan to strengthen the political  and economic situation to prevent the Zionists from infiltrating  through companies and cultural affairs. The Zionist presence is  subversive and will penetrate into the Arab and Islamic society.  It will attempt to cause division and strife.    Regarding the faction in Lebanon that will suffer most as a  result of normalization with Israel, Junblatt said: There is  fear for Lebanon because of fragile national unity, as the  Zionists might attempt again to divide Lebanon and use previous  agents or some new agents to undermine national unity.  Therefore, there is concern about national unity. We want  national unity to be based on Arab unity with Syria.  Normalization presents a danger to Lebanon. Some may return to  wanting sectarian mini states or cantons.    Minister Junblatt stressed the need for the government to  adopt a clearer social policy. Rafiq al-Hariri still represents  the promise for a political, economic, and reconstruction  revival. But we call on the government and its head to take  into account a very important issue--a clearer social policy.  The government cannot remain without a social policy vis-a-vis  the labor and farmers' unions, the elderly, and the poorer class  in Lebanon, which is getting poorer because of the presence of a  wealthy class that is getting wealthier. The government does  not yet have a social policy.</p>

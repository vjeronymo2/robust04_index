			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers' diamond sales up by 42% in first half DIAMOND SALES by De Beers, the South African group which dominates the market, reached an unprecedented Dollars 2.543bn in the first half of this year, 42 per cent above the depressed total for the first six months of 1992. But the company cited several special factors which helped to boost sales and were 'likely to prove transitory' and warned that 'it would be unwise to look upon the increased level of sales for the first half as a reliable guide to 1993 as a whole'. Nevertheless, analysts suggested that even an average second-half performance would send De Beers' rough (uncut) diamond sales above the record Dollars 4.17bn seen in 1988 and 1990. 'De Beers' market share must be as close to 100 per cent as it is ever likely to get,' said Mr Steve Oke, analyst at the Smith New Court financial services group. De Beers responded to the improvement by increasing its purchases from producers who belong to the cartel organised by its London-based Central Selling Organisation. In September the CSO told producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent as it struggled to bring rough diamond supply and demand back into balance following a huge surge in unofficial exports from Angola. These 'producer delivery entitlements' were raised to 80 per cent in May and yesterday went to 85 per cent. In February the CSO made its first price increase for three years, averaging a modest 1.5 per cent and concentrating mainly on stones above three quarters of a carat in size. De Beers said the transitory elements in its first-half figures included: A relative lack of uncut stones from Angola and Zaire, both affected by severe political disruption; A shortage of Russian polished diamonds in the first quarter (which analysts suggested was caused by bureaucratic bungling); Buoyant demand from India caused both by various budgetary incentives - including the increased convertibility of the Indian currency - and a rise in exports to the US. Restocking in the cutting centres and some consumer markets, particularly the US, the most important market for gem diamonds, where Christmas sales were up substantially both in volume and value terms. De Beers said there had been some recent increase in diamonds from Angola, Zaire and Russia. The US government had sold Dollars 77m worth of rough stones from its strategic stockpile and planned more sales later this year. The present market for polished diamonds was not as strong as that for rough stones and no dramatic improvement in retail sales could be expected until there was a resurgence of world economic activity, it added. Mr Oke at Smith New Court suggested a great deal of De Beers' extra first-half sales came from re-stocking rather than any substantial improvement in retail diamond sales. 'The stones are in the pipeline. But if there is no retail action to suck them through, wholesalers will sit tight and buy no more. But even an average second-half sale of Dollars 1.7bn would take 1993 sales to Dollars 4.2bn or Dollars 4.3bn - a significant improvement on recent years.' Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg financial services group, said the figures pointed to a 'welcome reduction in De Beers' diamond stockpile'. The group might be able to restore the recent dividend cut as well as soon restore the offtake from producers' to 100 per cent, he added. The figures were only slightly ahead of many analysts' expectations and De Beers share price, which had risen by Dollars 1.50 this week in anticipation of the announcement, was unchanged yesterday at Dollars 18.10.</p>

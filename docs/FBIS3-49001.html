It is our tradition, as well as that of other  peoples, to be closer to each other at the end of one year and  the beginning of another and to think with greater hope and  confidence of the new year that is approaching.    May it be a better year and may our hopes come true. With  these thoughts and feelings, I am addressing you with heartfelt  wishes for health, happiness, peace, understanding, and for many  happy returns.    The year we are concluding has been neither simple nor easy.  Maybe it has not brought the much-desired satisfactions to  people's homes and hearts, it has stored up -- as we, in fact,  expected -- too many difficulties. Surely, however, if we judge  correctly and objectively, the year 1993 was a purposeful year  that placed our hopes on a more stable foundation. This year of  continuity in our political and social balance and stability  also marked the beginning of our economic consolidation, a first  and decisive step toward what we have to perform from now on.    At the foreign level, the year 1993 marked Romania's  recognition as a factor of stability in this part of the world  that is still beset by anxiety, conflicts, and explosive  situations with serious and incalculable consequences. This  year marked the consecration of our integration into European  structures and our association, on the basis of partnership,  with international bodies and organizations. The merit of being  in a completely different international position today and of  benefiting from relations, which we have to honor with  dedication and seriousness, belongs to all reasonable political  and social forces in our country.    Dear compatriots, I believe that all of us have reason to  hope that the year to come will more evidently display the  fruits of Romania's change for the better. First, I am  truthfully thinking of those who have had and continue to have  difficulties, families with numerous children or those who are  without jobs -- young people, pensioners, and other segments,  who, day in day out, have to make ends meet with their modest  incomes. I want to grant them a tiny support and encouragement:  They will be neither eschewed, nor forgotten. It is the duty  of all of those invested with responsibilities in our society to  pay attention -- along with economic recovery -- to measures for  social protection in the year to come.    I am addressing all those who, through great efforts, honest  work, and practical initiatives -- the entrepreneurs and  managers of economic units -- have reaped success. I want to  congratulate them and to wish them new successes in the year to  come. Their results are of great importance in the work of  relaunching our economy. Their experience has to be encouraged  and given general application. Not through profiteering and  fiscal evasion will we build a modern economy, but through  productive initiative and intensive, intelligent, and honest  work.    Dear compatriots, we are going through a period that is  still  difficult. It is a trying time for our nation but we must never  forget that, during difficult and decisive times, the Romanian  nation reaped success through unity, cohesion, courage, and  intelligence, thus, each time, recovering through commendable  proof of balance and stability. Instigation to hatred and  disorder and disunity and intolerance have not been and are not  favorable, but, on the contrary, they have played and can play  into the hands of interests that are dangerous to our national  destiny.    Therefore, I want to appeal to the political and social  forces, and to all our citizens to rally their efforts,  capabilities, and energy, which our people do not lack, in order  to build a modern and prosperous society. Let us abandon feuds  and intolerance, as well as sterile confrontations and disputes.  Let us seek, together, through dialogue, the points of  understandings and eliminate those that disunite us.    On the eve of the New Year, I would like to extend a warm  message to our brethren across the Prut River -- to Ilie Ilascu  and his friends, and to all Romanians everywhere. I want to  express the hope that the year 1994 will guarantee for all of us  a better life, that it will be a year of peace and understanding  and of unity on the platform of national interests.    In conclusion of his message, President Ion Iliescu wishes  everyone a happy New Year and many happy returns.</p>

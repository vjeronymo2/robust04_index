			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES TO TRIPLE ITS WAGES  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council has voted to triple its monthly paychecks over the  opposition of two council members.  </P> <P> Stipends will increase from $100 to $300.  </P> <P> Council members Paul Lawrason and Eloise Brown voted Wednesday night against  the measure proposed by Scott Montgomery. It was supported by Clint Harper and  Mayor Bernardo Perez.  </P> <P> Montgomery said he asked to triple the pay because he feels that the council is  underpaid for the work it does.  </P> <P> The City Council meets twice a month at regular Wednesday meetings, and members  also attend special meetings at which city business is discussed, Montgomery  said.  </P> <P> The pay increases could become an election issue. Brown and Harper are up for  reelection in November. In addition, the city will elect a mayor for the first  time, and Harper and Lawrason have indicated that they will file to run for the  office. In addition to the stipend, the city has budgeted $6,600 to reimburse  council members for travel and business expenses, Deputy City Manager Richard  Hare said. The council has spent about $3,700 from the budget for travel  expenses this year.  </P> <P> Under state law, council members representing cities with populations of less  than 35,000 are allowed monthly stipends of up to $300. Moorpark is the  fastest-growing city in the county with a population of nearly 27,000.  </P> <P> The raise is the first the five-member council has given itself since the city  incorporated in 1983. Any pay increase approved by the council would not take  effect until after the November election. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

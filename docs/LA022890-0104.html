			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> '89 TRADE DEFICIT IS $113.2 BILLION, LOWEST SINCE '84  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $113.2 billion last year, the smallest since  1984, despite the highest level of foreign oil imports in 10 years, the  government reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the deficit shrank by 11% from an imbalance of  $127.2 billion in 1988, reflecting continued growth in American exports,  especially manufactured goods and agricultural products.  </P> <P> The 13.4% increase in exports, which rose to a record $361.9 billion, more than  offset a 6.4% gain in imports, which also hit an all-time high of $475.1  billion.  </P> <P> Tuesday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of payments  basis confirmed trends already noted in the department's monthly merchandise  trade reports, which showed a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.6 billion.  </P> <P> The new figure is higher because it excludes military sales by the U.S.  government and makes other minor adjustments in the monthly figures.  </P> <P> For the fourth quarter, the trade deficit posted an increase of 0.9% to $28.8  billion, following a deficit of $28.6 billion in the third quarter.  </P> <P> A higher trade deficit would spell trouble for the Bush Administration, which  is counting on further export growth to prop up the U.S. economy.  </P></p>

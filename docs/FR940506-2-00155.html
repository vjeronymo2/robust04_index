(``Mulberry LP Sub''). Mulberry LP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value. In exchange for an assignment from Energy Sub to Mulberry LP Sub of all of Energy Sub's right, title and interest in and to CSW Mulberry, Energy Sub would subscribe to all of Mulberry LP Sub's common stock. It is further proposed that the Joint Venture form a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary to be known as Polk Power GP II, Inc. (``Mulberry GP Sub''). Mulberry GP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value.

It is anticipated that a pledge of the stock of CSW Mulberry and JV Sub by their holders, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, respectively, which was required in connection with the Construction Financing, will be required in connection with the Term Financing. The requested authority is desirable to limit the liability of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, which have acquired interests in several other partnerships and corporations that are unaffiliated with the Project. If Energy Sub and the Joint Venture make such pledges and the Partnership defaults in its repayment obligations under the terms of such Construction Financing or Term Financing, interests of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture that are not associated with the Project could be adversely affected by the actions taken by the provider(s) of such Construction Financing or Term Financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> GPU Nuclear Corporation (70&hyph;8393) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GPU Nuclear Corporation (``GPUN''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, NJ 07054, a wholly owned utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding company, has filed an application under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GPUN proposes to offer to non-affiliates, with nuclear or non-nuclear plants in the U.S. and abroad, a range of services that are based on the skills, expertise, experience, resources and facilities that it has developed relative to its normal core business operations (``Services'').

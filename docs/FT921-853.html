			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Mongolia's trade drops by half MONGOLIA, which did 97 per cent of its trade with Comecon countries before the collapse of the Soviet Union, is struggling to find new markets and to counter severe shortages of essential goods. According to Mr S. Bayarbaatar, minister of trade and industry, the country's trade contracted by half last year to about Dollars 750m. The share of former Comecon countries has dropped to 70 per cent but remained as high as that because of dependence on Russian oil. However, shipments of oil have been suspended since December because of contractual problems. Few countries have embarked on more sweeping economic reform in the face of more obstacles. The Mongolian government's structural adjustment programme, enacted with the advice of the International Monetary Fund, includes price liberalisation, banking reform, privatisation, control of inflation, laws to attract foreign investment, and other steps towards a market economy. But as a land-locked country sandwiched between communist China and chaotic Russia, 'we have to create a more acceptable business environment than either China or Russia,' Mr Bayarbaatar said during a visit to London. The halt in oil supplies, which has caused Mongolia to use up strategic reserves and severely limit domestic consumption, is symptomatic of the country's problems. According to Mr Bayarbaatar, shipments stopped because it was not clear which Russian entity should sign the contract. A barter agreement has been signed, but no oil was shipped because of a dispute within Russia on who was liable for payment for shipment to the border. Mr Bayarbaatar is travelling on to Moscow to make a new attempt to secure resumption of supplies. Mongolia needs to import Russian petroleum products because they would be more expensive to buy elsewhere, especially if they had to be trans-shipped through Russia. The country also needs to export copper concentrate to Russian factories, which are unable to pay for it - hence the barter agreement. Meanwhile, shortages of essential goods in Russia are encouraging Mongolia's increasingly market-oriented traders to sell them across the border for high prices rather than at home. Flour, rice and sugar are all rationed. Because of growing unreliability of trans-shipment through Russia, Mongolia is seeking to develop trade links through China and has high hopes of a new freeport zone planned in North Korea. International donors last year pledged Dollars 150m to Mongolia to finance emergency imports, and will meet again in May to consider soft loans to meet the country's medium-term needs, including infrastructure, promotion of exports and import substitution.</p>

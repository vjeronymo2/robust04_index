			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S AID REQUEST FOR CONTRAS IS SLOWED BY HOUSE DEMOCRATS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III's request for new non-military aid for  Nicaragua's Contras ran into opposition Wednesday from House Democrats, who  said they need more time to study his proposals for U.S. diplomacy in Central  America.  </P> <P> The Democrats' misgivings appear likely to force President Bush to postpone a  public announcement of his new Central America policy, which officials said  they had hoped would take place as early as today.  </P> <P> The proposed policy would combine U.S. diplomatic support for a Central  American peace plan with increased pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista  government to enact democratic reforms -- plus an estimated $50 million to keep  the Contras alive until Nicaragua conducts elections next February.  </P> <P> Baker, seeking bipartisan support for his plan, won general backing from the  leaders of both parties in the House and Senate last week. But liberal  Democrats in the House marshaled opposition to the plan this week, prompting  House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.) to tell Baker on Wednesday that they want more time to consider the  plan.  </P> <P> "We are continuing to discuss the matter," Mitchell said through a spokesman.  "Progress is being made."  </P> <P> A senior Administration official expressed frustration with the Democrats'  stand. "They never get together up there on anything having to do with Central  America," he complained.  </P> <P> He said that the Administration wants to launch the policy with clear  bipartisan support. "Our view is that we've given them . . . an offer they  can't refuse," he said. "But maybe they'll refuse it anyway, in which event we  probably have to go forward."  </P> <P> At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, a majority of House Democrats decided that  they are unhappy with Baker's request for renewed non-military aid to the  Contras until the Nicaraguan elections.  </P> <P> "If it's aid intended to resettle the Contras, we have always envisaged that,"  said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "If it's some kind of  incentive to keep the Contras going, that's a completely different issue. . . .  I don't think we should support it until we see some more specifics."  </P> <P> An Administration official said that Baker still hopes some kind of compromise  can be worked out this week. "There are still a few issues to resolve, but  consultations are ongoing," the official said.  </P> <P> An aide to one House Democratic leader said that the issues include assurances  that the money will not be used to put the Contras in an improved position to  resume military operations if the peace plan falters. Baker already has said  publicly that the Administration will warn the Contras to halt military  operations against Nicaragua from their camps in neighboring Honduras.  </P> <P> "We're taking the military equation . . . out of it," a senior Administration  official said. "We are talking about keeping the resistance there as an  incentive to encourage the Sandinistas to do what they promised they were going  to do" in internal reforms.  </P> <P> He indicated that the Administration wants to postpone any moves to disband the  Contras until after the Nicaraguan election next February. Officials in  Honduras, where the rebels are based, have said that they want the Contras  resettled by the end of this year.  </P> <P> The Central American peace plan, adopted by five of the area's nations last  month, calls for a formula to demobilize and resettle the Contras by May 15,  but sets no deadline for the resettlement process itself.  </P> <P> "If there's a free and fair election in February, we'd have to look at measures  for repatriation," the senior Administration official said.  </P> <P> Asked how likely prospects are for a fair election, he indicated that he is  skeptical. "They haven't performed yet, have they?" he said of the Sandinista  government.  </P> <P> "The Contras are an incentive," he said. "Not as big an incentive as if they  were sitting there with a lot of weapons . . . but it is an incentive. And we  have not had performance by the Sandinistas; there's been anything but  performance. So whatever incentives we have, we should maintain."  </P> <P> He said that the greatest need is for a coherent U.S. policy with broad  support.  </P> <P> "What you have now is . . . a chaotic situation," he said. "You have Central  American government (officials) coming to town and meeting with (congressional)  staffers and not meeting with the executive branch and cutting deals with the  Hill. You can't run a foreign policy like that."  </P></p>

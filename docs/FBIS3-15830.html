			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The Estonian prime  minister yesterday welcomed what he said was clear and strong  support from the Nordic countries to his nation's demand that  Russia abide by its earlier suggested deadline of Aug. 31, 1994,  for troop withdrawal from Estonia.    Political support which we expected to get from the Nordic  countries over Russian troop withdrawal has been received and is  unexpectedly clear-worded and strong, Prime Minister Mart Laar  said.    The prime ministers of the Nordic countries at a meeting of  the Nordic Council in Stockholm Monday [7 March] issued a  statement urging for a quick, orderly and complete withdrawal of  Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994.    The Estonian leader in his remarks to BNS today said it was  particularly good that the Nordic leaders in their statement  very strongly asserted the final deadline for the pullout.

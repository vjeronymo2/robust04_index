			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin,  Russian president's special envoy, declared to INTERFAX on  Friday [4 March] that he "is concerned and even insulted" by  negative reaction of several Moslem leaders in Bosnia with  respect to the agreement to open the airport in Tuzla reached  with the leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic several  days ago in Moscow.    "This move will primarily correspond to the interests of the  Moslem population," he pointed out.    Churkin expressed a supposition that several leaders of the  Bosnian Moslems probably thought "that the airport in Tuzla will  be used for military transportations. These are people who wish  war but not peace."    At the same time Churkin expressed the opinion that "most  authoritative and serious Moslem leaders want peace and this is  the reason of the visit of the premier of the Bosnian government  Haris Silaidzic to Moscow on Monday. [no end quotes, as received]    He underlined that Russia intends to look for a common  language with the Moslem leadership. It will try to make its  utmost so as interests of Bosnia's and Herzegovina's Moslem  community "were taken into consideration in the course of the  political settlement."</p>

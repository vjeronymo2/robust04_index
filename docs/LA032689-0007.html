			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> If the A. C. Nielsen Co. had phoned me on March 12 to ask what TV program I was  watching, I would have been too embarrassed to admit it was "The People's  Choice Awards." And yet I sat -- benumbed by its self-serving pomposity --  through two hours of pre-announced and pre-taped winners; interminable  thank-you speeches (at one point there were 11 "acceptees" on stage); and, of  course, the usual endless program plugs and commercials. The only interesting  sidelight to the entire fiasco was that CBS had the guts to present what turned  out to be a running promo for ABC's "Roseanne" and NBC's "The Cosby Show."  </P> <P> Tom Lester, West Los Angeles  </P></p>

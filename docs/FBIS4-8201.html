			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs closed  checkpoints out of Sarajevo and mined access roads leading to  arms depots guarded by UN troops Monday as tension mounted  following NATO airstrikes on Serb positions near the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde.    The mines were layed during the day outside at least three  arms depots where Serbs had earlier placed their heavy weapons  under UN control. Two depots were located north of the city at  Vogosca and Radava and one, to the west, near Blazuj, a UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said.    UNPROFOR had suspended all movement of its forces, spokesman  Rob Annink said.    Meanwhile, all checkpoints leading to the city were closed  and even the head of UNPROFOR, French general Bertrand de  Lapresle, had to skirt around a Serb-held area to reach Sarajevo  airport from where he flew to Zagreb.    An attempt to organize a meeting between De Lapresle and  Serb  commander General Ratko Mladic was called off after Bosnian  Serbs broke off all contacts with UNPROFOR Sunday night in the  wake of a first North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike  against their forces outside besieged Gorazde. A second strike  was carried out Monday.    The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday  suspended its air bridge to Sarajevo and a spokeswoman said  UNHCR would reassess the situation Tuesday before deciding  whether to resume airlifts of injured Bosnians out of Sarajevo  to the Italian airforce base at Ancona.</p>

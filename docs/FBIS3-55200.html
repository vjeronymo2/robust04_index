			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Grigoriy Atamanchuk, doctor of </F> juridical sciences: "Reforms Lose Out in Battles for Positions  of Power"]    [Text] The elections are over but the choice, it seems,  has yet to be made: Will Russia take the path of peaceful,  creative, and rational development, or will it continue to  writhe in convulsions of self-flagellation and self-destruction?  There would seem to be few alternatives, but the choice is by  no means evident. I will not undertake to list all the causes  which reflect and imply weakness and instability in respect of  the democratic process, but I would like to draw attention to a  few. First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that the  democratic process has not yet harnessed to itself all those  people who are notable for their autonomous position, merit,  stable view of life, and their advanced abilities to evaluate  something in terms of deeds, rather than words. By dint of  their very being, these people -- let's call them "critically  reasoning figures" -- have always been pushed aside from power  and the solution of social problems by an authoritarian  bureaucracy, as they did not acknowledge the rules of the  political game being proposed. But even now, and moreover on  the very same grounds, many of them have still not become  respected or even equal components of the democratic process.    Once again they have proved unacceptable because from the  very start of democratic reforms they argued the need for a  balanced and serious approach, gradualness, and rational and  systematic actions, for gearing oneself toward the interests of  the majority of people, for a differentiated and honest approach  to the past, both distant and recent, for morality in politics,  and many other significant social values. People of this mold  have long warned of the danger of "accelerated" changes without  due account of their social consequences, the unacceptability of  rushing headlong across the entire "front line," and the  impossibility of relying on false stereotypes, such as the claim  that "it is necessary to create rich people, and then the rich  people will make the whole country rich." But few heard them,  and they were ever more frequently accused of conservatism,  backwardness, a failure to understand the processes and...they  were cast out from democracy. So it is that many of them  remained in the wings. To the detriment of democracy.    Moreover, it is impossible not to see that to this day the  democratic process is somewhat cautiously and timidly based on  science. It "trusts" only certain, staid elements, who were  always geared toward power and prepared to serve any system for  the sake of obtaining a portfolio. It is with equal success  that they praised socialism, as indeed they reject it today.  Suspicion is aroused by the fact that during the election  campaign, for instance, the staid elements of one and the same  branch of knowledge "split" into dozens of blocs, as if there  can exist dozens of truths in one and the same science, on one  and the same subject.    Hence the selective nature of the approach to proposed  recommendations, the tendency to select from the them only that  which is politically "beneficial" to somebody, and the  orientation toward certain one-sided postulates.    As a result, in the policy and practise of state  administration there is much in the way of subjectivist  improvisation, actions geared to the moment and not to the  future, "flitting" from one side to the other, servility in the  face of some foreign model or other, a solicitation of "advice"  from one visiting authority after another without due  consideration of the fact that he represents the interests and  views of that structure which sent him. Naturally, all this  impacts on the country's development and it does not in fact  advance reforms. And if we are talking about the latest  election campaign "performances," scientific know-how in the  sphere of social psychology was employed by the democrats  according to the principle of "whatever it says, do the  opposite." After actions like that, were the results of the  Federal Assembly elections really so surprising?    And there is yet another aspect which abruptly catches the  eye as a consequence of the foregoing factors: The depressing  incompetence and aggressive ignorance of many of those who were  swept into the offices of power on the wave of democratic  reforms and who now set themselves up as a buttress of  democracy. Instead of studying, trying to get to grips with the  science, art, and experience of administration, closely watching  what and how experienced people in other countries of the world  do it, honestly analyzing the consequences of their deeds,  decisions, and actions, such people found nothing better to do  than to get drunk on power, to engage in their own pet  development projects, and to organize "battles" for the most  influential positions. It is their fault that a converse  situation has arisen whereby state power is often used not to  resolve the country's major problems, but to satisfy the  ambitious aspirations of those who have acceded to power.  Moreover, this type of thing is already done quite openly, in  the public eye -- they do not shy away from it, nor do they fear  it, but, on the contrary, they are proud of it. Does this mean  that it is "permissible"?    But given that incompetence makes itself known, and that  sooner or later it becomes obvious -- thanks, in fact, to the  failure to resolve vital problems -- the incompetent  periodically "seek out" culprits responsible for their own lack  of talent, be this in the form of the apparatus which is  allegedly putting the brakes on reforms, or in the form of  former partyocrats apparently distorting reforms, or the  regional elite which pursues its own mercenary interests, or  nationalist forces which do not understand the advantages of an  integral state, or the director, or the farmer, or whoever. In  the years of Soviet power, indeed prior to the revolution even,  a great deal of "experience" had accumulated in respect of the  quest for enemies, so there is no need to devise anything new  here, it is sufficient to recall famous times gone by.    In brief, there are many symptoms which give rise to alarm  over the fate of the democratic path toward the development of  the fatherland.    No doubt it is time to take something of a new look at the  bases and capacities of the democratic process, and not only to  strengthen the substance and efficiency of the reforms under  way, but also to update significantly the basic lineup of  reformers, and to bring into it those professionally trained,  morally pure people who for whatever reason are still "in  obscurity." Not because they oppose the democratic process:  They do support it, but they will not accept those methods,  means, and forms via which this process is unfurling. There was  a time when the October cause was saved by the involvement  therein of so-called bourgeois elements. Something like this  needs to be done now: It is necessary to draw into the  democratic process all those who value Russia and hold it close  to their heart.    The development and appearance of infamous trends shows that  the main thrust of the battle for democracy lies not in the past  but in the future, when the incompetence and irresponsibility of  many who have latched onto democracy will have to be paid for.  It is worth preparing for this future today by reinforcing and  expanding the democratic process.</p>

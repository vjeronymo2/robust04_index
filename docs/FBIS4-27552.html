			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Strengthening of economic  relations between China and Japan is good not only for the two  countries but also for the Asia-Pacific region and the whole  world, China's trade minister said here Thursday [2 Jun].    Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi made  the remark in her meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in  the Diet building, a Foreign Ministry official said.    Wu, who previously met Hata in Seattle last November, also  expressed hope for early implementation of Japan's planned  fourth package of yen loans to China through official  development assistance, the official said.    Hata replied that Japan should try to forge future-oriented  relations with China based on repentance over controversial  remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the official  said.    Nagano resigned in early May over his remarks that the 1937  Nanjing Massacre never happened and that Japan was not an  aggressor in World War II.</p>

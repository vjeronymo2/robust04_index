			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Electoral watchdog launches publicity campaign Hong Kong's electoral watchdog launched a publicity campaign yesterday, to persuade residents to register to vote in the last elections before the British colony returns to China in 1997, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Woo Kwok-hing, Election Commission chairman, said he hoped a quarter of Hong Kong's 1.94m eligible voters who have yet to register would do so by July 1. The final local council polls fall in September, with Legislative Council elections next year.</p>

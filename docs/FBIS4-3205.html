			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign  exchange reserves in the central bank have increased since the  beginning of this year, a top Chinese bank official said here  today.    Zhu Xiaohua, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China  and director of the State General Administration of Exchange  Control, said that in general, the supply of foreign exchange  has exceeded the demand.    At a ceremony to mark the opening of China's foreign  exchange  center in Shanghai, Zhu said that last year, the contracted  foreign investment in the country amounted to 25 billion U.S.  dollars, of which most would be transferred to China this year  or next year.    He revealed that from April 1, the foreign exchange in the  special account in the people bank of China reached about 40  million U.S. dollars.    He said that once the demand for foreign exchange is higher  than the supply, the foreign exchange in the special account of  China's central bank will be used to make up the deficiency.    On the cause of the drastic increase of the foreign exchange  reserve, he mentioned three factors: increase of in-float  overseas capital, export value and income of tourist services.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter From Tokyo: Peace, prosperity and corruption Any government em-broiled in two political scandals, a constitutional row and a severe economic slowdown might expect a drubbing at the polls. But Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party got off lightly in yesterday's national elections to the Diet's (parliament's) upper house. The party lost far fewer seats than it had expected. It will now be well-placed in the next election in 1995 to win back control of the upper house, which it lost during the 1989 Recruit scandal, and re-establish its longstanding monopoly of legislative power. The Recruit stocks-for-favours affair now seems nothing more than a painful memory for the LDP. This year's two financial scandals, involving Kyowa, a building materials group, and Sagawa Kyubin, a truck delivery company, hardly surfaced in the election. Nor did the voters pay much attention to the controversy over the recent bill to permit the despatch of Japanese troops overseas to serve in UN peace-keeping forces. The LDP and rival parties were prepared for a tough fight over whether the bill infringes Japan's pacifist constitution. The ruling party published posters showing a Japanese as a member of an international baseball team. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, waxed eloquent about international contributions. But in the event the voters were not interested. As for the economy, the global slowdown may be bad news for US President George Bush, but it has done no harm to Mr Miyazawa. In the boom of the 1980s, the Japanese flirted with opposition parties. But the collapse of the financial bubble has sent voters scurrying back to the well-tried haven of the LDP. This is gratifying for Mr Miyazawa, whose chances of a second year in office when his term expires in the autumn grow better by the day. However, the surge in popular support could dissuade the LDP from tackling underlying political and economic problems, including electoral corruption. In many constituencies money still dominates election campaigns. Particularly in the countryside, the heartland of LPD support, the voters want to know which candidate will bring their district the biggest share of government spending. There is nothing uniquely Japanese about this. Politicians everywhere are familiar with electoral bribery. But what is worrying about Japan is the extent to which the pork-barrel dominates politics. This did not matter to the outside world when Japan was preoccupied with rebuilding its economy after the second world war, but now that it is an economic superpower it is of international concern. Japan's electoral system forces politicians into a debilitating dependence on money. Multi-member constituencies account for most seats in the Diet's lower house and for many in the upper house. Because politicians from the same party have to compete against each other, party discipline and ideology are weak. Electoral success is built largely on personal appeals to voters - appeals which are greatly enhanced by pledges of money. The biggest amount of cash circulates around elections to the Diet's lower house, the centre of legislative power. But even an upper house poll, like yesterday's, costs money. Funds circulate from companies to politicians to constituents. In return the companies are rewarded with public orders, especially building contracts. Not for nothing is the job of minister of construction regarded in some LDP circles as more important than the prime minister's. And not for nothing is the construction market particularly difficult for foreign companies to enter. As the party which has held power since the 1950s, the LDP has little incentive to change this system. However, it has acknowledged in voluminous reports what is needed, including controls on fund-raising, single-member constituencies and a redistribution of seats from the countryside to the cities. The last is most important: in the Diet's lower house, it takes more than three times as many votes to elect a member in the most populous districts as in the least populous. The implications run far beyond Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. The current political system was forged at a time when the nation was largely united in its aims: governments put the priority on economic growth and smoothing the frictions this generated at home and abroad without veering from their course. Bureaucrats, not politicians, took the important decisions. Having risen to economic pre-eminence, Japan must now define an appropriate role for itself in international affairs. It must tackle sensitive issues such as reform of an archaic tax system, the overhaul of land regulations, restrictions on foreign workers, and the ban on rice imports. The Japanese acknowledge the urgency of these arguments. But, until now, they have tolerated some political corruption because the LDP has ruled over unprecedented peace and prosperity. As long as the perpetrators of the most flagrant breaches of anti-corruption laws are punished, the Japanese have accepted that politicians will bend the rules. If the past is any guide, the Japanese will resist fundamental change until they are hit by a shock. Then change will come quickly. The hope is that this time such a shock will be unnecessary. But it would be unwise to rely on it.</p>

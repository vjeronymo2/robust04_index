			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / The pension bomb ticks unnoticed If President Bill Clinton were truly a 'new democrat' he would launch a national debate about the future of the federal government's largest programme - social security (pensions and disabled). The point would not be to tamper with the benefits of existing retirees but to ask whether the promises made to current workers make sense or, indeed, can be honoured. In just over a decade, the huge 'baby boom' generation (people born between 1945 and 1965) will start retiring. Over time, this will put enormous pressure on the federal budget. On official estimates, the number of social security beneficiaries per 100 insured workers will shoot up from 31 today to about 50 in 2030 and, on pessimistic assumptions, to perhaps as many as 80 by 2070. If US social security were an austere 'safety net' scheme, the demographic pressures might be manageable. It is not. Broadly speaking, the US is in the position of Britain in the early 1980s before the Thatcher government savagely pruned the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In contrast with the basic British pension, which rises in line with inflation, retiring Americans receive a generous federal pension based on their average lifetime earnings; once the pension payments begin they are indexed for inflation. This year, retiring single-earner couples will get federal pensions of up to Dollars 20,000. So long as the ratio of pensioners to workers is stable, pension liabilities rise at roughly the same pace as average earnings. But, if the ratio of pensioners to workers shoots up, as it will when baby boomers retire, the system is threatened with insolvency. Social security taxes are currently about 12.6 per cent of payroll earnings. Federal actuaries reckon that pension payments will rise from 11.6 per cent of earnings today to about 18 per cent late in the 21st century. On more pessimistic, yet plausible, assumptions, the ratio could rise to 27 per cent. If the far shakier trust fund covering medical benefits is included, the figures look much worse: total benefit payments rise to 31 per cent of payroll or a mind-boggling 52 per cent on pessimistic assumptions. In other words, on unchanged policies present social security promises could require anything from a 50 per cent increase to a near quadrupling of payroll taxes on the working population. When Mr Clinton is grappling with so many more immediate problems, including healthcare reform, it may seem perverse to expect him to bother about long-term demographic trends. After reforms in 1983, social security is expected to generate surpluses for at least the next decade. But letting the 21st century take care of itself is highly irresponsible. The trouble with pensions is that you have to give plenty of warning. It is no use waiting until 2010 and then telling 65-year-old baby-boomers that the nation can no longer honour its commitments. If future pensions are to be scaled back, baby-boomers must be told today so as to have a chance of increasing their private savings. There are two main steps that could be taken to reduce future pension liabilities. The link with earnings could be broken or greatly watered down. Payroll taxes would then rise much faster than pension benefits, compensating for the decline in the worker-pensioner ratio. The retirement age could also be increased beyond 67 to, say, 72 to reflect past and prospective improvements in life expectancy. But, rather than simply watering down the present scheme, it would make sense to consider radical alternatives. The threat of higher taxes on future workers arises mainly from the difficulty within a public scheme of one generation funding its own pensions. The Dollars 50bn social security surplus generated last year was only notionally 'invested' in US government securities. In reality it was spent just like any other government receipts. When the social security fund's claims fall due in 20-30 years, the Treasury can honour them only by raising taxes or increasing borrowing. There will always be a strong case for a federal safety-net pension, to keep the elderly out of poverty. But there is no economic reason why the federal government should be raising huge sums in payroll taxes (more than Dollars 400bn last year) to be recycled as earnings-related pensions. If Mr Clinton were bold, he would suggest instead that payroll taxes be sharply cut and individuals be required to invest the cash released in portable private pension schemes of their own choice. Baby-boomers' pensions would then depend on the performance of their equity portfolios, which in turn would depend on the economy's strength. Current workers would no longer face steadily rising payroll taxes. The political advantages of replacing social security (for future retirees) with mandated contributions to private schemes would be legion. Mr Clinton could claim to have cut taxes sharply, increased personal responsibility, headed off the future insolvency of social security, given the financial services industry a boost and, in all probability, sharply increased the national savings rate. He would be the savviest new Democrat in town. The depressing reality, of course, is that no American politician (Democrat nor Republican) has the courage even to begin such a debate. Social security is regarded as untouchable, whether or not the rules make sense.</p>

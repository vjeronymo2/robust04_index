			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 6 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 5 April, a government source commented on the  resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, stating:  "We have nothing to do. As far as Japan is concerned, it is  important that the United States see Japan's position in an  economic package to be compiled in June." The source indicated  that the framework talks will not be resumed earlier than June,  at which time Japan is scheduled to compile a final package of  measures to reduce its current account surplus, including  market-opening measures through deregulation.    In response, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  concurrently foreign minister, said at a news conference  following a cabinet meeting on the same day: "It is  inappropriate to say we have nothing to do. Each ministry and  agency is trying to come up with such measures as deregulation.  We have a chance to discuss the issue on various occasions. It  is important for us to discuss what efforts are now being made."  He thus criticized the remarks by the government source.</p>

"We want to invest in  Switzerland too," Mr. Zieleniec told the press after talks with  Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti. The two ministers signed  an agreement renewing all the treaties concluded with the former  Czechoslovakia. A convention on dual taxation should "shortly"  be ready for signing.    The Czech minister also paid a courtesy visit in the  afternoon to Confederation President Otto Stich. According to  Flavio Cotti, relations between the two countries are  "untroubled." With regard to Europe's security architecture,  Mr. Zieleniec reaffirmed his country's desire to join the  European Union and NATO. A first step will be the signing in  March of the Partnership for Peace membership documents.  Switzerland is still examining the question, Flavio Cotti said.  <H5>  Dual Taxation: Still No Convention </H5>   With regard to bilateral relations, the Czech minister  welcomed the involvement of Swiss enterprises which, according  to him, should be developed further. Switzerland is one of the  main foreign investors in the Czech Republic. To this day, more  than 300 joint ventures have been formed between Swiss and  former Czechoslovakian enterprises which are mainly Czech.    "But if we really want to be a capitalist country with a  market economy, we must invest abroad, and hence in  Switzerland," Mr. Zieleniec said. According to him, several  Czech enterprises have already gained a foothold on Swiss soil.    The agreement signed in Bern renews the agreements between  Switzerland and the former Czechoslovakia. Swiss entrepreneurs  benefit in particular from a bilateral investment protection  agreement which came into force in 1991. Czech-Swiss trade is  fundamentally free, aside from the limits placed on the export  of currency.    Another obstacle to bilateral trade is the absence of a  convention on dual taxation. However, the discussions on this  subject are almost finished, and it should shortly be possible  to sign the convention, according to Mr. Zieleniec. Finally,  the minister reported a plan for a Czech cultural center in  Bern, and announced that President Vaclav Havel would visit  Switzerland this year.</p>

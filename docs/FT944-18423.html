			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / M0 growth accelerates abruptly One of the government's main indicators of inflation surged last month, raising fears yesterday that interest rates may have to rise again before the end of this year. The annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of money supply, jumped to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per cent last month from 6.3 per cent in August, Bank of England figures showed yesterday. M0 is seen as a rough guide to activity in the high street because greater retail spending creates extra demand for cash. The surge in M0 may indicate that consumer spending is still buoyant, although the government is keen for the recovery to focus on exports and investment. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday that he was looking for more moderate growth in consumer spending 'to make room for expansion in other sectors of the economy'. Referring to last month's increase of half a percentage point in interest rates, Mr George added that 'it will be some time before we can be sure that the move we made was necessary or sufficient'. Annual growth in M0 has consistently stayed outside the government's monitoring range of 0 per cent to 4 per cent and Mr George expressed concern about the pace of M0 growth in the minutes of his June monetary meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Until yesterday's figure emerged, M0 growth had shown signs of slowing. Analysts pointed out, however, that the sudden jump in M0 last month may have been caused by a statistical blip. The change in the annual rate of growth of notes and coins, the main component of M0, was relatively modest, showing a rise from 6.8 per cent in August to 7 per cent last month. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, pointed out that the six-month annualised growth rate of the notes-and-coins element actually fell - from 7.3 per cent to 7.1 per cent - between August and September. The cause of the sharp jump in the monetary aggregate was the other component of M0: banks' operational deposits. This volatile statistic rose 38 per cent between August and September, having fallen 48 per cent between July and August. On a seasonally adjusted basis, M0 rose 1 per cent between August and September, but unadjusted it fell 0.3 per cent. This may indicate a problem with the seasonal adjustment process, according to Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist in London with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.</p>

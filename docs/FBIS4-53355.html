			<p>BFN     [Text] Yangsan, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Over 1,000 residents of  Chang-an, a township near Pusan, staged a sit-in early Thursday  morning against plans to build a nuclear waste dump in the  township, blocking roads with machinery and tires. As a result,  some 1,500 commuters were unable to report to work in Pusan and  Ulsan, while employees of Kori atomic power station were kept  from their jobs.    Some 500 protesting citizens blocked the road to the power  plant at 6:00 a.m. to keep over 500 station employees from  reporting for work, forcing those on the night shift to continue  working. Station chief Pak Sang-ki asked the police to disperse  the demonstrators, saying the sit-in protest would cause big  trouble for the facility. In response, the police deployed 10  companies of 1,200 riot troopers near the station to prepare for  any emergency. The protest also kept 760 primary and secondary  school students from Chang-an away from their schools.    The sit-in was triggered by the Kori atomic power station's  briefing on its nuclear waste dump construction plans at a  meeting of 14 Yangsan County council members and citizens  supporting the scheme in Chang-an on Wednesday afternoon.  Around 8:40 p.m., angry residents gathered for a sit-in at the  home of Sin Pong-cho, chairman of the Chang-an township  development committee that supports construction of the nuclear  waste dump. Sin's daughter-in-law, 29, fainted from shock at  the sit-in protest against her father-in-law and was taken to a  hospital for treatment.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Citic undaunted by past blemishes - The chairman of the Chinese investment body talks to Tony Walker MR Wei Mingyi, the new chairman of China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), has secured one of his country's more sought-after jobs, but also one of its most testing. The 68-year-old Mr Wei, elevated last month to the Citic chairmanship, inherits an increasingly complex international conglomerate with a heavy debt burden and a far from unblemished record in investing abroad. Mr Wei seems undaunted, however, and has little thought of slowing Citic's rapid growth. Rather, he is intent on pushing ahead on several fronts. 'If a company constrains itself by consolidating at a certain level, then I think that company wouldn't have a future,' he said at Citic's Beijing headquarters. 'Business is always aggressive: maybe, sometimes you win, sometimes you fail, but you must be aggressive.' Mr Wei's philosophy is certainly consistent with the 'go-go' mood of China, although his remarks are perhaps surprising, considering that he has spent most of his working life serving communism, much of it in his country's state-controlled electronics industries. Citic, itself state-owned, could hardly present a greater contrast to China's lumbering state sector. Founded in 1979 with capital of Yn30m (Dollars 5m) as a funnel for foreign investment into China, its global assets total more than Yn50bn, spread among 29 subsidiaries and affiliates. Among its more active overseas subsidiaries are Citic Hong Kong (Holdings), through its listed vehicle Citic Pacific, and Citic Australia. Both have been on the acquisition and expansion trail recently. In January, Citic Pacific acquired from its Hong Kong parent a 12 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications. Other recent investments include a controlling share of the Shanghai Children's Food Factory, and substantial interests in two mainland power projects. Citic Australia announced in March that it had purchased 10 per cent of Yaohan International Company, the Japanese retailer. Its main investment is a Dollars 70m stake in the Portland aluminium smelter in the southern Australian state of Victoria. It is also planning a stake in the Australian coal industry, and has linked with Hambros Australia to establish a joint venture securities firm - the first such investment abroad by a Chinese company in the financial services sector. Citic, said Mr Wei, would like to expand further, but is cautious about the international outlook. The chairman was probably speaking from chastening experience. Investment in a pulp and paper mill in Canada's British Columbia has gone sour, due to a slump in prices; in the US, the 1988 purchase of a Delaware steel mill has yielded little but heartache. Mr Wei said 25 per cent of Citic's business interests were overseas, about half in Asia. Ideally, Citic would like to lift its foreign investments to 50 per cent of the total, but this would require additional substantial borrowing which the organisation could not afford at this stage. The chairman estimated liabilities at about Yn40bn, against assets of Yn50bn. He described the ratio as not satisfactory and indicated that Citic favoured steps to reduce indebtedness, although prospects for achieving this do not appear bright in the short-term. Foreign liabilities, including loans and bonds, are put at Dollars 2.5bn. Last month alone, Citic raised almost Dollars 200m in separate international bond issues in Japan and Singapore. Depreciation of the Chinese currency by about 30 per cent against the US dollar in the past year has not made Citic's task any easier. 'My daily worry is servicing our loans,' said Mr Wei. 'But we cannot keep our money in the bank: we have to keep it moving.' Foreign bankers have occasionally questioned Citic's ability to continue rapid expansion funded partly by international borrowing - especially as a sizeable portion of its investments and energies are tied up in low-yielding or loss-making mainland state enterprises, and in infrastructure projects. Bankers assume, but do not take for granted, that the state would step in if required. Mr Wei said, somewhat ruefully, that in line with state priorities, Citic was obliged to invest in low-return, long-term projects in energy, transportation and heavy industry. To balance those investments, Citic was also engaged in 'quick return' projects in real estate, retailing, tourism and food processing. He dated the organisation's drive abroad to the credit squeeze of 1988, when China clamped down on most business activity. It was then that Citic made its push into Hong Kong, leading to stakes in Hong Kong Telecom (12 per cent), Cathay Pacific (12.5 per cent) and Dragonair (46.2 per cent). One of Citic's features, according to Mr Wei, is the autonomy it gives its subsidiaries. Larger investment decisions are referred to Beijing, but for the most part subsidiaries are left alone. They are set targets, and if they exceed them a percentage of profits is distributed as bonuses. This approach certainly accords with Mr Wei's business philosophy - with Chinese characteristics - which he expressed thus: 'A market economy is a market economy whether socialist or capitalist. We call it socialism because the capital comes from the the nation and not from private hands.'</p>

Under the plan, which has yet to be ratified by the State  Council, overseas firms would be permitted to operate  foreign-related insurance business in China. But they can only  settle their accounts in foreign currencies.    The move represents China's bid to meet the challenge of  restoring the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as  well as an endeavor to broaden international cooperation in the  areas of insurance, a relatively weak sector in the country.    However, China will be cautious about the step. It would be  a gradual process, the sources said, adding that conditions are  not yet ripe for a large-scale opening up.    Some restrictions are expected with regard to branches to be  established in China, the sources said, without giving further  details.    Experts here said that opening up China's insurance sector  will not only boost the country's insurance business, but help  garner more foreign funds.    With a population of about 1.2 billion, China is a huge  insurance market in the eyes of many foreign investors. In  fact, more than 30 foreign insurance companies have set up  representative offices and agencies in China so far, the  majority of which are offering consulting services or acting as  agents.    Over the years, the People's Insurance Company of China  (PICC), China's flag-carrier in this field, has established good  business ties with insurance firms in almost all countries and  regions, according to Shi Guoqing, deputy general manager of  PICC's International Department.    In line with the basic principle of "equality and mutual  benefit" embodied in GATT, China will be given the opportunity  of entering the international insurance market, while opening up  its own.    PICC, which monopolises more than 90 percent of the  country's  total insurance business, is currently accelerating the pace for  developing overseas insurance business.    China-funded insurance agencies are now scattered in Hong  Kong, Macao, Singapore, Britain, the U.S., Germany and  Luxembourg. They can conduct businesses such as property  insurance, life insurance, re-insurance and in the fields of  investment and securities.    The number of such agencies has risen to 71. A total of  1,000 employees are working in the agencies, which witnessed a  general insurance premium income of about 230 million U.S.  dollars last year.    The Hong Kong Chinese Insurance Group Company (CIG), which  was opened last year, has captured about 20 percent of the total  business in Hong Kong insurance market. The Hong Kong Minan  Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CIG, ranked first in the same  trade in Hong Kong for its large premium income.    China-funded insurance companies in Macao also hold as much  as 40 percent of the market.    As mentioned by Shi Guoqing, beside successfully organizing  the CIG and European China Holdings Company last year, China  will take a bolder step to set up regional management companies  in Southeast Asia and in North America in the near future.    Then the country will try to knit a world-wide insurance  network, so as to make China's insurance business more  competitive on the world market.    Shi Guoqing said that there was a broad prospect for China  to  develop overseas insurance business, as the world market is a  sizable one. Statistics show that the world's yearly premium  income is about 1,400 billion U.S. dollars.    In the meantime, the PICC has also done well in developing  foreign-related insurance business, which has contributed a lot  to foreign trade, and improving the investment environment.    Last year, premium income for foreign-related insurance  business achieved more than 700 million U.S. dollars, up 30  percent over the previous year.    PICC has now opened 80-plus insurance items for  foreign-related business, which include off-shore petroleum  drilling, satellite-launching and construction of nuclear power  plants.</p>

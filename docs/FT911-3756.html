			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T, NEC to develop new chip technology AT&amp;T Microelectronics, a division of the US telecommunications company, and NEC of Japan will jointly develop technologies to make future generations of semiconductors, they said yesterday. The agreement comes as Washington and Tokyo are negotiating a new pact on semiconductor market access in Japan, and is a sign Japanese companies intend to build closer links to the US electronics industry, in an attempt to reduce trade tension. For the next two years, the two companies have agreed to develop jointly the manufacturing processes for further miniaturisation, enabling them to increase the memory capacity and functions of an individual chip. While other semiconductor companies compete to develop similar technology, executives of the two companies said the joint effort would provide big advantages. Mr William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, claimed developing the 0.35-micron process, as the system is known, is likely to cost Dollars 400m (Pounds 232m) to Dollars 500m. A micron is a millionth of a metre. The smaller the micron measurement, the more advanced the chip. The next generation of memory chips, 16-megabit chips, are being developed using 0.5-micron technology. AT&amp;T and NEC are aiming for even more chip generations with the 0.35-micron technology. The companies will be sharing sensitive technologies in ultra-fine etching and circuiting, but say they are likely to have few problems in sorting out ownership rights of new processes. 'If the patent is developed from the joint effort, it will be used by both of us. If there are necessary patents that we already own, they will be licensed for the joint work,' Mr Warwick said. The companies plan to break down the development process into tasks they call 'modules', with 50-70 researchers from each company working on each module. There will be about 25 of these modules, and the two companies will exchange at least one researcher for each module, and have agreed to report regularly on progress. The project follows a more general pact signed in March last year, where the companies agreed to co-operate in semiconductor development. 'The relationship represents a win-win situation for both companies. Through partnering, each company shares resources, lowers individual company risks and gains timely access to technology,' Mr Warwick said. Mr Tomihiro Matsumura, NEC executive vice-president, said the agreement represents 'true co-operation between two multinational semiconductor companies', and proves the enthusiasm of each for 'a long-term co-operative relationship'.</p>

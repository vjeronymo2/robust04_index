			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sorry, we're all out to lunch - Nicholas Lander considers the lessons learned from the FT's Lunch for a Fiver scheme MATCHMAKER rather than dealmaker may seem an unlikely epithet for the Financial Times but it is perhaps the most suitable after the enormous success of 'Lunch for a Fiver.' For the 17-year-old son of one reader, Lunch for a Fiver made it possible for him to take his girlfriend to their first lunch in a top restaurant. Another reader, sadly made redundant the week before the scheme started, minimised his spending by courting prospective employers to a succession of Pounds 5 lunches, while finance directors pinned the list of 130 participating restaurants to noticeboards in an effort to control expenses. At the other end of the age spectrum, one woman wrote to say that, having drawn her pension that morning, she went to London for a lunch which she had thought beyond her budget forever. It also stretched some readers' ingenuity. When senior Home Office employees tried to book a table for 37 at Simpsons-in-the-Strand they were politely refused. Four of them then phoned separately to book three tables of 10 and one of seven which they confirmed by four different fax machines. Then they turned up en masse. During the fortnight, Simpsons served 2,387 Pounds 5 lunches. The average spend was Pounds 15.50; it extended the promotion for a third week. Some spin-offs could not have been foreseen. Alastair Little and Antony Worrall-Thompson, chefs used to media attention, could not believe the response: Little saw queues forming at 11.45am; Worrall-Thompson describing the effect on his business as 'mega'. Within the FT there was unprecedented interest in the food and drink page. The newspaper's foreign correspondents sent a stream of messages detailing what they could obtain for the equivalent of Pounds 5 in their cities. In New York it was a big pastrami-on-rye sandwich from the Carnegie Deli; in Brussels, a bowl of sweetcorn soup and a sandwich; in Bonn, dry bread, water, bangers and sauerkraut. Nor was I prepared for the number of enthusiastic calls, letters and faxes from readers. Examples: Mr and Mrs Turner in Dunstable, Somerset, who are now converted back to eating-out at lunchtime after a meal at the King's Head, Ivinghoe; Mrs Dalton of Hartfield, Sussex, whose Pounds 5 meal at Pierre Victoire, Edinburgh, satisfied the appetite of her 6ft 5in student son; and Suzanne L'Estrange, of Wandsworth, London, who booked nine lunches  -the last at Mijanou, in Ebury Street, London, which she described as blissful - and sent a detailed review of her gastronomic holiday. There have also been letters of complaint. The most vociferous and indignant were levied at the managements of Sheekeys and Drones for the Pounds 1.75 cover charge they imposed on top of the Pounds 5 menu. Those restaurants which offered a no-choice menu and segregated those on the Pounds 5 menu from other diners generated less goodwill than their more expansive rivals. But those restaurateurs who entered into the spirit of the scheme, offering wide choices and generous portions, have won many new customers. This attitude was most neatly summed up by Denis Blais, co-owner of Belgo, in north London, which discounted its Pounds 8.95 lunch to Pounds 5 and included a glass of Belgian beer. Blais said: 'For new customers it is a great introduction. For our regulars, it is a reward.' But things were not one-sided. Most restaurateurs and chefs asked me if I would like to see a Pounds 10 bill from a table of two customers who had eaten the FT menu, ordered tap water - and left. Some customers asked if bread and horseradish were included in the price. And, sadly, even at Pounds 5 a head, there were the occasional customers who failed to turn up. Risks are inherent in any promotion, but the success of Lunch for a Fiver has justified the FT's decision not to lay down too many rules. If you were at all disappointed in your Pounds 5 lunch, you still had the right to complain to the restaurateur; but please remember that the 130 restaurants that took part were those prepared to make a financial sacrifice and take a culinary risk to join a scheme that had never been put to the test in the UK. Many declined. For those that took part, Lunch for a Fiver proved a salutary marketing lesson. As Lou Segal, proprietor of Frederick's and a restaurateur for 23 years, put it: 'When I was working in the menswear clothing business, we had the answer to January and February - we would hold a sale. It has taken the FT to show us that this is what we have to do in the restaurant trade.' At Newtons, in south London, a busy lunchtime used to be 30 covers. Its owner, Tsu Newton, said she did not believe there was a market for lunch in her neighbourhood. However, during the scheme's two weeks she served more than 80 customers a day and last month her turnover was 30 per cent up on January last year. Rebecca Mascarenhas, of Sonny's, in London SW13, saw her lunchtime trade increase from an average of 30 to 102 covers on the last Friday of the scheme. Extra costs were involved and she had to top up her waiting staff's lunchtime rate but, in the end, Lunch for a Fiver proved financially rewarding. John Zarmit, an FT reader who managed to eat Lunch for a Fiver every day of the fortnight, says he was surprised that restaurateurs did not capitalise on this goodwill. None of the restaurants he visited offered wine specials, pinned the FT menu to their a la carte menu or offered a business card on the way out to entice him back. What Lunch for a Fiver did was create an atmosphere in the participating restaurants: a buzz normally associated with the busiest restaurants, of which there are usually only a handful. For Patrick Gwynn-Jones, Brian Turner, Stephen and Judy Markwick, restaurateurs of long standing, the fortnight invoked memories of 'the good old days'; for waiting staff who had to disappoint callers with the line: 'I am sorry we are booked until February', there was a sense of excitement. For customers that buzz is necessary. Quiet restaurants are just not exciting. One restaurateur rang me at 5pm last Friday afternoon, to tell me: 'Lunch for a Fiver has certainly worked with one table of 10. Six of them are still here and their bill is Pounds 410.' To those readers who were not able to enjoy Lunch for a Fiver because there was not a participating restaurant nearby, we apologise. For readers in the Exeter area, in south-west England, the St Olaves Court Hotel (tel: 0392-217736) has listed nine restaurants and hotels offering a Pounds 5 lunch during February. No sooner had Lunch for a Fiver been launched than Patrick Valetta was on the fax from his home in the south of France pointing out that there were no restaurants on the list convenient for him. Next year's FT Lunch hopes to rectify that. It will be bigger, better and, almost certainly, international.</p>

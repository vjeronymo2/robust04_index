			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xie Fuzhan (6200 0126 4232), affiliated with the </F> State Council Development Studies Center; edited by Luo Guifen  (5012 2710 5358): "China's Income Distribution: Status Quo and  Policy Analysis"]    [Excerpts]  <H5>  II. The Urban-Rural Income-Distribution Gap </H5>   Rural residents and city dwellers are two major interest  groups with different features in Chinese society. As these two  groups have completely different distribution mechanisms, as  well as quite differing distribution orders, clarifying our  urban-rural income-gap status quo and analyzing the factors  producing the gap, is of key significance in understanding  China's overall income distribution.    When our traditional system had just begun to be perfected  in  1957, the average income of China's city dwellers was 3.48 times  that of rural residents, which figure had basically stabilized  by pre-cultural revolution 1964 at about 2.38 times, where it  stayed until 1979. But as reform and opening up occurred first  in the rural areas, steadily raising agricultural labor  productivity, our urban-rural income-distribution gap has shrunk  yearly since 1979. By the mid-1980s, our urban-rural  income-distribution gap has dropped below 1.9. And while it  rose only slightly afterwards, it had clearly increased to 2.31  by 1989 and 2.42 by 1990, surpassing even that of 1978. The  clear growth of this urban-rural gap has aroused widespread  public concern.    The phased change in this urban-rural income gap was the  inevitable outcome of the phased advance of reform and opening  and the phased adjustment of our economic policy. Of the  factors causing the change in our urban-rural  income-distribution order, prices were one of the most direct  ones. In 1979, when the state raised the procurement prices for  18 categories of farm and sideline products, the composite  comparative price index for industrial and agricultural  commodities dropped to 82 percent. Peasant income went up 19.4  percent from 1978. In the following years, prices were  deregulated yearly, with the excess-purchase markup percentage  rising steadily.    From 1979 through 1981, the percentages of the price factor  in overall peasant income growth were respectively 4.1 percent,  18.1 percent, and 18.8 percent. By 1989, the composite  comparative price index for industrial and agricultural  commodities had shot up from 1988's 93.7 percent to 103.2  percent, reaching 107.4 percent by 1990, with the urban-rural  income-distribution gap growing respectively to 2.31 and 2.42.  In addition, the responsibility system of linking remuneration  to output in the rural areas that was first tested in 1979 and  then gradually expanded and fully implemented from 1982 to 1984,  along with the basic change in the rural organizational  structure, sharply aroused peasant production initiative.  During that time, peasant households had land-use rights,  acquiring independent property rights, directive planning and  administrative control of production was abolished in rural  areas, a commodity economy steadily developed, markets gradually  formed, and the enormous energies released by system reform  combined with the state's 3-decade post-liberation investment in  agricultural, fixed assets and infrastructures to sharply raise  agricultural labor productivity.    Our agricultural growth rates from 1981 through 1984 were  respectively 5.8 percent, 11.3 percent, 7.8 percent, and 12.3  percent, approaching and exceeding our GNP growth rates. During  this period, our urban economic-system reform had just begun,  with distribution-system changes reflected only in areas, such  as the raising of wages step by step and the restoration of the  bonus system, while all manufactured goods and service prices  remained mostly under directive-plan control. So in this phase,  our urban-rural income gap dropped to a historic low. But the  "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Economic-System Reform"  passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central  Committee showed that our reform priority had shifted from the  rural areas to cities. After this, urban economic reform  advanced quickly, with enterprises acquiring increasing  independent operating authority and planned management steadily  shrinking in scope. The dual-track pricing system, with bonus  maximums no longer set, and the various forms of the  responsibility system practiced after 1988, clearly slanted our  profit-distribution order toward the cities, with the  urban-rural income gap growing again to its 1987 level of 2.19.    It needs to be pointed out that while the comparative  profits  of [agricultural] cultivation began to drop in this stage, the  large shift of the rural surplus workforce to nonfarm industry,  with the rapid rise of all types of village and township run  enterprises, clearly raised the percentage of non-farm income in  peasant net income to a certain extent keeping the urban-rural  income gap at a fairly reasonable level. But the 1989  improvement and rectification sharply cut back the growth of  township and village enterprises, slowing the growth rate of  rural nonfarm industry. Over 30 million peasants who had left  the soil but not the countryside lost their jobs in nonfarm  industry, returning to traditional agriculture, which had  worsened by 1990. In peasant per capita net income, the  percentage of nonfarm income dropped to 26.53 percent. Still in  the period of improvement and rectification, due to the basic  difference in urban and rural distribution mechanisms, while the  1990 nonfarm industry growth rates were 5.5 percent for  industry, 3 percent for communications and transportation, -6.9  percent for commerce, and zero growth for construction, the  agricultural growth rate was a high 7.5 percent. But the  peasant net income growth rate was only 4.7 percent, with the  nonfarm employee wage growth rate reaching a high 12.7 percent,  and the urban and rural household average cost of living income  up 10 percent.    The above analysis involves only the overt urban-rural  income  gap and its causes. But a covert urban-rural income gap was  also very evident. First, urban housing was generally assigned  by the [work] unit and the state, at very low rents; health care  costs were also borne by the state and collectives, with  everyone receiving pensions after retirement. After 1984,  city-dweller subsidies clearly increased. A sampling and  projection by a CASS Economic Institute income-distribution  taskforce shows that if all types of subsidies are included, our  1988 urban-rural income gap was 2.36, higher than the 2.91  result obtained from overt-income calculations.    In short, China's urban-rural income gap is one of the most  glaring yet easily overlooked problems in the field of  distribution. This gap was formed by both system factors and  policy impacts. But while acknowledging our urban-rural  distribution gap, we also need to note that since reform and  opening, our overall urban-rural distribution trend has been  toward improvement and rationalization. From 1952 to 1978, our  rural income growth rate was 1.95 percent, while our urban  income growth rate was 3.15 percent, meaning that urban incomes  grew faster than rural ones. But from 1978 to 1990, rural  incomes averaged growth of 6.37 percent, while urban incomes  averaged growth of only 5.08 percent, meaning that rural incomes  grew faster than urban ones. So as to accumulated effect and  overall trend, reform and opening have still improved our  urban-rural income distribution. As to the phased results,  whenever reform and opening were proceeding more smoothly, our  urban-rural income-distribution gap was more rational, and vice  versa. This shows that it is only by persisting in reform and  opening that we can perfect our socialist distribution system,  to speed up the growth of our productive forces.  <H5>  III. The Regional Income-Distribution Gap </H5>   As China is vast in territory, with sharp differences in  natural and geographic conditions, and very uneven economic  development, our income-distribution gap among provinces is  quite obvious.    In our initial reform and opening period in 1980, net  peasant  income throughout China averaged 204.89 yuan, with 10 provinces  and municipalities having incomes higher than the average, and  the highest incomes being in Shanghai, where they averaged  397.35 yuan a year. There were 18 provinces and municipalities  with incomes lower then the average, with the lowest incomes  being in Shaanxi, where net income averaged 142.49 yuan a year.  Shanghai incomes were 2.78 times those of Shaanxi, with the  high-income group of provinces and municipalities concentrated  in the agriculturally-developed three eastern provinces,  Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the three  municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai). The  income-distribution inequality index W (Elteto-Frigyes) was  42.96 percent for all provinces, with the inequality index U for  the provinces and municipalities below the average income being  23.19 percent, and the inequality index V for the provinces and  municipalities above the average income at 25.73 percent.  Beginning in 1980, the degree of income-distribution inequality  among provinces rose steadily. By 1990, the highest incomes  were in Shanghai Municipality, where net incomes averaged  1,664.35 yuan a year, while the lowest ones were in Gansu  Province, where net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, making  Shanghai incomes 4.7 times that of Gansu's. By 1990, the W  index had risen to 46.74 percent, about 4 points higher than in  1980, while the U and V indexes had climbed respectively to  26.32 percent and 32.72 percent, both more than 10 points higher  than in 1980.    During this decade, the larger regional income-gap was  characterized mainly by a larger gap between income from the  collective economy and other nonproduction income, with the W  indexes for these two categories of income respectively at 93  percent and 60.54 percent, far larger than the inequality index  for peasant net income. The household-operation income index W  was 27.92 percent, lower than the overall gap: this included the  V index for provinces and municipalities above the average  income at only 9.6 percent, and the U index for those below the  average which was at 20.2 percent. It is thus obvious that the  gap between developed and undeveloped provinces in  household-operation income where the key source is traditional  cultivation income, was certainly not the major source of the  peasant income gap.    In contrast to the peasant income gap, urban-household  income  inequality among provinces was much less. In 1990, the  inequality index W was 30 percent for the lowest income group  among provinces, and 28 percent for the highest income group,  but only about 25 percent for the middle-income group. It is  thus obvious that the urban income gap was most glaring among  the lowest and highest income levels. In the provinces and  municipalities with incomes above the average, inequality was  lowest for the middle-income group, with the V index at only  10.7 percent, while in the provinces and municipalities with  incomes below the average, inequality was lower for the  high-income group, with the inequality index U at about 12  percent. So urban income-distribution equalitarianism remains  quite evident.    In urban household income, the gap among average employee  wages in all provinces and municipalties was also not too large.  In 1981, annual employee incomes were highest in Tibet and  Qinghai, and lowest in Jiangsu, with the national employee-wage  inequality index W at 16.37. There were 17 provinces and  municipalities below the average, with the U index at 7.49  percent, and 12 above the average, with the V index at 9.6  percent and except for the three municipalities, most of the  rest being minority nationality and border regions. The major  source of the wage difference was the regional difference  between the highland and border regions. From 1981 to 1986, the  inequality indexes climbed yearly, reaching their maximums by  1986, when the U, V and W indexes were respectively 14.06  percent, 21.08 percent, and 32.19 percent higher than in 1981 by  7, 12, and 16 points, respectively. But after 1986, the  employee-wage inequality index fell yearly, with the U, V and W  indexes by 1990 down respectively to 10.65 percent, 16.71  percent, and 25.51 percent. In 1990, average yearly wages were  3,178 yuan for the highest-income Tibet, and 1,729 yuan for the  lowest-income Jiangxi. Generally, average wages were relatively  higher for economically more developed regions and mostly lower  for undeveloped ones, except for border regions. Among all  provinces and municipalities, distribution inequality was  greater for those with wages above the national average than for  those with incomes below the national average. That the  employee-wage income gap first grew and then shrank was closely  related to wage-reform progress in the 1980s. Before 1985, wage  reform was basically a resumption of certain effective  pre-cultural revolution bonus systems, with adoption of methods,  such as additional wages for all employees in batches. But the  1985 enterprise and institutional wage reform actually  reinforced the equalitarian-distribution method.    The causes of the income-distribution gap among provinces  were as follows: The production-factor structure. In  eastern China, education had long been more advanced, with the  percentages of illiteracy and semiliteracy among those over 15  years of age lower than the national average, while in western  China, these percentages were higher than the national average.  The percentage of those older than 6 with higher than junior  high school educations was higher in the east than in the west.  This literacy discrepancy directly affected workforce quality,  even more so in its market-economy concepts. Generally, most  poorly-educated workers had information problems and no way to  get rich, being unable to quickly master new technology and  diversified economic means, they were only able to engage in  traditional, inefficient work. But regions and groups where  educational quality was higher were able to adapt to  market-economy laws. Based on their own advantages, while  engaging in traditional agriculture, they shifted surplus labor  and surplus worktime to nonfarm industry, with urban employees  taking up second occupations and other ways to get rich. As the  impact of this education gap on income distribution was  potential and longstanding, it was very hard to change quickly  in a short period of time.    As to natural and geographic conditions, the east was far  more advantaged than the west. Superior natural and geographic  conditions contributed to agricultural development, thus  supporting light industry growth, to bring along the economic  development of the whole region. In addition, eastern China had  far superior transportation facilities, information channels and  investment climates than western and central China, enabling it  to attract an inflow of talent, money, and technology from other  parts of China and abroad. Starting in the Sixth Five-Year  Plan, the state increased its investment in the eastern coastal  zone, pushing this region's percentage of national investment to  50.6 percent, far exceeding its 1953-1980 level of 40.6 percent.  During the whole 1980s, state investment in the eastern zone  and this region's own investment growth rate both far exceeded  that for western and central China, enabling the eastern region  to combine its human capital, funding, and geographic advantages  to quickly raise its production level, promoting its economic  takeoff, and speeding up its economic growth rate. The  economic-development gap was the main cause of the  income-distribution gap among eastern, central, and western  China, as well as that between the coastal and interior zones.    The most obvious feature of the regional income-distribution  gap as shown in development level was the makeup of the rural  industrial structure. As China has such a large population,  whether rural surplus labor can shift from traditional  agriculture to nonfarm industry, and the rate and scale of this  shift, largely determine a region's economic development and  income levels. Eastern China's ratio of GVAO to GNP is only  about 37 percent, while central and western China's are  respectively 55 percent and approximately 65 percent.  Conversely, eastern China's ratio of rural GVIO to GNP is about  50 percent, far exceeding the output value of traditional  agriculture, while central and western China's are respectively  only 29.3 percent and 22.3 percent. In 1989, in Jiangsu with a  higher level of rural industrial development, the ratio of  traditional-agricultural gross output value to GVAO was only  27.9 percent, which figure for Guizhou was 75.45 percent. This  huge difference in rural industrial structure obviously affects  the regional income-distribution makeup.    In the regional distribution gap, in addition to the impact  of the productive-forces gap, state macroeconomic policy was  also a very important factor. Since the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the state has adopted an  uneven-development regional policy, employing a laddered  development strategy of SEZs--open coastal cities--coastal  EDZs--open cities along the Chang Jiang and open border  zones--interior, to drive overall economic development. The  coastal zones that were opened first enjoyed more autonomy and  more preferential policies than the interior areas, such as  investment-project examination and approval, foreign-investment  attraction, foreign trade, foreign-exchange retention, loan  scale, and tax burden. These policy preferences on one hand  attracted a steady inflow of overseas advanced equipment,  technology, and funding and domestic outstanding talent and  economic resources, enabling these zones to steadily upgrade  their industrial structures and quickly develop their  manufacturing industries. On the other hand, they enabled these  zones to use a slanted price structure of lower prices for  domestic primary products, resource products, raw materials, and  energy and higher ones for finished goods, to benefit in the  exchange of products with the interior, enhancing their  accumulated might, and forming market and profit structures more  favorable to the eastern region.    The eastern region's faster investment and steady expansion  of domestic and foreign markets clearly raised its employment  rate, changing its workforce's job structure, and raising its  overall income level. As to the distribution-policy effect, the  zones that were opened first with a faster reform pace were the  first to break free from the iron-ricebowl and big-pottist (all  eating out of one big pot) distribution system, to establish  efficiency-oriented incentive forces, in which incomes were  closely linked to work done and efficiency produced. While  raising overall incomes, they also widened income grades,  stimulating the initiative of their whole workforce. In short,  China's regional income gap was caused by the development gap  and macroeconomic policy differences.  <H5>  IV. The Income-Distribution Gap by Ownership System and </H5> Industry    Since 1978, China has encouraged the suitable development of  its non-state economy, bringing marked change to the purely  state-owned economic structure under the traditional system. In  urban employment, employment figures for the collective and  other non-state economies climbed respectively from 1978's 21.52  percent and 0.16 percent to 23.54 percent and 5.67 percent by  1990. In GVIO, collective-enterprise output value rose to 35  percent, with output value for nonstate economic components,  such as individual, private, and "the three kinds of foreign  trade" enterprises, up from 0.7 percent to 10 percent. By the  end of 1991, the number of household operations throughout China  had grown to 14.168 million, employing 22.58 million, with  registered capital of 48.82 billion yuan; there were 108,000  private enterprises, employing 1.839 million, with registered  capital of 12.32 billion yuan. So while generally speaking, the  public economy remains China's dominant one, an order of the  coexistence and development of the diversified economy has  essentially evolved. This change in the ownership order has  resulted in a changed income-distribution structure. We will  now describe our income-distribution status quo and features by  ownership system and industry.    China's income distribution by ownership system is  characterized as follows: 1. Average incomes are higher for  employees in state enterprises than in collective ones. The  general scope of this is over 23 percent, with the difference  being fairly stable at 31 percent at its highest in 1979, and at  23 percent at its lowest in 1983, 1984, and 1987. The  difference in the average annual wage growth rates for employees  under state and collective ownership is almost nil. 2. Average  wages are higher for employees in nonstate enterprises than in  state enterprises. At their highest point in 1990, average  wages for employees in nonstate enterprises were respectively  2.232 and 1.77 times those in collective and state enterprises,  with the absolute value being over 1,700 yuan more. And the  employee-wage growth rate is also 14.2 percent higher for  nonstate than state enterprises. 3. The employee income gap  between state and collective enterprises widens during times of  economic retrenchment, shrinking during periods of economic  expansion. From 1983 to 1985, our economy grew very quickly,  with the wage gap between employees in state and collective  enterprises dropping to about 23 percent; in 1986 when our  economic growth rate fell, this gap rose to 27 percent. In 1987  and 1988 our economic growth rate accelerated, shrinking the gap  to 23 percent. But in 1989, with economic recession and soft  markets, the gap grew again to 32.8 percent.    The income-distribution gap among various Chinese industries  was smaller. As to the national average, the wage-growth rate  from 1978 to 1990 basically did not differ much, with that of  the fastest-growing industries, such as culture, education, and  public health, only 1.7 points higher than that of the  slowest-growing ones, such as commerce and catering services.  The wage-gap inequality index among industries remained at  about 10 percent for most years, as well as showing no yearly  growth momentum. Comparing the initial reform and opening  period to the most recent years, the U index among the  lower-income sectors also did not grow. And while the V index  among the higher-income sectors grew somewhat after 1985, its  growth was not serious. The income-distribution gap among  sectors by ownership system was larger for state than collective  ownership, and larger for other forms of ownership than for  state ownership, which completely tallies with the mass of  calculation results.    Within state-owned industries, the inequality indexes were  lowest for 1982 and 1983 at respectively 7.53 percent and 8.01  percent, and highest for 1979 and 1989 at respectively 9.58  percent and 9.33 percent. The U index among the lower-income  sectors was clearly lower than the V index among the  higher-income sectors, showing that the income gap was smaller  for the low-income sector than for the high-income one. The  overall-model W index rose more obviously in 1989 and 1990.  Within collectively owned industries, the inequality indexes  for 1979 to 1983 were higher than for the years afer 1983. This  shows that the distribution-equalitarianism tendency among  collective industries was more serious after 1983. In addition,  for collective ownership, the U index within low-income  industries was higher than the V index within high-income ones,  showing that the inequality was greater within low-income  industries than high-income ones. This was precisely the  opposite of the case for state industry. Among industries of  other forms of ownership, the income-distribution inequality  indexes U, V, and W were all higher than for state and  collective ownership. Their variation coefficient VC was  highest in 1985 at 31 percent and lowest in 1989 at 17 percent.  It needs to be pointed out that for the distribution gap among  industries as used here, since industrial concentration was  greater, the results derived from calculations of average level  might differ from those by particular industry. But due to  data-validity problems, we were unable in this article to make a  more detailed division or more thorough exploration.    The abovementioned income-distribution features among  various  Chinese ownership systems had profound system settings. 1)  Enterprises of varying forms of ownership had differing capital  sources. The investment sources of state enterprises had long  been direct appropriations from state revenue. Even once the  investment system was reformed, by 1990, state-budgeted  investment still made up 13.2 percent of state-enterprise fixed  assets, with self-raised investment at 42.5 percent, while  collective enterprises received only 0.42 percent of their funds  from the national budget, with self-raised investment at 47.66  percent, making self-financed investment 5 points higher for  collective than state enterprises. For enterprises of the same  size, tax rates were the same for ones of varying forms of  ownership (with the exception of "the three kinds of foreign  trade" enterprises), with the state not obtaining asset taxes or  rents from its invested capital. This investment-source  difference, as to both earned-profit capability and profit  distribution, caused differences between state and collective  enterprises. 2) As to industrial makeup, collective enterprises  were concentrated mostly in lines, such as light industry,  commerce, and catering services, while state enterprises were  mainly distributed in the field of heavy industry. As China had  always focused its energies on establishing a complete  industrial system from the early days of the founding of the PRC  to the late 1970s, emphasizing heavy-industrial development,  when the state set wage policy, it had always set wages higher  for heavy than light industry, to reflect its industrial  difference. This difference has always followed along, being a  system factor causing the wage discrepancy between state and  collective enterprises. 3) As to employee quality and makeup,  average literacy levels were higher for employees in state than  collective enterprises, with state enterprises having about 33  percent more employees with more than high school educations.  But collective enterprises had 20 percent more women employees  than state enterprises. These differences in employee quality  were bound to cause a discrepancy in wage levels. 4) State  enterprises were generally larger than collective ones. In 1990  for instance, the average unit in state industrial enterprises  had 418 employees, while urban collective industrial enterprises  averaged only 115 employees, with the enterprise size-effect  generally creating a distribution discrepancy. 5) During  periods of national economic fluctuation, state enterprises  received much more government protection than collective ones,  with employee wage and bonus rigidity higher than collective  ones. So while economic growth rates declined, employee incomes  certainly did not drop correspondingly. In contrast, collective  enterprises largely had to pay the price of retrenchment, with  their employee incomes generally falling along with economic  growth rates. During times of economic expansion, these two  sectors were restrained by state macroeconomic control about the  same. These were factors in the different degrees of impact on  their wage levels by economic fluctuations. [passage omitted]  <H5>  V. The Income-Distribution Gap Among Chinese Residents </H5>   China's rural household income-distribution order underwent  a  great change after rural economic reform. As rural farm-worker  productivity increased, a large group of surplus rural workers  shifted out of traditional agriculture, speeding up the mobility  and reorganization of the rural productive forces, resulting in  the evolution and upgrading of the rural industrial structure.    These changes in the level of productive forces and  industrial structure, while raising rural income levels, also  widened the income gaps among various regions and households.  By 1989 and 1990, the rural income base coefficient had reached  31 percent, 10 points higher than in 1978. As to all provinces,  by 1990, in more economically-developed Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and  Guangdong and minority nationality-concentrated Xinjiang,  Qinghai, and Ningxia, the base coefficient was higher at 30-34  percent. In the three municipalities and central China's Hunan,  Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the base coefficient was lower at  20-25 percent, being lowest in Jiangxi at 20 percent. As to the  three main regions of east, central and west, the peasant income  gap was higher in eastern China, with the base coefficient at 32  percent; with the gap smaller in central China at 27 percent,  and at 28 percent in western China.    The wider rural income gap after reform and opening had many  causes.    1. The various contract responsibility systems practiced in  the rural areas thoroughly broke free from the pre-reform  collective economy's "big pottism," from a system perspective  creating the climate and terms for better income distribution  and making it possible for peasants to get wealthy through  autonomous hard work.    2. The varying amount of production essentials possessed by  peasant households was also a key factor in the distribution  gap. While rural land was distributed by headcount, as to  families of the same size, differences in the numbers of family  members who were workers caused differences in the gains derived  from the same amounts of land. Statistics show that in a family  of five, every additional worker raised overall household income  by 357 yuan. This was because peasant households with more  workers could not only invest more labor in the same amount of  land, choosing more cash crops that required more labor, but  also could invest surplus labor and time in household sidelines,  construction, transportation, commerce, and township industries,  thus raising overall family income.    In addition to the income disparity caused by varying  numbers  of workers, worker quality also had an obvious impact on income  distribution. Putting peasant family-member education levels in  eight grades, from illiterate and semiliterate to college  graduate, each one-grade raise in peasant family-member average  education-grade increased peasant household overall income by  34.97 yuan. Peasant household-worker quantity and quality is  reflected not only in agricultural production, but also in  choice of household sidelines, diversified operations, and  nonfarm industry capabilities. Data shows that for every 100  workers with educations above junior high school, 40 are in  purely peasant households, while 58, or 45 percent more, work in  nonfarm industry. This distribution impact due to worker  quality was hard to reflect under the distribution system before  reform and opening.    In addition, as to production essentials, the size of  household assets such as large farm machinery and equipment, the  fixed assets needed for nonfarm industry and the working capital  needed for the production process, similarly had an obvious  impact on overall peasant-household income. Data shows that  based on overall peasant-household income, productive assets  have a returns rate of 9 percent a year.    3. Peasant-household geographic and natural conditions also  have a significant impact on peasant income. Peasant households  in more economically-developed regions have higher incomes. In  1990, in the three municipalities of Shanghai, Beijing, and  Tianjin, peasant incomes averaged respectively 1,664.65 yuan,  1,261.11 yuan, and 1,069.04 yuan; 1985 to 1990 income growth  rates averaged respectively 15.61 percent, 10.22 percent, and  13.62 percent, all higher than the national average of 9.63  percent. But in provinces and autonomous regions, such as  Gansu, Guizhou, and Tibet, due to poorer natural and geographic  conditions, 1990 net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, 435.14  yuan, and 437.71 yuan, respectively, only about one-quarter that  of the average Shanghai peasant income; net income annual growth  rates were respectively 9.35 percent, 8.61 percent, and 4.35  percent, all below the national average. This shows that the  peasants living in these places have not only current net  incomes lower than other regions, but also an income gap that is  still continuing to widen.    4. The peasant-household income gap is also reflected in  household production structure and operating orientation. By  1990, the percentage of purely peasant households had dropped to  25 percent, with that of those engaged mainly in agriculture but  concurrently working in nonfarm industry at 65 percent, and  those working mainly in nonfarm industry while continuing to do  some farming at 10 percent. This evolution of the rural  industrial structure has changed the workforce disposition,  changing peasant-household income sources, and causing an income  gap among peasant families.    In contrast to the rural income-distribution situation,  urban  income-distribution inequality is much less. From 1985 to 1990,  the urban income-distribution base coefficient was 20-22  percent. Using the information-theory concept of entropy, and  Theil Henri's proposed dual methodology, the calculated urban  income-distribution T and L coefficients were respectively 13-14  percent and 11-12 percent. In other words, when the overall  low-income group is larger, China's overall urban  income-distribution level is lower than the base coefficient at  equal-value calculation. Of the calculations for 24 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1990, the base  coefficient was higher than the national average for 17 and  lower for seven. The base coefficient was highest for Xinjiang  at 33.6 percent, with Guangdong and Qinghai next at respectively  25 percent and 25.7 percent, and lowest for Liaoning at only 18  percent, with Tianjin and Hebei respectively at 19.8 percent and  19.6 percent. The T-index calculations resulted similarly in  Xinjiang being the highest at 22.9 percent, and higher for  provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai,  Hainan, and Fujian, with the trend being similar to the results  calculated according to the base coefficient. The similar  results achieved from calculations according to these four  different methodologies show that China's overall urban income  distribution is still quite equal. Moreover, as to the time  order from 1985 to the present, there has not been any  significant expansion trend.    The causes of our relative urban-income equality are our  urban-employee wage and subsidy systems and our urban  population's employment system. The urban wage system that had  been practiced ever since the founding of the PRC was  characterized by equalitarianism right from the start. This had  reached an extremely severe degree during the cultural  revolution. But after reform and opening, in 1985, we conducted  a one-time national reform of our wage system. This reform,  widely instituted enterprises for the linking of payrolls to  economic efficiency, while devolving state wage-management  jurisdiction to lower administrative levels, leaving the state  to control only the total payroll. In institutions, we changed  the graded wage system to a structural one of mostly wages by  job. Our main aspirations in this wage reform were to break  free from equalitarianism, to reflect a spirit of rewarding hard  work and excellence and penalizing indolence and inferiority.  But as enterprise wage reform largely tried to widen the income  gap among enterprises, this change quite naturally was resisted  by enterprise competition, obviously not achieving its desired  result.    In the distribution among employees within enterprises, the  resistance to breaking with equalitarianism was even greater.  In state organs and institutions, the institution of the  structural wage system not only did not eliminate distribution  equalitarianism, but also naturally affected the household  income-distribution situation. After 1985, employee non-wage  income grew very quickly. While the ratio of urban-employee  non-wage income to gross income was 20.3 percent in 1985, this  had climbed to 25.7 percent by 1990. Of the many types of  non-wage income, such as bathing, transportation, and labor  costs, most were equalitarian distribution without regard for  matters, such as age, seniority, rank, or contribution. This  made employee overall income-distribution equalitarianism even  more serious. In addition, related price reform and the  practice of various nonstaple-food subsidies were even more so  distributed according to headcount.    China's employment system also had an obvious impact in  urban  household income-equalization. In the cities, as long as a  youth reaching working age waited patiently, with no nitpicking  about job quality or employment site, a job was just a matter of  time. And once employed, minus special conditions, quitting or  being fired was generally impossible. The number of employed  household members was one of the factors affecting the income  gap. And the universal full employment shrank the income gap.    Finally, most urban residents had no capital goods or  investments, which ensured from another perspective that the  income gap would not grow too large. Of course, while the rapid  increase in household operations and the rise of stock markets  in recent years have shaken urban income-distribution  equalization, they have not yet at least had a substantial  impact on the overall income-distribution order, or become its  decisive factor.    Putting urban and rural residents together for a graded  ranking, to calculate the income-distribution inequality  coefficient, shows that China's national income-distribution  inequality is greater than that calculated separately for either  rural or urban residents. Moreover, this inequality is growing  in extent yearly. This shows that China's income-distribution  inequality is due largely to our dual-economy feature. To  improve China's income-distribution situation, we will have to  on one hand overcome our urban income-equalitarianism tendency,  and on the other strive to shrink our urban-rural distribution  gap.  <H5>  VI. The Matter of Absolute vs Relative Poverty </H5>   Absolute vs relative poverty is another angle from which to  measure income-distribution inequality. We are here adopting  the methodology proposed by Victor R. Fuchs, calling thalf of  the population with incomes less than the average the  relative-poverty population. In defining rural absolute  poverty, we are using the PRC State Council's 1985 definition,  that those with average annual net incomes below 200 yuan are in  absolute poverty, and those with net incomes averaging less than  150 yuan a year are in extreme poverty. Based on a comparison  of the 1985 rural absolute-poverty line and the national  average, we have set the urban absolute-poverty line at 375  yuan, using the same method to set that year's urban  extreme-poverty line at 282 yuan. When calculating absolute  poverty, while we have used the same criteria for all years, we  have respectively used the urban-rural retail price indexes to  correct the poverty lines for all years. In addition, when  calculating the percentage of the population that is in absolute  peoverty, we have assumed that the incomes of the lowest-income  group conform to consecutive even distribution.    Our calculations show that from 1981 through 1990, our  percentage of urban absolute-poverty households was in a general  declining trend, with the percentage of extreme-poverty ones not  so stable, being highest in 1988 at 3.67 percent, and lowest in  1984 at only 0.97 percent. From a macroeconomic-setting  analysis, this trend was rational, as 1984 was this decade's  year of highest GNP growth at 14.7 percent, while that year's  overall urban retail price index was only 2.5 percent, with the  urban average annual income-growth rate at a high of 15.23  percent. While 1988 saw a GNP growth rate of 11 percent, with  average income growth of 17.8 percent, that year's urban overall  retail price index reached a high of 21.3 percent. Under normal  conditions, during periods of inflation, low-income losses and  gross-income ratios are necessarily much greater than  high-income losses and gross income ratios. So it was not  strange that 1988 saw a higher percentage of households in  extreme poverty. In rural areas, the percentages of absolute  and extreme poverty experienced a process of first falling and  then rising, which was obviously on the same track with the  urban-rural income gap first shrinking and then growing. This  shows that the changes in the percentages of rural absolute and  relative poverty are more sensitive to changes in urban-rural  income-distribution policy than those at the average-income  level. In other words, changes in urban-rural  income-distribution policy have a more direct and severe impact  on the low-income stratum. Official statistics for 1988 and  1989 show the number of rural poverty-households respectively at  19.7775 million and 19.5456 million, with the poverty-stricken  populations respectively at 88.48 million and 86.61 million, for  percentages of the whole rural population respectively at 10.74  percent and 10.41 percent. Obviously, official estimates are  much more conservative than our calculations.    Relative poverty is a phenomenon that has always existed in  economic life. In the first half of the 1980s, our urban  relative-poverty rate was quite low at 2.61-4.3 percent. In  1985, our percentage of relative-poverty households rose to  12.48 percent, since then it has remained at 8-9 percent. That  our relative-poverty-household rates stayed higher during the  last half of the 1980s than during the first half was due to our  income-distribution policy being more open and flexible. In the  rural areas after 1981, the percentages of households in  relative poverty rose yearly, peaking in 1989 at 15.6 percent.  The rise in the percentage of relative-poverty households in the  rural areas confirms from another angle the annually widening  rural income-distribution gap, which is basically consistent  with our conclusions in the previous sections of this article.    Rural absolute and relative poverty are caused by many  factors.    1. In certain regions, such as remote mountain areas, rocky  mountainous areas, high, cold mountain areas, minority  nationality regions, reserve areas, and localities with a high  incidence of disease, due to poor natural and geographic  conditions, residents who are dependent mostly on farming and  livestock-raising income have generally lower incomes, having  become a group of households and populations that can hardly  escape their poverty.    2. In ordinary areas, certain peasant populations are large  in size, with many non-adult children and old people who cannot  work, or longstanding family illnesses, a lack of workers or  strong workers, shortages of labor to put into production, and  even more difficulty in having surplus labor to engage in other  industrial-sideline production, leaving their gross incomes too  low, and their average incomes even lower.    3. Capital goods and real estate ownership is generally low.  In contrast to others, these peasant households have to put  more of their incomes into acquiring housing and improving their  living conditions, which is bound to further squeeze out  production funds, thus further lowering their production-fund  input, creating a lack of reproduction capability, and forming a  vicious cycle.    4. The percentage of purely farm households in the  poverty-stricken population is very high, with very few engaged  in industrial sideline production, leaving them largely  dependent on the weather, unable to supplement agriculture with  industry, and with lower incomes. The causes of urban poverty  are mainly too few family members working and too low job and  industry incomes. As a key feature of urban employment is that  family-member jobs are more concentrated, with many husbands and  wives, fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters all working  in the same factory or unit, if the income of the factory or  unit is low, this affects not only the individual, but also the  whole family's income. In addition, urban single-member and  unemployable families are also a component of poverty-stricken  households. [passage omitted]  <H5>  VII. The Illegal-Income Problem </H5>   There is no use denying that China's high-income stratum  contains both those who got rich through hard work and operating  in the right way, as well as no lack of upstarts who exploited  their authority for private gain. The public aversion to and  bitter hatred of income-distribution injustice is directed  largely toward this illegal-income phenomenon and those with  illegal incomes. Illegal incomes come in many types, such as  through bribetaking and illegal profiteering. Some exploit  foreign business and trade activities to buy in commodities and  equipment of poor quality through improper trading procedures,  taking bribes from foreign firms at the cost of sacrificing  national and collective interests; others exploit their  commodity-distribution authority in domestic commodity  transactions, in violation of national policy, to distribute  certain planned-target commodities in short market supply to  nonplanned-distribution partners, taking bribes for this; and  yet others exploit their job responsibilities in areas, such as  personnel, residence registration management authority, job  planning and transfer, and residence movement and registration,  to solicit bribes from their service partners. Certain  housing-management personnel exploit their housing-assignment  authority, some key school officials take advantage of their  student-recruitment authority, and certain hospital doctors and  nurses make use of their patient-reception and  operation-performance powers to demand and take improper gifts  from their service targets. Some industrial and commercial  management personnel, tax collectors, and health quarantine  officials engage in extortion activities, such as industrial and  commercial registration, tax examination and collection, and  health inspection. There are many such examples that do not  need to be listed one by one. In addition, certain people  exploit our dual-track system of planning and markets, making  exorbitant profits through lease-finding activities. Such  people might take advantage of powers, such as  shareholding-enterprise-listing examination and approval  authority and loan-allotment jurisdiction, to demand firsthand  shares from enterprises or they might profiteer through  commodities in short market supply, gold and foreign exchange,  or cultural relics and antiques, to get very rich through  black-market trading. Some household operators and private  enterprise owners practice bribery and gift-giving, buying off  tax collectors to evade taxes; some use means, such as under and  deceptive reporting of business turnover, overreporting of  costs and underreporting of income to evade taxes. A few  enterprise officers and accountants use public office for  private gain, embezzling public monies and stealing what is  entrusted to their care in economic activities. While the  phenomenon of illegally acquired income is a very isolated one  in China, it certainly has an inestimable impact on China's  income-distribution order and the public mindset. These  illegal-income recipients have a consumption style far above  that of ordinary families, making some people feel outdone, and  leaving people even more sensitive to income-distribution  injustice. This phenomenon is even likely to cause public  dissatisfaction with government and is a hidden danger to social  and political stability.    The black-market, lease-finding, and corruption phenomenon  is  the inevitable outcome of an unsound legal system and imperfect  business-management system. It is an unavoidable economic  phenomenon for developing countries in a particular  economic-development stage. It can be gradually overcome only  through reforming the political and economic systems,  establishing sound legal institutions, perfecting market forces  and improving government administration.  <H5>  VIII. A Brief Summary </H5>   We have learned through analyzing the  income-distribution-gap  status quo that China's urban-rural distribution gap is still  quite large, with our rural-income base coefficient quite high  at about 30 percent. We also have a distribution gap between  developed zones and undeveloped regions. First, we need to  affirm that China's rural base coefficient remains within an  internationally-recognized rational standard. As to our  interregional gap, from the efficiency angle, while  economically backward regions have a lower level of development,  their income ratio to the national average is higher than that  of developed zones. Taking 1989 for instance, the three  provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong had a ratio of  income to the national average of respectively 73.99 percent,  85.24 percent, and 98.73 percent, with a ratio of rural  consumption to per capita GNP of respectively 43.26 percent,  44.45 percent, and 41.76 percent. But the three provinces of  Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu had a ratio of urban consumption to  per capita GNP of respectively 168.3 percent, 140.44 percent,  and 181.72 percent, as well as a ratio of rural consumption to  per capita GNP of respectively 55.94 percent, 54.91 percent, and  42.26 percent, all higher than Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong.  This shows that the state provides distribution consideration  and subsidies to backward regions. In addition, as to the way  to eliminate the urban-rural and regional gaps, either through  curbing the high-income stratum and high-income-region income  growth to shrink the gap, or through promoting faster economic  development in low-income regions and among the low-income  stratum, thus achieving a high-level of joint prosperity, our  correct option obviously must be the latter.    From a development perspective, China is going to be faced  with a long historical period of still quite difficult  industrialization and urbanization missions. By 1990, China  still had 73.59 percent of its population living in rural areas,  with about 60 percent of its workforce engaged in farmwork. To  decrease our agricultural population and workforce, so that the  rural population shifts to cities and the agricultural workforce  to nonfarm industry, our immediate option must be to continue to  vigorously develop in a planned and step-by-step way all types  of township and village enterprises that conform to our  industrial-development orientation. In this process, the  different paces of workforce shift, the order in which this  occurs, and the difference in labor productivity of traditional  and modern industry, will be bound to mean that the income gap  among groups will exist and grow. But this is precisely an  essential process that must be undergone in order to achieve  joint prosperity. In addition, in western China, in certain  relatively backward border zones, we have speeded up the pace of  reform and opening in recent years, so that as our national  industrialization ladder advances, coastal-zone-development  marginal costs rise steadily and western China speeds up its  development of resource industries, such as raw materials and  power, the development gap among regions will eventually shrink.  Of course, this process will be a long one, not to be  accomplished all in one move.</p>

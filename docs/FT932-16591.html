			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Deutsche strengthens Morgan Grenfell link FOR the first time since Deutsche Bank bought Morgan Grenfell just over three years ago, a senior executive of the parent bank will take a direct role in the management of the UK merchant bank's German operations. Mr Jurgen Bilstein, 45, named last week as head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank, has become one of four managing directors of Morgan Grenfell's German subsidiary. This will give Deutsche its first direct influence over the day-to-day management of Morgan Grenfell in Germany, which with 30 professional staff is Germany's largest mergers and acquisitions operation. 'The changes have been implemented at my initiative,' said Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell and board director of Deutsche Bank. 'Although Morgan Grenfell is head and shoulders above any other M&amp;A house in Germany we felt we would be able to do a more effective job for our customers in Germany if we co-operated more closely with the parent bank.' Mr Bilstein will be reporting indirectly to Mr Craven on M&amp;A issues, but as head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank he will report to Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche board member responsible for corporate finance. Under the Deutsche Bank definition this does not include M&amp;A. On occasions German clients have asked Deutsche to advise on M&amp;A transactions to the exclusion of Morgan Grenfell.</p>

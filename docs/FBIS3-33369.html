			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following reports are reactions to  statements by Domingo Laino, leader of the Authentic Radical  Liberal Party, PLRA, that the governability pact has been broken.    Asuncion HOY in Spanish, in its 21 February issue, carries  on  page 3 an unattributed 200-word article quoting Christian  Democratic Party President Miguel Angel Montaner denying the  breaking of the governability pact. He says: "`To the contrary,  the pact has been greatly strengthened; on 19 February, for  example, the multiparty negotiating board met in San Bernardino  to discuss how to face the social problems.'"    The same newspaper, on pages 22 and 23, carries another  300-word unattributed article quoting Colorado Party President  Eugenio Sanabria Cantero saying: "The possible breaking of the  governability pact announced by PLRA leader Domingo Laino was  not the result of an argument in the multiparty negotiating  board," whose members met on 19 February in his house in San  Bernardino and "where the issue was not mentioned at all."  Sanabria Cantero, who learned of Laino's statements through the  newspapers, said the multiparty negotiating board will meet  again on 21 February to discuss the subject.    Also on 21 February, Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish publishes  on page 6 a 500-word unattributed article quoting several  politicians. Enrique Gonzalez Quintana, second president of the  Colorado Party, says: "With or without a pact, the Colorado  Party will solve the social crisis." PLRA Deputy Francisco Jose  de Vargas states: "The real opposition members will not change  their policy because they always fought corruption." PLRA Deputy  Blas Llano says the "governability pact may have broken because  it did not accomplish anything." PLRA Deputy Luis Delorme states  that Laino "changed his attitude regarding the governability  pact because he realized that it is not working." Presidential  social adviser Oscar Paciello said he does not believe the pact  should have been broken "because some of the opposition members  are very optimistic about it."</p>

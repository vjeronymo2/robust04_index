			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Russia offers deal to Volsky THE Russian government will today try to secure its survival and the thrust of its radical market reforms by offering industrialists a chance for their leader, Mr Arkady Volsky, to help draft a new economic strategy. Under a deal to be submitted to industrialists in Moscow today, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation and co-ordinating economic reforms, would work directly with Mr Volsky on a compromise economic plan. In return, Mr Volsky, the powerful head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a leading figure in the main Civic Union opposition group, would work for the survival of the government at a critical session of the Russian super-parliament on December 1. But despite the fact that the deal represents a major coup for Mr Volsky, Mr Chubais named three crucial areas in which the government would refuse to compromise. He said it would reject any increase in money supply to support industry, any slowing down of mass privatisation, and any attempt to abandon a single exchange rate. It is not clear what this will mean for policies which are already being eroded in practice: the government has lost control for instance over much monetary and credit policy because Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, believes in supporting industry. A bankruptcy law, which will be approved in a final reading by parliament next week and which is supported by Mr Volsky, is unlikely to bite for some time because the country does not have commercial courts to enforce it. But the government must at least hope it will fend off the worst of the demands being made by Civic Union, which include: a return to price controls and centrally-planned state procurement, an indexation of all savings to inflation which could be 2,000 per cent this year, and apparently limitless increases in working capital for inefficient enterprises. It is in the industrialists' interests to support a government which depends on them for survival, rather than a new one which could bring in genuine anti-market moves. In talks in Kiev on Thursday, Russia reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine, persuading it to give up most of its claims on former Soviet assets so that Moscow can take sole charge of the former Soviet Union's main liability, a foreign debt of Dollars 80bn.</p>

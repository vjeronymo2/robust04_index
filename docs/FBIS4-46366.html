			<p>BFN     [Text] Egyptian security agencies are trying to gather  information about meetings between a delegation of Egypt's  al-Jihad Organization and Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former  secretary general of Lebanon's Hizballah. These agencies have  obtained information that several Egyptian "Afghans" [Egyptians  who fought alongside the Afghan Mujahidin against Soviets], who  were expelled from Pakistan, have arrived in Lebanon and are now  under Hizballah's protection.</p>

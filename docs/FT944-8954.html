			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Eurocamp's dash for cover - The offer of an alternative to canvas It was raining on the Cote d'Azur as Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director of Eurocamp, showed visitors around the 1,400-apartment complex he is offering in his brochures. The surrounding sea and mountains did little to lift the gloom, but there was one comforting thought: at least we were not sheltering in tents. Mr Atkinson, who joined Eurocamp in 1976 as a campsite attendant and led a management buy-out in 1988, realises that not all holidaymakers share his enthusiasm for canvas. 'Let's face it, not everybody fancies going camping,' he says. Eurocamp, Europe's leading self-drive camping operator, is increasingly promoting alternatives to tent holidays. It is attempting to raise sales of mobile home packages and last month launched a new brand, EuroVillages, which offers holidays in 20 French apartment and studio resorts. The strategy follows a sharp fall in profits and margins in 1993 - a shock for a company which had enjoyed four years of impressive growth. In 1989, the first year after the buy-out, pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.6m. By 1992, the year after Eurocamp's flotation, profits had reached Pounds 9.4m. Last year they fell to Pounds 6.3m. Pre-tax profits represented 11 per cent of turnover in 1993, compared with 15 per cent in 1992. Mr Atkinson says a principal cause of the decline was sterling's fall against the French franc. About 80 per cent of the campsites which Eurocamp uses are in France. Sterling's fall did not affect the price of holidays last year as the company had bought its currency requirements forward, but it did adversely affect consumer attitudes to France. The poor continental summer in 1992 and the French lorry drivers' dispute also depressed last year's bookings. Mr Atkinson says his company was also being damaged by longer-term trends. The first was that mobile home holidays were growing faster than the camping packages that were Eurocamp's staple. The market for self-drive camping and mobile home holidays grew by 65 per cent between 1989 and 1994. Over the same period, however, the mobile home share of that market almost doubled from 18 to 34 per cent. Mr Atkinson attributes the growth of mobile home packages to the fact that they appeal to less experienced holidaymakers. 'The more the holiday market becomes a mass market, the more conservative customers are going to be: less confident and more likely to want basic comforts.' Along with a greater emphasis on mobile Homes, Eurocamp is trying to raise quality of service. Its customer surveys found that service had slipped in 1992. Campsite staff now receive two bonuses: one based on profits and one on customer satisfaction surveys. Throughout its travails, Eurocamp has had a cushion available to few other UK tour operators: an international customer base. This year, 45 per cent of bookings will be from abroad. The company's largest overseas markets are Germany and the Netherlands, where bookings have held up well. Overall, bookings are up 20 per cent this year and the company is confident of improved profits. Moving into holidays in apartments is essential to maintain growth, Eurocamp believes. It aims to capture families who grow out of camping and parents with children too young to camp or with teenagers who find it boring. The EuroVillages programme, however, takes Eurocamp's offering closer to that of giants such as Thomson and Airtours, where competition is fierce. And while the Cote d'Azur resort, which is owned by the French group Pierre &amp; Vacances, has impressive sporting facilities, the rooms seem cramped. It probably all looks better in the sunshine.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (12): It started in London back in 1839 - The persistent dream of winning cheap electricity from chemical fuel cells The race to achieve ever higher thermal efficiencies from combined-cycle gas turbine power stations may be the most crucial in the short term for the big equipment suppliers, but other 'next generation' technologies are not being ignored. One of the most interesting involves solid oxide fuel cells. Both Siemens and Westinghouse are involved - separately - in developing this technology. The direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy in a simple hydrogen/oxygen-based fuel cell was achieved in 1839 by Sir William Grove in London. Fuel cells with liquid electrolytes have been used in space travel but terrestrial applications have remained limited to specialised uses in military and telecommunications. However, according to Siemens, with advances in knowledge, and especially in materials science, there is evidence that the 'forgotten' electrochemical conversion of energy can equal or perhaps even surpass today's successful energy technology under current ecological boundary conditions. There are various types of fuel cells, depending on the type of electrolyte used, and two broad classifications, low-temperature and high-temperature. Among low-temperature cells, Siemens has been developing the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type since 1982. These run on very pure gases, are easily transportable, and are available up to 200-300KW. But their cost means they are likely to be used only in specialist applications. A second low-temperature type with phosphoric acid electrolytes is also available in 200KW units, which can be used in combination up to 1MW, says Siemens. Their thermal efficiency in combined heat and power applications can be as high as 90 per cent, but the cost per kilowatt produced is high. Interest is now focused on the high-temperature type of fuel cell, and particularly solid oxide fuel cells which operate between 950 and 1,000degC and have sophisticated ceramic electrolytes. 'The technology is more difficult but there are big advantages,' says Dr Hans Bohm, a senior executive at Siemens' KWU power generation unit. The hot exhaust gas from the cell could be used in conjunction with a gas and steam turbine combined cycle, giving a relatively high electrical efficiency of about 68 per cent for a 40MW plant. Other combinations, for example an industrial CHP plant, could attain a total fuel efficiency of 75 per cent. The cells are still very small scale - even a 1KW version will not be available for a few months, says Dr Bohm - and stacks of 300-500KW will be needed for even modest commercial or industrial power generation. Achieving that will take several years. Westinghouse, meanwhile, has announced a two-year contract valued at Dollars 7.3m for a programme to develop and demonstrate solid oxide fuel power systems for the NASA Lewis Research Centre. The multi-phase programme will focus on developing transportable solid oxide fuel cells to produce electricity for military applications. The cells will use hydrogen-based fuels such as jet fuel and diesel fuel to produce direct current power with very low emissions. The programme will culminate with the demonstration of a fuel cell with peak output of more than 30KW. It will also produce conceptual designs which will lead to both commercial and military applications of solid oxide fuel cell technology. Mr Frank Bakos, vice president and general manager of the Westinghouse power generation business unit, says: 'This technology's high efficiency and very low emissions will make it an important power generation resource in the coming decades.'</p>

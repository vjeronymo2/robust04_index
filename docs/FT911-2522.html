			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Rent review issue can be re-litigated ARNOLD AND OTHERS v NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Griffiths, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Lowry): April 25 1991 A LESSEE is not barred from seeking judicial construction, for the second time, of a rent review clause, if there are special circumstances justifying re-litigation ofthe issue, in that there has been a change in the law since the earlier proceedings and the decision, which was plainly wrong, leads to injustice. The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendant landlord, National Westminster Bank plc, from a Court of Appeal decision on a preliminary issue, that the plaintiff lessees, Mr Michael John Arnold and others, were not barred from re-litigating the construction of a rent review clause. LORD KEI TH said that National Westminster was the landlord of premises in Fetter Lane let to a firm of chartered accountants. The lease was for 32 years, expiring June24 2008. It provided for an initial yearly rent of Pounds 800,000 subject to review on June 24 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2004. The rent from each review was whichever was the greater of the preceding rent and the 'fair market rent' at review date. The 'fair market rent' was defined as meaning 'suchamount as shall represent a yearly rent at which the demised premises might reasonably be expected to be let at the relevant review date in the open market .  . ' When the first review date came up in 1983 it was referred to an arbitrator. There was a dispute as to whether, under the definition of 'fair market rent', the rent for the hypothetical lease for the residue of the unexpired term was to be fixed on the basis (a) that it contained the same rent review provisions as the actual lease, or (b) that it contained no review provisions. The arbitrator decided that the hypothetical lease should be treated as containing the rent review provisions, and fixed the rent at Pounds 1m per annum. In case hewas wrong, he determined that if the hypothetical lease contained no rent review provision, the rent would be Pounds 0.2m. The landlord appealed. Mr Justice Walton held that the arbitrator was wrong and that the hypothetical lease should be treated as not containing any provision for rent review, so that the rent payable was Pounds 1.2m. He refused leave to appeal, and refused to certify a question of law of general public importance to be considered by the Court of Appeal. The lessees then sought to appeal against the refusal to grant a certificate, but the Court of Appeal held it had no jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal. In the subsequent case of British Gas v Universities Superannuation Scheme (1986) 1 WLR 398 Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, vice-chancellor, had to consider a somewhat similar rent review clause. He said the correct approach was that, in the absence of clear words requiring the rent review provisions to be disregarded, and in the absence of special circumstances, the rent review clause should be construed to give effect to its underlying commercial purpose by requiring future rent reviews to be taken into account. That approach had been approved by the Court of Appeal (see Equity and Law Life Assurance (1987) 1 EGLR124; Basingstoke and Deane BC (1988) 1 WLR 348). There were therefore powerful grounds for the view that Mr Justice Walton wrongly construed the rent review clause. In 1988 the lessees sought to reopen the question of construction. They brought an action for rectification of the lease, and for a declaration as to the true construction of the clause. National Westminster applied to strike out the construction claim, on the ground that the lessees were barred by issue estoppel from re-litigating the point. The matter came before the vice-chancellor. He took the view that special circumstances could prevent an issueestoppel from arising; that such special circumstances included the situation where relevant new material, not available at the time of the first decision, hadsince come to light; and that such new material might include not only the discovery of new facts, but also a change in the law. He said 'the question is whether, given subsequent change in the law indicating that the earlier decision was wrong, the injustice of holding the plaintiff in the second action bound by the erroneous decision in law in the first action, outweighs the hardship to the other party in having to relitigate the matter, and the public interest in the finality of legal proceedings'. He had no doubt that justice did require the matter to be re-litigated. The relevant factors were: (i) there was a continuing contractual relationship of landlord and tenant which would regulate four further rent reviews; (ii) unlike the ordinary case of prior decision by a judge, Mr Justice Walton's decision was not subject to appeal because of the peculiarities of procedure applicable to appeals from arbitrators; (iii) the decision whether or not to permit an appeal was the decision of Mr Justice Waltonhimself; (iv) subsequent decisions such as Equity and Law Life made it stronglyarguable that Mr Justice Walton's decision was wrong. The Court of Appeal affirmed his judgment on substantially the same grounds. National Westminster now appealed. There was a distinction between cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. Cause of action estoppel arose where the cause of actionin later proceedings was identical to that in earlier proceedings between the same parties involving the same subject matter. In such a case the bar was absolute in relation to all points decided, unless fraud or collusion was alleged. Issue estoppel might arise where an issue forming a necessary ingredient in acause of action had been decided and, in subsequent proceedings between the same parties on a different cause of action, one party sought to re-open that issue. In Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, a case of cause of action estoppel, vice-chancellor Wigram, in a statement which had been held to be applicable also to issue estoppel (see Brisbane (1979) AC 411,425), observed that there might be 'special circumstances' where estoppel did not operate. The present case was concerned with the nature of such special circumstances. There appeared to be no decided case where issue estoppel had been held not to apply by reason that in later proceedings a party had brought forward further relevant material which he could not by reasonable diligence have adduced in the earlier proceedings. There was however, an impressive array of dicta of high authority in favour of that possibility. The House should affirm that there might be special circumstances where further material became available which could not by reasonable diligence have been adduced in earlier proceedings. The question was whether the further relevant material was confined to fact, or included change in the law. There was no right of appeal against Mr Justice Walton's judgment because he refused to grant a certificate that the case included a question of law of general public importance. There could be little doubt that he was wrong in that refusal, as was shown in the large volume of litigation on construction of rent review clauses and decisions in that field. Anyone not possessed of a strictly legalistic turn of mind would think it most unjust that a tenant should be faced with a succession of rent reviews over 20 years, all proceeding on a construction of his lease which was highly unfavourable to him and was generally regarded as onerous. Estoppel per rem judicatum (by previousjudicial decision), whether cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel, was essentially concerned with preventing abuse of process. In the present case abuse of process would be favoured rather than prevented by refusing the lessees permission to reopen the disputed issue. The vice-chancellor was right when he said that a change in the law subsequent to the first decision was capableof bringing the case within the exception to issue estoppel. Special circumstances required the lessees to be able to re-open the question of construction decided against them by Mr Justice Walton, his decision being plainly wrong. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For National Westminster: Terence Cullen QC and Hazel Williamson QC (Stephenson Harwood). For the lessees: James Munby QC and Jonathan Gaunt QC (Freshfields).</p>

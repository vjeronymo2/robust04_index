			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, emigrants, who in the  past carried out acts of violence against Cuba, stressed the  importance of the meeting they are attending here on the island  in search of normalizing ties between the country and its  citizens who live abroad.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Huguet, former member  of the Alpha 66 group, stressed that the theory of violence as  the way to solve Cuban problems has been irreversibly defeated,  thus confirming the opinion of a majority of the Cuban community  living in the United States expressed during a recent poll.    Those who defend the idea of war are desperate despite the  control exerted on the Miami media and the hopes of those with  extreme positions who want to protect their economic profits,  Huguet said.    Huguet also stressed the increase in support by U.S.  congressmen who are demanding an end to the U.S. blockade of  Cuba as the initial step toward improving bilateral relations.    The former Alpha 66 member also believes the future of his  country of origin is very positive and described that the  current "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference as historical.  The conference was convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry and  more than 200 emigrants, from various countries throughout the  continent [as received], are attending.    Meanwhile, Luis Tornes, a man who participated in the foiled  Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, admitted the failure of the use of  weapons, which he himself used on occasion, and stressed the  progress being made by those who support the normalization of  ties between the emigrants and the homeland.    Regarding the differences between Cuba and the United  States,  Tornes said Washington must realize that the island is not part  of its territory. "We are a free, independent, and sovereign  country," he added.    Tornes strongly criticized the spokespersons for the most  recalcitrant counterrevolutionary organizations in Miami, adding  that they are trying to use a sort of "radio violence" against  those who defend a just position regarding Cuba.    With regard to the conference, Tornes concluded by saying: I  have been working toward this for some time and now that it is  being held, I am very optimistic and sure that everyone will be  pleased with the results.</p>

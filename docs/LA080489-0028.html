			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOT AMUSED BY ANIMAL RIGHTS COLUMN  </P> <P> Was Jim Quinn trying to be clever with his "Around the Valley" effort (July 5)?  </P> <P> His snide attempt at belittling the animal rights movement by sneering at a  fund-raiser attended by a group of well-off animal rights proponents succeeded  only in demonstrating that he is limited, insensitive and, worst of all,  ignorant. If only more of the minds so tightly closed to the serious and very  real issue of animal rights were as easy to dismiss as that of James Quinn! As  it is, he and The Times may be assured that no such pathetic excuse for humor  as Quinn's unworthy, low-blow write-up will undermine the animal rights  movement a whit.  </P> <P> And, just for curiosity, since when do sunflowers have faces?  </P> <P> PATRICIA R. BJORKLUND  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Harmony Leisure cuts losses HARMONY Leisure, the USM-quoted operator of restaurants, pubs and hotels, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 2.13m for the year to March 28. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.45m to Pounds 5.69m. The result was after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 2.66m) of which Pounds 961,000 related to property write-downs. Losses per share were cut to 8.01p (13.83p). In his first report to shareholders, Mr John Main, chairman and chief executive, said that substantial progress had been made in restructuring the company and refocusing its principal activities. A property investment division had been formed and the group had now agreed to buy a portfolio of mixed properties from British Land, Mr Main said, further details of which would be announced shortly. In addition, the group had entered negotiations, which, he believed, would cumulate in the sale of most of its existing pub estate. The directors are proposing to offer one warrant for shareholders to subscribe for one ordinary share at 15p each in the years 1994-99 for every five held.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WEST LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Two dozen carnival masks from the tiny West African country of Guinea Bissau  are temporary residents in Ernie Wolfe's unconventional outpost of ethnic art.  The gallery has housed a fantastic jungle of painted metal plants -- not to  mention shows of Polish and Soviet art -- but it has never topped the current  assembly of masks. Measuring up to 5 feet tall and displayed on posts so that  they loom above our heads, the masks are a wondrous and terrifying forest of  weird faces that threaten to eat visitors alive. Painter Ed Moses has provided  a suitably ominous background of dripped pigment on dark canvas.  </P> <P> Wolfe, who travels widely and has a penchant for ethnic art that you won't find  in coffeetable books, bought all the masks from young men who wore them in a  pre-Lenten parade last spring. Made of papier-mache over clay molds, the  brightly painted masks are typically destroyed or discarded after the annual  parades. This show is likely the first American exhibition of carnival masks  from Guinea Bissau.  </P> <P> Are they great art? Not in terms of refinement, but the masks are  extraordinarily expressive. While each is an individual creation, the faces  share ghoulish grins, sharp fangs, curled horns and big, pointed ears. Little  people and animals often sprout on the tops of the giant heads. Human hands  sometimes emerge from the masks' hungry mouths.  </P> <P> Two themes apparently dominated the 1989 parade: health and world peace. A  bright-blue condom is displayed on one mask, while another boasts a little  doctor with his medical kit. The piece de resistance, however, is a mean,  toothy face that sprouts a veritable tower of peace. A nude male figure  standing on the mask balances the star of Guinea Bissau and a white dove on his  head while he waves Soviet and U.S. flags.

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Rules for claimants will be tightened - Benefits THE MEASURE The chancellor announced three changes to the benefit system which will improve the position of some low-income families but will tighten the rules for those claiming unemployment benefit and invalidity benefit. IN DETAIL The Childcare Allowance will permit low-income families to earn an extra Pounds 28 per week without losing any income-related benefits. The allowance, expected to come into force in October 1994, will apply to couples and single parents who currently claim family credit to boost their incomes. Family credit averages Pounds 42 per week but varies according to the family's average earnings and the number of children, among other factors. The Jobseeker's Allowance, which cuts the initial unemployment benefit period from one year to six months before the individual is means-tested, will not come into effect until the 1996/97 tax year. The Incapacity Benefit, which is expected to come into force in April 1995, would replace invalidity benefit. The new benefit, which would be taxed in line with other income-replacing benefits, would only be granted after 'tighter and more objective medical tests'. THE BACKGROUND The jobseeker's proposal was sharply criticised by John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. He said: 'The change in title from unemployment benefit to Jobseeker's Allowance is a clumsy marketing ploy which cannot camouflage the halving of unemployment benefit and the lack of jobs in the economy.' Industry sources estimated that the measure would reduce the unemployment figures by 200,000. The people likely to suffer most by the change are those who have made some provision for savings or have received redundancy money. Under the means-testing system, benefit usually is withheld from unemployed individuals who have savings of more than Pounds 8,000. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said the purpose of the proposal was to help people when they look for work. 'The Jobseeker's Allowance makes clearer the link between looking for work and receiving benefit. We will also be introducing a Jobseeker's Agreement requiring those receiving benefit to specify in advance the steps they will take to find work - and then to take them.' In addition Mr Hunt announced three pilot schemes to assist the long-term unemployed including a Jobfinder's Grant, which will give assistance to people who have been out of work for two years or more when they find a job. Details of all three proposals are expected to be announced today by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary.</p>

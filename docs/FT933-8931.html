			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Gas THE STRONG build-up of interest in British Gas shares evident since the start of this week intensified yesterday when turnover in the stock expanded to a hefty 21m shares in the wake of buy recommendations from many of the market's top broking firms. These were said to have included leading lights such as Kleinwort Benson, James Capel, SG Warburg and UBS. The weight of buying of Gas shares was sufficient to catapult the stock to an all-time record of 329p. The shares came off the top late in the session to close a net 13 1/2 higher at 328p. Since the start of this week Gas shares have risen 21p. There were lingering concerns that the recent bout of strong buying interest in Gas could have been triggered by a leak of the conclusions of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the gas industry, expected next Tuesday. The full inquiry into British Gas will be published in September. There have been worries in the market that the MMC might recommend the break up of Gas. Dealers also pointed to the very high levels of activity in Gas shares this week. On Monday turnover was a heavy 19m and on Tuesday reached 11m. Kleinwort Benson, in a buy note on British Gas, published on Tuesday, said that while it is dangerous to prejudge the MMC enquiries it believes most of the possible changes will have a relatively small impact on short-run profitability and that in the long run impact will be more than balanced by the growth in unregulated earnings. 'Gas's yield relative more than discounts the enquiry; given the downward trend in interest rates, the 6 per cent yield is attractive,' said the Kleinwort team. Other analysts adopted a more cautious view, however, pointing out that after their recent bout of exceptional outperformance, Gas shares could attract profit-taking, with one adding that 'the shares have offered an above average yield since the 1986 privatisation'.</p>

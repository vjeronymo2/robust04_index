			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / BT cuts price of Australasia calls British Telecommunications is cutting the cost of some overseas telephone calls in the latest phase of its price war with Mercury. From Wednesday a standard-rate call to Australasia will cost 70p a minute and a cheap-rate call 60p a minute, BT said. This will cut the cost of a five-minute, cheap-rate call to Pounds 2.92 from Pounds 3.36, representing a 13 per cent reduction. Mercury said its charges to Australasia remained cheaper at just more than 52p a minute standard rate and less than 45p a minute cheap rate.</p>

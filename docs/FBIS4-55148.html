			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) considers winning over 30 percent of votes in the  first round of the elections as a major achievement, which has  increased the Socialists' sense of responsiblity, Acting Deputy  Chairman Imre Szekeres told MTI after the MSZP Presidium's  session today. No matter what the second round brings, the MSZP  has become a determining factor in Hungary's political life, he  said.    The Presidium confirmed its previous position that coalition  talks should only start after the second round. The Socialists  underlined that such talks should be based on the compatibility  of party manifestos.</p>

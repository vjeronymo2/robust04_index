			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "CSCE: High Officials, Experts To </F> Move on Crimean Crisis"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- High-ranking officials from  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as well as  experts in economics and constitutional affairs are to be  dispatched to the Crimea in the hope of helping negotiations  between Crimea and the Ukrainian authorities, a statement said  here this evening.    Issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry because Italy is the  CSCE's duty president, the statement said a meeting of the  CSCE's committee of high-ranking officials in Prague decided  that a top CSCE official would be sent to central Asia for a  year on a "permanent liaison" mission. This posting and the  mission to the Crimea were designed as an act of preventive  diplomacy, the CSCE's "primary and qualifying" task, the  statement here asserted.    According to the Foreign Ministry, the permanent mission's  aim was also to act as backup for the experts as they seek to  ease talks between Kiev and the authorities in Simferopol, the  capital of the Crimea which became an autonomous republic within  the Ukraine in 1954. The aim of the talks is to improve power  sharing and joint moves to improve the Crimea's economic growth  prospects.    In the last couple of years, the Crimea, a peninsula on the  Black Sea with a major naval base at Sevastopol and place names  such as Balaklava and Yalta, has been seeking its independence,  or at least closer ties with Russia from which its ethnic  majority comes.    A major stumbling block has been the ex-Soviet naval bases  at  Sevastapol and other ports. Both Russia and the Ukraine have  laid claim to the ex-Soviet Black Sea navy, but now negotiations  to divide it seem to be on the right path.    Early this month, CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities Max  van der Stoel was shuttling between Moscow and Kiev when Crimean  and Ukrainian delegations were negotiating on the problems  raised by an April referendum in which Crimeans voted by a large  majority for closer relations with Russia, and by the approval  in May of a 1992 constitution with apparently secessionist  provisions, among them one allowing for dual citizenship.    "The ways and possibilities for finding a solution are  sufficient, the only problem is to want to use them" said Van  der Stoel, who was also full of praise for the Ukraine's policy  on ethnic minorities.    Negotiations are still going on to reconcile the new Crimean  constitution with Ukraine's, without touching Ukrainian  territorial integrity, a basic principle reasserted today by the  CSCE, which reiterated its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty  and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its frontiers.    According to the statement here, the CSCE also called on the  Crimean authorities to avoid any act that could aggravate the  situation and endanger negotiations.    The meeting in Prague also began preparations for the CSCE  summit to be held in Budapest in December, an occasion to which  South Korea will also be invited as an observer.    (Italian Ambassador Paolo Bruno, who chaired the meeting in  Prague, told reporters there that other decisions and  recommendations covered joint CSCE-Commonwealth of Independent  States monitoring missions in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh as  well as CSCE monitoring in Moldova and Bosnia.)    (He said the meeting also decided to return the missions to  Voivodina and Kosovo.)    (The Vatican delegation asked for Serbia-Montenegro's  readmission. The federated republic was suspended because of  the Bosnian war.)    (The ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia was also kept in its  status as observer due to Greek opposition to full membership.)</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sony's lean new manufacturing machine - Steven Butler on a second revolution wrought by the Japanese electronics producer SONY, the trail-blazer of Japan's post-war consumer electronics industry, is famous for rapid product innovation - churning out hundreds of new products incorporating the latest technology and design. Now it is revolutionising the electronics industry in another way - by adopting lean manufacturing. This year, Sony has cut by about two-thirds the time needed to assemble a video recorder. The significance of Sony's new style of production management goes beyond the obvious reduction in manufacturing costs achieved. The new focus is a sign - and an admission by Sony - that the fast-growing consumer electronics industry has reached maturity. Technical change in basic products has slowed to a point where there is little reason to launch new products every few months. As a result, product cycles will be longer in future, making it possible to organise production differently. Mr Yoshitaka Kato, general manager of production engineering, says: 'In the past, our eye was always focused on catching up on technology to make new products. But now, with the pace of technical change slowing sharply, 'we can concentrate less on technology and more on manufacturing the product.' There has been talk in recent months about the need for Japanese companies to cope with the current recession by lengthening product cycles to cut costs. Sony's innovation, however, is all the more significant because it is unrelated to the recession and, instead, reflects planning that stretches back several years. Sony engineers began to realise then that the technology for many products, such as video recorders, had stabilised. In 1988, Mr Kato was told to double production of 8mm video equipment in three years but without increasing production space. 'By the end of 1990 we doubled production by means of automation, but the cost was too high.' Sony spent about Y8bn (Dollars 64.5m) installing automated assembly equipment but concluded that manufacturing had become too complex and costly. Last year, Mr Kato set out to simplify the manufacturing process and opted for the 'lean' production system. Since adopting lean production at its VCR plants in Japan in January, Sony has achieved the expected results. Instead of keeping a month's supply of spare parts on hand, it now orders parts 48 hours before they are needed. The company has reduced by some two-thirds the work time needed to assemble a video recorder. Sony is also able to root out product quality problems quickly, since it takes less time to put together a finished product that can be tested. The system is being adopted throughout Sony's video division. Other manufacturing divisions of the company are now also starting to look at it. Mr Kato says Sony has not calculated precisely the gains in production cost or quality, but says they are significant. This raises the question, however, of why it took Sony so long to modify production. The answer is that lean production is suitable only when product cycles are relatively long. Lean production requires a higher degree of integration in the production process, and greater co-ordination among a large number of parts suppliers. It is, therefore, relatively inflexible as far as the basic production process is concerned. Mr Kato says that Sony has, in the past, had trouble meeting some needs of the market quickly, for example, resupplying a certain colour of television set that had sold out. Now, with production time shortened, and parts makers sending supplies on only a few days' notice, Sony can more quickly adapt production to meet changing demand. It also can, within limits, change housing designs easily to reflect fashion trends, without altering the basic product. The move to lean production implies another important change in Sony's strategy. In the past, Sony's products were technology driven, with product designers hoping new ideas would catch on with customers. Market research was often neglected on the grounds that consumers would not have a sensible opinion about an entirely new product. Yet, with Sony now having less new in the way of technology, Mr Kato says: 'We really need to study the needs of consumers more.' All these changes are signs the consumer electronics industry, and Sony, are reaching middle age. Sony will continue to offer new products incorporating new technology. But, for the bulk of the basic audio and video business, it will be more important to cut costs and meet consumer need precisely.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Moscow looks to Ecu for trade fillip THE SOVIET UNION is to discuss today with three of Europe's leading banks a payments system that could ease trade among the former communist nations of eastern Europe and help them to move to a free-market economy. Officials from Gosbank, the Soviet central bank, are meeting in Turin to talk about the concept with representatives of Deutsche Bank of Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy. These three groups have indicated general support for the idea, possibly through establishing lines of credit. The state banks of Poland, Czechoslavakia and Hungary are also to be represented at the meeting. An official from the European Commission, which may support the venture financially, is taking part. The system under discussion would use the Ecu, a basket of the main west European currencies, as a common financial unit in settling transactions between banks in eastern Europe that arise from trade payments. It would replace the system formerly used in eastern Europe for trade-based banking settlements, which was based on the transferable rouble. The transferable rouble was abolished earlier this year as part of the process of adopting western-style economic thinking in the former communist-bloc nations. Since then, trade among the countries in the region has been hit due to the lack of an alternative payments procedure. The Ecu-based system could start in about a year, assuming planning proceeds smoothly. It would use computers and financial procedures based on an existing Ecu payments-clearing system. It is thought that initially the east European venture would administer a far smaller total of transactions, involving about 15 commercial banks in eastern Europe. Later, it could be extended to incorporate transactions involving banks in western Europe, so bolstering trade between the eastern and western parts of the continent. According to one idea under discussion, the system could be run by a consortium of east European commercial banks, possibly with help from western partners. Representatives from four commercial banks from the former communist states have indicated an interest in this idea and are attending the Turin meeting. The banks are the International Bank for Economic Co-operation of the Soviet Union; Investicni Banka of Czechoslovakia; the Inter Europa Bank of Hungary; and Poland's State Savings Bank. Setting up the system would cost about Ecu1m. The meeting in Turin has been initiated by the Ecu Banking Association, a group of European banks. Mr Dominique Rambure, chairman of the association and a senior executive at San Paolo Bank, said: 'The system would be a step in the right direction of getting eastern Europe away from centralised economic planning.'

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Splendor in That Cottage--The FDP </F> in the New Laender Has Gambled Away the Genscher Bonus"]    [Text] When CDU [Christian Democratic Union] Caucus Leader  Juergen Scharf passes by the table reserved for the FDP [Free  Democratic Party] regulars in the cafeteria at the Magdeburg  Landtag he usually loses his appetite. In the past there has  been only infighting among the liberal coalition partners.    If a Social Democrat is standing nearby, Scharf pulls him  aside and gibes: "Look closely. You will not be happy with this  party."    The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] feels it has a  good chance of forming the government after the coming landtag  elections. Whether the Free Democrats will even be available as  coalition partners at that point seems most uncertain; their  entry into parliament is seriously threatened.    For the liberals in the east--at least in land  politics--things are going downhill. Although the most recent  Emnid poll still promises 9 percent for the FDP-East in the  Bundestag elections, the prognosis for the five land parliaments  that will also be elected this year is less optimistic.  According to the results of a poll taken at the request of CDU  Minister-President Bernhard Vogel, in Thuringia the Free  Democrats come away with only 4 percent. In Saxony they get only  3 percent.    Since Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is admired as a folk hero  by the east Germans for his liberation of the refugees from the  Prague embassy in the fall of 1989, withdrew from politics, the  eastern liberals have been without a draft horse.    "We still have no classic liberal voter potential here as  they have in the west," laments Saxony-Anhalt's FDP Chairman  Peter Kunert. Party Leader Klaus Kinkel blames the poor results  in the polls in the new laender on the "absence of a middle  class."    The principal blame for the wretched state of affairs,  however, is borne by the Free Democrats from the east.  Supporters of their policy are colorless. As one Bonn  functionary has admitted: "There are no fine surprises in the  east."    These days, leading liberals in the east are arousing keen  interest only in the justice arena. The Department of Public  Prosecutors is conducting investigations of Thuringian FDP  Caucus Leader Andreas Kniepert on suspicion of coercion, and of  Peter Kunert, the FDP chief in Saxony Anhalt, on suspicion of  breach of trust. Kniepert is suspected of having placed undue  pressure on an official in the Thuringian roadhouse affair;  Kunert is involved in shady property deals.    The lone FDP-East member in the Bonn Government, Minister of  Education Rainer Ortleb, was forced to step down last February  because of overtaxing.    Even so, things started out well for the liberals with  unification. Through skillful management practices they were  able to take over two coalitions right away: the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Germany and the National-Democratic  Party of Germany (NDPD), which was founded by the SED [Socialist  Unity Party of Germany] in 1948 as a catch-all for former Nazis.  Immediately after unification the FDP-East had around 170,000  members. But 140,000 of these later turned away from the party  in disappointment.    The liberals in the new laender have never established a  reputation in economic policy, a classically FDP domain. In  Thuringia, liberal Economics Minister Juergen Bohn has come  under fire for his passivity in the crisis surrounding the  Bischofferode potash works. Unions and employers' associations  alike have attested to the incompetence of this FDP member.    In Saxony the liberals, who with eight representatives are  the smallest opposition group next to the SPD, the PDS [Party of  Democratic Socialism], and the Greens, are seeking to attract  attention by adopting a staunchly conservative line. Caucus  Leader Ludwig Martin Rade willingly attacks the liberal left of  his own party, for example Bonn Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger because she rejects the deportation  of Kurds.    Rade would prefer to govern under Minister-President Kurt  Biedenkopf, but the Christian Democrat keeps himself sheltered.  The alliance Greens are possible partners if the CDU fails to  acquire the absolute majority in the landtag elections in  September.    In Brandenburg the party remains true, though apathetically,  to Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. The FDP, criticizes Mario  Quast, land leader of the Young Liberals, is "too concerned with  itself." Party members accuse Land Chairman Detlev Paepke of  being more concerned with his firm than with the land  association.    In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the FDP, which governs the  land jointly with the CDU, bravely announces that it will remain  a "reliable partner" in the future--it just does not know for  whom. Caucus Leader Walter Goldbeck, who according to the  SCHWERINER VOLKSZEITUNG is a "relative unknown," would gladly  continue the liaison with the Christian Democrats. But their  election victory is questionable based upon the current voter  atmosphere.    The liberal organization network in the east is full of  holes, particularly in the countryside. In many cities and  villages in Western Pomerania "the FDP does not exist," laments  Goldbeck.    In addition, the Free Democrats suffer from an increase in  the ratio of older members to younger members: The party's  junior organization, the Young Liberals, has only a few hundred  active members in the new laender. In Brandenburg there are only  a couple of dozen.    The liberals may face their greatest losses in  Saxony-Anhalt,  where the FDP received 13.5 percent of the votes in the 1990  landtag elections, thanks to Genscher, who was born in Halle.  Genscher's epigones have long since recklessly gambled away the  Genscher bonus.    For months a bitter battle over posts and sinecures has  raged  between the Saale and the Elbe. At the land party conference in  March Peter Kunert fought his way tooth and nail to the top of  the land list of party candidates for the coming landtag  elections. Many Free Democrats are unhappy with him for his role  following the Magdeburg salary affair, when Kunert called for  new elections, against the will of the FDP landtag parliamentary  caucus.    The party conference was barely over before FDP members  began  to doubt the legitimacy of the nomination of the candidates. The  land chief election official has already made public his  misgivings over allowing the party to participate in the  election on 26 June.    Kunert's opponent, Environmental Minister Wolfgang Rauls,  has  been on the black list of the FDP leadership since details  regarding his past as a member of the NDPD district control  commission were revealed. Halle native Genscher has reacted with  particular harshness.    Despite all of this, Party Leader Kunert radiated passionate  optimism at the land party conference. He drummed his point,  that the party is "stronger than ever before," into the heads of  the 300 delegates. Then he promised them "double-digit returns."    Hans-Dietrich Genscher remains the last ray of hope for the  eastern liberals. The hero of Prague has already declared,  however reluctantly, his readiness to once again do small time  for his supporters throughout the new laender.</p>

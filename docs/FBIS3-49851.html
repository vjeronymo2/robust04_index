			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking on the phone line from Geneva, where he is  taking part in peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate  Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  stated for the Croatian radio and television program "TV  Parliament" this evening that Croatia will put forward a  proposal to Serbia tomorrow which contains concrete conditions  for normalizing relations and mutual recognition. It will also  put forward a proposal to the Bosnian Muslim side on conditions  for the urgent cessation of all hostilities and elements for  drawing up internal boundaries.    As Minister Granic said, Croatia remains open to  negotiations  on the alliance between the two states, and hopes that progress  will be reached in one of these fields. He also added that it  is not realistic to expect a final agreement on  Bosnia-Herzegovina to be reached at meetings which are to be  continued tomorrow.    Speaking about the results of negotiations conducted today,  the Croatian foreign minister stressed that what could be  considered headway in talks with the Bosnian Muslim side was  that they have finally put forward draft maps and that they have  agreed to hold talks on the alliance between the Bosniak Muslim  republic and the Croat Republic as well as talks on territorial  settlement within the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We deem that this was important progress.    However, we are not happy with the proposals, but it is  finally clear what they consider contentious and what their  proposals to the Croatian side are, Mate Granic said in his  phone call.</p>

To borrow a metaphor from tennis, it can be  translated as: while Beijing sets the rules of the game,  Guangdong draws the lines of the court.    When Beijing last December announced a capital gains tax  with  a maximum tax rate of 200 per cent starting this year, the  initial reaction from Guangdong officials was that it was not  applicable to the southern province. And two months later,  provincial cadres knew how to play the new game.    Instead of bouncing the tax law back to Beijing, local  cadres  admitted that the new regulation, signed into law by premier Li  Peng last December, was as good in Guangdong as in other  provinces. But on the other hand, they also reminded foreign  investors as well as Beijing that any laws -- not just the  capital gains tax -- must take into consideration the concept of  "local reality".    The reality, as Guangdong officials described it, is an  insatiable demand for property -- both residential and  commercial. To catch up with other developing Asian economies in  15 years they must go full steam ahead to develop its property  market.    For example, under the Great Metropolis Development Plan  announced by Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu, the provincial capital  will expand to three times its present size reaching a total  area of 550 square kilometres by 2010. A total of 3.43 million  square metres of new houses will be needed by the end of this  century. In addition, the city Government will be responsible  for finding accommodation for the 38,000 couples expected to  marry over the next six years.    The market temperature was heated further by a commercial  boom in Guangzhou last year. Hong Kong real estate giants such  as Cheung Kong and New World Development have already queued up  for contracts in the city.    Such "reality", Guangzhou officials contend are a very good  reason why the city should be treated differently under the new  tax rule.    In a recent interview with the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, Jin  Yiguo, Director of the Market Administration Department of  Guangzhou Real Estate Management Bureau, said there were  "questions" over how the new tax rule could be implemented in  the regions. First, there is the question of the nature of the  capital gains tax.    According to Mr. Jin, there was no clear definition whether  the new tax was a central government tax or a revenue earner for  the local authorities.    "My understanding is that it is the opinion of the city  (Communist Party standing committee) that first the law will be  enforced in Guangzhou.    "Second, (we) must enforce it in accordance with the actual  situation in Guangzhou...and fully take into consideration that  we have already collected a land price from the investors, he  said.    "In principle, we should not add an extra (tax) burden on  investors and this is as much I can say (about the tax law) at  this moment," he added.</p>

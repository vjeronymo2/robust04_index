			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Partnership projects must be more equal Sir, Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, hit the nail on the head in his analysis of the government's private finance initiative ('Private finance projects need bigger return', September 7). Previous government statements have been over-optimistic on the extent of risk which the private sector is willing to bear. Companies have duties to their shareholders and in many cases there are far more attractive investments in terms of risk and return than large infrastructure projects. So the government has to make these projects as attractive and certain as possible if there is to be any real cost benefit in a joint venture. There is still a widespread feeling that the Treasury is anxious to shuffle off the risk element overwhelmingly on to the private sector. To combat this there needs to be a stronger sign that government is prepared to co-fund projects, particularly where social benefits are created. It is difficult to see how some projects will get off the drawing board without genuine public/private sector partnerships of this kind. A problem remains in the Treasury's accounting rules. It insists that if a private sector company builds, say, a toll road, it must bear the risk that tolls will not cover the costs. The Treasury is unwilling to 'stand behind' a company and bail it out if things go awry because the project will then count as public expenditure and so increase the public sector borrowing requirement. But if government will not underwrite projects or share risks more equally the private sector will naturally expect a higher return, perhaps 15 per cent or more. The Treasury still seems unwilling to commit public money to joint ventures in which the private sector stands to earn returns of this dimension.

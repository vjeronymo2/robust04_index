Basis and Purpose of the Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The practice of paying for order flow has generated much debate and controversy <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  regarding the potential benefits and harm to public investors and whether receipt and retention of payment for order flow compromises a broker-dealer's duties to its customer. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Congress has shown continuing interest in the resolution of that controversy. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The history of that debate and other background information can be found in the Proposing Release. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  In their response to the Proposing Release, few commenters suggested that the Commission not act at all regarding payment for order flow practices. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Most commenters supported the disclosure approach, with modifications. These commenters suggested that payment for order flow practices are a mechanism for competition among market centers for order flow. Many commenters argued that there is no harm in these practices. Others argued that disclosure to the customer adequately would address any perceived conflict of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> For a detailed discussion of this controversy, see Note, The Perils of Payment for Order Flow,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 107 Harv.

At the same time, however, the practice raises concern as to whether the customer is being treated fairly. Specifically, payment for order flow raises concerns about whether a firm is meeting its obligation of best execution to its customer. Not all market centers expose market orders to other order flow or attempt to improve the price at which market orders are executed. Thus, the decision to route an unpriced order to a market center offering immediate execution at the NBBO, could mean that the customer has lost an opportunity for execution at a superior price because of the lack of exposure to other order flow. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes disclosure that payment for order flow has been received and a description of whether the customer's order has an opportunity for price improvement will enhance investor protection and provide customers with information to evaluate more effectively the markets to which their orders are routed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Market 2000, supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 3, Study V at 3&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Rules adopted today represent a tiered approach to disclosure of payment for order flow practices in the broader context of broker-dealer order handling practices and the special relationship that already exists between a broker-dealer and its customer. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  The components of the Rules include disclosure at the time an account is opened, annually thereafter, and on the transaction confirmation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A broker-dealer's duty to seek to obtain best execution of customer orders derives, in part, from the common law agency duty of loyalty, which obligates an agent to act exclusively in the principal's best interest. Restatement 2d Agency section 387 (1958). Thus, when an agent acts on behalf of a customer in a transaction, the agent is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to obtain the most advantageous terms for the customer. Restatement 2d Agency section 424 (1958). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

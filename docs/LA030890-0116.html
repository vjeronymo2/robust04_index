			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: VALVANO NEGOTIATIONS GET STATE INVOLVEMENT  </P> <P> At the request of the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, a  representative of the state attorney general's office and a private lawyer will  help North Carolina State negotiate a contract settlement with basketball Coach  Jim Valvano, state officials said Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> Andrew Vanore Jr., chief deputy attorney general, will represent the state.  John Simmons, a spokesman for Attorney General Lacy Thornburg, said the school  will be represented by Raleigh lawyer Howard Manning, who specializes in civil  litigation.  </P> <P> Manning is scheduled to meet Friday in Chapel Hill with the UNC system board.  </P> <P> Chairman Robert (Roddy) Jones said the meeting may give board members a chance  to learn about issues "that we may not now know."  </P> <P> Jones told The News and Observer of Raleigh that he didn't expect negotiations  with Valvano to continue until after the board meeting.  </P> <P> The school reportedly wants to avoid a costly settlement such as the one  reached with North Carolina football Coach Dick Crum, who received $800,000  after resigning after the 1987 season.  </P> <P> Valvano has been under fire since former Wolfpack star Charles Shackleford  admitted receiving $65,000 while in school. Shackleford and three unnamed  former N.C. State players also were accused of point-shaving in an ABC News  report. Shackleford has denied the allegations, which are being investigated by  the State Bureau of Investigation.  </P> <P> If N.C. State fires Valvano without cause, it must pay him $500,000. However,  the payment isn't required if the coach is found guilty of a felony or a major  NCAA violation.  </P></p>

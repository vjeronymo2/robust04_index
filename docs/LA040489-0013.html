			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR POWER CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> A. David Rossin ("Nuclear Power: Small Risks, Big Gains," Op-Ed Page, March 26)  may well believe that the "technical lessons from Three Mile Island have been .  . . learned and learned well," but this conclusion is as misguided as his facts  are distorted.  </P> <P> In fact, as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has acknowledged, nearly  four-fifths of the nation's reactors have not completed implementing the  requirements that arose from the TMI accident 10 years ago. Unfinished items  include the very control rooms, instruments and control systems that Rossin  touts as evidence of nuclear power's safety. The NRC's top safety official  admitted that many of the unimplemented items have great safety significance,  and that he doesn't understand why they remain unfinished.  </P> <P> If the industry has returned to its pre-TMI level of complacency, unfortunately  so has the NRC, which has failed to act against any of the delinquent  utilities. Worse, the NRC recently argued (unsuccessfully) in federal court  that it need not consider certain safety matters at a Pennsylvania reactor  because the odds of an accident are "remote and speculative." So much for the  lessons of TMI.  </P> <P> Rossin should also learn how to read public opinion polls. The AP poll found  that 55% are willing to let existing reactors operate, but nearly 70% opposed  any new reactor construction -- a finding that is in line with every recent  poll undertaken.  </P> <P> The fact is that the American people wisely are unwilling to trade one  environmental calamity (the greenhouse effect) for another (nuclear power and  its radioactive waste). There are better alternatives: increased energy  efficiency to start, along with energy conservation; and further development of  solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy forms.  </P> <P> In an age where we are learning we must reduce our production of all  unnecessary toxic waste, it makes sense to stop producing the most unnecessary  toxic waste of them all: nuclear waste.  </P> <P> MICHAEL MARIOTTE  </P> <P> Executive Director, Nuclear  </P> <P> Information and Resource Center  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

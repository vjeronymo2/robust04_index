Mulino said: "Gelbard's statements are not specific and shed  no light on the faults committed by Panamanian authorities."    The foreign minister said "the administration's report does  not give names and places where the illegalities occur."    Mulino says "the case to which the document alluded was the  raid on the Gil Cafe Company, but added there was no sustaining  evidence in the fact." [sentence as published]    For his part, Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Manuel Faundes  cited "the strange U.S. attitude of discrediting Panama's image  before the concert of nations."    Faundes has stressed the national authorities' cooperation  against drug trafficking, a situation that can be brought up in  the face of any accusation on the part of the United States.    The magistrate has said "Panamanian international financial  centers have controlled money laundering, something to which  U.S. banks can attest."    A U.S. delegation is visiting the country and is being  escorted by Olegario Barrelier, president of the National  Banking Association (ABN).    This visit will last until 11 April, according to  Barrelier's  agenda.</p>

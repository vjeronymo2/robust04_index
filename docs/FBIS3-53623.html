			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F> revolution, on the occasion of Islamic Revolution Guard Corps  Day amd the birth anniversary of Husayn, the third Shiite imam,  to members of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps and the law  enforcement forces at the Imam Khomeyni mosque in Tehran on 16  January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [crowd chants: "We are all your soldiers,  Khamene'i. We are ready to receive your orders, Khamene'i," and  other slogans] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. On this great and auspicious day I sincerely  congratulate all freedom-loving and justice-seeking people of  the world, and particularly the great Iranian nation, the brave  youth of this land, and the offspring of the Koran; that is, the  dear guards of the revolution and you, dear participants.  [passage omitted]    Today Islam is flourishing in the world. Today Islam is  attracting nations to itself as the most brilliant and clear  source of hope. Is this a joke, after the passage of 1,400  years? It is due to the blessings of the uprising of Husayn  Bin-'Ali. It is Almighty God's wish that, for the first time  since the era of Husayn Bin-'Ali, the Koran should rule in the  Islamic Republic. Everything that has been done since Imam  Husayn's uprising has been an introduction to today for you.  All those scholars, thinkers, philosophers, and speakers; all  those efforts and all the Crusader wars -- throughout it all,  Islam was protected and conditions were prepared for today, so  that a government be created that is based on divine and Koranic  values. You, the Iranian nation, were fortunate to have the  opportunity to be trusted, for the first time, with that  responsibility. [passage omitted] This is not something that  will end. Do not think that the Islamic Republic is going to be  destroyed by the utterances of a few simple-minded wishful  thinkers who say it is going to end today or tomorrow. No, sir.  These foundations are not going be annihilated. [Crowd chants:  "God is great;" "Khamene'i is the leader;" "Death to America;"  "Death to Israel," and other slogans]    You and I will of course come to an end. Individuals do not  go on for ever. The best are those who guard themselves until  death. And some even fail to do that. There are all types.  Individuals are vulnerable to damage and destruction. However,  the basics continue. This Islamic revolution, this Islamic  revival has its roots in history, in 10 centuries of effort and  struggle. It relies on Islam, and for this very reason today --  at a time when, more than ever, Zionist and arrogant propaganda  has tried to portray an ugly image of the Islamic Republic,  Iran, Iranian people, us, and everyone -- popular attraction  toward Islam, in all parts of the Islamic world, is growing at a  greater rate than five or 10 years ago. Look at Islamic  countries. Look at Muslim minorities in non-Islamic countries.  Look at the harsh measures taken by the arrogant powers against  Muslims. There is a reason for such severity. If the Muslims  were like a body at the hands of the mortician, there would be  no severity.    I wish to state that the element of loneliness in the  contemporary movement has created a degree of similarity between  us and the movement of Husayn Bin-'Ali. Do not fear the  loneliness. Do not be scared, for Husayn Bin-'Ali and his  companions -- for whom we mourn and weep, and whom we love more  than our own children -- reached the heights of loneliness. The  result was that Islam is alive today. The events of Karbala'  [where Husayn died in battle] were not limited to a small region  but concern a large part of contemporary humanity. Karbala' is  now everywhere. Look at literature, culture, traditions, and  beliefs, and at people's hearts. Even the man who does not bow  down to God respects the greatness of Husayn Bin-'Ali. That was  the result of loneliness. He was the height of loneliness. And  today you are lonely and today the Iranian nation is lonely and  wronged. But its loneliness and meekness does not mean  weakness. We are very powerful today. No other Muslim nation  -- and dare to believe this -- is as powerful as the Muslim  nation of Iran. No other nation, be it small, large, or with a  population of 100 million.    Iran is alone in the world today. The power of the people  of Iran today is at its zenith; the same applies to the Iranian  Government. The government is very powerful, very dear; those  in positions of power in the world pay attention to the  Government of Iran. The people and the government are strong  and capable; they know what they are doing. At the same time,  they are lonely and oppressed. We are alone in the world today.  No power in the world supports us today. This does not mean  that all the powers in the world are lined up against us; no, do  not let our enemies get happy, thinking: Thank God, all the  powers are against Iran. Even if this was the case, it would  not matter. We have experienced such a situation. No, today  all the governments and powers of the world are not lined up  against us. There are many governments who feel that,  considering the material criteria that they have, it is not in  their interest to line themselves up against the Iranian people.    But no one helps or supports our people. The most powerful,  arrogant powers of the world confront our people, are enemies of  our people. They oppress the Iranian people, they do not take  their rights into account, they make accusations against our  people. They do not consider our people's good points, and they  make a mountain out of a molehill of our bad points. This is  the oppression and loneliness of the Iranian people. This  oppression and loneliness should make you stronger. I say that  this is a blessing from God. Some corruption exists, but the  structure of society is healthy. If we were like one of those  so-called revolutionary countries of the previous era -- today  they do not exist...[pauses] There used to be certain  countries and governments that were so-called revolutionary,  they were supported by one of the bullying powers of that era,  the Soviet Union, which supported them. If we were like them,  our people and government would have been corrupted. You see  today that the people and government have, thank God, remained  healthy. This does not mean that there is no corruption among  the people or officials; there is to a certain extent, but the  structure is healthy, the composition is healthy, the main  elementsare healthy; members of the society who occupy sensitive  positions are healthy. This is a great blessing. This blessing  comes from being alone, from relying on no one but God.    There are two trends. One is the trend of Islam, the Koran,  divine values, and spirituality, with the Islamic Republic at  its zenith. Officials of this system are standing up under this  enormous pressure, strongly and without fear or hesitation.  They are happy and do not bow down. This is one trend. The  other trend consists of all the satans of the world, all the  evil ones of the world. All the mischievous ones of the world  belong to the other trend.    There exists a division here. If anyone has any energy,  where should he expend that energy? If anyone has anything to  say, if anyone can take the initiative, where should he be? If  someone inside this faction of righteousness, or outside this  faction of righteousness, starts to wage a war on this faction  -- which is fighting mischief and evil to such an extent --  based on the premise that this faction of righteousness has not  paid attention to a particular point, or committed a small  mistake, error, or even sin, can this be right? Is this not  weakening divine power in the line of blaspheming against the  blessings of God?    Those who have nothing to say apart from utterances that  weaken the front of righteousness, weaken the officials, weaken  the government, the president, the judiciary, the Majles, using  any excuse ... [pauses] For example, they say: The judiciary  issued the wrong sentence in such and such a case; such and such  a judge said this; such and such a government official acted in  such and such a way. Rather than expending their energy to  confront the faction of evil, they use these excuses and use the  same energy to fight against the faction of righteousness. Are  they not blaspheming against the blessings of God? Don't they  deserve divine punishment?</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Israeli army accused of using 'death squads' THE Israeli army has become embroiled in allegations that it is operating a 'shoot-to-kill' policy against Palestinian activists in the occupied territories following a recent spate of killings by army squads working undercover in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In a dispute similar to a controversy in Northern Ireland in the 1980s over police killings of IRA suspects, Palestinian leaders accuse Israel of deliberately executing street-level activists of the four-year intifada, or uprising against Israeli rule. Of 31 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops this year, at least 17 have been shot by undercover squads. Last year about 30 per cent of the 109 Palestinians killed were shot by the squads, a higher proportion than the previous year. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) freely acknowledge the existence of the squads. But it strongly denies any 'shoot-to-kill' brief, saying the intention is to arrest suspects often accused in the murders of Palestinian 'collaborators'. It says some of those killed were armed and all ignored warnings before being shot. However, the army's insistence that its rules are strictly adhered to has come under severe question this week. An Israeli couple visiting Arab friends in the West Bank village of Dura, near Hebron, say they witnessed the shooting and wounding of two men painting intifada slogans by an army squad. Their story was prominently reported by Israeli media. 'We were sitting on the porch having dinner and then we saw three masked young men with pots of paint in their hands. Suddenly a civilian car with (West Bank) licence plates arrived,' Mr David Elimelech told the newspaper Ha'aretz. 'Several people got out of the car and shot bursts at the young men from a distance of two or three metres. They shot without warning. They shot without saying a word.' Mr Elimelech and his wife Aviva said when they realised the gunmen were soldiers, they protested, but were forced inside their friend's house at gunpoint, struck and sworn at. Their host said soldiers came to his house the next day, beat him and threatened his family if he complained. The IDF said the two Palestinians, who were not killed, were 'armed with chains' and had ignored warnings to surrender. It denied the Elimelech's were struck and accused them of obstructing and threatening the soldiers. The Elimelech's story nevertheless had a striking resemblance to the testimony of Palestinian witnesses in many other incidents involving shootings by undercover squads. It has highlighted the way army tactics against the intifada have increasingly concentrated on targeting what the IDF sees as a hardcore of several thousand activists. Palestinian gunmen yesterday killed a West Bank Arab doctor accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities, while in the Gaza Strip masked men shot to death an alleged drug dealer in unrelated attacks, AP reports from Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Jobless problem of skilled blacks HIGHLY QUALIFIED black and Asian people are more likely to be unemployed than are white people, regardless of their qualification level, according to an analysis of 1991 census data on race, qualifications and unemployment published by the GMB general union yesterday. The GMB said that black and Asian people were more likely than white people to be highly qualified, but they were more than twice as likely as highly qualified white people to be unemployed. The union said employers should be required to carry out ethnic monitoring of their workforce.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: CRA retains 10% stake in Pasminco CRA, the Australian minerals group, said yesterday it was retaining a 10 per cent shareholding in Pasminco, the Melbourne-based zinc and metals processing company. It has also undertaken not to dispose of the stake for at least 12 months, except to a trade buyer or buyers. The company confirmed it had succeeded in placing the remainder of its large minority stake in Pasminco. CRA directors said the company had sold almost 309.2m Pasminco shares, representing almost 39 per cent of its capital, to a large number of domestic and overseas buyers through Potter Warburg and Bain Capital Markets, two stockbroking firms. The shares, placed at ADollars 1.70 each, raised more than ADollars 525m (USDollars 383.2m), making the placement one of the largest involving an Australian company. The sale included a stake of 19.1 per cent in Pasminco which CRA controlled through an option agreement with North Broken Hill Peko, another Australian mining group. CRA had said it was planning to shed its Pasminco holding earlier this year, suggesting it would use the funds raised to develop the New Century mine in Queensland. At that stage, CRA gave no firm indication of how the stake would be disposed of, but said it was willing to consider offers for all or part of the holding. Yesterday, Mr Peter Barnett, Pasminco's managing director, said he was pleased that uncertainty over the company's ownership had been promptly resolved. He believed the wider spread of ownership would lead to maintenance of its current credit rating.</p>

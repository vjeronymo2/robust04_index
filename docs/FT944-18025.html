			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais share rise prompts probe Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, became embroiled with regulators yesterday as they examined whether new financial information had been released exclusively to a small group of analysts. The probe followed a sharp jump in the price of Credit Lyonnais's shares on Monday after an analysts' meeting on Friday evening, at which the bank had appeared to emphasis that the French government would continue to underwrite past losses. The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the markets regulatory body, stressed yesterday it had not launched a formal investigation but confirmed it had asked for clarification of precisely what the bank had told the meeting. It is against COB rules to provide any information to a small group without providing a public statement to ensure that all investors have equal access to it. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was appointed chairman of Credit Lyonnais by the government last year after its troubles emerged, told the analysts that all bad debts inherited from past management would have no impact on the bank's accounts from the start of next year. The clear subtext was that the French state would underwrite whatever provisions were necessary to keep the bank solvent - with estimates that up to a further FFr15bn (Dollars 2.84bn) may yet be required on top of the FFr10.1bn announced last week. However, Credit Lyonnais maintained that it had sent the same message to all investors at a press conference to announce its results on Tuesday last week, when Mr Peyrelevade said that current activities would be protected against potential losses due to bad risks in the past. Meanwhile, the ministry of finance and economy reiterated last night that there was no 'blank cheque' for Credit Lyonnais and that it could not guarantee support until it had full knowledge of the exact size of provisions necessary. Analysts were sticking to their position yesterday. 'Either all analysts are stupid, or Mr Peyrelevade said he had the backing of the state,' said one yesterday. 'The market is still convinced of this support, so I think analysts are not completely stupid.' The bank is in the middle of a public relations offensive following publication last week of half-year losses of FFr4.5bn.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An appointment with a select few - A new trend among recruitment agencies Scanning the appointments pages is like walking down the high street: the same names are to be seen again and again. Also like the high street, the old names have been replaced by new ones. In recruitment advertising, the Benetton and Sock Shop equivalents are the new 'selection' firms such as NB Selection, Selector Europe, Whitehead Selection, K/F Associates and St James' Associates. Striking ads from these companies now fill some 60-70 per cent of the appointments pages. Consultancies of this kind - mostly spin-offs from leading executive 'search' firms - fill a gap in the market between top level search, in which potential candidates are contacted directly, and the no-frills service offered by agencies placing box-number adverts in newspapers. The fee is usually less than for a search firm - 25 per cent of the successful candidate's first year salary compared with 35 per cent for example. Of the UK's top eight executive search firms, five have established fully-fledged selection operations. NB Selection, established by Norman Broadbent, was the first and now has 27 consultants in seven offices. Others are also establishing regional networks. 'We have set out to capture business which was being reluctantly passed to the recruitment advertising specialists. We were not sure they did a good job for our clients,' explains Nigel Smith of search firm Whitehead Mann. Search firms prefer to concentrate on pure executive search. But this is not suitable when 'the population of potential candidates is large, and the skills required are easily transferable,' explains Smith's colleague Nigel Bates of Whitehead Selection. According to Piers Marmion of Selector Europe, many of the jobs that would have gone to search are now being advertised through selection firms, partly because the recession has increased the number of candidates, while the European market has also broadened the field. How does 'selection' work? The client briefs the consultant, who puts out the ad, sifts the responses, and presents a short list, all in about a month. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed and appraised, references checked. 'The research and direct approaches to individuals made by search firms are replaced by advertising,' explains Nigel Humphreys of Tyzack, who set up TX Selection three years ago. Selection firms also emphasise the importance of their service to job hunters. They 'see candidates as future clients and are anxious to protect their reputations,' argues Nigel Rose of K/F Associates. All selection firms have found that more unemployed people are reaching shortlists, and Richard Boggis-Rolfe of NB Selection emphasises that 'we have no prejudice against unemployed candidates - John Major proves that a period out of work is no bar to future success]'</p>

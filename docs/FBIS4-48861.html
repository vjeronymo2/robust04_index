			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The fight for the control of ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] headquarters at  Tubmanburg has posed all sorts of problems to the Liberian peace  process.    At the end of last week, the Mandingo faction of ULIMO,  loyal  to Roosevelt Johnson, launched an attack on Tubmanburg and took  control of the city center, forcing Alhaji Koromah's Krahn  faction to retreat to the western suburb. Shortly afterwards,  an ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] convoy heading for Tubmanburg was ambushed and  a group of soldiers were taken hostage.    On this program yesterday, ECOMOG field commander Major  General John Inienger told us that, following negotiations with  Alhaji Koromah, he had managed to secure the release of some of  the ECOMOG soldiers, but that at least five others were still  being held hostage. Well today, Alhaji Koromah called us up  from Monrovia to give us his version of events for the last few  days around Tubmanburg. On the line, Heather Saleh asked him  what he had to say:    [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, the first thing is that it  is not true that we have lost Tubmanburg. Tubmanburg is under  our full control, and you can ask UN and other sources. We just  took a tactical retreat to the barracks, and then encircled the  enemy, and then we have driven them out of the place -- and many  of them have died. Of course, they were being assisted by  ECOMOG artillery, especially the Nigerian contingent that is  there.    [Saleh] You say Tubmanburg is under your control, but you  have had to, in fact, move your headquarters away from  Tubmanburg to Voinjama, and you said that the Krahns controlled  the city center.    [Koromah] That was the first day. We moved our  administrative headquarters to Voinjama because of the level of  insecurity in the Tubmanburg area. The military headquarters is  still there and that the city center area that was being  occupied by the dissident forces. [sentence as heard] They are  not only Krahn people, necessarily, OK? So, we have recaptured  the city center. It is under our control now. You can ask the  UN people. They will confirm that.    [Saleh] So according to you, there are no forces of  Roosevelt Johnson in Tubmanburg now?    [Koromah] In the first place, these are not forces of  Roosevelt Johnson. You know, this is misinformation. Johnson  has only been a public relations officer for these forces, and  he represents nothing. These are forces of General T. Kallah.  These dissident groups have been driven away from Tubmanburg,  and we are chasing them in the swamps and in the forest areas.  But the question of Gen. Inienger telling us that we hijacked  his vehicles, this is not true. He has been misinformed. These  vehicles, when individual Nigerian soldiers were fighting along  with the dissidents and they were captured, and we have three of  them now, and they have been confessing the news of some of  their higher ups who give them the command to get involved in  this war. [sentence as heard]    [Saleh] But you do admit that you are holding a number of  ECOMOG troops?    [Koromah] These people were captured along with the  dissidents, and I have promised Gen. Inienger that they will be  released very shortly. They were about 24 of them that we  captured. We have released 21 of them, and the other three are  being questioned to give us information, and they shall be  released very shortly.    [Saleh] When did you regain Tubmanburg?    [Koromah] Yesterday. Yesterday. In fact, we never really  left the entire city. It was just the city center, because we  did not want the citizens to get caught in the crossfire. So we  moved to the actual military barracks. [end recording]</p>

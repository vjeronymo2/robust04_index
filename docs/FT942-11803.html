			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Observer: Caracas to take the job? Antonio Casas Gonzalez could hardly wish for more testing circumstances in which to prove his mettle. The new president of the central bank of Venezuela flies in from London amid a full-blown bolivar crisis, to step into the shoes of the immensely respected Ruth de Krivoy. The latter's resignation, after a row over the central monetary authority's independence, unsettled international investors - who are far from mollified about what they fear is a political appointee in her place. A sociable type who was well-liked during his four-year sojourn as UK boss of the national oil company, PDVSA, Casas is also close to President Rafael Caldera. A couple of months ago, friends had expected him to return to Caracas with a shot at the top job at PDVSA, or perhaps the oil portfolio in the new cabinet, but those positions went elsewhere. Casas is of course an experienced and well-travelled man. In addition to his stint as head of the government's economic planning office during Caldera's first administration in early 1970s, he also sat on the board of the central bank for three years between 1972 and 1975. He had held diplomatic posts in Washington and worked at the Inter-American Development Bank before moving to PDVSA, where he rose to the position of chief financial officer. But while the Venezuelan economy is in far too much trouble for anyone to worry about the academic niceties of central bank independence, Casas will have to prove he is more than a Caldera stooge before any degree of international confidence returns.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / People: Bringing intelligence to bear on buildings Doug Oughton, a director of Oscar Faber Consulting Engineers, is the first chairman of the European Intelligent Building Group, which spreads the message across the continent about the merits of what is termed 'intelligence' in building design and construction. The EIBG grew out of the Intelligent Building Group, a co-operative that claims to have gained considerable momentum in recent years. It counts among its members consultant engineers such as Oscar Faber, architects including DEGW, Lloyd's of London as a 'user', a selection of suppliers to the building trade and a coterie of academics. The first European members in the expanded operation include Legrand, the French electrical supplies manufacturer. Oughton, who is well known in the industry and a long-serving fellow of the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, specialises in energy conservation at Oscar Faber. He will be chairman of EIBG for a year. While no-one can quite agree on a definition of exactly what constitutes the intelligent building, Oughton stresses that it is more than state-of-the-art technology. 'It is rather a case of looking at everything that improves the productivity of the workplace.' The Lloyd's representative cites for instance the dividends paid by flexibility - as when Lloyd's immediately offered a workable home to the Baltic Exchange after the latter's City premises were destroyed by the recent IRA bomb. DEGW has just completed a 1,100 page study devoted to intelligent buildings in Europe. While this started off as an IBG idea the group did not then have the resources to effect it itself. Now it would, says Oughton, who says such studies are an important way of influencing consultants.</p>

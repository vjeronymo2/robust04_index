			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Emerald Energy heads for USM EMERALD Energy is to be introduced to the USM next week in a Pounds 1.7m share placing which will follow a reverse takeover engineered by Mr Peter Winton, the former exploration director of Tricent-rol. Tricentrol made substantial discoveries in the North Sea in the 1980s before being bought by Arco, the US oil company. Emerald Energy is based on the Isle of Man. It will place 170m new shares at 1p each through brokers John Siddall and Son, and Walker, Crips, Weddle, Beck. Trading will begin next Tuesday. Its shares have traded under Rule 535(2). Mr Iain Alexander, who will take over as chairman, says the bulk of the Pounds 1.51m Emerald intends to raise will be used to develop US oil and gas assets acquired from Mr Winton's Cobham Oil and Gas for Pounds 500,000 in shares and options. The 46 wells on 4,200 acres of land in west Virginia are located in the Appalachian Basin, where oil and gas have been produced since the late 1800s. Many of the wells are not in production, but Mr Winton, who takes over as managing director of Emerald, says a combination of deepening existing wells and drilling 120 new ones nearby 'will open up significant reserves'. Emerald's strategy is to take advantage of the recent deregulation of the US natural gas industry and the higher prices which have ensued by seeking additional acquisitions of existing fields whose output can be increased without big capital investment.</p>

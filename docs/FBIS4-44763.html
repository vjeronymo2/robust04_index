			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Frederic Fassot report: "France Telecom Switches the Core </F> of the Public Network to an `All-Optical' Configuration"]    [Text] France Telecom recently unveiled its plan for  modernizing the French switched telephone network (STN) that was  launched three or four years ago. While the public operator  does not envisage any significant increase in its investment  budget for this task (each year it plows in 20-25 billion French  francs [Fr] out of a total budget of Fr30 billion), the  technological choices that have just been announced, however, do  threaten to change the list of the company's registered  suppliers. This is a game of musical chairs whose stakes run  into billions of French francs, since, for example, each year  France Telecom spends around Fr4 billion on transmission  equipment and Fr6 billion on public network switching.    The French public network, with the highest proportion of  digitization in the world (85 percent in switching and 90  percent in transmission) will therefore undergo massive change.  The changes announced, however, only concern the core of the  network (the transmission network) which runs from the five main  transit switchers to the 13,800 local centers. On the other  hand, there should be no changes in the short-term for the  distribution network, i.e., the links between the local centers  and the 30 million subscribers, which represent between 40 and  50 million connection lines. Thus, the changeover to an  "all-optical" configuration does not directly affect the  subscriber and does not therefore herald a possible "information  highway."  <H5>  National Network Cabled in Optical Fiber by 1996 </H5>   However, far-reaching changes have been announced for the  transmission network. Firstly, these changes could enable it to  handle the massive increase in traffic generated by the decision  to cable the distribution network with optical fiber to the door  of the subscriber. Secondly, these changes affect all the  network functions: switching (all switches will work by  time-division switching by 1998), transmission, and signaling  (where the network is controlled by the transmission of commands  between switches), without forgetting network supervision  (administration and technical management).    The greatest challenge concerns transmission, with the  generalization of SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) technology  and optical fiber: by 1998, the structure of the France Telecom  transmission network will be almost exclusively cabled with  monomode optical fiber, and as a result, coaxial cable and  Hertzien links will be dropped completely for this purpose. At  the end of 1993, the national network included some 12,000  kilometers of optical fiber cable, with 22,000 km on the  associated regional networks. This represented a total of  820,000 km of monomode fiber (since each cable can now carry an  enormous number of fibers). This figure will reach 1.3 million  in 1996 when, with 21,000 km, the national network will have  been completed, while the total length of the regional networks  will be 43,000 km. By the year 2000, two million kilometers of  optical fiber should be in service, with 80,000 km of cable for  the regional networks. These are mouthwatering prospects for  Alcatel and the SAT [Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications],  which have been selected to supply optical fiber. However,  where SDH equipment is concerned, it is harder to spot the  eventual winners. The adoption of this technology, which today  makes it possible to transmit at a speed of 2.5 Gbits/s down a  single fiber (the equivalent of 30,000 telephone lines) and 10  Gbits/s in three or four years' time, will lead to a complete  reconfiguration of the network architecture from an arborescent  structure to a structure of regional loops (about 100) connected  up to five major national branches, or, to use the France  Telecom term, petals. This loop structure will thus ensure dual  network access at all levels so that, if an incident is  generated on the loop it will be possible to automatically  reroute the traffic along the second branch of the loop.  <H5>  Suppliers to be Chosen Before the Summer </H5>   The first 2.5 Gbits/s-per-fiber petal will be looped up in  the autumn of 1994 (in eastern France, followed by the north).  By then, the suppliers will have to be chosen. The first  choice concerns the I/O multiplexors which make it possible to  catch data "in flight" at different transmission speeds without  demultiplexing, and then inject them into the 155 Mbits/s loop.  Each loop should have three to four multiplexors (or around 400  systems in total). A number of groups are competing on this  market: Alcatel, the SAT in partnership with Siemens, Secre in  association with the Israeli company ECI, Nokia, and TRT-PKI  (Philips). Suppliers could be selected within a few weeks,  although Jean-Pierre Poitevin, director of the public network,  warns: "No one is today capable of meeting the specifications  promised on paper." Then the suppliers of the SDH patch bays  (which do the actual switching) will be chosen. Alcatel and the  SAT have already been selected to supply the 2.5 Gbits/s  point-to-point transmission line systems on the petals.  <H5>  A "Programmable" Network for Dedicated Links </H5>   The other major innovation on the public network concerns  dedicated links. Until now, these links have been permanent and  built at the request of companies for the transmission of their  data. However, to reduce service costs by eliminating some of  the civil engineering costs involved in link connection, France  Telecom has recently decided to build a separate network for  dedicated links. Christened MDTN (multiservice digital  transport network), this network will be fully precabled in  optical fiber. A connection is then made by programming it in,  the physical link being already in place. This technique of  optical fiber precabling is also starting to be used to build  FOC's (flexible optical connections) for major professional  customers and densely-populated business districts. Already,  some 200 buildings have been cabled in the Defense business  district of Paris, offering high-thruput services (up to 34  Mbits/s). In 1998, 1,500 buildings will be cabled, and France  Telecom has also examined the possibility of cabling 5,000  additional buildings. Lastly, network control, or signaling,  will also be considerably modified. Initially, the data  required to control the network (the status and availability of  equipment, billing, etc.) were exchanged over voice links. From  now on, the Semaphore signaling network will be kept separate  from the voice network to increase the data exchange capacity  required by the proliferation of new services such as the  upcoming capacity to transmit messages in the course of a  communication, or to identify the incoming call number --  services which could thus open up new markets for terminals.    In fact, the general network will consist of four networks  one on top of the other: the voice and Semaphore networks, but  also an "intelligent" network and the technical supervision  network. Thanks to the "intelligent" network, new services  could rapidly be developed simply by altering the software in  the centralized database -- service modifications could even be  done in real time! As a result, certain instructions will no  longer be programmed into all network switches, but will instead  be placed in the central database which the switches would then  consult. This will greatly simplify the technical management of  the telecoms system.</p>

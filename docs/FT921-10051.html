			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: US lawsuit hits Bass shares SHARES IN BASS, the brewing and hotels group, tumbled 15p to 520p yesterday on news that it had filed a lawsuit in the US over the Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.23bn) acquisition of Holiday Inns in North America two years ago. Bass said that it had taken the action against Promus, the US-quoted casinos and hotels company which remained after the Holiday Inn business had been sold, 'to protect its right to enforce its claims for indemnification for breaches of warranties and representations'. The warranties and representations, given by Promus in merger and tax-sharing agreements relating to the acquisition, were due to expire last night. They cover various aspects of the condition of the hotel chain at the time of the takeover. Bass said: 'It is not possible at this stage to quantify any potential recovery from Promus under the claims for indemnification.' The group is already pursuing one claim in excess of Dollars 10m. Bass made substantial provisions in its accounts for acquisition costs in both 1990 and last year. The company said yesterday:'I can confirm that the down-side has been adequately provided for.' Analysts estimate that the US hotels contributed about Pounds 68m or 11 per cent of Bass's total trading profits of Pounds 616m last year. See Lex</p>

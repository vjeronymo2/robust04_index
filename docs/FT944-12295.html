			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Hytner's Don Giovanni - Munich Opera The Bavarian State Opera's new production of Don Giovanni is Nicholas Hytner's latest excursion into opera - an art form he is threatening to give up in favour of spoken theatre and film. The staging is simple, abstract and clear, does not overwhelm the music, and gives Peter Jonas his first solid success as intendant in Munich. Why, then, does Don Giovanni not come across as powerfully as it should? The polished singing cannot be blamed, nor can Colin Davis's inspired conducting. The answer lies in Hytner's own ambivalence. He sees Don Giovanni not as a morality play, but as an opera which questions social norms - offering no judgments, providing no solutions. Like Mozart's music, Hytner refuses to give indicators of good and bad. They co-exist, and we must draw our own conclusions. Bob Crowley's decor is painted blood-red from start to finish. Two featureless portals frame a succession of dropcloths in the intimate scenes, a curved tunnel in the ensembles - and provide a dramatic showcase for the arrival of the Stone Guest, accompanied by the Great Reaper astride a real white stallion. The all-red setting emphasises some pointed symbols - the hand of the almighty, the crucifixes of a patriarchal society. It also throws into relief Hytner's intelligent direction of the principals, dressed in black 18th century costumes. The cast works with concentrated poise - but the result is curiously bloodless. One reason may be the shortage of humour. At Monday's opening performance, the only laughs came when Giovanni tempted Zerlina with visions of bedded bliss - illustrated by a pop-up neo-classical villa. But the main reason seems to be that Hytner is too keen on maintaining equilibrium. William Shimell's Giovanni is neither a seductive anti-hero nor a villainous thug - he is a charmer who fails to achieve a single conquest, an aristocrat who indulges in bun-fights with his servant. Despite a flawless Champagne aria, Shimell is constantly in danger of being upstaged by Lucio Gallo's Leporello - whose leery grin, crisp bass and artless diction make him more naturally hot-blooded. Angela-Maria Blasi's Donna Elvira is no scatterbrain, but an Ann Trulove who loves her Rake. She is virtually indistinguishable from Sheri Greenawald's Donna Anna. Peter Seiffert's Ottavio makes do with one aria, but he sings flawlessly. Most personable of all are Rene Pape and Alison Hagley. Pape's Masetto is no pushover, and he has a rounded bass which should suit him for the title role. Hagley's Zerlina is gentle seduction personified: 'Batti, batti' was outstanding. And so was the conducting. There was more life, humanity and fear of death in the overture than anything in this summer's Salzburg production and Sir Colin realises the full symphonic weight of the penultimate scene.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy by </F> Jean-Francois Couvrat; place and date not given: "Sarkozy  Tightens Up 1994 Budget"]    [Text] [Couvrat] The government has announced a lot of new  spending since January. How will you maintain your budgetary  objectives this year?    [Sarkozy] When we came to government, the French economy was  in a deep recession. We therefore had to completely reshape the  1993 finance bill which the Socialists had left us and then  launch the Balladur loan. This is the gamble we took in  announcing a 1.4-percent growth rate for 1994. There were then  many observers who thought that we would never achieve that  rate. Today most have rallied round and the average growth rate  forecast by the economic institutes for this year is 1.4  percent. For several weeks, all the indications have been that  the economic machinery is starting up again. Manufacturing  production apparently grew by 2.4 percent in the first quarter,  even if it stagnated in March. Job offers have increased by 38  percent. Redundancies have fallen by 19 percent. Finally, the  most spectacular thing is that, for the first time since 1990,  20,700 more jobs were created than were lost in the first  quarter. Who would have thought that was possible just a few  months ago?    [Couvrat] What is your objective?    [Sarkozy] Our objective is twofold. We must fund the  government's priorities: the fight against unemployment, which  is our absolute priority; security, urban, and regional  development policies. But we must also ensure that the aim of  reducing public deficits is strictly respected. Because,  contrary to the false idea which sometimes circulates, it is the  accumulation of public deficits which could jeopardize the  emerging growth. Deficits increase long-term interest rates;  they are a source of anxiety for the future, whereas we must  encourage demand by reassuring it; finally, if the state borrows  too much, that is money which private investors will not have.  The budgetary limitations will therefore be maintained.  Consequently, we must control the deficits. This is a formal  request from the prime minister. The 1994 budget deficit will  not exceed 301 billion francs [Fr]. And the deficit forecast in  the draft 1995 budget will be around Fr275-280 billion.    [Couvrat] Will you have to cut into the budgets of some  ministries this year to finance the new expenditures which have  been announced?    [Sarkozy] There are two bad courses of action which can be  taken. The first is to set a ceiling on all the budgets,  without thinking about the government's priorities, which would  deprive it of all credibility. The second consists of spending  without counting and without worrying about how to fund it.  Here, you find yourself in the situation which we inherited from  the Socialists, which led to the worst recession ever since the  war.    We chose the path of reason. It consists of guaranteeing all  new expenditures by economies in public spending. We already  did that at the beginning of April. An advance decree made it  possible Fr2.2 billion in savings on all ministries, to fund  Fr2.2 billion in new expenditures: aid to fishermen, automobile  subsidies, safety measures in the schools.    Still on the subject of the 1994 budget, we must now finance  the other new expenditures: the youth employment subsidy, i.e.,  between Fr2 and Fr3 billion, and the measures accompanying the  devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. It  should be noted that the new funding allocated to the police,  the legal system, regional development, and even the  implementation of the military programming law will only take  place from 1995 and will be spread out. Moreover, we expect  around Fr10 billion in additional fiscal revenue this year  compared with the forecasts.    [Couvrat] What savings will you make?    [Sarkozy] The prime minister has just authorized me to carry  out a budget adjustment of Fr7 billion over a base of Fr118  billion. These are current operational funds or subsidies which  the ministries will not be able to spend without justifying  every franc. Anything which is not vital will be canceled.  Everybody must understand that failing to reduce the deficits  is running the risk of stifling growth. All the European  countries have made the same choice. It should be noted that in  our case, we are doing it without increasing the compulsory  deductions, unlike the British Government, the only country in  the Community whose growth forecasts for 1995 have been lowered  after it had to propose a substantial tax increase.    [Couvrat] If new savings finance new expenditures, why  privatize the AGF [French General Insurance Company] this year?    [Sarkozy] We are privatizing the AGF in order to be able to  renew the capital of the public enterprises, especially Air  France, which should receive Fr10 billion this year, then Fr5  billion in 1995, and another Fr5 billion in 1996. Moreover, I  find it difficult to see how the European Commission could  prevent us from saving as important an enterprise as Air France,  after the efforts which the staff have been asked and have  agreed to make. The government's European choices are  well-known. That is why we cannot afford to be either weak or  naive.    [Couvrat] Is the announcement of this budgetary adjustment  not intended to reassure our German partners, worried by the  loss of control over public spending in France?    [Sarkozy] No. The aim is to pursue the economic policy in  which we believe. I would like to add that the pace of economic  activity is virtually the same on both sides of the Rhine. In  France and in Germany, the recovery is being led by foreign  trade and investment. As for the efforts made by our partners  to balance their accounts, they are naturally worthy of praise.  But the action we launched in 1993 was equally spectacular in  its efficacy and content. We reduced our deficit by 1.2 percent  of GDP! The social security deficit will thus be halved  compared with the underlying deficit. Unemployment insurance  will generate a surplus this year. As for the budget deficit, it  is and will continue to be reduced. Between 1993 and 1995 it  will be reduced by Fr65 billion!    [Couvrat] The Germans criticize the French Government, above  all, because it has increased public debt, with the elimination  of the one-month lag in VAT [reimbursement of value-added-tax]  in particular, without it appearing in the budget.    [Sarkozy] I do not accept that criticism, which, moreover, I  have not heard from our German partners. The reimbursement of  the one-month VAT lag has enabled thousands of enterprises to  survive. This debt to businesses existed already, if not in the  state's accounts, at least in the accounts of those who had been  waiting for reimbursement for years. In France and in Germany,  moreover, everybody has his accounting conventions. For  instance, the deficit of the [German] Trust Agency, which funds  investments in the East, does not appear in the German public  deficit. Who is the most open? The one who reintroduces into  the state accounts a debt which ought to have been there, or the  one who takes out of the state accounts a debt which is not  there? All in all, the French public deficit will amount to 5.4  percent of GDP in 1994 and 4.2 percent in 1995, compared with  5.3 percent and 4.2 percent respectively in Germany.    [Couvrat] But what is your answer to the foreign investors  who seem to share the anxiety of the German authorities?    [Sarkozy] There is no reason to be worried. The deficits  will not increase. The government's priorities will be funded.  French growth is starting again on a sound basis. We know that  there is money in savings accounts and money in businesses.  Everything is in place for strong growth to resume. The  nervousness of the financial markets depends very largely on a  bad analysis of the situation, which means that the U.S. economy  and the European economy are treated in the same way. Is there  a risk of the recovery in the United States leading to a new  increase in inflation? I would refrain from giving a verdict on  that. What I do know is that there is no risk of inflation in  Europe. And, to say the least, we are not worried about too  rapid a recovery. There is no objective reason why the pressure  on interest rates in Europe should continue.    That is why we are determined to reduce the budget deficit.  Advocates of an unlimited deficit must shoulder their  responsibilities. They must therefore explain to us how, with  public accounts which are not well kept, it would be possible to  maintain interest rates; and how, with rising interest rates,  the economic recovery could last. A different policy is  certainly possible. But I do not think that it would produce  better results than the policy implemented over the past year by  Edouard Balladur.    [Couvrat] Did the increase in household contributions last  year not curb the economy too strongly?    [Sarkozy] That was one of the great debates at the time. It  was explained to us that increasing the CSG [General Social  Contribution] was likely to postpone all the prospects of  growth. The facts proved us right. I do not regret the fact  that we increased the CSG immediately. Because it was a painful  operation which cannot constantly be repeated, it is now forcing  us to find savings in health insurance.    Those who reject that must be prepared to explain to the  country that the CSG must be increased again. For the  government, matters are clear: There will be no new increase in  the CSG. The only path which can be envisaged is that of  savings.    [Couvrat] Do you regret the fact that you had to adapt your  budget policy to the constraints of an excessively restrictive  monetary policy?    [Sarkozy] It was obviously necessary for us to adapt. There  is no good budget policy in absolute terms. A good budget  policy must be adapted to the economic situation of the moment.  As for monetary policy, I leave it to the theoreticians to  decide whether or not it is too restrictive. Finally, interest  rates have dropped spectacularly, and the economy is taking off  again. This is the essential thing. I therefore do not  understand the continuation of the controversy on this subject  now.    [Couvrat] In 1995, how much room to maneuver will you have  for public finances?    [Sarkozy] Our room to maneuver will not be great. The  recovery is being led by exports and investments, which do not  increase the state's main revenue -- VAT. In addition, we will  continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis. Moreover,  this makes the debate on passive spending on unemployment, which  some people would like to turn into active spending for  employment, unrealistic. But who would suggest reducing the  benefits paid to the unemployed and those who have had to retire  early?    [Couvrat] When will you succeed in making savings on social  security spending?    [Sarkozy] We have already done so. We will continue to do  so. If we want to maintain the French people's social benefits,  we must continue the vital effort to achieve medical control of  health spending. It is not emergency services which worry us:  The increase in costs in this sphere is consistent with the  agreement reached between the social affairs minister and the  professionals. On the other hand, spending on drugs increased by  7.2 percent in 1993, which is equivalent to a spontaneous  increase of 10 percent, partly disguised by the reduction in  reimbursements decided last year. And hospital spending has  also increased by 7 percent over 12 months.    If we do not want to increase compulsory contributions, we  have no other course but to control spending. But we will not  succeed in doing that without convincing the professionals  concerned: doctors, members of the drug industry, and hospital  staff. It is with them that we will succeed.    [Couvrat] The prime minister has just suggested a reform of  social security funding which, with regard to contributions,  would replace methods of funding based on consumption or income.  Is this the right time to reduce income tax, as you have  promised to do for 1995?    [Sarkozy] In 1993, we carried out a first stage in this  reduction by returning Fr19 billion to the French people. That  was a good initiative. The first reduction of Fr6 billion,  which took effect with the first interim tax payment, is not  unconnected with the good economic indicators. The remaining  amount, in other words Fr13 billion, will be implemented on the  final one-third of taxes due.    Should we go further? I am convinced that the income tax  reform must be continued. But should it be continued as of 1995  or later? The question is this: For what should we use the  margins which the new-found growth will give us? This is the  heart of the debate. I am listening. I am gathering views. I  am listening to the arguments of those like Jacques Barrot or  Christian Poncelet, who propose to defer the reform, not to use  the room to maneuver which is available for cutting income tax,  but rather for reducing social security costs in order to create  jobs. I will participate in this debate. This matter has not  been decided. The majority will have to debate it. It will be  for the government to draw the conclusions when the time for  budget adjustments comes, in other words during the summer.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Peru savours return of global goodwill: The financial benefits of recent elections AS the official vote count continues, it seems likely that Peruvian congressional elections held on November 22 have been enough to satisfy the Organisation of American States and, by extension, the international community that the country has returned to the democratic fold. This, in turn, should pave the way for badly-needed foreign funding. Japan made the swiftest and most enthusiastic response. Just two days after the election a Dollars 100m (Pounds 65.7m) loan from Tokyo, negotiated in March but frozen in the wake of President Alberto Fujimori's April 5 coup, was signed in Lima. It is assumed another Dollars 220m from the InterAmerican Development Bank, involving Japan, will be disbursed when the final OAS report on the elections is published. The Dollars 320m was 'a lifesaver', Mr Fujimori said. The credits depend on financial sector reforms, but since the Peruvian government has already carried out essential restructuring with its own resources the money can effectively be spent on anything. There was also good news from New York. In a lightning visit days before the election, Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister, managed to convince Peru's commercial creditor banks to suspend possible lawsuits over non-payment of debt. Mr Bolona and Mr Raymundo Morales, the debt negotiator, are due to start renegotiations with Peru's steering committee in February. Relations with other multinational organisations are also good. Peru has met, and in some cases exceeded, the quarterly target set by the IMF, and a new programme for the next couple of years is under discussion in Lima. Peru is to apply for an extended fund facility which will effectively clear arrears and open the door to fresh credit. Settlement with the IMF also lays the foundation for crucial negotiations early next year with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Peru, which owes Dollars 6bn, is the Club's third largest debtor and the largest in Latin America. But Lima managed to win a favourable deal with the Club in September 1991. Payments to the Paris Club this year were reduced to about Dollars 330m and, as with all other external debt quotas, has been honoured. But about Dollars 2bn falls due in 1993, which is clearly unpayable without significant rescheduling and some debt forgiveness. Peru has a tough road ahead, even with its elections over and the increased international goodwill. Predicted GDP growth of 3 per cent this year has turned into a similar deficit. Peruvian per capita GDP is back at 1960 levels; the average family has seen its income dwindle by 27 per cent since 1986. The 3 per cent growth now forecast for 1993 will, taking population growth into account, translate into a modest 1 per cent improvement. 'At this rate,' says economist Richard Webb, 'it will take a generation to get back to where we were six years ago'. Peru's balance of trade deficit for 1993 is also set to worsen. Liberalisation and sharply lower tariffs have provoked a flood of goods from abroad. Official imports this year will total about Dollars 4bn; next year they will be at least 4 per cent higher, partly due to extra expenditure on capital goods tied to various investment projects. Only a slight rise in exports is expected. Economists are forecasting a current account deficit of about Dollars 2.6bn for 1993, similar to this year. To help cover it Peru needs to form another 'support group' of friendly countries - the newly-elected Congress has already nominated a group of representatives to accompany key ministers on fund-raising trips abroad. Once again, Japan and the US are expected to be the key contributors, although Peru expects the Clinton administration to attach more strings to future financing than its predecessor. Mr Bolona, however, seems quietly confident that Peru will win international support. He expects to hold inflation next year to about 30 per cent and promises moderate 1993 reactivation, largely through an increased social spending budget which has earmarked some Dollars 500m for small construction and infrastructure projects and job creation. Public investment is also scheduled to rise from virtually nil to the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP. The Bolona team can also expect to count on broad support from the new Congress for ongoing structural reforms including deregulation, further reduction of the heavily-bureaucratised state, relaxation of labour stability laws and accelerated privatisation of state-owned assets. With the recent blows to Peru's economically debilitating guerrilla movement and a more favourable investment climate, 1993 could just be the year when Peru starts to edge out of stabilisation-induced recession.</p>

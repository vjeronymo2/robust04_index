			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL PARCEL TAX FAILS BY 4 VOTES IN  RECOUNT  </P> <P> A tax to benefit Beverly Hills schools fell four votes shy of passage,  according to results of a recount announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> The parcel tax measure in the June 5 election collected 6,862 votes, or 66.63%,  elections officials said.  </P> <P> Votes against the proposal numbered 3,436, or 33.36%. The levy needed approval  by two-thirds of the voters -- or 6,866 -- to pass.  </P> <P> Supporters of the tax requested the recount, done by hand, after a computer  tally last month showed the measure fell five votes shy.  </P> <P> The assessment on each residential and commercial parcel of land in the city  would have raised $4.5 million a year for the Beverly Hills Unified School  District. Its failure means teachers lose a 3% pay raise for the coming school  year, which was negotiated during the teachers' strike last fall but made  contingent on the tax's passage.  </P></p>

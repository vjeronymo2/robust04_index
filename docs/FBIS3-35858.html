			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chairman of the Crimean Parliament Nikolay Bagrov  told a press conference in Simferopol on Monday that Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk and parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch  took calmly the news about the victory of pro-Russian candidate  Yuriy Meshkov during the presidential elections in Crimea. On  Monday morning the defeated Bagrov had a telephone conversation  with the Ukrainian leaders.    Bagrov announced that he would quit politics and that he had  no plans to lead any opposition to the elected president.  Neither does he imagine any confrontation with the Crimean  parliament. However, he described Meshkov's election program as  unfeasible and recommended that the newly-elected president  amend it.    The possibility of holding a referendum on Crimea's status,  which the new president has scheduled for March 27, must be  evaluated by the Crimean parliament, said Bagrov. He also  pointed out that Crimea and Russia could no longer be reunited.    Meanwhile, according to Interfax-Ukraine's sources, Meshkov  is already forming his cabinet. The law on the president of the  Republic of Crimea gives him the status of head of the executive  authority. On Tuesday or Wednesday Meshkov is likely to go to  Kiev for talks with the Ukrainian leaders.    Vice Chairman of Ukraine's Popular RUKH Aleksandr  Lavrinovich  described the results of the presidential elections in Crimea as  "the defeat of the Ukrainian officials' authority." He told  Interfax-Ukraine that a referendum on Crimea's secession from  Ukraine might be held, presumably next spring.    He believes that the results of the elections in Crimea  might  mark the beginning of confrontation between Crimea and Ukraine."  [no opening quotation marks as received]    Ukraine's First Deputy Minister for Nationalities and  Migration Aleksandr Piskun believes that the results of the  elections were due to the Ukrainian authorities' inconsistent  policies. "All this poses a threat to Ukraine's sovereignty," he  said.</p>

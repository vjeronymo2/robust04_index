			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Romford brewery heads for Beijing Romford brewery, famous for its John Bull bitter, is to be shipped off to China tank, tun and keg to help slake thirsts in one of the world's fastest-growing beer markets. San Miguel, the Philippines-based brewer, has bought the complete plant and will re-erect it about 100 miles south of Beijing. It will use it to brew its own lager, which is one of the best-selling foreign brands in China. A victim of over-capacity in the UK market, the brewery was closed early last year ending nearly 200 years of production on the site, which was the original home of Ind Coope. Mr Iain Oag of Carlsberg-Tetley, the seller, said: 'It was a sad but necessary day.' The company pools the UK brewing interests of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, and Allied Domecq, the UK spirits group which today changes its name from Allied-Lyons. In addition to the Romford equipment, which can brew 1m barrels a year, San Miguel is buying a bottling line from Carlsberg-Tetley's Northampton brewery, which was closed a year ago. Carlsberg-Tetley declined to disclose the sale price. Much of the equipment dates from the early-1980s but some is newer. Most of it is small enough to fit in containers but one 30-ft diameter tun, a stainless steel separation vessel, will be cut in half and reassembled in China. China's annual beer consumption is running at only 8.4 litres a head compared with 100 litres in the UK and 158 litres in Germany. But China is already the third-largest producer in the world after the US and Germany. UK consumption is falling by about 2 per cent a year. With production running at about 34m barrels a year, the industry is operating at over-capacity of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.</p>

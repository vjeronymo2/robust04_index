			<p>BFN     [Text] Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish left for  Morocco this afternoon to represent Israel in the final round of  GATT talks. This agreement is supposed to lift trade  restrictions and expand it by $300 billion per year. Israel can  also benefit from this agreement. The conference will open in  Marrakech tomorrow. It will be attended by representatives of  114 countries. Minister Harish told our correspondent Arye  Schorr he hopes to use the conference for holding contacts with  representatives of Arab countries that do not have relations  with Israel.</p>

The arrest of two senior members of the  renamed Party of Democratic Socialism for diverting $71 million in party funds  to accounts in Moscow has dealt a severe blow to the party's new reformist  image. The scandal also appears likely to hurt the party's chances in elections  for an all-German parliament on Dec. 2.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / BA and Virgin take steps to end dispute BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic last night took a significant step towards ending their bitter 'dirty tricks' row and imp-roving the badly dented relationship between the two airlines. A 1 1/2 -hour meeting between Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, and Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, was described by the two men as 'a very good first step'. Both sides refused to disclose details of their talks, which took place at Mr Branson's London home, but they are understood to have centred on Virgin's demands for compensation for the financial and commercial damage it claims to have suffered due to BA's covert activities. Further meetings will be held between executives from both airlines 'to resolve outstanding differences' over the next few weeks. The two sides appear anxious to prevent any escalation in the long-running dispute which centres on BA's earlier attempts to undermine its smaller rival. Outside his home last night, Mr Branson said: 'Everybody had lots of cups of tea and the atmosphere is a great deal warmer than a few weeks ago.' Although Mr Branson appears to have had the upper hand throughout the dispute, neither side believes it can risk prolonging what could become a long and damaging feud for both. BA is keen to restore its international reputation at a time when it is pursuing its ambition to become a global airline. It is trying to establish a partnership with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, which could be destabilised by any further legal action taken by Mr Branson. Last night the 'big three' US airlines - American, Delta and United - renewed their opposition to any deal by urging the Clinton administration to declare a moratorium on foreign investments in American carriers from countries with restrictive aviation agreements with the US. Mr Branson believes his legal dispute with BA has already taken up too much of his airline's time, money and resources. Any US antitrust suit against BA would prove a long and costly affair without any guarantee of Virgin's success. However, Mr Branson said after the meeting that his terms for reaching a final agreement with BA remained on the table: 'Nothing has been dropped, but we hope the next meetings will sort everything out.' Virgin went into the talks demanding compensation for the commercial damage inflicted upon the airline by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. Before the meeting, a Virgin official said the airline could have lost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m in revenues. Virgin is also seeking a commitment from BA not to exploit private computer reservation details. In addition, it wants use of BA aircraft servicing and maintenance facilities which were withdrawn from the airline five years ago. Sir Colin echoed Mr Branson's optimism and said he hoped for 'an amicable' resolution. Both men refused to elaborate on the talks but said they would meet again. They said there would be no public comment until then. The talks took place two weeks after BA publicly apologised to Virgin and paid Mr Branson Pounds 610,000 in a High Court libel settlement. Alison Smith adds: At Westminster, Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, accused the government of being 'paralysed' over the BA 'dirty tricks' affair. He called on ministers to say what they intended to do about the matter. Observer, Page 17 Lex, Page 18</p>

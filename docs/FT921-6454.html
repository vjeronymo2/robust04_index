			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Beith warning on minority rule - Liberal Democrats LIBERAL Democrats have stepped up their attempts to force a coalition government in the event of a hung parliament by warning of the economic damage a minority government would inflict on Britain. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, yesterday said a Labour or Tory government, unable to command a parliamentary majority and struggling to survive before calling a second general election, was 'a recipe for economic chaos and damage'. A coalition government, with an agreed programme of government, could help stabilise prices, Mr Beith said. During the pact between the Liberal and Labour parties in 1977-78, inflation fell from 21 per cent to 7 per cent, he added. Liberal Democrats know the two main parties will not willingly agree a post-election deal - largely because of insistence on electoral reform as a pre-condition for support. So they are anxious to increase the moral pressure on Labour and the Tories to form a coalition. The party has been encouraged by a report by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, which said that the worst outcome of the election would be 'a lame minority government which, eschewing formal pacts, limped along in a policy vacuum'. P &amp; D praised the Liberal Democrat economic policies as the 'most logically argued and the most sensibly radical'. It added: 'For economic performance, the better outcome would involve power sharing in which the Liberal Democrats pressed home their economic programme  -bringing out the best features of the Conservatives' policies or limiting the possible damage of Labour's' The Liberal Democrats will emphasise at a defence policy launch today that their past target of a 50 per cent cut in defence spending by 2000 is only an aspiration, and depends on a thorough review of the UK's defence needs.</p>

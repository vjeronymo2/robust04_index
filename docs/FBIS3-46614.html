			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the opening of the </F> fourth session of the Ninth National Assembly in Hanoi on 6  December]    [Text] Dear Presidium and delegates: You must have copies  of those government reports on its plans and state budget to be  presented before the National Assembly. These reports review the  implementation of those tasks set forth by the National Assembly  in its second session for 1993, evaluate the first three years  of implementing the five-year 1991-95 plan, present the course  of socioeconomic development for the two remaining years,  especially for the year 1994. The National Assembly will hear  supplementary reports on national defense and security, on  foreign relations, on mountain area socioeconomic development,  on the enforcement of the new wage system, and on the fight  against corruption and smuggling.    The report I am presenting before the National Assembly for  consideration will further provide an analysis of a number of  assessments and major policies.    I. Urgent requirements and ability to enter a new stage of  socioeconomic development:    1. In 1993, we have continued to further develop the  achievements of 1992, and fulfilled and exceeded all major  targets set by the second session of the Ninth National Assembly  in its resolution on tasks for 1993.    Generally speaking, in the three years from 1991-93, the  average annual gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.2  percent, which was higher than planned in the five-year 1991-95  plan.    In agricultural production, although there were a number of  areas stricken by natural calamities each year, we were still  able to achieve our development targets. In 1993 alone, extended  drought, typhoons, and floods occured in many central region  provinces, but the country was still* able to increase its  agricultural production output to 24.5 million tons of food  grain, thus attaining the target set forth for the year 1995  [year as published]. In those areas stricken by natural  disasters, prices continued to be stable, and production and the  people's normal life were promptly restored.    The production of various industrial and service  establishments belonging to different economic sectors have, in  general, adjusted fairly well to the market system. The annual  industrial production output increase was higher than planned.  Export values and budget revenue rose at a rate higher than that  of production growth. Economic relations with foreign countries  expanded quickly. Balance of payment was improved, foreign  currency inflow adequately met the import demands of those  materials and goods needed for production and everyday life.  Internal reserves have started to grow. Living standards of a  bulk of the people have been improved.    The constant growth achieved by many economic sectors in  various domains over the past three years shows that our economy  now has come out of recession.    Along with the economic growth, inflation was dispelled as  evidenced by the fact that the inflation rate for the first 11  months of 1993 was merely 4 percent. It is certain that  inflation will be at the single-digit level for the whole year.  Smuggled goods had some impact on efforts to reduce inflation  because they made the price of certain home-made industrial  goods less competitive. However, the main factors leading to  price stability were the growth of commodity production and  circulation, improvements in the regulation and circulation of  currency, and the increase in material reserves. This enables us  to make interventions whenever there is an unexpected market  upheaval. Although there are still unstable factors such as  great budget overdraft and small foreign currency reserves, our  inflation control ability, in general, shows greater  improvements than before.    In the cultural and social field, although many important  problems still remain to be solved, compared with preceding  years, there were better improvements in the implementation of  various programs -- such as the program to create employment,  the program to popularize elementary education and to gradually  improve educational qualities and the research and application  of scientific and technological innovations, the program to  expand radio and television broadcasting coverage, the epidemic  control program, the program to develop physical education and  sports, the program to do away with hunger and poverty, and the  program to repay the kindness of those who sacrificed their  lives for the country.    Generally speaking, we were able to overcome by a very  significant step the socioeconomic crisis. Most notably, we  overcame the economic recession, dispelled inflation, firmly  maintained political stability in a very tough and challenging  situation where there was no foreign financial aid and where the  U.S. embargo was still in place. All these achievements have  testified to the vitality and shrewdness of our Vietnamese  nation and people, and to the fact that the renovation policy of  our party and state has suited the reality of our country. These  acheivements have also demonstrated our people's strengths and  capability to achieve self reliance.    The success of the renovation process is inseparable from  our  multilateral and diverse external relations policy. This policy  has won the sympathy and support from other countries and  international organizations and has paved the way for the  integration of our country into the world community. The image  of a renovating Vietnam wishing to befriend all countries  received worldwide welcome and high appraisal, thus creating  favorable conditions for our international relations.    The following factors have further enhanced our position  and strength and created the necessary conditions for a new  stage of development:    A. A vast majority of our people trust and enthusiastically  support the renovation undertaking, regarding this cause as  their own because it works for the fulfillment of their goals.  Because the economy is well-motivated, it has encouraged  production and business activities across society.  Socioeconomic activities have not been in completely good order  or well organized. Nonetheless, we have succeeded in reviving  the people's dynamism and creativity and eliminating the  negative attitude created by the state subsidization system.  This is a very important factor in development.    B. The development environment has enjoyed the following  basic factors, which are more favorable:    -- First, we have maintained political stability; pursued a  policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation; and broadened our  relations with almost all the nations in the world.    -- Our success in checking inflation has created the  conditions for stabilizing microeconomic activities and reduced  the risks for development and investment projects.    -- Positive efforts have been made to amend and perfect our  legal system.    C. The material conditions for development -- though still  limited by the shortage of capital, technology, marketing, and  infrastructure -- still represent a great potential that awaits  future exploitation.    -- As far as our country is concerned, the economy has begun  to show an increase in capital accruement. Between 1991 and  1993, the ratio of investment capital generated by the national  economy was 4.8, 6.9, and 12.7 percent respectively compared  with the gross domestic product. This shows that we have  successfully put an end to the decrease in investment capital  accruement which occurred over the past few consecutive years.  The sources of capital among the people that can be tapped to  serve investment and development remain substantial (it is  estimated that in 1993 this capital amounts to 20 trillion dong,  of which 8 trillion dong has been used, mostly to cover housing  development projects). Our new policies and lines have created  a new stimulus in many sectors and occupational areas,  especially agriculture and the rural economy, where the people's  manpower and material resources play a key role. Along with the  state-provided investment capital generated by the national  economy and international development aid, we are now retaining  more and more material reserves from previous years. It is  possible that we can increase them quickly in the future.    Regarding the outside world, our ability to acquire capital  and technology has grown quickly despite the impact of the U.S.  trade embargo. The breakthrough in our credit ties with  international financial institutions has strongly stimulated  multilateral and bilateral international development aid. A  total of 22 countries and 17 international organizations sent  delegations to the recent Paris conference of Vietnam's aid  donor countries. These countries and international  organizations pledged to provide our country with 1.86 billion  U.S. dollars in development aid in the 1993-94 fiscal year.  Direct foreign investment has continued to increase. It is  noteworthy that foreign investment capital for 1993 reached  about 800-850 million U.S. dollars, twice the amount invested in  1992. The current pace of foreign investment capital inflow  depends mainly on our ability to receive and make effective use  of it.    The above-mentioned factors present tremendous opportunities  for development. Opportunity does not come spontaneously. It  comes through the personal efforts of our entire party and  people together with the trends of peace, stability, and  cooperation in the region and other parts of the world.  Opportunity would not have brought us success if we had not  seized it and developed it in time.    2. The new stage of development requires an effort to grasp  opportunities and the ability to understand clearly those  weaknesses, difficulties, and obstacles that must be overcome.    A. Our economy is still rife with many factors of  instability; this could lead to upheavals.    Slow efforts have been made to improve the quality of the  socioeconomic infrastructure, which, in some cases, has  deteriorated. The savings and investment rates are still low.  A substantial part of the people's potential has not been  tapped or developed into productive activities. Public assets  and state investment funds are being embezzled or seriously  wasted.    The work force has not yet been brought into full play.  Economic efficiency is still low, thus limiting the sources of  investment capital and material reserves as well as our ability  to improve the people's standard of living.    Our market economy is still in the nascent stage. It has  not developed fully and has not been managed in a satisfactory  way. This is because our legal system is not yet unified, and  our abilities and efficiency in macromanagement do not meet  requirements. Moreover, weaknesses and negativism are still  prevalent in our administration, financial, and banking systems  as well as in the state-run business sector. Corruption and  smuggling persist and inflation may return.    B. Many social changes have been slow, and there are still  many tough issues that remain a source of public concern,  especially unemployment. Social vices and crime have been on  the increase. A considerable number of people are accumulating  wealth illegally, while many honest people and those with  meritorious national deeds are facing difficulty in their  livelihood.    C. Now entering the in-depth phase, renovation is growing  comprehensive and is experiencing more difficulties. Those with  vested interests have been affected. At the same time,  renovation requires higher revolutionary awareness and better  leadership and management knowledge.    Corruption, ineptitude, a poor sense of organization and  discipline, and bureaucracy among a considerable number of  cadres in many state agencies and organizations at various  sectors and echelons -- in both the administrative and trading  sectors -- are negating many policies. They are hampering and  undermining renovation and reducing the people's confidence.  They are a challenge to the party leadership and the state  management.    Meanwhile, external and internal hostile forces are seeking  to sabotage us. They have not missed any opportunity to weaken  our internal ranks further.    To prevent internal disorder and external manipulation, it  is  inevitable that we must overcome our subjective shortcomings in  leadership and management and the corruption and ineptitude of  our contingent of cadres.    3. The greatest challenge to our nation and regime is slow  economic development. Poor economic performance will leave our  country further behind. We will remain weak and uncompetitive  and lose out on international cooperation. In the current  world, where the brutal economic race is emerging as the most  important issue, further economic decline may lead to political  and social instability and may constrain our efforts to  consolidate our national defense and security and protect our  independence and sovereignty.    To meet this challenge, we must promptly seize and make full  use of any opportunity to dispel danger. We must carry out  socioeconomic development at a quick and steady pace to build a  prosperous people, powerful country, and an equal and civilized  society. We must strive to narrow the development gap with  neighboring countries. These are the people's aspirations and  pressing demands. These will also determine the durability of  our regime, guarantee national development in accordance with  socialist objectives and orientations, and foil enemy schemes  and actions to undermine and violate our national sovereignty.    The only way to achieve this is to continue to accelerate  the  renovation process, both in scope and intensity. We must  further develop a sense of independence, mastery, and  self-reliance; practice thrift for national construction and  defense; and broaden international cooperation. Only by  developing our internal strengths to the full can we attract and  make satisfactory use of our external resources for quick  development. Waiting for and relying on external assistance  will lead us into a state of dependence and restrain national  growth. This is not an understood principle, but reality has  proven it to be true.    What can we draw on from the above analysis? The conclusion  is that in 1994, we can and must open a new era of socioeconomic  development in our country. The future GNP growth rate must not  be less than 8 percent a year. We must try to double our 1990  GNP by the year 2000, so that the conditions will be set and the  momentum generated for more rapid national development as the  country enters the 21st century.    In previous years, we had to concentrate our efforts on  overcoming economic recession and inflation and achieving social  and political stability. From the beginning of 1994, although  we will still be concerned about stability, we will also have  the conditions to allow us to focus our efforts on accelerating  economic development and producing more drastic social changes  to improve the people's material and spiritual lives. There  will be more opportunities for us to consolidate political  stability and strengthen national defense and security. This is  the way to bring our country through its socioeconomic crisis so  that it can enter into stable and steady development. In  leadership and management, we must not concentrate on resolving  urgent and unexpected issues. Instead, we must resolve  fundamental and strategic issues to spur the restructuring of  the economy toward industrialization and modernization in order  to attain rapid economic growth with higher results and achieve  better social order, justice, and progress.    Our socioeconomic development course for the next two years  and our plan for 1994 are based on that spirit. Here, I would  like to clarify further a number of major issues. I will also  emphasize each issue that requires deep understanding or a new  approach.    II. What should be done to ensure quick and long-lasting  economic growth?    1. Accelerate investment and development and gradually shift  the economic structure toward industrialization and  modernization.    In the past three years, total investment in the entire  society has reached 68.8 trillion dong. Investment is expected  to be about 41 trillion dong in 1994, an increase of 32 percent  over 1993. In 1995, it will reach about 52 trillion dong.  Total investment in five years may equal or exceed the target  outlined in the 1991-95 socioeconomic strategy plan extending to  the year 2000. It will create a prerequisite for economic  development and the improvement of employment in our society.    A. What are the capital resources for investment?    The most fundamental and important capital resource is  domestic savings and reserves.    All those who care for the country and uphold the national  tradition are aggravated by violations of the public property  and lavish expenditures by agencies and state-run enterprises as  well as in society. These practices should be condemned,  especially when our country is still poor, our people's standard  of living is low, and our national reserves are minimal. The  government is responsible for formulating and implementing laws  and policies to promote thrift and investment and oppose  corruption and waste. In leading our nation into a new stage of  development, we must formulate measures, mobilize the work  force, educate the people to make them realize our nation's  important current position, and launch a mass movement to  promote thrift and denounce embezzlement, waste, and  prodigality. We must strive to create a psychological feeling  in society that practices such as buying luxuries and spending  lavishly on engagement and wedding parties, funeral services,  and other feasts are acts that should be condemned rather than  honored.    The following are the government's lines and policies on  exploiting and using capital investment resources in the years  ahead:    -- There is great latent potential in capital resources  among  the people and economic units. This is an effective source of  investment that needs to be exploited with suitable policies to  encourage savings for production investment. We should  promulgate laws soon to encourage domestic investment with  preferential conditions similar to those provided for foreign  investment. We must implement various forms of shareholding;  sell more promissory notes; enhance the capabilities of various  enterprises in investment, including state-run enterprises;  simplify regulations on business registration for all kinds of  business establishments; and strengthen measures to promote  investment and improve services. Efforts must be made to  encourage domestic investment, especially in projects that do  not need sophisticated equipment but can produce essential goods  that meet market demands, thus making profit in a short period  of time (these includes projects in food processing, hotels,  tourism, and so forth). Efforts must also be made to increase  the proportion of domestic capital in various projects and joint  ventures signed with foreign countries.    We must quickly develop the capital market; reform, and  improve the activities of the banking and financial system to  mobilize idle money for savings accounts, insurance funds,  bonds, and shares. We must increase investment credit  resources, including government credit. We must quickly expand  medium and long-term credit resources to meet the demands for  capital for investments in development. We must also  satisfactorily prepare conditions that will enable us to  experiment with the setting up of stock markets, firstly, in Ho  Chi Minh City and Hanoi.    -- Government investment sources include domestic reserves  and bilateral and multilateral foreign aid for development  (mostly consisting of concessional loans and some gratuitous  aid). The foreign aid committed by the recent Paris conference  is a benefit. However, we still have to settle old debts to  clear the way for foreign credit. We should also realize all  the difficulties and complications in using loans from this  source. This is so that we can calculate loan effectiveness as  well as our repayment capacity to avoid losses and inactivity.    -- Government capital from national budget allocations is  reserved only for infrastructure projects where the investments  cannot be redeemed. Increasingly, mutual credit organizations,  partnerships, and shares in enterprises in different economic  sectors are a source of investment capital. This investment  system will be applied to the 1994 state plan.    To efficiently use government capital resources and to avoid  loss and wastage, it is necessary to solve the following issues:    -- Investment projects must be well-planned and closely  connected with long-term regional economic development planning.  On that basis, government capital can be reasonably coordinated  in a concentrated form, and its dilution avoided. This is the  main duty of the State Planning Commission which it must carry  out together with its reforms in organization working methods.    -- The management of investment capital must be  strengthened.  Construction prices must be adjusted to suit real conditions.  Methods for bidding, planning, construction, and approval must  be perfected. We should use foreign and domestic consultancy  services in these areas.    -- The management structure of state capital investment  should be reformed in conformity with experiences learned from  the management of foreign concessional loans to our country.    -- Approved projects must be timely funded according to the  progress in construction. Responsibility for material loss  caused by the funding organ to construction projects must be  clearly stated.    Direct foreign investment is the most important source of  foreign capital, which is mainly attracted by a favorable  investment environment that contains little risk, disturbance,  and trouble. It is important to improve the investment climate.  At the same time, we should have policies to attract foreign  countries to invest in our preferential sectors and regions.  Investment commitment should be closely supervised, especially  in the transfer of technology and environmental protection. It  is about time that we pay attention not only to investment  attractions but also to how registered capital is utilized and  how enterprises already in operation are managed. From now on,  the main index for foreign investment will be its capital and  the effects on the economy.    B. Investment orientations for improving the economic  structure as an initial step toward national industrialization  and modernization under the socioeconomic development strategy  from now to the year 2000.    In the next two years, we must concentrate our efforts on  the  following tasks:    -- Strive to bring about prominent changes in the structure  of agricultural production, and gradually industrialize  agriculture and the rural economy in accordance with the party  Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. This should be  carried out through the use of the people's capital and efforts  under state guidance and support. Market demands at home and  abroad and new and current production conditions have enabled us  to become self-reliant while concentrating more efforts on  improving agricultural production. All regions, especially  mountainous and coastal areas, must strive to improve their  production structure and develop their advantages to contribute  to fighting poverty and hunger effectively. Effort must be made  to provide more electricity to promote and accelerate  agro-forestry-fishery processing industries at various levels.  This will help improve the socioeconomic condition in rural  areas, while building more agro-industrial economic models to  strengthen the multisectoral economy.    -- We must attract foreign investment and encourage domestic  investment to exploit and process natural resources covering  bare hills and mountains, and develop export production and  services to create more jobs. These are the main sources of  capital for forming a new industrialized and modernized  structure.    -- The state must concentrate its investment in  infrastructure projects, especially in the electrical  transmission system, land and railway routes, seaports and  airports, water reservoirs, internal telecommunications; and  scientific, industrial, cultural, and social research  institutions as well as education and public health services.    -- We must conduct research, anticipate, and correctly pick  key development areas for the future, so that timely and  essential preparations for further development can be made.    -- We must manage, supervise, and strictly control the  import  of technical and technological equipment. The import of  obsolete and expensive technical equipment for production  especially those that pollute the environment must be strictly  reviewed and controlled, especially when the state budget is  used to buy such equipment.    -- Accelerate the planning process for major economic areas  in three regions and develop the locomotive effect that  stimulates development in other areas. Plans for each area  should accomodate its full potential and advantages in close  association with the activities of major economic areas. The  state shall support and take priority in giving foreign gratuity  to areas with difficulties, especially border areas and offshore  islands, areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and sites of the  former revolutionary bases. The state shall also focus  assistance on the building of socioeconomic infrastructure  projects, while formulating appropriate mechanism and plans to  help regions and localities exploit their capabilities for  further development.    The government recently worked with localities that still  have numerous difficulties in determining orientations for  development, concentrating on a number of programs and  objectives from now until the year 2000 aimed at overcoming  poverty and underdevelopment, thereby creating a prerequisite  for rapid development in the 21st century.    While carrying out national projects to improve electric,  transportation, and communications network, provinces in the  central coastal region should concentrate efforts on the  following key projects: First, the preservation and planting of  forest trees in close association with the settlement of nomads  and protection of the environment. Second, the improvement and  adjustment of crop patterns to avoid natural disasters, the  planting of appropriate industrial crops on denuded hills, and  promotion of the processing industry and development of  livestock breeding on a larger scale. Third, the exploitation,  raising, and processing of aquatic products in close association  with the efforts to protect coastal areas and offshore islands.  And fourth, the provision of sufficient water for agriculture,  forestry, industry, and domestic use in rural areas.    Provinces in the Central Highlands should also concentrate  their efforts on carrying out these projects (excluding the  production of aquatic products). They should make more efforts  to improve forestry, plant more industrial crops, strengthen  livestock breeding, and promote processing industries.    The northern highland provinces need to concentrate on  building a socioeconomic infrastructure with the support of the  central government. This includes a transportation, power,  water supply, and communications network; education and training  facilities, especially boarding schools for ethnic children;  tertiary education and research establishments; a public health  care network from the tribes, hamlets, and villages up to  districts and provinces; the transmission of radio and  television programs; and the development of cultural and  information services aimed at restoring and developing the  unique cultural characteristics of ethnic peoples.    In economic development, we must improve the economic  structure of planting, animal husbandry, industry, services, and  skills according to the party Political Bureau resolutions,  government decisions on socioeconomic development in mountainous  areas, and Government Directive No. 525 on practical guidelines  and policies. The highland provinces and districts must remain  close to the grassroots level and review experiences in order to  build their own economic development models that suit local  conditions and ethnic characteristics. The government will  choose the most difficult mountainous province and district to  supervise directly and draw experiences. In early 1994, the  government will work with localities in the Red River delta and  the Mekong River delta to establish directions for their  economic development.    2. Exploiting the potential and enhancing the work efficacy  of economic sectors.    Uniform implementation of the multisector economic policy is  a significant factor that greatly contributes to the success of  renovation. We have to continue renovating and implementing  effective mechanisms and policies on different economic sectors  in a satisfactory manner, however, in order to unleash the  production force completely.    A. As a poor and underdeveloped nation, and with the aim of  building the national economy and ensuring the state's role in a  macromanagement system, Vietnam must strive to guide and help  the economic sectors develop further along a socialist  orientation. Efforts must absolutely be made to develop  state-run economic and business enterprises. It is necessary to  say that state-run economic enterprises do not just include  business establishments, but also financial and banking  institutions as well as national reserves, land assets, and  other state properties. We must have a panoramic view of the  state-run economy in order to manage, preserve, and develop  national assets effectively. Ownership of all national assets  must be defined. We must urgently carry out the allocation of  land and forests to peasant households, concretely resolve land  problems in urban areas and zones used by enterprises, build  houses for sale or rent, and sell or rent enterprises or other  establishments that the state no longer wants to operate. These  tasks must be performed in line with the government's uniform  guidelines, and money derived from the sale or rental must be  transferred to the state budget.    Although state-run enterprises have been reorganized even  further, their structures are not rational and key sectors have  not been properly integrated. Many state-run enterprises are  too small, are equipped with outdated machinery, and are  operating at very low efficiency.    Therefore, on the one hand, we must continue to arrange and  correct those enterprises in a more urgent and resolute manner.  We must differentiate public service enterprises -- which serve  the common demand and benefit socioeconomic development, so the  government needs to have appropriate structure and management  systems -- from business enterprises whose existence and  development depends completely on their business performance.    On the other hand, we need to continue developing state  enterprises in some necessary sectors and domains, such as  grassroots establishments and some production enterprises that  require a large capital and high technology, especially in heavy  industry. The government will concentrate on changing some  state enterprises in key areas into strong economic  organizations that compete strongly in the international market  and enjoy high efficiency. This will provide important  financial contributions to the state budget. These enterprises  must be reorganized and connected with commercial banks,  import-export companies, and national and international  transport services to form major economic organizations. The  important thing is that the connection must be based on mutual  economic benefit, ownership relations, and development  strategies; not on administration arrangements. State  enterprises compete and cooperate with enterprises from other  economic sectors. In the process of forming big economic  corporations, enterprises from other economic sectors can join  in the form of collective ownership.    For those enterprises no longer under state management, we  should definitely settle them by transferring their ownership,  lending out, merging with other establishments, or abolishing  them. Realities at many agricultural units, forestry sites,  trade and business establishments, and transport corporations  show that the application of the contractual system and the  transfer of some machinery and equipment to the workers at  state-run enterprises have brought about remarkable economic  results.    One of the most effective measures to create enthusiasm  among  workers, to overcome the condition that no one is responsible  for state properties, and to oppose negativism is to introduce a  shareholding system at state enterprises. This will allow civil  servants and workers to share ownership at these establishments.  To carry out this task, efforts must made to clearly define the  proportions of shares to be held by the state, those for the  workers, and those for sale to private organizations and  individuals and to foreign businessmen, and so forth. The  government has been slow in drawing practical experiences,  formulating legal documents, and providing training and guidance  to introduce the shareholding system to state enterprises.    By looking at actual situations, we now understand that the  state management function over all enterprises, regardless of  different forms of ownership, must be clearly detached from the  ownership-related function over the state enterprises. All the  ownership-related functions should be concentrated on a state  organ responsible for the management of all public capital and  property and representing the state ownership in public  companies. This organ is also charged with the duty to select  officials who will become government representatives in the  management boards of public companies where the government has  invested. Consequently, the structure allowing the management  of government ministries and departments over economic  enterprises and the confusion arising from state management  function and ownership-related function and the discrimination  between the central economy and the local economy will have no  reason to exist.    B. Efforts must be made to renovate cooperatives, develop  the economic autonomy of cooperative members, and strengthen new  economic cooperation in the rural areas in accordance with the  party Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. We must  review experiences to provide guidance and assistance to build  and develop various appropriate economic cooperation at various  sectors and occupations.    C. It is essential to abolish regulations banning or  creating difficulties for individual and private trade. At the  same time, we must strengthen law enforcement to oppose  unregistered business, counterfeiting, tax evasion, or other  illegal activities.    The law clearly clarifies all banned trades and services and  those that need to obtain a license before operating. Besides  this limit, all business investments meeting all regulated  conditions, irrespective of individual or private business, only  need to register for their business, provided that they will  conduct their business as registered.    We must apply a credit policy that works on the  socioeconomic  result and repayment capacity and that does not discriminate  against any economic sectors. Under that spirit, we will  increase credit percentage to the collective economy,  individuals, and private business, especially peasant households.    D. We must create a clear framework for healthy business  operation and competition and strictly deal with illegal  business practices from any economic sectors. We must reexamine  all cases of trade monopoly so that we can apply measures to  limit the bureaucratic practice in the provision of goods and  services.    The government will provide favorable conditions and active  support for the establishment of contingent of able businessmen  of all levels, from the heads of a family business to managers  of major corporations, considering this as a decisive factor to  develop the economy in an active, efficient, and discipline  manner.    3. Expanding Economic Relations with Foreign Countries.    We are enjoying new favorable conditions in international  relations at present. However, in expanding and enhancing the  efficiency of foreign trade, we must rely on production  development in accordance with the open door economic structure  while strengthening exports and diversifying trade relations  with the outside world.    New prospects for attracting foreign capital and technology  require intensive efforts to develop domestic potential and  maintain close management if we are to welcome and use these  sources of foreign capital satisfactorily. Meanwhile, we must  increase our macromanagement abilities in an effort to avoid  hasty investments, as this may lead to imbalances and renewed  inflation.    We must continue to ensure that exports develop at a faster  pace than the economy (which is expected to increase 20 percent  by 1994 and 25 percent by 1995) while making gradual efforts to  improve the range of exports.    The consumer market is emerging as a very important factor  in  production. Production in general -- and exports in particular  -- must proceed from market demand. We must not turn out  products before efforts are made to search for markets.    The increase in certain processed goods -- such as knitwear  items, garments, and aquatic products -- is currently quite  large. Yet some export-oriented products -- including mineral  ores and farm produce -- are mainly raw. They continue to  account for a large proportion of exports and have been exported  through middlemen. There is still a lack of stable markets for a  wide range of export-oriented goods. Therefore, increasing  processing capabilities -- particularly for farm produce -- must  be given top priority in our investment promotion policies,  including the policy to promote foreign investment. From 1994  on, we must map out and implement a plan to develop major export  goods (with an annual export value exceeding $100 million). We  must harmoniously tackle various issues, ranging from investment  capital obtained from various sources to various state  structural policies, and from production and exploitation to  processing and consumption, in a gradual effort to create a  steady source of customers in the world market.    Economic sectors and establishments must renovate their  technology so they can turn out high-quality products (of all  categories, designs, and packaging styles) at an attractive  price for local and foreign markets. We must be very strict on  quality standards for exports and in the observance of  contracts, in an effort to maintain our credibility. The  government will introduce administrative regulations governing  those goods bearing the "Made in Vietnam" trademark.    Production establishments must improve their ability to  approach markets in an effort to take the initiative in finding  customers. We must develop the role of chambers of commerce and  trade in support of various businesses. We must reorganize our  work in statistical and economic information. Not only will  this benefit leadership and management activities, but it will  meet the needs of businessmen. We must broaden our activities  in existing markets, restore our traditional markets (China,  former Soviet republics, and East European countries), and  explore new markets (such as the European, Middle East, African,  and Latin American markets). We must prepare to enter the U.S.  market when conditions permit.    To promote vigorous exports further, we must continue to  renovate our management mechanism, narrow the range of products  under quota management; reduce red tape, particularly in the  granting of licenses; and promptly deal with fluctuations in the  foreign exchange rate. Imports must be placed under tight  control through the tariff policy, foreign exchange rate,  customs controls, and other necessary administrative measures.  Efforts to limit imports to protect local products must be  carried out resolutely and constantly, both at entry points and  on the local market. Measures must be taken against the  smuggling of cheap imports, as this may cause stagnation in the  sale of local products. It is important that local products  meet highly diversified demands, suit the tastes of various  consumers, and become increasingly competitive with foreign  goods.    In the future, the number of foreign visitors entering  Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese returning home to visit will  grow rapidly. This requires the tourism-hotel sector to achieve  extraordinary growth, both in terms of material conditions and  service quality. In building new hotels, attention must be paid  to mobilizing capital from domestic sources in various forms.  Efforts must be made to shift hotels and guesthouses from  various public organs and enterprises to the system of business  accounting. We must renovate and upgrade a number of these  facilities to travel lodges.    4. Renovating and improving the financial, monetary, and  credit situation.    A. The 1994 budget faces great financial needs for  investment, development, and solutions to social problems. As  the volume of foreign investment capital increases rapidly, we  must ensure there is sufficient domestic capital to match it.  Therefore, we must follow a new approach to ensure budget  equilibrium. State revenues, which come from domestic  collections and nonrefundable international aid, must be used to  meet regular spending, pay debts, and cover investment and  development costs (in 1994, we will have to allot about 15  percent of our state revenues for this purpose and probably more  in subsequent years). Regarding the lack of additional state  revenues to carry out investment and development plans, we must  rely on capital borrowed from the people (let's increase the  ratio of mid- and long-term loans step by step) and from foreign  countries (from now on, let's apply only for long-term foreign  loans at low interest rates to meet investment and development  goals). Definite steps must be taken not to circulate new money  to serve budgetary and credit purposes. Regarding those funds  that the government has obtained from foreign countries at low  interest rates to assist various projects -- including  infrastructure projects -- which are likely to generate  sufficient income to help pay back capital, they must be shifted  to the form of state credit loans under which the beneficiaries  are duty bound to make fair payments on both principal and  interest. This is the only way to generate income to pay for  foreign debts.    By the way, it is worth saying something about the amount of  foreign debt now due. These are relatively enormous figures.  They include loans we had to borrow to make up for spending  under the state subsidization mechanism, namely materials for  production, grain, and certain kinds of consumer products.  Regarding foreign loans to import equipment, a number of  production installations have made good use of these loans.  Generally speaking, however, some of those loans have generated  insignificant results, while others have not been put to use  yet. To pay for our debts, we do not have any alternatives  other than making efforts to develop our economy and improve its  performance. Therefore, it is necessary to make use of all  kinds of new loans at low interest rates and work out tight  management measures to guarantee effective use, thus helping  make the economy stronger and capable of generating income to  pay for both old and new debt, increase state revenue, and  improve the standard of living. Immediate measures, however,  must be taken to end the unhealthy situation in which we fail to  exert close control and management over the application for  foreign loans by the various sectors and localities, as well as  to the bad practice of many foreign loan beneficiaries who, once  they are unable to pay their debts, shift the entire burden to  the state.    Efforts must be made to improve the tax collection system,  reduce tariffs for some goods that need promotion, apply a  modestly higher tax rate to suit the conditions in our country,  strive to collect all taxes levied on imported goods, and  improve tax collection to help increase the proportion of  procurement derived from the gross domestic product (GDP) (in  1994 it is estimated at 24 percent). The budget deficit in 1994  should be lower than that of 1993, and lower than 5 percent by  1995. The main source of capital to offset the budget deficit  comes from investment and low-interest loans from other  countries. While we are striving to increase our national  budget, we must promote business activities, encourage people to  practice thrift, and invest in and improve the production of  goods so as to increase income. Efforts must be made to  rationally settle capital depreciation at state-run  establishments to ensure their continued operation, especially  those at the grass-roots level.    Efforts must also be made to improve the management of the  state budget in conformity with the objectives and division of  authority and responsibility defined for the various levels of  the administration; grant more budget authority to ministers for  specialized projects related to the work of their ministries;  and accelerate the promulgation of the law on the state budget.    I would like to stress here again that while implementing  various financial measures, we must strive to overcome such  negative practices as lavish spending, using state funds to buy  gifts, and organizing feasts to celebrate founding or major  anniversaries. The government will issue regulations on these  expenditures. The regulations will clearly define prohibition  on unessential expenditure and ask the people to monitor and  expose violations. For the immediate future, during the  forthcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, we must stop using state  funds to buy gifts for officials of various state organizations,  regardless of their positions.    Banking service: The State Bank, with its increasing  authority for regulating money circulation, must closely observe  market indicators to control the amount of currency in  circulation, ensure that inflation will be kept to the single  digit-level, and stabilize the value of the dong. In 1994, the  bank must concentrate its resources and apply many measures,  including the computerization of its services, to ensure speedy  and convenient services in all situations. It must designate  appropriate interest rates to attract all enterprises and people  to deposit their money and use the banking services. We must  have measures to deal with high interest rates on credit, which  are causing difficulties for business and obstructing  development investment.    We have to build and develop an inter-banking market for  both  Vietnamese and foreign currencies so that we can regulate  capital resources and encourage the development of a capital  market. The bank must quickly expand the non-cash transaction  services by applying more advanced methods.    It is necessary to forestall high inflation and great  fluctuation in exchange rates when foreign currency resources  are increased rapidly. The exchange rates between the dong and  the U.S. dollar must be settled step by step to stabilize the  true exchange rate (in consideration with the fluctuation of the  dong and other foreign currencies) in order to encourage  exports, limit the import of unnecessary goods, but not cause  sudden price fluctuations. The application and repayment of  foreign loans by enterprises, departments, and localities must  be closely supervised. Regulations on loan guarantees and loan  applications from business enterprises should be introduced  quickly.    Foreign currency management should continue to improve to  create favorable conditions for the dong to be exchanged freely  with foreign currencies, making it the only transaction medium  in the country.    Commercial banks which play a major role in the capital  market must develop their loan activities in the direction  mentioned previously. Public credit groups should be  established after drawing experiences from experimental groups.  Relations between the State Bank and the commercial banks and  public credit groups must be reformed under the philosophy that  the supervisory role of the State Bank must be maintained. The  State Bank must not interfere with the credit and transaction  activities of commercial banks. It must create a healthy  competitive environment between commercial banks, including  foreign banks. A banking association should be established. We  must increase the training of bank officials and improve the  management and quality of banking services.    III. Resolve Various Socioeconomic Issues More  Satisfactorily:    Realizing that linking economic development with cultural  and  social development is the tradition of our people, the character  of our regime, and the trend of our era, the government has  given priority to preparing plans and funds to guide various  cultural and social activities. In 1993, although many sectors  concerned have not attained their desired results, they made  some improvements through the use of government funds and  contributions from the public.    The country is embarking on a new era of development. This  means that from now on, the relationship between economic growth  and cultural and social development will have more favorable  conditions. This relationship should be dealt with in a more  balanced and harmonious manner.    Economic development, as explained previously, includes the  settlement of many very important and fundamental social issues  such as the creation of jobs and increasing the people's income.  Cultural and social development has other demands which require  each person to contribute attention, effort, wisdom, money,  lifestyle, psychology, and opinion. The government is  responsible for policies, measures, and funds to create  favorable conditions for this undertaking to enhance  development, under the direction that the government and people  should work together with possible contributions from local and  foreign organizations.    The 1994 draft plan outlines realistic measures and  increases  funding for educational and cultural activities; scientific  research; and public health, physical education, sports, and  family planning services. I would like to emphasize the  following issues:    A. First, we must improve the people's intellectual  standard, provide additional training to the contingent of  laborers and cadres, and train the succeeding generations.  Given our current requirements, this is a very important task  aimed at preparing for our country's long-term development,  especially for embarking on the 21st century with more drastic  development measures. We must not only improve the quality of  teaching and studying in all educational institutions in  conformity with the requirements for socioeconomic development,  but also mobilize all forces in society, from families to mass  organizations, including mass media agencies, to improve the  educational level of the entire society and to create more  potential for advancement among the youths, who will strive for  their own personal achievement as well as for the national  interest.    The arrangement of employment for newly graduated students  must be given attention through assistance measures taken by the  state and by various mass organizations and families. This will  contribute greatly to encouraging students to study harder. We  must create conditions for the contingent of intellectuals to  dedicate their intelligence and talents to the country and to  earn a good living with their own careers. The government will  welcome and create conditions for those Vietnamese intellectuals  living abroad to participate in socioeconomic development in  their country in various areas of work and under various  suitable forms.    B. Greater attention must be paid to improving the health of  the people of various strata. Specifically, we must concern  ourselves with improving the health of the entire people,  ranging from children to mothers to the aged for the sake of our  national construction now and for future generation.    Along with government guidance and further budget  assistance,  we must step up physical education and sports activities,  preliminary health care, disease prevention and treatment,  family planning, and so forth. We must strive to launch a  movement to carry out these tasks in a wide and far-reaching  manner with the participation of all individuals, families,  schools, mass organizations, and the rest of society.    In 1994, the government will allocate more funds and provide  better guidance for implementing various measures to provide  health care for people in the mountain regions and for ethnic  minority compatriots. We must dispel and then proceed toward  eradicating all social diseases and resolve the issue of water  supplies for our compatriots.    C. Improving the intellectual standard and protecting public  health are essential conditions for averting and dispelling  social vices, especially prostitution, drug addiction, and the  danger of being infected with HIV virus as this disease is  spreading and causing indignation and concern among the people.  As early as 1993, the government issued a directive with  drastic measures aimed at preventing and dispelling these social  vices, but implementation is, however, still slow.    The administration at various levels must cooperate with  mass  and social organizations in reviewing and profoundly analyzing  the movement to fight social vices in the past, draw on lessons  of good works and failures, become familiar with the experiences  of other countries in order to take practical and effective  measures suitable to our country's situation. The government  will create better conditions and provide more financial support  for these tasks. Most importantly, various authorities in the  local administration at the provincial, city, district, village,  and ward levels must strive to seriously carry out their  functions and duties and take responsibility in curbing social  vices in their areas.    IV. Develop Our New Advantages in Diplomatic Activities:    On the basis of the successes of the renovation process and  taking into account our correct foreign policy, our positive and  dynamic diplomatic activities have helped create a favorable  international environment for the cause of national construction  and defense and for improving the position of Vietnam in the  international arena as an active member of the trend toward  peace, stability, and cooperation in this region and the world  over.    We have consistently restored and expanded the relations of  friendship and cooperation with neighboring and other countries  in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. We have agreed  to settle conflicts through peaceful negotiations. The  relations of cooperation between our country and many developed  nations have expanded, while our relations with traditional  friendly countries and nonaligned nations have been  strengthened. In 1993 we also restored relations with  international financial and monetary organizations while  strengthening cooperation with the ASEAN and the EC.    From this forum, on behalf of the government and people of  Vietnam, allow me to once again express my gratitude for the  goodwill, effective cooperation, and valuable assistance given  by the many countries and international organizations to  Vietnam's renovation and development process. This assistance  was clearly reflected at the recent Paris donors conference. I  would like to avail myself of this opportunity to reassert that  Vietnam always wants to befriend all countries in the  international community in the struggle for peace, independence,  and development.    As for the government and people of the United States, we  advocate closing the past and look toward the future, ready to  establish normal relations on the basis of equality, mutual  respect, and without any preconditions. Not only will this  conform to the aspirations and interests of the two peoples, but  this will also be beneficial to peace, security, and stability  in the region.    From the vivid reality of implementing our foreign policy,  we  can confirm that in the international background of many  complicated changes, although we have to deal with many  challenges, we have opportunities to create and develop  multifaceted relations with all nations and international  organizations. This should be attributed to our effort in the  struggle to defend our national independence and sovereignty,  our determination to attain self-reliance, and our efforts to  carry out national development while maintaining national  characteristics under the banner of peace, cooperation, and  development. This will continuously improve our country's  prestige and position in the international community, thus  positively serving the cause of national construction and  defense. Achievements in the renovation and national  development and the effective expansion of multifaceted  cooperation with foreign countries have served as a base for  strengthening our diplomatic activities.    Our foreign policy for the days ahead will be carried out  and  developed in depth in accordance with this fundamental  orientation.    V. Enhancing the government's management efficiency:    In 1993, the government concentrated efforts on directing  the  implementation of 10 major tasks and directly dealt with a  number of urgent problems and worked with many local governments  to define development orientations and work out problem-solving  methods. Those efforts have, together with the very great  endeavors of our entire party, people, and armed forces, led to  our socioeconomic achievements in the past year.    However, much remains to be done to enhance the government's  management efficiency. The functions of state management in the  market economy require that our state apparatus, first of all,  our administrative apparatus, be fully competent and pure to  perform their functions as stipulated by law. This is a very  important part of our efforts to build a law-governed Vietnamese  state which truly belongs to, comes from, and works for the  people.    As the renovation cause proceeds further, it will become  more  difficult and complicated and necessitate efforts to combine  economic reform with administrative restructuring to ensure a  rational course of action and coordination to implement the  overall reform program. Measures must be taken to overcome the  lack of uniformity, coordination, and even agreement when it  comes to directing the implementation of the reform program as  we have experienced in the past. The government's management  efficiency is guaranteed and enhanced only when its management  function is carried out in a concentrated and uniform manner and  only efforts are exerted to overcome all indications of  departmentalism and regionalism as well as to get rid of  corruption and purify our state apparatus. In 1994, marked  progress must be made to overcome the government's management  drawbacks to create conditions for our renovation process and  socioeconomic development program to advance a step further.    As an immediate objective, concentrated and urgent efforts  must be made to resolve a number of high-priority problems as  follows:    -- At present, there is an urgent need to create the legal  framework for all economic activities under the market  mechanism. First of all, we must accelerate the legislative work  program by combining efforts to build or amend a number of laws  still in effect with endeavors to formulate basic legal  documents, especially the civil code and business law. This  requires the formation of a contingent of experts to study and  complete the legislative work program as scheduled. May I  suggest that the National Assembly spend more time on its  legislative work to meet the requirements of the economic reform  program. The government will formulate regulations to ensure  that law enforcement documents are promulgated in time. It will  also work to enhance the efficiency of law enforcement agencies,  regarding this move as an important part of the administrative  reform program. Law enforcement instruments go hand in hand  with financial, monetary, and planning apparatus. They must all  be applied in a uniform manner to manage macro-economic  activities under the market mechanism.    -- It is necessary to define the power of administrative  organs at all levels, first of all their power to formulate  rules and regulations, bearing in mind the need to work toward  the formulation of uniform policies to ensure strict  implementation of government decisions. Efforts must be made to  overcome departmentalism, arbitrariness, no discipline, and the  situation in which ministries, sectors, or local people's  committees issue legal documents at variance with government  decisions.    In 1994, we should work out plans to abolish administrative  organs' control over business establishments. Then, on that  basis, let's reduce the sizes of ministries, agencies under the  management of the government, and local administrative organs at  all levels. This is a very important move because it will not  only make our mechanisms less bulky and bureaucratic, but also  will help overcome regionalism which prevails in the management  systems of different sectors and localities.    Presently, the administration procedure is too superfluous  and complicated. It is encouraging the practice of  authoritarianism, extortion, and corruption by many cadres and  officials when the people need to register something or apply  for certain permission. It also creates obstacles and  difficulties in work relations between different government  offices. This situation causes difficulties and expenses for  the public and arouses indignation in society. In 1994, the  government will carry out reform of administrative procedures  under the principle of both providing convenience to the public  and safeguarding the state management of the government. The  reform will, first, concentrate on areas that are experiencing  negative phenomena, causing inconveniences to many people and  obstructing business activities. This task must be carried out  under deliberated plans with close supervision and control of  the agencies concerned. Efforts must be made to motivate mass  organizations and the people to participate in this task,  especially the contribution of ideas to amend and apply various  administrative procedures. We must strive to urgently  promulgate administrative law to serve as a legal base for  building administrative apparatus and formulating civil servant  regulation as well as for setting up an administrative tribunal  to settle the people's complaints against administrative  agencies and officials.    One of the most important tasks is to train and enhance the  capability of our civil servants, step by step standardize  administrative positions, and revise procedures on recruiting  and assigning civil servants. We must formulate appropriate  plans to carry out this task to produce a contingent of capable  civil servants who can handle their duties effectively,  especially those who hold key positions at administrative  agencies at the central level or in provinces and municipalities.    Dear National Assembly deputies:    Our nation and people have a tradition of steadfastness. We  have, on many occasions, proved our capabilities in overcoming  acute ordeals to survive and develop further, thus creating  various historical turning points.    Presently, while we have great opportunities to develop our  country we also face numerous difficulties and ordeals. The  government, however, places its confidence in our nation and the  people who always uphold the spirit of patriotism and  self-reliance, develop their intelligence and creativity, and  maintain their diligence for labor productivity.    Together with the National Assembly and the Vietnam  Fatherland Front, the government will do its best to strengthen  the great national unity bloc comprising all nationalities,  religions, and people's strata at home and abroad. We will  create a favorable environment and conditions for all people to  do their best to amass wealth for themselves and for the nation.  We will create necessary conditions for our people to enter the  21st century with firm capabilities to help extricate our  country from its situation as a poor and underdeveloped nation.    With the wholeheartedness and strong determination of the  entire people to advance along the path chosen by our party, we  will definitely miss no opportunity in striving to fulfill all  tasks set by the National Assembly for 1994, thereby ushering in  a new stage for socioeconomic development in our country.    Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Joem H. Macaspac] </F>   [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a program that  would provide some two million jobs to the rural people in the  next three years, with allocation of some P23 billion  [Philippine pesos].    Dubbed "Kabuhayan 2000," [Livelihood 2000] the project was  simultaneously began in various parts of the country. The  president presided over the launching ceremonies in Balayan,  Batangas, together with Speaker Jose de Venecia and former Vice  President Salvador Laurel.    The president designated Interior and Local Government  Secretary Rafael Alunan III as chairman of the inter-agency  committee that will implement the program.    In his speech at Balayan, the president said his government  is pursuing the project as part of the national effort to  improve the economy by providing better and high paying jobs to  the rural folk. He said Kabuhayan 2000 is a vital cog in his  Pilipinas [Philippines] 2000 economic development program for  the Philippines.    Mr. Ramos stressed that the ultimate objective of the  program  is the eradication of poverty and consequently improving the  quality of life of the people.    The employment plan, Mr. Ramos said, is also part of a  three-pronged undertaken by the Presidential Council for  Countryside Development, the Commission to Fight Poverty, and  the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development. [sentence  as published]    These agencies have been tasked with coming out with  programs  that would stimulate employment, accelerate production and  generate capital. But the new employment program has the local  government units at its forefront. The governors and mayors,  through their respective organizations, have already accepted  the president's challenge and agreed to work for the program's  success.    The project will also have six components that each will be  handled by one department.    Job opportunities will be created through reforestation,  agribusiness development, rural enterprises, rural  infrastructure, and job placement.    Thus, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources  will be tasked with implementing the reforestation phase; the  Department of Agriculture and Food on agribusiness development;  the Department of Trade and Industry on rural enterprise  development; the Department of Public Works and Highways on  infrastructure projects; the Department of Labor and Employment  on job placements; and, the Department of Interior and Local  Government on capability building.    Mr. Ramos said funding for the project will come from  various  financial institutions, including those based in foreign  countries.    He said P17.5 billion has already been obtained and the  balance will be appropriated by next month.    The chief executive is confident that the program will  succeed. The six main categories of the project are the  so-called "multiplier enterprises" where one project or one job  creates additional opportunities in the neighborhood for similar  complimentary or supportive projects.    In Balayan, the president presided over the signing of an  agreement among political opponents in the province. Among  those who signed the covenant were former Vice President  Salvador Laurel of the Nacionalista [Nationalist] Party;  Batangas Gov. Vicente Mayo of the Nationalist People's  Coalition; Rep. Hernani Perez, House minority leader, of the  opposition Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino [Struggle of Filipino  Democrats]; and Reps. Eduardo Ermita and Ralph Recto, both  belonging to the House "Rainbow Coalition."    Mr. Ramos urged officials in the other provinces to emulate  the lead taken by the Batangas officials who have decided to  cross party lines and form a multiparty covenant seeking the  success of the presidential employment program.    Mr. Ramos said politicians must now set aside their  political  interests so that they can effectively contribute to the general  effort toward transforming the Philippines into a  newly-industrialized country before the turn of the century.    Answering criticisms that his provincial sorties are mere  junkets and do not contribute to the development of the rural  areas, the president said his administration is now bringing the  government to the people through innovative projects that  directly benefit the citizenry.</p>

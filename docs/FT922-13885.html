			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (3): Value of a degree / Take the measure of the MBA AMERICANS AND Britons do it, Asians and even East Europeans now do it. People around the world have been swept up in the glamour of the Masters of Business Administration degree. The MBA used to be seen as the automatic passport to a vastly enhanced salary, a flashy sports car and an imminent seat on the board of a major company. It is still widely perceived as a useful stepping-stone to better things. Even so, recently the degree has come under a cloud as an explosion in supply has coincided with a growing disillusionment and the pressures of recession. For some unfortunate students in Britain at least, the MBA has become a staging post on the way to temporary unemployment. British employers have historically had a lower regard for the qualification than many of their counterparts overseas, particularly in the US. Even in North America, the reputation of MBAs has suffered periodic tarnishes, with the typical 28-year-old graduate stereotyped as being trained for no position less worthy than the chief executive of a major corporation. Attempts to change the curriculum have not always proved too effective. Harvard Business School - one of the most famous of the American schools and the originator of the 'case method' approach to teaching - was criticised publicly last year by Mr Ian Evans, chairman of LEK, the management consultancy. He said he would view applicants to his firm from the school with great scepticism, arguing that the admissions policy there was now 'wayward'. Last year, MBase, a computer-based employment service for job-hunting MBAs, produced a widely-reported survey that suggested employers had little interest in the degree. The findings stung the careers officers of many business schools, already demoralised from one of the most difficult years for recruitment they could recall. But the Association of MBAs (Amba), based in London, pours scorn on these negative images and stresses that interest is higher than ever. It estimates that the number of British students graduating from UK institutions alone with the coveted degree has risen from 775 in 1975 to an estimated 4,500 in 1991. At the same time, the number of organisations offering courses has shot up from a handful to about 82. Mr Peter Calladine, administrator at Amba, says: 'I think people recognise the MBA as a portable qualification, which is very often a way out of a corner, to prevent them becoming a specialist.' Mr George Bain, dean of the London Business School, agrees that acceptance of the MBA is growing, as demonstrated by both the rising number of students and of employers willing to sponsor them. Nevertheless, he concedes that 'some firms are reluctant to hire freshly-minted MBAs'. He also says that the stereotype of the MBA of the past is not entirely untrue, and the general consensus is that the number of job offers to graduates has dropped by a quarter in the last two years. 'The environment is tougher now,' he says. 'There is no question that there was a great boom in management education, which for the moment has ended.' But he says new institutions have continued to enter the market for MBAs, even though the peak has obviously been reached and the market is overprovided for. 'The quality of faculty to staff up expansion like this is just not available,' says Mr Bain. 'The market will sort itself out. Many weaker suppliers will withdraw and the late entrants will probably suffer.' That is hardly reassuring for students now contemplating studying for an MBA. But the lesson is nonetheless clear. As Mr Bain puts it: 'You have to be very thoughtful. Choose an institution with care.' Mr Calladine adds: 'Despite what everyone says, there is no such thing as the best school. It is no use someone in the national health service who wants to stay there going to a school where most of the graduates go into finance.' He says prospective students should take every opportunity to talk to faculty, current and former students, and even possible employers at business schools to learn about the course offered and what it might lead to. The distinction between different types of MBAs is shown clearly in a detailed analysis of the growth of enrolment in courses. Amba figures show that full-time MBA students are now in a diminishing minority. The intake last autumn was 3,500 on full-time courses. The figure appears to have levelled off, which partly reflects the costs and risks of the degree: on top of tuition of several thousand pounds a year, students have to pay accommodation and other expenses. Most important, nearly all give up their job, their salary and typically any commitment to re-employment. Perhaps surprisingly, a further 6,000 students were enrolled on part-time courses, giving them the chance to continue working - and often be sponsored by their employers. However, both these figures now appear to be relatively stable. The real area of growth is for MBAs obtained through distance-learning, such as the courses offered by Henley, Warwick and the Open University. Ms Sheila Cameron, MBA programme director at the Open University, and author of a book on the qualification*, stresses that her course offers a great deal of contact with other students through tutorials and residential sessions as well as tapes and workbooks. It also has the advantage - like all the other distance learning courses - of being entirely flexible, with no requirement to attend courses at fixed times, regardless of other pressures on an individual's time. For those who choose a course with care - and are realistic about their abilities and ambitions - the MBA can remain a rewarding and often remunerative qualification. Amba - 15 Duncan Terrace, London N1 8EZ - publishes a series of books, offers student loans and holds a business school fair at the Institute of Directors in London in October; the University of London Careers Service holds one at the Business Design Centre, Islington, in the spring. *Sheila Cameron.

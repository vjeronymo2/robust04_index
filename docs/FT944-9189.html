			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (4): 'Coin' cards now used in 27 towns - Towards a cashless society The Danes have passed an important milestone on the road to the cashless society. They have established the world's first national fully functional 'electronic purse' system, using pre-paid smart cards to replace cash in vending machines, payphones, canteens, laundries and parking meters. After trials in 1992 in the town of Naestved, about 70km south-west of Copenhagen, the development of a national pre-paid card system, known as Danmont (literally translated: Dan-coin) began last December. The service is now available in 27 towns, and transactions are increasing rapidly. They were up by 32 per cent to 191,419 from the first to the second quarters of this year, and by 46 per cent to 280,394 from the second to the third quarters. The use of pre-paid cards is not new. What is new about the Danish system is that it is not a closed system (involving, for example, only the payphone customer and the phone company), but an open system. There are many card issuers and many service providers, and the card-holder can use the card for all the various services on offer, such as payphone, canteen, newspaper dispenser, laundromat - even, in central Copenhagen, at 10 plug-in points for re-charging the batteries on electrically-operated cars. A debit is made each time the card is used. At present, the card expires when there is no credit left. Re-chargeable cards are the next step. They have already been developed and are working in Danmoent's laboratory, but they will not be introduced until final agreement has been reached on a European technical standard for smart cards. The system is still in its early days. The number of transactions is tiny, compared with the millions which take place every day using money and other credit card systems. The card has been introduced initially in selected areas, usually in a vicinity where there are schools and other educational establishments, and where a large number of young people are present. Mr Henning N. Jensen, managing director of the Danmoent operating company, believes that it will take from five to seven years for consumers to become accustomed to the system, but well before the end of the century he expects that 50 per cent of the population will be using pre-paid cards for most of the daily transactions they now make by cash. Mr Jensen is a hard person to catch. International interest in the Danish system is so intense that he and many of his staff spend much of their time abroad, advising would-be electronic-purse operators on how to set up a system. So far, no one else has, on this scale, and that, says Mr Jensen, is related to the fact that few other countries enjoy such a system of close co-operation between the banks, and between the banks and the telephone companies, as Denmark does. Denmark also operates one of the most successful debit-card systems, the national Dankort system, which, since its inception in 1982 for use at retail level, has reduced the number of cheque transactions from 280m a year (1986) to under 100m in 1993. One of the essential factors for the success of the system was the ability of the banks and savings banks to agree to the establishment of a single-card system, using the clearing system, PBS, which is owned jointly by all 170 banks and savings banks, some of them quite small. Debit-card systems have been far less successful in countries where the banks have tried to set up competing systems, Mr Jensen noted. Almost every adult now has a Dankort, and it is accepted by virtually all retailers, restaurants, hotels, cinemas, and theatres. There were many initial difficulties in introducing the Dankort system, and considerable scepticism about its future, but within seven years it was in general use. This is the span of time which Mr Jensen believes will be necessary for Danmoent to become accepted. The system is a logical extension of the existing payments infrastructure. Danmoent itself is owned jointly by the PBS (ie, by the banks) and KTAS, the Copenhagen telephone company, on behalf of all the phone companies, whose transmission facilities are essential to the system. Danmoent itself is a tiny organisation of only 18 people. As the system operator, it is responsible for laying down the standards for the hardware, such as terminals, the integrated-circuit cards themselves, and for surveillance of the clearing and security systems, and finally for marketing the system. But Danmoent is not, and has no ambition to become, an equipment producer or supplier. There is complete independence between card issuers, such as a phone company, and service providers, such as a laundromat. Similarly, there is independence between service providers and equipment suppliers, which means that an independent laundromat operator, who does not issue his own card, can nevertheless install a terminal and thus gain access to the system. In fact, this is what has happened, according to Mr Jensen. The dominant suppliers of washing machines quickly realised the advantages of the Dankort system (one of them is that there is no cash around to attract thieves) and introduced terminals and cards; but other laundromat owners were able to install the same terminals, which accepted the same cards, receiving payment through the Danmoent clearing system, thus staying competitive with the business round the corner from them. It will be some time before Danmoent becomes profitable, because this will require a very large number of transactions. Meanwhile, the cards are being used as an advertising medium, an extra way of earning money - and the expired cards have become collectors' items.</p>

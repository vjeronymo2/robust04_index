			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / PowerGen awards big turbine contract POWERGEN, the electricity generator, has chosen GEC Alsthom, the Franco-British engineering group, as main contractor for its 1,360MW combined-cycle gas turbine power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd. The station, which will cost about Pounds 580m if a second optional phase is built, will provide power for more than 1.25m people and create about 1,000 jobs during construction. It is scheduled to begin operating commercially in 1995. The deal is the third big combined-cycle contract in three weeks for GEC Alsthom, which says it has more than 50 per cent of the UK market and at least 20 per cent of the world market for this type of power equipment. Mr Kelvin Bray, chairman and chief executive of European Gas Turbines, a GEC Alsthom subsidiary, said that the company was talking to more than five other potential UK clients. Combined-cycle systems use exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a steam turbine, thereby reducing emissions and producing overall thermal efficiency of well over 50 per cent compared with 35 per cent to 40 per cent for coal-fired stations. The system is also quicker to build than large coal-fired stations and has proved particularly attractive to the privatised UK utilities. GEC Alsthom was an early victim of the trend away from coal-fired plants as potential contracts from the Central Electricity Generating Board for such plants were cancelled after privatisation of electricity generation. GEC Alsthom lost out initially to suppliers such as Siemens of Germany which were better prepared to exploit the new market in the UK. GEC Alsthom has since hit back strongly in the UK and overseas combined-cycle markets, thanks partly to its 212MW to 226MW 9F turbine, jointly developed by GEC Alsthom and General Electric of the US. It is the world's largest gas turbine and is also claimed to be the most efficient. Yesterday's contract brings GEC Alsthom's orders for the 9F to 14. The first phase at Connah's Quay involves three 340MW Vega 109F modules  - where the turbine and the steam generator are linked on a single shaft - with a fourth module on option for the second phase. The new station, which still awaits planning consents, is to be built on the site of a coal-fired station which closed in 1982. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said that the contract represented 'a further step ahead in our strategy to achieve a balanced range of fuel for generation'. GEC Alsthom will build the gas turbines at Belfort in France and the steam turbines and generators at Rugby and Stafford. The UK content of the project will be more than 55 per cent. Separately, GEC Alsthom said that it had won an order worth about Pounds 13m from National Grid for a 400kV indoor gas insulated switchgear substation at Barking, east London. NEI Power Projects, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, announced a contract worth almost Pounds 20m to extend La Collette power station in Jersey to meet increased demand.  --------------------------------------------------------- GEC ALSTHOM'S REVIVAL  --------------------------------------------------------- Major combined-cycle gas turbine orders since the beginning of 1991  --------------------------------------------------------- Client                              Power rating (MW)  --------------------------------------------------------- Corby Power                                350 Peterborough Power                         350 Brigg Regional Power Generators            240 Didcot National Power                     1360 Barking Reach Thames Power                1000 Connah's Quay PowerGen                    1360  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

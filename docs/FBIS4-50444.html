			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [China Daily News: "Growth Boom Continues in Foreign Trade"] </F>   [Text] China's foreign trade has continued its  double-digit growth in the first four months of this year, to  hit a total volume of $57.84 billion, up 21 per cent over the  same period of last year. customs officials said.    The export growth rate grew faster than that of imports,  indicating that the macro-economic and reform measures adopted  since late last year have paid off, according to officials in  the General Administration of Customs (GAC).    Foreign-funded enterprises continued to set the pace in  trade, as their exports and imports reached $21.33 billion, a  46.9 per cent increase and accounting for nearly 37 per cent of  the national trade volume.    During the January-April period, China's total imports grew  by 20.3 per cent, amounting to $29.79 billion, while gross  exports increased 22 per cent, hitting a total of $28.04 billion.    The export growth rate was a 3.3 per cent rise over that in  the year's first quarter, according to statistics from the GAC.    This, the GAC officials said, also signaled that the  government has put an end to the trend of a weak export growth  against a runaway import boom.    However, in the four-month period, China's foreign trade  still saw a deficit of $1.75 billion, only $20 million less than  the same period of the previous year, the GAC officials said.    General merchandise exports recorded a 30.5 per cent lift  with a total volume of $14.36 billion, which accounted for over  half of all exports, while the processing trade maintained a  high growth rate of over 23 per cent, totalling nearly $11.3  billion.    But exports and imports through barter and border trade,  respectively, plummeted 55 and 26 per cent, standing at a total  of only $1.08 billion.    In the first four months this year, there were some major  changes in the mix of China's exports as manufactured products  witnessed a sharp rise of 25.6 per cent to $23.2 billion,  accounting for 82.7 per cent of all exports.</p>

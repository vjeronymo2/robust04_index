			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON TO SEEK MORE ANTI-GANG FUNDING;  </P> <P> PREVENTION: GANG-RELATED INCIDENTS IN THE VALLEY INCREASED 134% LAST YEAR. THE  COUNCILMAN IS SEEKING A GREATER SHARE OF THE CITY'S $1.4 MILLION EARMARKED FOR  YOUTH PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley, where gang-related crime more than doubled in 1989, is  not getting its fair share of $1.4 million in city funds proposed to steer  susceptible youths away from gang membership, a top aide to Los Angeles City  Councilman Hal Bernson said Monday.  </P> <P> "The Valley always gets less," complained Greig Smith, Bernson's chief deputy.  To help remedy this, Smith said Bernson will seek city funding for an anti-gang  program proposed by Project Heavy/San Fernando Valley, a nonprofit social  service agency.  </P> <P> Monday, the council's Public Safety Committee, chaired by Councilman Richard  Alatorre of the Eastside, adopted a $1.4-million anti-gang plan recommended by  city staff.  </P> <P> Project Heavy, however, was not among seven Valley-based social service  agencies that would be granted money under the plan. The proposal next goes to  a committee chaired by Councilman Joel Wachs, a Valley lawmaker, for further  review.  </P> <P> Smith said more anti-gang money should go to Valley organizations because of a  recent spurt in gang crime. Statistics released last month showed gang-related  crime in the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Bureau increased 134% in  1989 over the prior year -- from 510 crimes to 1,191 -- a greater increase than  in any of the department's three other bureaus.  </P> <P> The Central Bureau reported a 55% rise in gang-related crimes, and the West  Bureau reported a 34% increase. The South Bureau had the smallest rate of  increase, 6%, but the greatest number of gang-related crimes, 2,674.  </P> <P> Smith said it was not clear how much money Bernson will seek for Project Heavy.  Bernson was attending a seminar in Irvine on Monday.  </P> <P> The agencies receiving the $1.4 million are to use it to provide services to  youths susceptible to joining gangs, spending much of the money addressing  problems in the families of potential gang members.  </P> <P> Of the total city funding package, $222,928, or 15.2%, was allocated to the  Valley. City staff recommended that El Centro de Amistad, a Canoga Park-based  social service agency, coordinate the Valley program.  </P> <P> El Centro would get $37,000 under the plan, while El Nido Services, another  Valley agency, would receive $68,928, the largest single award among Valley  agencies. Other agencies recommended for funding were: Juvenile Justice  Connection, Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center, Maud Booth Center, SFV  Child Guidance and Assn. of Educational Therapists.  </P> <P> Because funding is allocated to each of the four Los Angeles Police Department  bureaus based on its share of gang-related crimes, the Valley would receive the  smallest amount, despite having the greatest rate of increase. Although Bernson  has not opposed use of this formula before, it now makes sense to give  additional funds to those areas experiencing rapid increases, Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith noted that 35% of the city's youth -- ages 6 to 17 years -- live in the  Valley.  </P> <P> "Using gang-related crimes is the wrong criteria for allocating funds," Smith  said. "It misses the mark. Kids in gangs who are already committing crimes are  not the ones we thought were to get helped by this program. We thought it was  to help kids from problem homes not yet in gangs."  </P></p>

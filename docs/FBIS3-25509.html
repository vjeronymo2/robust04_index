			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Blantyre, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The opposition weekly  MALAWI DEMOCRATIC said Friday [18 February] it had received  death threats over a story about an opposition party leader,  Bakili Muluzi.    The paper last week published a story revealing how Muluzi,  favoured to win May 17 presidential race, was jailed for six  months for stealing government funds 25 years ago while working  as a civil servant.    The newspaper is a mouthpiece of the opposition Alliance for  Democracy Party, while Muluzi is leader of the United Democratic  Front Party.    "Since the story was published, we have received more than  15  serious death threats through telephones and written messages,"  editor Charles Simango told AFP Friday.    He said he was not surprised with the threats, but added "we  had overwhelming evidence" to back up the story. "The paper  remains unshaken as long as we report the truth," Simango said.    Muluzi, former right-hand man of President Kamuzu Banda,  told  another newspaper THE NATION that the MALAWI DEMOCRATIC had  "sinister intentions to make the people of Malawi discredit me."    Muluzi, who comes from the majority south, said: "It is upon  the people of Malawi to decide whether they want me as a leader  or not." Observers say the newspaper revelations have damaged  his standing.    A two-day constitutional conference beginning February 21 is  likely to recommend that presidential candidates must not  criminal records of dishonesty, a source in the national  consultative council told AFP. [sentence as received]    The council, which includes representatives from all  political parties and manages Malawi's transition to democratic  pluralism, has been writing a new constitution which will  adopted during the conference.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (5): The target is a triple seven - Economy OPTIMISM is increasing that South Korea's overheated economy is gradually cooling down. Although the country had an enviable growth rate of 8.4 per cent last year, the brisk economic activity fueled a high inflation rate of 9.7 per cent, steep market interest rates of 17.8 per cent and a widening current account deficit of Dollars 8.8bn as import growth outpaced exports. These are worrying statistics for a country whose livelihood is heavily dependent on exports in spite of the growing importance of the domestic market. South Korea's international competitiveness has been eroded in the last five years by a jump in wages as workers sought to keep up with higher consumer prices and climbing housing costs. The inflationary pressure was fuelled by an expansion of the money supply. However, the government claims that 1992 will mark the turning point in regaining control. 'The Korean economy is in a process of readjustment. We are not pessimistic about its prospects,' says Mr Kim Chong In, a legislator who recently served as the senior presidential secretary for economic affairs. The Economic Planning Board (EPB), the main economic policy agency, speaks of achieving a triple seven economy this year, meaning a 7 per cent growth rate, 7 per cent inflation, and a Dollars 7bn current account deficit. That assessment can probably be dismissed as election talk and even the government is hesitating to adopt these targets as its official goal. There are encouraging signs that South Korea is approaching the EPB guidelines, although still falling short of them. The economy grew by 7.6 per cent during the first quarter. The inflation rate of 2.6 per cent during the period was almost half that of the 4.9 per cent rate a year ago. The current account deficit shrank by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn as the growth in exports surpassed that for imports, narrowing the trade deficit by 23 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn. The Korean Development Institute (KDI), the government-affiliated research organisation, recently revised its forecast for the year based on the favourable first-quarter results. It predicts a gross national product growth rate of 7.5 per cent, an inflation rate of 8.7 per cent and a current account deficit of Dollars 8.4bn. But some of the reasons for the improvement should still make government officials pause. The slowdown in economic growth is mainly due to cut backs in fixed investment rather than personal consumption. The government has clamped down on the construction spree, which was a main source of economic expansion in the last few years. The state is curtailing residential investments following the completion of its three-year programme to construct 2m housing units, while commercial and infrastructure projects are less affected by investment restrictions. The growth rate in construction is expected by the KDI to be halved to 5.4 per cent this year. The growth in industrial investments is declining from a rate of 12.8 per cent in 1991 to an estimated 9.7 per cent in 1992, reflecting the economic slowdown and high interest rates. This follows several years of healthy industrial investments as Korean companies sought more automation in their factories. The growth in personal consumption remains stubbornly high, with the KDI predicting an increase of 8.8 per cent against a 9.2 per cent rise in 1991. The government has vainly sought to curb consumer spending, which has been bolstered by wage rises and money earned in the speculative property market over the last few years. The state has sponsored an austerity campaign that has focused on conspicuous consumption, including the purchase of imported luxury goods. But this has had only a marginal impact. The slight fall in private consumption expected this year is mainly the result of slower growth in disposable income caused by high inflation and lower wage increases. The economic slowdown is expected to narrow the trade deficit and the current account deficit. Exports grew by 11 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn in the first quarter of 1992 due to increased shipments of cars, ship and petrochemical products, outpacing the 6.6 per cent rise in imports to Dollars 19.5bn. South Korea will have difficulty sustaining this performance. Lower oil prices were largely responsible for the decreased import growth in the first quarter. A year ago, South Korea was stockpiling oil in response to the Gulf crisis as oil prices were hitting their peak. KDI expects imports to rise by 9.7 per cent to Dollars 85.6 per cent this year, against a 16.7 per cent increase in 1991, due to falling purchases of capital goods from abroad. Exports will rise by 10.4 per cent to Dollars 77.5bn, reflecting a gradual recovery in the global economy and a depreciation of the won. Exports could grow faster if South Korea managed to tame inflation, which is the government's number one economic priority, according to Mr Choi Gak Kyu, the vice-minister and head of the EPB. The battle against inflation rests on tighter fiscal and monetary policies on the demand side and containment of wage increases on the cost side. That may be a tough task to achieve in an election year and with the government's authority weakened by its disappointing result in the National Assembly elections two months ago. The government is seeking to cap wage growth at 5 per cent during this year's pay negotiations. Most independent economists believe the actual rise will be closer to 10 per cent, although this is still down from the 20 per cent annual pay growth that workers received in the late 1980s. The government is arguing that wage demands should be lower since housing prices are starting to fall. It claims this is the result of its plan to build 2m housing units in 1988-91, although critics contend the project helped fuel inflation and drove up wages as workers fled industry for more lucrative construction jobs. The government must resist the temptation to increase the money supply in an election year. It has committed itself to limit this year's growth in the M2 measure of money to 18.5 per cent against 18.6 per cent in 1991. This follows an average growth rate of 19 per cent in the second half of the 1980s. Mr Cho Soon, the Bank of Korea governor, is dedicated to a tight monetary policy and is willing to see companies go bankrupt to maintain it. That view could prove unpopular with his political masters at the Ministry of Finance. Pressure on the ministry from senior government officials to ease lending, at least to small and medium businesses, could increase as the wave of expected bankruptcies mounts in the approach to the presidential election in December. Some members of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party argue that monetary policy should remain flexible. They argue that an excessively tight money supply could slow growth below the 6.8 per cent to 7.2 per cent range that is considered optimal by the EPB to absorb the country's young labour force. Another obstacle to keeping the money supply under control is the seepage of money from the country's sizeable underground economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. has  started talks with a major Chinese automaker on possible joint  car production, Toyota officials said Monday [20 June].    Toyota sent two executives to China on Sunday for talks with  Tianjin Automobile Industrial Corp., the officials said.    The two executives are Akira Takahashi, senior managing  director for production technology, and Akira Yokoi, managing  director for external affairs.    During their visit until Thursday, they will hold talks with  Tianjin officials over the possibility of forming a joint  venture, they said.    Moreover, the two Toyota officials will obtain information  on  China's policy on the participation of foreign capital in new  passenger car manufacturing operations expected to be introduced  in 1996.    Toyota's car production in China, if realized, is expected  to  encourage other Japanese and foreign automakers, industry  analysts said.    Already, Ford Motor Co. of the United States and Mitsubishi  Motors Corp. of Japan have declared their intent to move into  the Chinese market.    Toyota has supplied state-owned Jinbei (Gold Cup) automotive  in Shenyang with commercial-vehicle technology.    But it believes Tianjin Automobile Industrial would be the  most appropriate production partner among China's eight car  producers, since the company is expected to form the "core" of  the Chinese auto industry in the future.    Tianjin has been turning out cars in a tie-up with Daihatsu  Motor Co. of the Toyota group.    Chinese officials say China plans to create six or seven  conglomerates by the year 2000, each capable of churning out  300,000 cars a year. These would be further reshuffled into  three or four giants in the early decades of the next century.</p>

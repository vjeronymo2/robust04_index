			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There has been a big rally in the center of Zaire's  capital, Kinshasa, today of the opposition UDPS [Union for  Democracy and Social Progress] party. It was addressed by its  leader, Etienne Tshisekedi -- the first time he has made such a  big public appearance in a long time. He comes as the tussle  over the prime minister's post drags on interminably.  Tshisekedi says he is the legitimate premier. President Mobutu  won't hear of it, and there is a split in the opposition  alliance, the Sacred Union, with some parties deserting  Tshisekedi and putting up their own candidates. Chris Green  asked journalist Mikheli Ron in Kinshasa what the atmosphere has  been like at today's rally:    [Begin recording] [Ron] I mean, it was an atmosphere of  great  enthusiasm, very cheerful. There were probably about 20,000  people in all, and they crammed into the botanical gardens --  which is in the center of Kinshasa. There were people waving  green bands, which is the usual sign of victory and peace, and a  lot of people had to climb up into trees to get a glimpse of the  stage. Women were taking off their rags and laying them down on  the floor to form a ceremonial carpet for Tshisekedi to walk on  as he came into the botanical gardens.    [Green] So it seems they gave him a fairly extravagant  welcome?    [Ron] He got a very enthusiastic reception. He always does,  but he hasn't actually been seen in public for quite a while.  The last big crowd event was when his mother died, and there  were a lot of people who turned up for her funeral, but he  hadn't actually spoken in public for the last three months.    [Green] And what did he say today?    [Ron] His message was, as ever, that he remains the prime  minister of Zaire and expects to be reconfirmed by President  Mobutu. He appealed to President Mobutu to approve his position  as the prime minister, to sign the decree that would make that  legal, and he said that if this doesn't happen he is willing to  call for a general strike in the state's diamond mining company,  the MIBA [Bakwanga Mining Company], and he said that now that  the copper mining industry, Gecamines [General Quarries and  Mines Company], has virtually closed down, this would obviously  bring the whole of Zaire's economy grinding to a halt, and  that....    [Green, interrupting] Is that actually a credible threat on  his part?    [Ron] I think it is credible, in that if he were to launch  that kind of call he might well get a response. Yes, I think he  does have that kind of popular support.    [Green] Did Tshisekedi have anything to say about relations  among the parties opposing Mobutu?    [Ron] Well, relations are extremely strained at the moment  between his UDPS party and some centrist opposition parties that  are fielding their own candidates for the post of prime  minister. Last week France, Belgium, and the United States sent  their diplomats to his house to ask him to reopen talks with  those parties. Today, he wasn't being very conciliatory. He  basically said that those parties are welcome to come back into  the fold, but they will have to show solid signs of good faith  before they will be accepted. He did not really....    [Green, interrupting] Solid signs of good faith presumably  means full support for Tshisekedi?    [Ron] I think that is what he means. He certainly wasn't  showing any signs of compromise.

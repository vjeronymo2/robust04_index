			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE, UMBERG INSPIRE 'NO' VOTE ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> I could not believe my eyes as I read a profile of Curt Pringle (R-Garden  Grove) regarding his stand against abortion at any stage for any reason,  including rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.  </P> <P> It would be easy to dismiss this person as an old fool set in his ways.  </P> <P> However, he is only 30 and in public office. My God, that scares me. His rigid,  Dark Ages stance relegates women to the lowest form of humanity, having a  lesser worth than even a fertilized egg.  </P> <P> To choose the life of a fetus over the life of the mother was one of the  saddest and most tragic acts a doctor had to perform in the 1940s. Husbands  became widowers, children motherless.  </P> <P> Every woman, Democrat or Republican, and every man who has a sister, daughter  or wife, or any enlightened man should take to the polls and resoundingly vote  this guy out of office. He's dangerous.  </P> <P> LORRAINE DIAMOND, Orange  </P></p>

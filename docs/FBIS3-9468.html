			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Tsvetan Totomirov, </F> commander in chief of the Bulgarian Ground Forces, by Vasil  Lyutskanov; date not given: "We Were Not Created by Foreign  Commission, the 'Soviet Connection' Has Never Interfered With  Us"]    [Text] [Lyutskanov] General Totomirov, how would you  comment on the allegations in connection with the alleged  elimination of the Ground Forces command [KSV]. Do you know  anything about the source of the rumors, and how do you rate the  arguments "for" and "against" such alleged intentions?    [Totomirov] Personally, I am convinced that the question is  being artificially fanned by the press and is based on various  sources. If we accept such rumors as true, they apply in  particular to the Ground Forces [SV] personnel. Reflecting on  this aspect of the question I can only assume that such  ill-intentioned, conspiratorial rumors, conceived "in the dark,"  serve certain poorly concocted plans that reflect a total lack  of patriotic feelings. My conviction is based on the recent  meeting between the KSV and members of the parliamentary  National Security Commission.    At the meeting the commission chairman Mr. Slatinski,  himself, and the representatives of the Defense Ministry and  Army General Staff confirmed that eliminating the KSV was not on  the agenda for the time being. The allegation that the KSV was  created by "foreign commission," that is, on the initiative of  the Warsaw Pact, also appears outdated. It was clear that such  command staffs were established long before us in NATO  member-states such as Greece, France, the UK, Italy, and other  countries. The most convincing evidence of the absence of a  "Soviet connection" in the creation of the KSV within the  Bulgarian Army is the establishment of an analogous command  staff in the Romanian Army following the disbanding of the  Warsaw Pact, rather than during the time it still existed.  Thus, I do not believe rumors and allegations, but prefer to  trust authoritative institutions. In other words, no arguments  "for" and "against" disbanding the KSV exist at all. I would  rather say that we are confronted with a poorly concocted  "fiction" based on specific, biased intentions.    [Lyutskanov] Are you expecting any dismissals among the  officers and sergeants in the Ground Forces?    [Totomirov] There are constant rumors about imminent  dismissals. Not only do they have a negative impact on the  self- confidence and enthusiasm of our officers and sergeants,  but are a cause of concern for military personnel, for all  employees and workers in the military institutions. An officer  who has devoted his entire life to the military does not deserve  to be confronted with such uncertainty about his future. It is  very easy to dismiss officers and sergeants; it is much more  difficult to train military cadres. While the first thing,  dismissal, is a unilateral act and can be done at a stroke, the  second is a very difficult and lengthy process. The Ground  Forces are currently suffering from a lack of the necessary  officers' corps. Unlike in previous years, however, the lack of  well-trained officers not only affects the command staffs, but  also the sub-units. Compared with the past, 20 percent of the  officers' posts are unoccupied in the KSV today. The reformed  Bulgarian Army needs well trained and experienced cadres. Hence,  before dismissing cadres, we should know who will replace them.    [Lyutskanov] What kind of resources in terms of money and  officers are required for the redeployment of the SV in  accordance with the new military doctrine?    [Totomirov] The SV reform is a complicated and lengthy  process involving the following tasks: redeployment of certain  units and groups of units, transition to brigade organization  and adjusting the combat staff to the established quotas,  rearmament with effective and updated armaments and equipment,  improvement in the professional training of military cadres and  personnel, transition to a system of mixed equipment  [komplektuvane] of the troops, and so forth. These tasks  require the implementation of a series of measures, but they  also call for time and money. So if I mention an amount needed  for the redeployment of the SV, it would hardly be accurate.  Before redeploying the sub-units, we must build, repair, or  adapt the barracks and living quarters for army personnel to the  existing infrastructure. We need to provide parking space and  storage, and premises and facilities so training can be carried  out inside and outside the barracks. In 1993 only 17 million  leva out of the 160 million needed were granted for the planned  major repairs of storage areas and parking facilities. A total  of 2,049 officers in Plovdiv, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Blagoevgrad,  and Shumen have no quarters. Considerably fewer motor vehicles  than necessary are provided for our units and groups of units  today, which means that the number of firing exercises and the  amount of tactical training has to be reduced. We are trying to  promote certain measures that do not cost much money. As far as  the officers' corps of the Ground Forces is concerned, it is  well trained and ready to implement the reform. It is now  necessary to fulfill the remaining conditions for the reform.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Albania spurns Greek overture Albania's President Sali Berisha yesterday rejected a Greek proposal for dialogue in exchange for the release of five ethnic Greeks convicted of espionage and illegal arms possession. 'They are and will remain Albanian citizens, and we do not indulge in trade with our citizens,' Mr Berisha said. Greece has offered negotiations on improving sour relations between the two countries on condition that Albania set the five free and allow them free passage to Greece. Last week, an appeals court reduced their jail sentences of 6-8 years by 1-2 years. Also last week, a terrorist organisation in northern Greece admitted being behind an attack earlier this year on an Albanian army centre that killed two soldiers. President Berisha said capture and punishment of the perpetrators would be welcomed by Albania. He also defended a draft constitution that would force the Greek head of Albania's Orthodox church to step down. Still to be approved, probably by referendum, it stipulates that heads of Albania's mainstream religious communities must be Albanian-born citizens who have lived there for the past 20 years.</p>

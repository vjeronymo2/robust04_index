In studies by other authors cited here, the miniband  structure of the GaAs/AlAs superlattice was computed within the  framework of the effective mass method applying some boundary  conditions for the electron wave function, and contrary to the  empirical results, the even or odd property of the M monolayer  was not affecting the miniband spectrum. It is demonstrated in  this study that these boundary conditions require a revision.  After introducing a sign changing multiplier, depending on the  number of the superlattice monolayer, the computations in  approximation of the effective mass also indicate a dependence  of the GX-mixing effect on the even-odd property of the M  number. Electron dispersion for two lower miniband is found in  the superlattice transition region from type I to type II.  Figure 1, references 9: 2 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Finn MPs near N-plant vote EUROPEAN energy industry leaders and environmentalists will be watching the Finnish parliament closely today as debate opens on whether to approve construction of a new nuclear power plant. The project, one of a few of its kind in Europe, has become the focus for wider arguments over the merits of nuclear power. Within Finland, it has prompted sharp debate in recent years, with the outcome of a free vote by MPs due on Friday still uncertain. Commercial interests are also watching developments closely. Bids to build the proposed FM10bn-FM15bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds 1.7bn) plant have already been received from ABB Atom of Sweden, Atomenergoexport of Russia and NPI, a consortium formed by Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France. Finland already has four nuclear reactors, built in the 1970s, with a total capacity of 2,300MW. They supply about a third of the country's electricity needs and about 15 per cent of total energy needs. In 1975, talks began on building a fifth reactor, of about 1,000MW capacity, at one of the two existing sites. By 1986, the authorities were close to giving the go-ahead when the Chernobyl nuclear accident led to radioactive fall-out on Finland. The project was frozen until two years ago. The cabinet finally gave its assent, by an 11:6 vote, last February, but this intensified a debate which has split the two largest political parties, the governing Centre party and the opposition Social Democrats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview under the rubric "Crucial Interview" with </F> Lieutenant General Viktor Grechaninov, chief of staff of civil  defense of Ukraine, by Colonel Valentin Dmitriyev, NARODNA  ARMIYA correspondent; place and date not given: "Our Specialists  Are Always Ready!"]    [Text] [Dmitriyev] Viktor Fedorovich, a year ago, on 3  February, the Law of Ukraine "On Civil Defense of Ukraine" was  adopted. This day has now become a holiday for a large number of  people who see the entire meaning of their work in the  protection of the life and health of people, preventing  emergencies and catastrophes, and cleaning up after them. What  are their daily tasks like?    [Grechaninov] According to that law, for a year we have been  living, working, and reforming the civil defense system,  fulfilling the requirements and tasks contained in that document  for creating a system for defending the life and health of  people in Ukraine. During that time we have done a great deal of  work for reorganizing the structure of the staff itself, we have  published statutes on the civil defense staff of Ukraine and on  regional civil defense staffs, and the Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine is now considering a draft we submitted of the Statute  on Civil Defense and a number of other documents that would make  it possible to create the legal base necessary for successful  performance of the tasks set for civil defense. And here they  are. The main one is to prevent emergencies, and namely  accidents and catastrophes of a technical nature. And if they  occur anyway--to clean up after them skillfully and quickly, to  render aid to the victims, to provide life support systems, etc.  From this follows an entire complex of tasks, beginning with  prompt notification and ending with aid to the suffering  population after the cleanup. This is a long list of jobs which  require special forces and means. Therefore, the civil defense  forces consist of civil defense troops of specialized formations  and nonmilitarized formations.    There does not seem to be any need to explain in detail just  what civil defense troops are. But their specialized formations  are worth discussing. They include highly qualified  specialists--rescue workers who provide guaranteed service for  various dangerous enterprises. We in Ukraine have 1,693 of these  enterprises in the chemical area alone. The country has too many  sources of danger: Among them are nuclear power plants and water  reservoirs, which in the right circumstances could be the cause  of great catastrophes. There are also possible earthquakes. Or,  for example, the danger of secondary consequences -- a break in  the dam of the sedimentation pond at a chemical enterprise, etc.    [Dmitriyev] Do you have a certain kind of specialists or is  it possible to teach just any soldier to do the job?    [Grechaninov] It is difficult to train the same soldier  psychologically for action in extreme situations when, for  example, there has been an earthquake or a landslide and it is  necessary to look through the heaps of rubble and rescue people,  to drag the victims out, etc. And it cannot be ruled out that it  will be necessary to deal with the dead, the wounded... This is  far from easy. Therefore we have special training aimed at  developing in the individual the necessary qualities and  psychological stability in the most difficult of situations.    We have a very broad scope of training. The main thing is  that we must have specialists who are capable of working while  wearing the necessary protective clothing, depending on the  nature of the production and the accident. They include people  capable of working under water, of jumping from the air in a  disaster zone; they include specialists capable of evaluating a  situation on the spot, making a decision, and correctly carrying  out what they have decided, which is very important. Because if  a mistake is made in emergency rescue work, the consequences can  sometimes be irreparable; for example, if you disturb a pile of  rubble and do not manage to save the people. A high level of  professionalism is achieved through constant training. And we  are now placing our hopes in the idea of having our people work  under contract, that is, for several years. Because it is very  difficult to train a skilled specialist in a year and a half:  His training is long and varied.    Further. We have specialized subdivisions--like the Spetsat  [expansion not indicated], the Poltava detachment for cleanup  after accidents at petroleum deposits, the Dneprodzerzhinsk and  Zaporozhye chemical detachments, and others. These people under  today's conditions (let me note that they are excellent  specialists) must have good wages and proper social protection.  Otherwise they will go to commercial structures. And there are  truly dedicated people among them... This is one of today's  problems.    [Dmitriyev] But your people need not only a high level of  mastery but, frequently, also courage, heroism...    [Grechaninov] Our people never think about whether it is  heroism or not. Suffice it to recall that at the accident at the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant the first readings of the  radiation around the destroyed reactor were taken by our  officers, particularly Aleksandr Tomlenov. It was a civil  defense specialist who took the first helicopter flight to take  readings over the reactor.    We have a lot of problems, for example, with the little  "presents" left on the land after a war. Most frequently they  are large-capacity aerial bombs which are beyond our  specialists' range of competency. And, as a rule, all of them  have the kind of device and are in a condition that they can be  neither lifted nor transported--they must be defused on the  spot. Well, you can imagine the difficulties our specialists  encounter when they discover explosives in densely populated  residential areas of cities or on the site of an industrial  enterprise. And in spite of the fact that in such situations it  is very dangerous to work with the "rusty death" that has been  discovered, our people defuse them, raise them to the surface,  and take them to a safe place, where they are exploded.    Literally a couple of days ago an ammunition depot from the  war was discovered in Kiev. And what is to be done with it? Next  door is a residential building. Accompanied by the president's  representative in the city and the rayon, we inspected the  place. A decision has now been made to clear the mines from the  depot without resettling the residents of the nearby buildings.    It is possible to give many examples of our people's  heroism.  Especially in gas rescue work. Let us face it, accidents occur  at our chemically dangerous enterprises. And here our brave  specialists, as soon as they hear the alarm, boldly go to clean  up after the accident and fulfill their mission.    Or recall Chernobyl. Very many officers and enlisted men of  civil defense units put their best foot forward there. In  particular it was our specialists who removed the heavy water  from the destroyed reactor.    Today our people are working indefatigably in spite of all  the objective and subjective difficulties. First among them I  would like to note the civil defense chiefs of staff of Lvov  Oblast Colonel Damir Shafigulin, Kiev--Colonel Vladimir Zinkin,  and Poltava--Colonel Leonid Martyninko, and the leader of the  Zaporozhye specialized formation--Boris Udod. I can give the  names of many self-sacrificing workers and highly qualified  specialists. But even among them there are those who are the  best. There are especially many of them among the subordinates  of Boris Petrovich Udod. Several days ago this collective had  occasion to participate in the cleanup after the collapse of the  concrete ceiling of the building of the Zaporozhye Oblast trade  union association. No mechanized equipment could be used there.  Therefore the specialists did everything by hand. And in three  hours the aftermath of the accident had been cleaned up,  supports had been placed under the vault of the building, and  everything necessary had been done to make sure that it did not  collapse completely.    This formation has very wide-ranging tasks. It is meant to  perform emergency rescue work at metallurgical and chemical  facilities. Its specialists perform difficult jobs for  prevention, including those that even the personnel of the  facility refuse to do--they are so difficult and dangerous.    Brigade commander Colonel Aleksandr Yevdin, regiment  commander Yevgeniy Konov, chief of the brigade's engineering  service Major Vladimir Potapenko, and many other officers enjoy  well-deserved respect.    [Dmitriyev] Few of our readers understand what the words  "civil defense" really mean. What do your formations do, what is  the principle of leadership of the country's civil defense?    [Grechaninov] The principle of civil defense is  territorial-production. The chief of the country's civil defense  is the prime minister, and the civil defense chiefs in the  oblasts and rayons are representatives of the president of  Ukraine. At enterprises they are the managers. Each of them has  a commission for emergencies and nonmilitarized formations.  Because the volume of work that must be done constitutes a whole  complex of measures. If, for example, it is necessary to  resettle people to evacuate them somewhere, someone has to  provide them with shelter, clothing, food, and medical  assistance. Finally, jobs must be found for them. And all this  is the responsibility of the civil defense. Therefore it is the  task of the civil defense staff and the regional staffs to  coordinate the actions of the ministries, departments, various  structures, enterprises, and all organs of power for organized  work according to a single plan.    [Dmitriyev] Well, who is the first to receive the alarm in  the localities? How is the mechanism for your reaction engaged?    [Grechaninov] The existing civil defense system, which is  now  being restructured, makes it possible to react rapidly to all  cataclysms that arise. We have people on duty in our civil  defense staff headquarters. Plus, in a number of regions (in  Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, and other oblasts) special groups  have been created which, if necessary, go to the site and report  on everything to the civil defense staff and then immediately  organize the work that is necessary in such situations.    Now, according to predictions, the strong winds in  Transcarpathia are supposed to get up to 40 meters per second.  We too are preparing for this. Instructions have been given to  the local areas to reinforce the special repair groups of  electricians, communications experts, etc. so that it will be  possible to promptly correct any damage caused by the elements.  In general, all the work is being done for prevention in  Transcarpathia.    [Dmitriyev] Transcarpathia now has a difficult situation  caused by the mountain rivers overflowing their banks. Large  regions have been flooded and many villages have suffered.  Assistance is needed in resettling people from the destroyed  homes. Are your people participating in the rescue work there?    [Grechaninov] Most actively. It is possible to give many  examples of self-sacrificing participation of our subdivisions  in all the work. It is difficult even to single anybody out. The  people let nothing stop them from rescuing the victims,  organizing their evacuation, and giving them blood, food, and  medical assistance.    [Dmitriyev] In other words, they are doing their duty  honorably. Many people are in need of their help. In this  connection a question arises: What about civil defense itself,  does it need help from the state? What problems does your  department have?    [Grechaninov] During all of 1993 the collective of the staff  of the civil defense of Ukraine was working with dedication to  improve the country's civil defense system. At the same time  objective difficulties, primarily financial ones, are impacting  the effectiveness of the measures we are taking. Thus the chief  of civil defense is the prime minister. His frequent replacement  has a negative impact on the state of affairs...    In order to carry out the difficult task in the region that  is affected the specialists need special equipment, instruments,  means of personal protection, etc. And all this requires the  corresponding material expenditures. Unfortunately, financial  matters become worse each year. Although one should understand  that the more money that is invested in measures for prevention  of accidents and emergencies, the lower the cost of cleaning up  after them.    [Dmitriyev] Nonetheless, your department has a considerable  potential of its own. Are any attempts being made to take  advantage of internal reserves?    [Grechaninov] Understanding the difficulty of the economic  situation in the country, of course, we are assessing its  capabilities realistically and searching for additional  reserves, including in international activity. In particular,  civil defense of Russia has received tens of millions of dollars  for delivering humanitarian aid cargo through the UN. And this  year we too want to become involved in the implementation of the  humanitarian aid programs of this international organization.    We are now very much in need of money. Because we have  conceived and are working on one necessary system.    [Dmitriyev] One wonders what it is needed for, if, of  course,  it is not a secret.    [Grechaninov] Our specialists are working on a system of  notification which would automatically inform the civil defense  staff if an accident occurs at a dangerous enterprise. And then  it would not make any difference whether the manager wanted to  inform us of this promptly or not--we would have our own  information about what happened. Remember how much time they  remained silent about the accidents at the Beloyarsk and  Chernobyl nuclear power plants?...    We have already achieved certain results in this area. We  are  now automatically receiving information from a number of  facilities with chemical and radiation danger. But we must make  sure that this is a system that will enable us to monitor  completely everything that can present a threat to the life and  health of the population.    Furthermore, in keeping with the concept of civil defense,  each regiment has an emergency rescue battalion on 30-minute  alert, and in the brigade there are two. In other words, the  personnel of these subdivisions are prepared to move with their  technical equipment to the site of the contamination within a  half hour. But we are not satisfied with the questions of  financing. We need money to buy means of minor mechanization,  technical equipment, instruments, etc. The quality of the  emergency rescue work depends directly on this.    [Dmitriyev] From all that has been said, one can draw the  conclusion that your department has concerns 24 hours a day.  Just take ecology. What "presents" the elements sometimes throws  in your way...    [Grechaninov] You are right about that. Just yesterday we  had  to solve a problem that arose before us: Ice was floating on the  rivers on the territory of Belarus. So we can expect it on our  territory soon as well, on the Dnieper. The threat is that  enormous amounts of water can accumulate, and they are capable  of washing away dams in the region of the 30-kilometer zone of  Chernobyl... So we are now working in close cooperation with the  Ministry of Water Management of Ukraine, the hydrometeorological  service, and our Belarusian colleagues.    [Dmitriyev] In other words, you have international ties and  contacts as well...    [Grechaninov] Quite right. One of the tasks of our civil  defense system is international activity for rendering  humanitarian aid and peace-making efforts. We are working on  bilateral agreements with our neighboring states--Poland,  Slovakia, and Belarus--so that in the event of a situation on  both sides of the border it would be possible to coordinate our  actions in matters of civil defense and localize the  consequences through joint efforts.    Incidentally, in a recent critique of a recent joint  strategic staff training session President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk concretized the tasks for the establishment of  international contacts of the country's civil defense.    This is what I wanted to note. We have a unique center for  modeling and predicting catastrophes. There is nothing like it  in Europe. Now our specialists can quickly and concretely model  one or another situation and its possible consequences. It has  already been tested repeatedly. This makes it possible to  promptly take correct and timely actions, beginning with  removing people, evacuating them, so that they do not end up in  the affected zone, and ending with cleaning up the aftermath.    The center has been visited by representatives of the UN,  and  apparently this organization is going to ask us to model for  other countries the possible variants of the development of  events in the case of the appearance of one emergency situation  or another.    [Dmitriyev] As I understand it, this order will not be free  of charge...    [Grechaninov] Of course it will be possible to earn foreign  currency for the state this way.    [Dmitriyev] But how does the interaction between our civil  defense and that of neighboring states occur in practice? Are  there examples?    [Grechaninov] As one example, I can discuss the following.  In  Izmail in Odessa Oblast we have a pulp and cardboard combine  which has large amounts of chlorine. Last summer there was a  fire there which threatened to cause a discharge of a  considerable quantity of substances that are dangerous to the  health, and not only of city dwellers but also of the population  on the territory of the neighboring state--Romania. Within 20  minutes after the signal was received in the civil defense staff  headquarters, both the president and the prime minister had on  their desks the conclusions and suggestions necessary for making  a decision. Our border guards and other departments were  promptly notified. The corresponding information was also sent  to the Romanian Embassy, for which the government of this state  expressed its gratitude to us.    [Dmitriyev] On this holiday I want to wish happiness and  good  health to you and all who work and serve with you in the civil  defense of Ukraine. And that you have fewer occasions to go to  disaster zones!    [Grechaninov] Unfortunately, the number of accidents and  catastrophes is not decreasing. Contributions toward the cleanup  are immense. And under the conditions of today's economy this is  a difficult burden which it has to bear. Therefore, we will do  everything we can to protect the country's economy by reducing  the number of catastrophes and the difficulty of cleaning up  their aftermath. Because there is a certain pattern here. The  more powerful and richer the civil defense, the fewer the  preconditions for accidents and other emergency situations, and  the less it is necessary to spend on cleaning up after them.</p>

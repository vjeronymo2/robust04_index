			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Technology: Experts tackle the bills Electricity is one of the highest costs for the water industry because of the power needed to run pumping stations 24 hours a day. An Israeli company, with a staff of six, is now winning orders from UK water companies for a computerised control system to cut those bills. Welsh Water, the first to have the system running, says it is saving up to 15 per cent of its electricity bill at its biggest treatment works, Court Farm, supplying Cardiff and Newport. This should mean an annual saving of more than Pounds 100,000. The system, called WaterExpert and designed by Intellect Expert Systems, is also being developed at two of its other plants. The impetus for WaterExpert was the electricity price pool - the complex wholesale market set up when the electricity industry was privatised - and the need to match water demand with the optimum tariff. Michael Harrington, divisional operations manager for Welsh Water, says: 'With the electricity price changing 48 times a day, the only way to control that is with some form of expert system. It is a very difficult job to do it manually or mentally.' Fed into WaterExpert, which uses a PC with software tailored to each plant, are factors such as reservoir levels, river abstraction rates, water quality, weather forecast and likely demand. It then produces a 24-hour operation schedule, either on-line or off-line, to initiate the opening and shutting of pumps and valves. The plan is modified automatically to take account of changes in demand or a mechanical failure, but it can also be adjusted by the operator. Intellect Expert Systems says WaterExpert should pay for itself within a year and the company has orders from three other UK water companies. John Roberts, works controller at Court Farm, says: 'The system is very user friendly. It does save electricity costs and management time - there is not so much time spent with paper and pencil.'</p>

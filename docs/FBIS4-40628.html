			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Parliamentary Observer Vladimir Yermolin </F> under the general heading "When Adopting the Federal Budget the  State Duma Accepted Reduced Defense Spending" accompanied by  list of deputies who voted for, against, or abstained and those  who did not register a vote]    [Text]  <H5>  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Parliamentary Observer Commentary </H5>   It should be borne in mind that by voting for the adoption  of  the government version of the federal budget, the deputies were  thereby accepting the defense budget which, when the proposals  of Mikhail Zadornov and his committee [the Committee for the  Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances] were taken into account,  amounted in total to 40.6 trillion rubles [R]. This figure,  according to the most modest estimates of specialists from the  Defense Ministry (and indeed the ministries of finance and the  economy, too), will not meet even the minimum level required.  That will require around 15 trillion more.    Thus, in saying "yes" to such a budget it may be presumed  that the deputies were leaving the Army to sort out its own  problems, saying to it: "you'll manage somehow." It is curious  that even those deputies who just the day before considered it  almost a crime to agree to military spending of less than R55  trillion somehow suddenly decided to make do with scarcely more  than R40 trillion. Look at the results of the voting and  remember the deputies' public statements... The figures speak  for themselves -- only 40 parliamentarians felt it necessary to  say "no" to this budget. Of course, not all of them are  concerned for the fate of the Armed Forces -- the present budget  will also reduce science, culture, and health care to starvation  rations. But those who said "yes" to the government draft law  did agree to a defense budget of R40.6 trillion. And that means  that they agreed to a level of officers' pay which is a pittance  by present-day standards, to a chronic shortage of housing in  the Army, to ships which will have to perform combat duty even  though they can barely stay afloat because there is no money to  pay for repairs, to aircraft which have been standing idle for  months for want of fuel, to test ranges overgrown with weeds, to  a defense industry which is paralyzed... There are many things  that those deputies agreed to when they voted so hastily for the  government version of the budget.    An analysis of the results of the vote clearly show that the  following factions did not consider it necessary to fight for a  decent defense budget: the Communists, the Agrarians, the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Women of Russia, the  majority of deputies from New Regional Policy, the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, and the Democratic Party of Russia. A  section of Russia's Choice preferred to abstain while another  section did not vote at all. Only the Yabloko  (Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin) faction actively opposed the  government's draft budget. And even that faction objected not  so much to the reduced military spending as to the general  approach to budget policy itself.    Strange as it may seem, the members of the State Duma's  Defense Committee also accepted the loss of R15 trillion. None  of them voted "against." To be fair it should be noted that  until recently the committee sought to influence the  government's position and acted as an ally of the Defense  Ministry. Thus it is all the more incomprehensible why members  of the committee surrendered their right to vote without a  battle, as it were. How else is one to interpret the failure to  take part in the voting? Eight committee members actually said  "yes" to the budget. Although at the moment that the vote took  place, Aleksandr Piskunov, for example, was actually standing at  the microphone making one last desperate attempt to persuade his  colleagues not to rush into the adoption of the budget.  Incidentally, Sergey Glazyev, who recently told KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  readers (see the 7 June issue) how it was possible to get 55  trillion for the Army without increasing the budget deficit at  the same time, decided for some reason against making such an  attempt.    To cut a long story short, there is one conclusion which  instantly springs to mind: The rumors about a  military-industrial lobby in the State Duma proved to be  exaggerated, to put it mildly. There is no reasonably cohesive  force, faction, or party in the State Duma today which would  seriously defend the military's interests. Barely more than a  dozen [yedva li bolshe desytaka] members of the entire corps of  deputies sincerely care for the Army and the country's defense.    I do not want to resort to conjecture or cast a slur on  people whose absence from the session or failure to vote may  well have been due to factors which are even quite valid. The  results of the voting are in front of us. One vote out of many.  No more than that. True, these results may affect the lives of  hundreds of thousands of people and indeed the fate of the  Russian Army itself. I hope that the deputies were aware of  this when they decided which button to press or whether to press  a button at all. The results of the voting which took place at  1647 hours on 8 June may prove historic. And when in the future  we look at the names of the people's elected representatives, we  will have a special feeling when we think of the first State  Duma in post-Soviet Russia and its attitude to the defense  capability of the Armed Forces, the problems of the Army and  Navy, and its concern for the "man with the gun."  <H5>  The Roll-Call Vote Shows Who is Who </H5>   The discussion of the 1994 federal budget at the second  reading took place behind closed doors, as is well known. And  the decision was also made "in-house" -- in the absence of the  press and television. However, among the people there was, for  quite understandable reasons, considerable interest in this  vote. Within the Armed Forces, too, the logical question was  asked: Which of the people's elected representatives said "yes"  to such an patently meager defense budget?    In response to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers' requests, we now  publish the results of the roll-call vote on the 1994 federal  budget (second reading).  <H5>  Those Who Voted in Favor </H5>   M.M.

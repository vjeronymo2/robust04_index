			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NEW ANGLES ON A DESERT HIDEAWAY  </P> <P> Rising like a Flintstone cartoon house from giant quartz monzonite boulders,  this desert retreat on a 10-acre site in Joshua Tree was built with wit, style  and the intention of breaking -- or breaking out of -- traditional rules.  </P> <P> To begin with, the house is three structures instead of one. Windows and door  frames are angled, not plumb. Exterior walls are painted periwinkle blue,  "gluggy" olive (the architect's adjective) and burnt orange, an otherworldly  palette that is inspired by desert blooms such as yellow cups, lupine and  poppies. "Combined in unusual combinations, earth colors are quite amazing,"  says architectural designer Josh Schweitzer, who built the residence as a  weekend retreat.  </P> <P> Building materials are basic: painted stucco, dry wall, exposed aggregate and  simple cabinets. Likewise, the purpose of the house is simple. Schweitzer, 36,  calls it a shelter, not a home, because 90% of his time there is spent outside.  "It's really a refuge to give us shelter when we want to be protected, a  service center for us to cook, bathe and sleep. People don't perceive it as a  house -- it's not exactly your standard ranch with a roof," he says. The three  structures occupy 950 square feet. The blue building houses the kitchen, dining  room, bath, bedroom and two suspended sleeping lofts. It is joined to the green  building, which functions as the living room, with a voluminous 20-foot  ceiling. The open-air, poppy-colored structure stands apart from the others.  It's used mainly for taking in the sunsets over the Little San Bernardino  Range.  </P> <P> Schweitzer, best known for avant-garde restaurant designs (he designed City  Restaurant, Rondo, Border Grill, and recently Border Grill 2),  self-deprecatingly describes his work as "chunky, clunky and heavy-looking."  There is a certain monumentality in all of Schweitzer's work. His initial  attraction to monumentality came in the sixth grade when a teacher introduced  him to the wonders of ancient Egyptian history. Now he designs his buildings,  and their rooms, with unusual heights, and they have, he says, a certain  spirituality.  </P> <P> The 300-square-foot living room has a ceiling as high as the room is long,  giving the room an uplifting cathedral-like quality. "If I was to make a  connection of how I perceived volumes and space, I would say, 'They don't have  to be big, but they have to be tall,' " Schweitzer says.  </P> <P> And what about those windows and doors? Spaces between the nearby desert rocks  inspired Schweitzer to design the nearly trapezoidal shapes. Doors loom high  and irregular. "We're so geared in our thinking that spaces must have a  uniformity of heights," he says. "My whole bent is to disturb that sense of  reality. They're not meant to be upsetting, just not the same."  </P></p>

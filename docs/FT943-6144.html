			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SB's Dollars 2.9bn bid may hit credit rating SmithKline Beecham's planned Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.87bn) purchase of the consumer health operations of Sterling Winthrop could cost it its double-A credit rating, potentially adding to the borrowing costs associated with the deal. Yesterday Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, said it was reviewing the Anglo-US group's credit standing and may downgrade it. This follows a similar announcement by rival agency Moody's late on Monday, after the Sterling deal was announced. Both agencies currently accord SB their lowest double-A rating, AA-minus in the case of S&amp;P and AA3 for Moody's. A downgrade would take the company into the single-A category. This could raise its debt costs, since many bond holders are restricted to owning securities issued by companies or other entities with ratings of double-A or above.</p>

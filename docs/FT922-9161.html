			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings fall at SA brewer's retail units DIFFICULT trading conditions contributed to a sharp fall in earnings at OK Bazaars and Afcol, two retail-based subsidiaries of the South African Breweries group, in the year to end-March. Attributable earnings dropped 37 per cent at OK Bazaars, the mass merchandising supermarket chain, and by 35 per cent at Afcol, the furniture group. OK Bazaars decided to pass its final dividend, while the overall dividend at Afcol dropped to 53 cents per share from 81.5 cents. OK Bazaars said the group had been particularly hard hit by escalating unemployment and the introduction of VAT. Turnover was only 5 per cent up at R5.04bn (Dollars 1.8bn). Operating income was down 27 per cent to R43.3m. High interest rates and higher borrowings saw the interest bill of R46.8m exceed operating profit. However, a R13.5m tax credit allowed the group to make a R9.3m attributable profit, down 37 per cent on 1991. The higher borrowings meant gearing ratio jumped to 111 per cent from 71 per cent. Management said 'strenuous action' had been taken to restore this to more appropriate levels. The group closed 23 stores during the year. Afcol's profits were hurt by a severely depressed furniture market. Output in the furniture manufacturing industry fell 17.4 per cent in real terms during 1991  - the worst decline in a decade. The group managed, however, to increase market share.</p>

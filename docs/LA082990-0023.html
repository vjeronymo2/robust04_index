			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> County Issue Will the county program to reduce car trips succeed in fighting  air pollution?  </P> <P> Starting Nov. 1, Ventura County employers with 100 or more workers must develop  plans to reduce their employees' use of automobiles. Two deadlines for starting  the program, referred to as Rule 210, have been missed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Florence S. Taylor  </P> <P> Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu liaison with Air Pollution Control  District  </P> <P>  It will, as long as employers comply with the rule as they must. Ultimately,  all employers in the county with 50 or more employees at a single work site  must develop and submit plans to reduce motor vehicle ridership in order to  meet Environmental Protection Agency and court mandates. Certainly, the  Department of the Navy is prepared to cooperate and comply with these  requirements. As a major employer and good citizen in the county, the Navy  supports this effort to improve the environment for all of us.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nancy M. Williams  </P> <P> Executive director, Ventura County Economic Development Assn.  </P> <P>  VCEDA has been actively working with the county Air Pollution Control Board on  all levels of the air-quality management plan. Most industries here use  state-of-the-art technology and their emissions are as tightly controlled as  possible until new technology becomes available. We support the concept of Rule  210, because the largest single source of air pollution in Ventura County is  from vehicular use. We have supported ongoing educational programs to encourage  residents' use of car-pooling, van-pooling, mass transit and other alternative  means of transportation. But people have a love affair with the car in Southern  California. To change our lifestyle is going to require a lot of education  and/or financial incentives. Whether Rule 210 succeeds or not is going to  depend on the employees seeing the benefits of trip reduction. A question is:  How far can you go to enforce the program without violating individual rights?  It will have to be attractive enough that it will be foolish for employees not  to participate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carl Herman  </P> <P> Senior vice president, Simi Valley Bancard First Interstate Bank of Calif.  </P> <P>  Certainly I believe and hope the implementation of this kind of program in  Ventura County will be successful in reducing air pollution and improving the  environment. From what I know of these kinds of programs operating in other  parts of California -- for example, in Los Angeles -- definite progress is  being made. Many of these programs are relatively new, so there aren't a lot of  statistics or hard facts available yet, but it seems to me that any reduction  in vehicle usage would have a positive effect on air quality. As I understand  it, the larger employers in eastern Ventura County will be the first ones to  develop and implement plans. Here at First Interstate, we have been deeply  involved with this issue for well over a year and a half. We have participated  with other employers and county and city officials in discussing the rule and  its implementation. We hosted a meeting to talk about planning in cooperation  with the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, and a transportation management  association is being formed in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> William Mount  </P> <P> Planning director, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District  </P> <P>  Yes. The Rule 210 program has great potential to improve air quality in  Ventura County. However, it won't happen overnight. It is going to take several  years for the rule to be fully implemented. We also expect it will take time  for employers to reach the goals specified in the rule. This is a brand-new  program, which represents our first attempt to regulate the use of the  automobile, not just the emissions coming out of the tailpipe. Emissions from  motor vehicles account for about half the air-quality problem in Ventura  County. Although cars are far less polluting today than in the past, traffic  volume has grown tremendously. While population is growing at approximately 2%  per year, vehicle miles traveled are growing at 5% per year. If people want  clean air, they have to realize that a change in their driving habits is an  important part of the solution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neil A. Moyer  </P> <P> President, Environmental Coalition of Ventura County  </P> <P> The county is fortunate that Rule 210 is patterned after the South Coast Air  Quality Management District Regulation 15. Because that rule has been in effect  for three years, a lot of very useful plans have been developed by various  companies and industries. Many of these plans can be used by Ventura County  firms to accelerate such programs as ride-sharing and van-pooling among their  employees. As far as the county government is concerned, the program that the  South Coast district has been using should be very successful with county  employees. If the county pursues this program vigorously, the county should  have a very successful program with its own employees. Also, because a number  of consultants have emerged in this field because of Regulation 15, Ventura  County firms should be able to use their services and develop successful  programs for their own employees.  </P></p>

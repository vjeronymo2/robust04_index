			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Glitter fades from Tiffany earnings THE SPARKLE has vanished from the latest results at Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery group. After-tax profits in the three months to end-July were almost halved at Dollars 3.89m, compared with Dollars 7.23m in the same period a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 120.8m, barely increased on the Dollars 119.4m in the same period of 1991. Tiffany said that US retail sales were static at around Dollars 53.6m. Local people kept buying, said the retailer, but there was a decline in sales to tourists visiting the US. International retail sales also remained flat, with increases in European and Far Eastern stores being offset by a shortfall of wholesale sales in Japan. On the direct marketing front - that is, business-to-business sales and through the catalogue - there was an 8 per cent sales gain. Profits for the first half now stand at Dollars 6.99m, compared with Dollars 11.6m a year earlier (before a one-off accounting change item). Six month sales were ahead at Dollars 228.1m, compared with Dollars 216.5m.</p>

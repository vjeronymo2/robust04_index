			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Pirelli wins Dollars 53m cable contract PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, Alcatel of France and AT&amp;T of the US have won a Dollars 53m (Pounds 35.3m) contract for more than 600km of underwater fibre optic cable for an ambitious communications scheme in South America. When completed, the new Unisur network will link Brazil to Uruguay and Argentina, greatly improving voice and data links in the southern cone of Latin America. Unisur's four new fibre optic cables will eventually be able to carry up to 80,000 simultaneous telephone conversations. Unisur comprises 25 international telecoms carriers, including companies from Latin America, the US, Italy and Spain. Once connected with the existing Americas-1 fibre optic network, subscribers will gain a direct fibre optic telecoms link stretching from southern Latin America along the Brazilian coast to the Caribbean and North America. The link will also allow Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina to hook up with another new fibre optic network, Columbus II, providing a continuous fibre optic connection under the Atlantic to Europe.</p>

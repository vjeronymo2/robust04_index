			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 16 -- Commenting on the decision of  Minister Michal Kulesza to resign from the post of government  commissioner for public administration reform, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak said on Monday that he "expected more  responsibility in these actions." Pawlak added he hoped "a  slightly different outlook on introducing reforms might be  helpful in working out final solutions."    "We are supporting decentralisation but at the same time we  are not going to put responsibility on local governments in a  way which is making it impossible for them to fulfil these  tasks," the prime minister stressed, adding that for instance it  was local governments which decided whether to take over  schools. The prime minister also said the cabinet was  supporting the plan to grant more powers to local authorities.    Commenting on Kulesza's statement that the assumptions of  the  socio-economic policy for the years 1994-1997 and draft laws on  state administration prove that the cabinet is not interested in  Poland's decentralisation, the head of the cabinet office,  Minister Marian Strak, said: "I think that this opinion is  resulting either from incomplete knowledge of the documents or  ill will." Strak stressed the documents proved the cabinet  wanted to increase powers of local governments and to  consolidate the position of a governor. "The point is to make a  governor a host in a province and not one of the parts of the  state administration," he added.</p>

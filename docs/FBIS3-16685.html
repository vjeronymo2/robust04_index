			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Buds Are Swelling: An Omen of a </F> Coup?"]    [Text] What are the founding fathers afraid of?    On 17 March, a group of fairly well known persons announced  in Moscow the creation of a new public movement: "Accord for  Russia." The founding fathers include: Valeriy Zorkin,  Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Mikhail Lapshin, Petr  Romanov, Aman Tuleyev, Sergey Glazyev, Sergey Baburin, Vasiliy  Lipitskiy, Aleksandr Tsipko, and others. The list remains open;  the movement is ready to admit anyone who is concerned over  Russia's fate. At present, the movement's founders themselves  are worried most of all by the threat of "a junta-style palace  coup." Valeriy Zorkin said at the new movement's first press  conference: "The signs of a coup are evident. Currently,  analytical memos of this sort have been drawn up and are  circulating, various coup theories are under discussion.  Something similar occurred on the eve of 20 March and 21  September of last year. It is well known that subsequently the  forecasts spelled out in the analytical memos proved to be  correct." Zorkin's fears were shared by Gennadiy Zyuganov.    OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has managed to obtain an analytical memo.  (It is published in a slightly abridged form.)    Confidentially    Theory 1    (according to information as of 16 March 1994)    Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the previous  ones are discarded.    According to available information, a group of statesmen --  First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M.  Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Y. Luzhkov -- plan to make an  attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin, B.  Mikhaylov, chairman of the Russian Federation committee on the  press (apparently B. Mironov -- editorial board), reportedly  also belong to the group... Those listed above have already  held tentative talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S.  Stepashin, and by employing various arguments managed to obtain  their agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B.  Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye.  Primakov's inner circle. A pretext for launching the action  should be an address by a prominent public figure or an  industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel  putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons  the deterioration of the president's health and his physical  inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a  television documentary should be shown portraying the president  as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. Then the  aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through their allies  at the State Duma the constitutional procedure of handing  provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin so as to  hold emergency presidential elections in the country within the  next three months. The chiefs and activists of the Russian  Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware of the  group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power suits  them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu. Luzhkov  in the group.    According to available reports, the action is scheduled to  be  carried out in March, the deadline is April of this year.  Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state  of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited  territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic  situation and the struggle against crime.    The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March --  on  that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to made a television address  and a corresponding documentary was to be shown. Typically, V.  Chernomyrdin himself left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and  then set out for Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the  time. The attempt fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev,  chief of the "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company,  refused to accord television air time and advised the  president's inner circle of the intentions. Immediately  afterward, a number of those who were directly or indirectly  involved in the action left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M.  Kolesnikov for France (he will return on 16 March). S.  Stepashin was hospitalized.    On that same week when the unsuccessful attempt to depose  Boris Yeltsin was made and also during the preceding two or  three weeks a whole range of politicians, primarily those in  opposition to the president, made statements about the need for  Boris Yeltsin to resign one way or another and for early  presidential elections to be held... Former British Prime  Minister Edward Heath and former U.S. President Richard Nixon  have visited Moscow to meet with domestic party leaders in order  to figure out the alignment of political forces and plans with  regard to future presidential elections.    Despite the initial failure, the group of the  aforementioned statesmen have not given up their plans to depose  Boris Yeltsin by using an approximately similar plan of action.  Currently, talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the  Gazprom joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an  address Yu. Skokov failed to make.    Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev has postponed  his working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was  scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour,  when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of  journalists had already left for St. Petersburg... On the  whole, the Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two  groups: Boris Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly  expressed their commitment to the incumbent president, including  P. Grachev and his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the  "opposition" represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov  and Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. According to available  information, Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin maintains close  ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly does various services to  him, his deputies, and relatives. A. Kokoshin and O. Soskovets  meet virtually twice or three times a week.    On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800 P. Grachev met with V.  Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been  disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been  publicized.  <H5>  What this might mean... </H5>   The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board has asked Aleksandr  Yakovlev, chairman of the Federal Television and Radio Service,  whether Yuriy Skokov was indeed scheduled to make a television  address. Aleksandr Nikolayevich said that Skokov did not  approach him in that regard, but there was a "sideways" phone  call that warned Yakovlev that such an address was being planned.    Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian State Television  and Radio Company, has also received a phone call: ARGUMENTY I  FAKTY's correspondent asked him to explain why Russian  television denied Yuriy Skokov air time.    To all appearances, we are dealing with a clear  mystification, an anonymous letter, nothing more. And a fairly  rough fabrication at that. The authors' bottom line is only too  evident: to compromise a number of the president's closest  allies, such as Yuriy Luzhkov, to smear the "power" ministers,  to sideline promising politicians by, say, resuscitating "the  Skokov threat" -- in a word, to plunge into a regular palace  intrigue. This should not, however, be dismissed as an  innocuous joke. In principle, a coup d'etat or something of the  kind may well be organized this way, too: by "warming up" the  situation, pitting influential politicians against each other,  ratcheting up the psychosis of universal suspiciousness and  provoking the authorities into taking inadequate "security  measures." This is a technology in the struggle for power.  Definitely, a dirty one. But everyone struggles as one can.</p>

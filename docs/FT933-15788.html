			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Bonn sacks prosecutor over shooting THE GERMAN government yesterday sacked its chief state prosecutor, Mr Alexander von Stahl, in a new, and increasingly desperate, move to allay public disquiet over the shooting of a suspected terrorist. The action was ordered as confusion continued to surround the precise circumstances of how Mr Wolfgang Grams, a suspected member of the fanatical left-wing Red Army Faction, and a member of the government's crack anti-terrorist unit both died in a shoot-out in eastern Germany. Mr von Stahl's enforced retirement was ordered by Ms Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, justice minister, following the resignation on Sunday of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and a close ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The latest move was announced as a measure to preserve the dignity of the federal prosecutor's office from the confusion surrounding the anti-terrorist operation 10 days ago, in which Mr Grams and the young policeman were shot dead and Ms Birgit Hogefeld, a suspected faction member, was arrested. Instead, the public impression is one of confusion in the highest offices of state and an inability to allay fears that the suspected terrorist was shot dead as he lay wounded and disarmed on the ground. The country's top police investigator, Mr Hans Ludwig Zachert, head of the federal criminal investigation office, confirmed yesterday that Mr Grams was probably shot with his own gun, from extremely close range. He was unable to confirm precisely what had happened at the end of a gun battle with the elite GSG-9 anti-terrorist unit on the Bad Kleinen railway station near Schwerin. Mr von Stahl, a member of the Free Democratic party in the governing coalition, is a political appointee, and his retirement had to be ordered by the justice minister. In a statement issued last night, Ms Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said that the importance of the office meant that a prolonged debate over the occupant would be damaging. She thanked Mr von Stahl for his efforts 'to explain the terrible events in Bad Kleinen'.</p>

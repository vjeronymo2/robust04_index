			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Trident costs disputed THE MINISTRY of Defence will come under pressure this week to clarify its arrangements for obtaining Trident strategic missiles from the US, following a report that US defence cuts could raise the cost of the programme to Britain by more than Pounds 200m. The report by the British American Security Information Council, an independent lobby group, says reduced production plans by the US navy would increase the unit cost of missiles by Dollars 13m to Dollars 49m (Pounds 34m). Britain has already paid for many of the missiles it requires to equip four submarines - thought to be about 70. The missiles will be drawn from a shared pool and serviced in the US. The report says a conservative estimate of the extra cost of missiles remaining to be paid for by the UK is between Dollars 221m and Dollars 312m. The Ministry of Defence yesterday rejected this figure as 'completely unrealistic'. It did not yet have conclusive information about the impact of the US changes on Britain's costs but said the increase would not be significant 'and could be nothing'. Mr David Clark, Labour party defence spokesman, said he was 'alarmed' by the report. The all-party Commons defence committee is due to question officials about the progress of the Trident nuclear deterrent programme tomorrow. Last year it estimated the Trident missile cost - not counting warheads, which will be British-made - at Pounds 988m. The report says the US is thought to have covered at least 20 per cent of the UK's share of the costs until now.</p>

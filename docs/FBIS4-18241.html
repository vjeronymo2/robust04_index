			<p>BFN     [Text] Arcore, Italy, April 1 (AFP) - Key talks on forming  Italy's new government between mediate magnate Silvio Berlusconi  and aides to his nominal election ally Umberto Bossi failed to  get under way here as scheduled Friday [1 April] morning.    The meeting between Berlusconi, head of the Forza Italia  party, and a delegation from Bossi's federalist Northern League  was due to start at 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) at the media magnate's  residence in this town near Milan.    Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani told hordes of  journalists at the scene that "the meeting will not take place  here. I can add nothing more other than to say that  negotiations are continuing and everything is going well."    Meanwhile Roberto Maroni, the head of the League's  parliamentary group, said on radio that the meeting would take  place Friday morning, but at a secret location away from media  attention.    The confusion over arrangements for the meeting followed a  statement Thursday by the League challenging Berlusconi's claim  the premiership.    The federalist movement said in a statement that "the  Northern League is the premier political force in the country,"  claiming the right to run Italy's next government.    The statement confirmed deep-seated rivalries between the  two  parties, allied with the neo-fascist National Alliance in the  right-wing coalition which won the elections Sunday and Monday.    A day earlier the League had reportedly agreed to let  Berlusconi become prime minister.    The League has threatened to split the rich, industrialized  north from the rest of Italy if more autonomy is not granted to  the regions.</p>

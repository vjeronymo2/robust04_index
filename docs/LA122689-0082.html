			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IGNORING CEASE-FIRE PLEA, SHIITE FACTIONS FIGHT ON IN LEBANON  </P> <P> Rival Shiite Muslim militiamen, ignoring cease-fire pleas from their Syrian and  Iranian sponsors, battled in south Lebanon Monday for a third day, and at least  eight people were killed.  </P> <P> Men of the Syrian-backed Amal, advancing under a hail of artillery and rocket  fire, tried to retake three villages captured earlier by the pro-Iranian  Hezbollah, security sources said.  </P> <P> Hezbollah fighters, dug into trenches and fortified emplacements, repelled the  attacks with heavy machine-gun, rocket and mortar fire and then tried to  advance on Amal-held territory.  </P> <P> At least eight people were killed and 40 wounded, the sources said, raising the  toll in three days of fighting to at least 35 killed and 150 wounded.  </P> <P> Iran's ambassador to Syria, Mohammed Akhtari, had announced earlier that the  two Shiite militias had agreed to observe a cease-fire as of late Sunday  evening.  </P> <P> He was speaking after meetings in Damascus among Iran's First Deputy Foreign  Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati, Syrian officials and leaders of Amal and  Hezbollah, rivals for control over Lebanon's 1.5 million Shiites.  </P> <P> The two militias blamed each other for the fighting in the strategic Iqlim  al-Tufah region between the southern Lebanese port of Sidon and Israel's  self-declared south Lebanon security zone. Hundreds of villagers have fled the  area.  </P> <P> An Amal statement said it would negotiate only after Hezbollah withdrew from  the positions it had captured. Hezbollah said it was ready to start an  unconditional dialogue with Amal immediately.  </P> <P> Security sources said that, although no positions changed hands Monday,  Hezbollah appeared to have gained the upper hand in the fighting.  </P> <P> Hezbollah -- trained, financed and equipped by Iran -- seized the villages of  Bouslayah, Kfar Fila and Ain Qana in a pre-dawn assault Saturday on Amal  strongholds.  </P> <P> Security sources said Hezbollah took the village of Jarjouh Sunday, but Amal  sources strongly denied the report.  </P> <P> The fundamentalist Hezbollah and the moderate Amal have waged on-and-off  battles for the last two years. Amal, the largest Muslim militia, regards south  Lebanon as its preserve and says Hezbollah should have no active role there.  </P> <P> Hezbollah, dedicated to fighting Israel to the finish, needs a foothold in the  area to launch guerrilla attacks against the Jewish state and its security  zone.  </P></p>

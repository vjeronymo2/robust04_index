			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 13, BNS -- The representative of the  International Monetary Fund in Lithuania, Peter Cornelius, said  the fund is seriously concerned about the present rate of  inflation in Lithuania.    The problem will reportedly be the central issue at talks  between the Lithuanian Government, the central bank and an IMF  mission that is scheduled to come to Vilnius next week.    "The fund is quite concerned about inflation. It has gone up  from less than 1 percent in August to 7.3 percent in October and  then fell to 6.8 and 6.2 percent in November and December  respectively. These are inflation figures that we regard as too  high," Cornelius said.    The IMF official admitted, however, that there are some  extraordinary factors behind these figures, such as the  reduction of subsidies to energy and the increased import  tariffs for certain agricultural products.    Cornelius said "these factors had an impact on inflation,  however to a large extent, it has been caused by the monetary  policy" of the Lithuanian central bank. He said this is  indicated by the amount of money in circulation. 1 billion lits  were supposed to be in circulation by the end of 1993, but 1.1  billion were released. Another 0.1 billion later added to that  amount in two weeks.    "Next week, the IMF mission will thoroughly discuss  inflation  and how to get the monetary policy back on track."    Cornelius said the central bank's interference with the  foreign currency market is too strong. On the average, the bank  buys around 5 million U.S. dollars per week, or around 20-15  million per month, which is around 80-100 million lits.    The IMF representative said the bank's hard currency  reserves  totalled 227 million U.S. dollars in late December, but,  according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the  reserve was supposed to be only 110 million.    Cornelius denied press reports that the IMF pressingly  recommends to create a currency board, but added that the system  has some advantages. "No space is left for politics to interfere  with the monetary policy." In his opinion, a currency board also  means "very tight arrangements which do not allow credits to the  government, enterprises and commercial banks."    Currency boards function in Estonia, Hong Kong and  Argentina.  Their activities are very successful in all of these countries,  Cornelius said.    "We do not push the idea of a currency board but we are  ready  to help in implementing it if the government makes a decision  and if there is strong support in the parliament.''</p>

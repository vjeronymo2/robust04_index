			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Leaders defeated over minimum wage The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday defied its own party leadership and aligned itself with Labour by backing the introduction of a system of minimum hourly wage rates. In the latest defeat in what is proving a distinctly uncomfortable conference for party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown, activists rejected the unanimous view of their 23 MPs that the Liberal Democrats should give priority to market inflexibility over direct intervention in setting wage rates. The decision came as Mr John Monks signalled his determination to widen the trades unions' range of political contacts by becoming the first TUC general secretary to visit a Liberal Democrat conference. Mr Monks, who told a fringe meeting that he wanted the party to move further in recognising the legitimate trades unions, also plans to travel to the Tory conference in Bournemouth next month. During the employment debate at the conference, Baroness Williams, formerly Labour minister Mrs Shirley Williams, led the rebellion against Mr Ashdown over the leadership's attempt to limit government intervention on wages to the creation of a low pay commission which would investigate individual cases of exploitation. Lady Williams' support for an alternative plan for the commission to set minimum hourly rates - varying across regions - ensured it secured the overwhelming backing of party activists. In spite of Mr Ashdown's call at the start of the conference for the party to acknowledge the need for the maximum possible flexibility in labour markets, the conference accepted Lady Williams' judgment that a minimum wage would not hit jobs. She told delegates that as long as it was set at a modest level - the present suggestion is for one equivalent to 35 per cent to 40 per cent of average earnings with variations between regions - a minimum wage was likely to create jobs. Mr Ashdown and his colleagues sought to put a brave face on the conference's support for a plan he had earlier described as 'far too prescriptive, far too centralised'. They insisted the approach agreed yesterday still pointed to a much more flexible system than the fixed nationwide rate proposed by Labour. The leadership pointed also to separate plans approved by the conference as evidence of the party's commitment to a dynamic labour market. Among the proposals agreed at the conference were cuts in employers' National Insurance Contributions to encourage companies to take on more workers, and the introduction of a refundable training levy. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Treasury spokesman, said he expected the conference formula to be incorporated into party policy at the next general election, while Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, suggested Mr Ashdown had wrongly seen the issue as a test of his personal authority. Mr Monks welcomed the decision as a step in a direction of a national minimum wage.</p>

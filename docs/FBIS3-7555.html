He commented on the policy study group proposed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for the purpose of uniting the  ruling coalition parties into a big parliamentary group, and he  stressed: "Prime Minister Hosokawa has suggested creating a  study group. It is necessary to form (a unified group) after  taking such steps." He added, "When elections are held under  the single-seat constituency system, coordination (on choosing  candidates) will be necessary," thus indicating his intention to  use the policy study group as a venue to coordinate the  selection of candidates.    Moving on to the issue of the realignment of political  parties, Hata said, "I believe it would be good for the present  ruling coalition parties to become a monolithic group." He  reiterated that he wishes to form a large unified group of the  ruling parties and eventually to found a new-new party  [shin-shinto].    With regard to the plan for Shinseito to unite first with  the  Japan New Party in the process of forming a large parliamentary  grouping, Hata said: "It is still too soon. There is the  question of what to do with the other parties. There are times  when you need to do things in the right order. However, nothing  is definite yet." He thus indicated that it is not wise to raise  this issue at this stage.    Meanwhile, Shinseito Managing Secretary Hajime Funada also  gave a speech in Toyonaka town, Kagawa Prefecture, on the same  day. As for the policy study group, Funada said:  "Organizations like this will also form the basis for selecting  a common candidate (for the ruling coalition parties).  Shinseito thinks that this will contribute to forming a unified  group, and a new-new party in the future." He indicated that  the study group should be the basis for coordinating in  selecting candidates in the future.</p>

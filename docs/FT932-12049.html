			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Philippine financing breaks new ground LOANS exceeding Dollars 700m (Pounds 444m) have been pledged by a group of international financial institutions to equip a 700MW coal-fired power station in the Philippines. Hopewell Power (Philippines) Corporation, a subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, will construct the plant under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) arrangement with the government. The Dollars 700m will be used to buy equipment, mainly from Mitsubishi of Japan and Westinghouse of the US. Costing an estimated Dollars 933m, the plant is described as the biggest single foreign investment ever in the Philippines. The financing deal was arranged by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank arm concerned with private sector projects. The other main sources of finance are the Japanese and US export-import banks. It is the first time the latter have provided limited recourse co-financing without government guarantees for a large power project in the developing world. The IFC will provide Dollars 10m in equity and lend Dollars 60m on its own account, with up to Dollars 40m more to be syndicated with commercial banks. Financing is also being provided by Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation and the Asian Development Bank. The financing arrangement is expected to become a model for similar infrastructure projects elsewhere in the developing world. 'The availability of export credits without guarantees from host country governments will be critical in expanding the private sector's role in the power sector,' Mr Vijay Chaudhry, IFC power division manager, said in Washington. The loan from Japan's Eximbank, which accounts for nearly Dollars 370m of the financing package, is also its first for a BOT project. Hopewell Power will build the plant and operate it for 25 years, during which the state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) will buy the electricity it produces. The plant will then be handed over to Napocor. The plant, located in Pagbilao town in Quezon province some 125km southeast of Manila, is scheduled for completion in 1995, to serve as a baseload plant to service consumers in Luzon, the country's main island and is part of government efforts to ease the serious power shortages that can last 8-10 daily in Manila and the rest of Luzon.</p>

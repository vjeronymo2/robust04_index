Earnings worked through at 4.2p (3.7p) and a final dividend of 1.29p makes a 1.6365p (1.4885) total. The group's interests are in confectionery and automotive accessories. The directors stated that the former is currently trading 'at an equivalent level to last year' while sales and profits in the automotive division in the first quarter were higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Turnover for the 12 months to April 30 increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 24.6m. The directors said they were examining ways to exploit Armour's potential and believed the group was 'in an excellent position to respond to a recovery in the economy.'</p>

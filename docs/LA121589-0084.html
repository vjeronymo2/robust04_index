The report added that attempts to get the  money back have been unsuccessful. After the January, 1988, death of Werner  Nachmann, the 62-year-old chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany,  investigators found he had run a massive embezzlement scheme involving  reparations paid by the West German government.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (2): Controls are likely to be tightened - Regulation It is one of the ironies of the UK Financial Services Act that the most sweeping legislation in the industry's history should have overlooked one of the riskiest businesses - custody. The shock which struck the financial community when it realised the ease with which the late Robert Maxwell stole more than Pounds 400m from pension schemes he controlled has since been translated into a wide-ranging review of how custody is treated. Before the Maxwell affair, custody - the safe-keeping of securities on behalf of investors - had been overlooked by regulators probably because it had been an event-free activity. Not only had there never been any loss to investors as a result of the failure of a custodian, but its activities are little understood by the general public and regulators probably were unsure even what questions they ought to be asking about safeguards. Since then, the Securities and Investments Board has been goaded into action. In August, it produced a 103-page Discussion Paper raising 65 separate questions about the matter, ranging from whether custody should be an authorisable activity under the FSA to whether custodians should be responsible for sub-custodians they appoint. It also asks what the role of auditors should be and whether regulation of nominee companies should be tightened. Although the deadline for comment has passed, the SIB has yet to distil the responses from the leading industry trade associations and market participants before deciding how to proceed. Far from limiting itself to some of the narrow risk matters raised by the Maxwell affair, the paper leaves open the possibility of far-reaching changes to the custody business in Britain - and, by extension, overseas. The central issue addressed in the paper is whether those wishing to offer custodial services should be required to seek specific authorisation to do so - a move which would require an act of Parliament to amend the FSA. Authorisation, the SIB notes, would require not only a set of rules but a monitoring agency capable of ensuring that they were followed and imposing penalties or ordering corrective action where they were not. For its part, the SIB said in its paper that it was minded not to go down that route. Privately, the Treasury has said it wishes to avoid re-writing the FSA in connection with the more pressing matters of retail and wholesale market regulation, and it is difficult to imagine it would willingly make an exception for custody. SIB officials point out that most custody operations are carried out by banks which are regulated by the Bank of England. Non-bank custody operations are regulated usually as part of a firm regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority. Thus, there is very little of the custody business which escapes the regulatory net. That point, however, has not sat comfortably with one of the leading trade organisations, the Institutional Fund Managers Association. 'While most custodians are regulated by the Bank of England, they are regulated with a fairly light touch,' said Mr Julian Lefanu of IFMA. Moreover, he said, there are some custodians whose activities fall between the two stools of banking and financial services and 'it is the clients that need the comfort of knowing that their assets are protected', he said. If the pensions industry is to set up a compensation scheme with losses through fraud or theft made up by a levy, pension schemes need to know that any risk of loss through a custodian is minimised. Another question the SIB raises is whether there should be minimum capital adequacy requirements for custodians. Considering that every other aspect of financial services - including the provision of nothing more than advice - does carry such a requirement, it is surprising that the safe-keeping of billions of pounds of other people's money does not. IFMA takes the view that there is little point in setting 'position risk' capital adequacy requirements for custodians. 'We would nevertheless support a minimum capital threshold to ensure that the custodian has the standing to carry out his duties,' Mr Lefanu said. That way, regulators may rest assured that custodians have sufficient assets to invest in appropriate record keeping and information systems to ensure that the job is done properly. Without minimum investment, even a well meaning and otherwise honest custodian may inadvertently cause losses to a client by, say, failing to collect or credit dividends. But perhaps the most sensitive question raised by the SIB focuses on custodians and the sub-custodians they appoint. Should a custodian be liable for losses of his sub-custodian, and if so, how? Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president at Morgan Stanley, argues that requiring such a measure is absurd and impossible for any leading custodian to meet in any event. First, if the securities are in the name of the client or his nominee, there is no way any other entity could lay claim to them in the event of the sub-custodian's bankruptcy. The only risk relates to cash assets. But in the case of Morgan Stanley, which may have Dollars 55bn in cash assets with sub-custodians at any one time, how would the bank reflect its 'guarantee' of those assets? Such a charge well exceeds all Morgan Stanley's existing capital and could not appear as a charge on its balance sheet. That view is widespread in the custodial industry which has reacted with some alarm to the suggestion in the SIB paper. Instead, Mr Whitehill argues, the answer is to improve the drafting of sub-custodial agreements. Morgan Stanley asks its sub-contractors to guarantee them against wilful mismanagement, non-performance or negligence. In the event of such activities, Morgan Stanley will make its own clients whole and seek to recover from the sub-custodian. 'Increasingly, clients do ask for some protection,' he said. Morgan Stanley carries out six-monthly reviews of all its sub-custodial arrangements to reassure itself of the safety of its clients' money. Only through that sort of vigilence, custodians say, can clients be sure that their assets are safe in a sub-custodian's hands.</p>

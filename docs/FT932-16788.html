			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: Bank puts a new gloss on gilts - Serious Money GILTS HAVE been neglected by the private investor for understandable reasons. Too often, inflation has destroyed their value; and they are difficult to comprehend and buy. It is true there is a cheap service available at the Post Office. But it is hardly user friendly: you must queue, there are no specialist staff to help and it is up to you to decide between the Exchequer 12 1/2 pc 1994 and the Treasury 9 3/4 pc 2002. So it is good news that the Bank of England has produced a booklet* with the aim of giving investors basic information about the gilts market. This desire to educate is not entirely altruistic; the government may have some Pounds 50bn of gilts to sell this year and private investors are a large potential market. The booklet is a useful guide for beginners, although it does not answer some of the questions that readers often ask the FT, such as how to calculate the real yield on an index-linked gilt. Nor is the section on the taxation of accrued interest clear. It is a complex area. The price of gilts bought between dividend entitlement dates includes an element to reflect the accrued interest. If you have holdings of less than Pounds 5,000, you may find yourself paying income tax on this accrued element, even though you have paid for it out of capital. Say you pay Pounds 1,025 for stock reflecting accrued interest of Pounds 25 out of a forthcoming dividend of Pounds 50. You will pay income tax on Pounds 50, not the Pounds 25 you receive. But there is a more fundamental question, which the guide does not address. Bond prices have been rising steadily since the start of 1991 - so is the government encouraging investors to buy gilts at the peak of the market? Don Smith of Greenwell Montagu does not think so. He believes that long bond yields, currently around 8.5 per cent, will fall to 7 3/4 per cent. Since yields and prices have an inverse relationship, that means gilt prices will rise. Greenwell Montagu believes that fears of renewed inflation are overdone. It expects a rate of 3.25 per cent at the year end, which means that gilts are trading on attractive real yields of more than 5 per cent. Those who are not as optimistic as Greenwell Montagu about inflation might prefer index-linked gilts, which merit two pages of their own in the Bank of England guide. Both income and repayment values increase in line with the RPI. However, the trading price does not always rise in line with the RPI, which is what can cause investors so much confusion. Again, this is not made clear in the guide. One practical measure announced this week was an increase in the maximum that can be invested in gilts via the National Savings Stock Register (at the Post Office) in any one gilt. This has been increased from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000 per day. In future, all stocks will be available rather than just a selection (both changes apply from April 7.) Although you may not get the best price via the NSSR, dealing costs are cheap (Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250, then 50p for every further Pounds 125 or part thereof). Buying Pounds 25,000 of stock would thus cost Pounds 100. What the guide cannot tell you is which are the best issues to buy. This depends on your individual circumstances; need for income, tax position and so on. It may be worthwhile paying extra in commission to get the benefit of a stockbroker's advice on this. Greenwell Montagu says private investors are normally keen to buy issues which are trading below par and have shifted their attention to the longer end of the market. Investing in Gilts; a guide for the small investor. Available in 1,500 post offices or from the Bank of England, PO Box 96, Gloucester, GL1 1YB, freephone 0800-616814. S G WARBURG'S new quarterly review of income shares adds further fuel to the debate about this extremely complex sector. Referring to the so-called 'ordinary income shares' (those with a repayment value which is not set, but is dependent on the growth of the trust's assets), Warburg says 'at current levels, the sector is cheap, assuming 5 per cent growth rates in capital and dividends.' The shares which Warburg recommends as a result of its analysis are: Fleming International High; Gartmore American; M&amp;G Income Geared Units; Rights &amp; Issues Capital: Drayton Blue Chip: Kleinwort High: and River &amp; Mercantile Extra. These offer gross redemption yields of between 14 and 20 per cent, if one assumes the trusts' assets and income grow at 5 per cent per annum until maturity. However, this does not mean the share prices will grow substantially. Because of the high dividend income, these shares stand above their repayment values were the trusts to be wound up today. Warburg points out that, in some cases, 5 per cent growth in assets will be needed for investors to get their capital back at redemption. Accordingly, the return on these trusts is largely in the form of income, which may have disadvantageous tax consequences for higher rate payers. This is a sector of the market which should be limited to the very assiduous amateur investor, and only then with expert advice. The rest would be safer with the likes of Foreign &amp; Colonial.</p>

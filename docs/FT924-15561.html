			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Councils are hit by troubles at MMI - But individual policyholders have less cause to be concerned THE DEMISE of Muncipal Mutual (MMI), the UK's ninth-largest insurer, is causing serious problems for Britain's local authorities which are facing increases in premiums and are without cover in some cases. But individuals who have bought home, motor, health and life insurance policies from MMI and its subsidiaries should not get too worried by its well-publicised problems. On Wednesday, the company stopped writing new business or renewing existing policies, and ceased temporarily to pay claims. MMI, which insures nine out of 10 metropolitan, county and district councils, stumbled into difficulties following rapid expansion into new insurance markets in the 1980s when it undercut many of its competitors. MMI also suffered from a sharp rise in legal actions for negligence against local authorities like Staffordshire, which was hit hard by claims from victims of the 'pindown' disciplinary regime in its childrens' homes. Across the country, councils also have been hit by a surge in minor public liability claims, such as those from people who have suffered accidents on badly-maintained roads. In May, MMI reported that it had been forced to inject millions of pounds into its reserves to pay for future claims, leaving it with insufficient capital to continue trading at present levels. Net assets at the end of 1991 amounted to Pounds 4.9m compared with net premium income of Pounds 785m. Following a change in senior management, the company began efforts to transfer its business to other insurance companies. But this has proved difficult and this week's announcement followed the breakdown of rescue talks with a French company, La Garantie Mutuelle des Foncionnaires. MMI's managers are hopeful they can avoid a full-scale liquidation. One possibility being explored by the company, along with its local authority owners, is to set up what accountants call 'a scheme of arrangement' with creditors. If this were to be agreed, Municipal Mutual would remain intact in order to pay all claims on policies sold already, disposing of all its liabilities in an orderly fashion. Individual and commercial policy-holders alike could expect to receive full payment of any claims as the company ran down its asset base of more than Pounds 1.3bn. The group's health and life subsidiaries are in better shape. Prime Health is continuing to write new business and renew existing policies, while Prosperity Life Assurance will continue to issue renewals but will not issue new policies. In addition, the company still hopes it can transfer its 1m or so individual home and motor policies to other companies. Already, a number of 'block' policies - sold on insurers' behalf by building societies - have been transferred. Since January 1990, Cheltenham and Gloucester building society has sold 216,000 MMI policies (mainly home and contents) to its mortgage borrowers. The society has negotiated in principle to transfer all these policies to General Accident, the Perth-based composite (general and life) insurer. Norwich and Peterborough building society, which has sold 22,000 MMI policies, has switched the block to Norwich Union, with which it is already insuring the remaining one-third of its block polices. Most of the policies came up for renewal on September 29. Terms and conditions remain unchanged. Even if the worst happens and MMI does eventually go into liquidation, individual policyholders will have most of their claims paid. The Policyholders' Protection Board - established in 1975 after a number of insolvencies in the late 1960s and 1970s - meets 90 per cent of all non-life and life claims from individual policyholders. In the case of compulsory policies - such as third party motor insurance - the PPB pays 100 per cent of all valid claims. Municipal Mutual policyholders who bought their policies from AA Insurance Services, the broker, also will receive full payment for all valid PPB claims, with the AA making up the difference between the 90 per cent paid by the PPB and the full value of the claim. Around 80,000 motorists have bought MMI policies from the AA. MMI also was part - along with three other insurers - of an AA scheme which sold 300,000 home policies. The PPB is financed by the insurance industry as a whole, and a liquidation by Muncipal Mutual would lead to some of its heaviest payouts yet. In recent years, claims have been paid by the PPB following the insolvencies of Continental and Trinity Insurance in 1992, NEMGIA in 1991, and Cavalier Insurance in the mid-1980s.</p>

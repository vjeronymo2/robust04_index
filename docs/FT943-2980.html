			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Penalty on BCCI loss ruled out The two Western Isles council officials who were held responsible for losing Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991 are not to be surcharged, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has decided. He ruled that surcharging the two men - making them pay a financial penalty for their errors - would not be appropriate. The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod was dismissed by the council and Mr Lawrie left it shortly before the BCCI crash to become director of finance at North East Fife district council.</p>

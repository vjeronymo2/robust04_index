			<p>BFN     [Text] British Prime Minister John Major could visit South  Africa soon. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in  Pretoria that Mr. Major was very keen on coming to South Africa.  He said a visit paid by the queen was also very much in the  cards after South Africa rejoins the Commonwealth. Mr. Michael  Heseltine, the British trade and industry minister, is also due  in South Africa in July along with 50 of Britain's most senior  businessmen in an effort to restore trade links.    Another world leader expected to visit South Africa soon is  French President Francois Mitterrand, who will probably arrive  next month. French Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie made  this announcement in Pretoria after leading the French  delegation to the inauguration of President Mandela. Mr.  Mehaignerie said France should bolster its stakes in tourism,  industry, housing, and public works in South Africa.</p>

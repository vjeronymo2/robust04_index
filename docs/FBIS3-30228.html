			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Janko Bobetko, chief of general staff of the  Croatian Army Corps, has denied the accusations by the Sarajevo  government that regular units of the Croatian Army are allegedly  present in Bosnia.    [Begin Bobetko recording] The issue of Croatia's involvement  or noninvolvement [in the fighting in Bosnia] is an issue which  has always been absolutely politicized because the basic fact,  or the strongest argument, has been completely forgotten, and  all humanitarian and civilizational norms have been ignored.  Thousands and thousands of Croats born in Bosnia and living  here in Croatia not only looked on [at what was going on in  Bosnia], but also lost either their entire family or some  members of their family in most beastly ways. They saw their  fathers gone missing, relatives who are no longer there, sisters  who are wondering around those Bosnian ravines -- and the  question which is raised now is: who has got the right to forbid  me or any Croat from Bosnia, to defend his (?own). Who can do  that? Which institution? It is sad that organizations which  have concrete insight in every detail of what is going on can  still be perturbed by a statement by a Silajdzic because Croatia  is present and it does not allow the genocide over the Croatian  people. If that was [true], and it is in fact invented, the  world, today, in the 21st century, [as heard] should ask itself:  What are we doing, gentlemen, when in 21st century [as heard]  Europe we have allowed such atrocities and such a war?

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: ACT clears a path through risk-management minefield - Derivatives Publication of the Association of Corporate Treasurers' guidelines on risk management and control of derivatives could hardly have been better timed. A succession of losses through the use of these complicated financial instruments has nurtured an impression that companies cannot handle them. The ACT believes that the problems lie not so much in the complexity of the products as in a failure of control at a very basic level. The organisation, which groups corporate treasurers from the UK's largest companies, elevates one simple recommendation above all: 'Strategies, policies and procedures for the use or trading of derivatives must be clearly agreed by senior management and at least endorsed by the board of directors.' Most non-financial corporations say they only use derivatives to hedge, or lay off their risk. But Mr Derek Ross, author of the paper and ACT chairman, argues that hedging is an ambiguous concept which needs to be pinned down. A dealer takes a view of the market when deciding when and for how long to hedge. The ACT policy document holds that management must not only agree a clear policy but 'monitor and report all derivative activities, positions and exposures'. That reads like a rather trite sentiment, but a basic failure of supervision lies behind many of the recent corporate losses. Another important point is the need to provide for an internal check on treasury and dealers. This separate risk management function should ensure compliance with limits to exposure and independent reporting to management. Some treasurers maintain that the ACT's recommendations are over the top and the public hysteria is overheated. The sanguine view is that derivatives, complex and misunderstood as they are, get more than their fair share of blame for losses. For every loser there is a winner, analysts stress, but the winners stay silent. Companies have proved perfectly capable of losing large sums of money, not on exotic derivatives, but simply because of movements on underlying markets. Rolls-Royce, Laker and Lyons lead the list of examples. Only rarely is it mentioned that a company should have used derivatives to hedge its exposure. There may be no boardroom panic about derivatives but there is concern. For a start, about one-tenth of UK treasury departments still trade for profit, according to surveys of corporate treasurers, and that can also expose them more to losses. Speculating treasurers can always do damage but highly leveraged derivatives can allow them to wreak particular havoc. It is also possible to lose money on a standard but misunderstood hedge. A company can misjudge its underlying exposure. It could, for example, over-estimate its sensitivity to interest-rate movements and over-compensate. And some treasurers still experiment with complicated instruments which are beyond them. 'There is very good and strong sales pressure,' says Mr Les Halpin, of Record Treasury Management, the risk management research company. 'And it is natural human nature: a treasurer wants to try things out.' The roll-call of corporate losses on derivatives is nevertheless having a salutary effect on practices. 'It will make people that much more cautious, that much more diligent,' says Mr Paul Reyniers of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Ahead of the ACT guidelines a trend towards more robust and explicit controls is already in evidence. Some companies have, for example, restricted the use of certain instruments such as the short option. Corporate treasurers are evaluating their positions more frequently. This practice of 'marking to market' can be misleading, some companies claim, and some of the more complicated instruments are hard to value. The Record survey showed only 28 per cent of surveyed corporate treasurers marked to market every day or week. Marking to market is nevertheless becoming more common as a guide. Management can rein in their central treasury units but many of the most crippling derivatives losses have been inflicted by rogue subsidiaries. 'There are people in subsidiaries that can sell the company,' says Mr Reyniers. Companies are therefore tending to insist that units, as well as filing the usual monthly balance sheet, also state their off-balance sheet positions. Corporate treasurers and board members are also taking to heart the message that they should not be using derivatives if they do not understand them. 'If you don't know what you are doing you are dead,' says Mr Richard Desmond, corporate treasurer of BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group. Some clients have blamed their misapprehension on investment banks for giving bad advice. Fewer than half of the corporate treasurers interviewed by Record said sellers of derivatives explained their products adequately. In the US both Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibsons Greetings have sued Bankers Trust, a leading derivatives dealer. However, companies' dominant reaction has been to put their own house in order. While there has been no obvious fall-off in overall use of derivatives, a gentle shift has taken place: from the captions and swaptions that bewilder the uninitiated towards simple, 'plain vanilla' products that can be easily explained to superiors. Explanation is easier if executives have solid basic knowledge. Workshops, seminars and conferences on derivatives for corporate treasurers have proliferated. A finance director attending one accountancy firm's course said: 'My treasurer wants to use more derivatives. I just don't feel comfortable. She could be doing something crazy and I would never know.' Of course a board may endorse a risky move in the derivatives market. In that case there are no guarantees. The most Mr Ross can do is to argue: 'If a company wishes to adopt such a hazardous policy it should at least be disclosed to shareholders.'</p>

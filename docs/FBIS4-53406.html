			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon),  sent to international organisations, peace, democratic and  solidarity organisations and prominent figures of many countries  around the world an appeal for a solidarity movement to force  the Japanese authorities to stop persecuting and suppressing  Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan.    The appeal recalls that persecution and suppression of  Koreans is openly committed in Japan and on the 25th of April  the Japanese police searched the Osaka Prefectural headquarters  of Chongnyon and its branch offices by letting loose scores of  riot police vehicles and more than 1,300 policement.    The appeal says:    "It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities are  trying to justify their massive arms buildup by spreading rumors  about `threat from North Korea' through all the propaganda  machines and media and, furthermore, to pave the way for a  comeback to the Korean peninsula and Asia by enacting a  'security emergency law' and forcing constitution revision at  any cost.    "The Japanese authorities, far from deeply repenting of, and  apologizing and compensating for the colonial domination over  Korea and the past crimes against the Korean people, are  persecuting the Koreans in Japan, the direct victims of the  colonial domination, and savagely suppressing the Chongnyon  organisation that speaks for their democratic national rights  under the groundless pretext. We sternly denounce this,  branding it as one more crime against humanitarianism."    "In view of the grave situation today, we appeal to our  friends worldwide who love justice and peace to launch a  solidarity movement protesting the unpardonable persecution and  suppression of Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan by the  Japanese authorities and calling for its immediate halt."</p>

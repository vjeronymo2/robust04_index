			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE GOAL: FUN;  </P> <P> NOBODY'S KEEPING SCORE IN LEAGUE FOR 5-YEAR-OLD GIRLS  </P> <P> There is no blood left on the soccer field when the Bunnies meet the Lambs.  </P> <P> And there are no winners or losers when the Ducklings take on the Fawns. When  their game is over, the Kittens and the Puppies don't even know the score, but  they exchange hugs anyway.  </P> <P> Welcome to the American Youth Soccer Organization's league for 5-year-old girls  -- a league whose games are played on what AYSO organizers, with apologies to  Disneyland, call the "Happiest Field in Mission Viejo."  </P> <P> "Our goal is for the kids to have fun," said Paul Beltis, program director for  the local league. "We don't keep score and we don't have standings. The kids  have the rest of their lives to be competitive."  </P> <P> For the 102 girls in Division 7, the AYSO league is their first experience with  organized youth sports. At this age, say AYSO coaches, the game is rather  basic. Run down the field. Kick the ball. Aim for the goal.  </P> <P> "The joy for them is kicking the ball and scoring," said Allan Gallup,  commissioner of the Mission Viejo AYSO district, which he says is the second  largest in the nation with more than 3,000 children. "So we don't use goalies."  </P> <P> The girls tend to bunch around the ball like bees around a hive and buzz up and  down the field, giggling and laughing. League officials like to tell stories  about untangling the occasional overenthusiastic youngster from the nets when  their momentum carries them into the goal.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, said Gallup, all 22 girls from both teams chased a ball  beyond the end line and just kept going, ignoring the excited whistles of the  referee as they ran, en masse, past startled players on the next soccer field,  then scooted down a hill after the ball, stopping only when it jammed against a  fence.  </P> <P> "The game is so entertaining that parents on the next fields stop watching  their kids and turn around to watch the girls," Beltis said.  </P> <P> But gradually, they learn the basics of soccer, and in the learning also pick  up some valuable social skills, their parents say.  </P> <P> "Initially they are very shy," said Lorie Kilgore, as her daughter, Ashley, sat  quietly by her side after a game last week at Youth Athletic Park in Mission  Viejo. "Their attention span is very short, and they tend not to be very  aggressive."  </P> <P> "But then you see them grow and gain confidence in themselves," said Kilgore,  who coaches the Ponies. "They learn so quickly."  </P> <P> Every girl gets a uniform, and at the end of the year, everyone gets a trophy,  said Peltis, whose daughter Jennifer, the last of his six children -- all girls  -- is in the league.  </P> <P> "They love it," he said. "It's their very own trophy, and they take it to  preschool or kindergarten during show and tell and share it with the other  kids, they're so proud of that trophy."  </P> <P> And by the end of the season, the improvement in play from the early games is  dramatic, he said. The girls eventually learn the meaning of end lines and how  to guide the ball instead of kicking it aimlessly.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo is one of only three AYSO districts in the county that separate  the girls from the boys, Gallup said.  </P> <P> "Even at this age, the boys seem to be more aggressive," he said, which tends  to send some of the girls into a shell. "As a rule the kids do better when they  are separate and many (AYSO) districts in the Southern California area are  trying to do that.  </P> <P> "The problem is, they don't have the numbers," Gallup said, "which is a shame  because once they get started, the league really takes off."  </P> <P> Called the "baby animal league" because the teams are named after infants in  the animal world, the 5-year-olds were divided three years ago into six teams.  </P> <P> Currently, there are 12 teams, and organizers say they are running out of baby  animal names.  </P> <P> "We finally settled on the Foals and the Fledglings for new names this year,"  Beltis said. "We were going to use Chicks, but we thought some of the parents  might not be too happy about that." Christine Cotter / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

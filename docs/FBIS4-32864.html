			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 29 May (AE) -- Today during the opening  session of the Second Southern Cone Marketing Congress, Industry  and Commerce Minister Aecio Alvares reported that the government  is studying a draft anti-dumping bill. He said that the  government is worried about the problem as customs barriers are  being eliminated over the entire world, and dumping and  subsidies are becoming frequent practices in international  trade. "In these cases we need to react immediately, or face the  disappearance of some industries," he said.    Alvares mentioned the case of the textile industry, which  faces competition from Korean products arriving in Brazil with  prices 50 percent below domestic prices. "We cannot stop  encouraging trade at lower prices," he said, but "we also cannot  allow subsidies or dumping practices," he added. According to  the minister, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is  particularly important in combating these two unfair trade  practices that hurt the free market, as the regional trade bloc  strengthens the position of Brazil in international forums such  as GATT.    The minister also said that the participation of private  initiative in the detection of harmful practices in trade is  essential. Alvares said that Mercosur is already a real market.  Businessmen from the four member countries--Brazil, Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay--are already identifying potential joint  actions and solutions to common problems. He mentioned the  initiative of the shoe industry businessmen of Novo Hamburgo,  Rio Grande do Sul, who are contacting their Argentine and  Uruguayan counterparts to defend themselves from the trade  actions of Chinese shoe producers in the international market.    The Second Southern Cone Marketing Congress began today with  an attendance of 2,500 -- 1,000 more than what was expected by  the Parana Marketing and Sales Managers Association (ADVB),  which is organizing the congress. The congress will last until  31 May, and among its highlights will be presentations by Alvin  Toffler, one of the greatest international marketing  specialists, and by Serge Ogranovitch, a Frenchman resident in  the United States who is a key player in projects for forming  economic blocs. Ogranovitch has counseled Japan and its partners  in the consolidation of the Asian trade bloc.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Highlights of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Patent Information, Certification, and Notice of Certification to Patent Owner and Certain Application Holders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute prohibits the agency from making effective the approval of an ANDA or an application described by section 505(b)(2) of the act (referred to as a 505(b)(2) application) before all relevant product and use patents for the listed drug (a drug product listed in an approved drug product list published by the agency) have expired, except where the generic applicant asserts either that its product will not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. In the latter case, approval of the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application may not be made effective until the patent owner and the NDA holder have been notified and have had an opportunity to litigate the issue of patent infringement or validity. To facilitate the patent protection provisions, the statute requires that applications submitted under section 505(b) of the act include the patent number and expiration date of all relevant patents that claim the drug (including product and formulation patents) in the application or use patents that claim a method of using the drug. The agency publishes this patent information in its approved drug product list (``Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,'' also known as the ``Orange Book'') for each listed drug for which patent information has been submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A generic drug applicant submitting an ANDA that refers to a listed drug must include a certification as to the status of all patents applicable to the listed drug. Similarly, an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application must make certifications with respect to patents claiming any listed drug or claiming a use for such listed drug. If a generic applicant certifies that a relevant patent expires on a specified date, the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will be delayed until the expiration of the patent. Thus, for example, if the patent expired on January 1, 1995, the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application would be January 1, 1995. The agency regards drug products with delayed effective dates as having tentative approvals; it does not consider the approval to be final until the effective date and the issuance of a final approval letter (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956). When a generic applicant certifies that any product or use patent is invalid or will not be infringed, the applicant must give notice of such certification to the patent owner and appropriate approved application holder for the listed drug. The generic applicant must include in the notice the factual and legal basis for the applicant's opinion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Finally, a patent owner has 45 days from receipt of the notice of certification to file suit against the generic applicant to defend the patent. If the patent owner files suit within 45 days, the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be delayed up to 30 months pending resolution of the lawsuit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule describes: (1) The requirements for the submission of patent information by an NDA holder or applicant, (2) the patent certification requirements applicable to generic applicants, and (3) the content of a patent certification notice. The final rule also specifies: (1) When and to whom the notice is to be sent, and (2) the effect of each type of patent certification on the effective date of approval of an application for a generic drug product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Exclusivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 505(c)(3)(D) and (j)(4)(D) of the act protects certain listed drugs, or certain changes in listed drugs, from generic copying for specified periods by placing a moratorium on the submission, or by delaying the effective date of approval, of ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications for those listed drugs. These so-called ``exclusivity provisions'' provide the following periods of protection from generic competition: (1) A 10-year period of exclusivity for new chemical entities approved during the period January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984, the date of enactment of the 1984 amendments; (2) a 5-year period of exclusivity for new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984; (3) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984, if the applicant submitted an application containing reports of ``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant''; (4) a 3-year period of exclusivity for certain changes made after September 24, 1984, if the applicant submitted a supplement containing reports of ``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored by the person submitting the application''; and (5) a 2-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical entities, or for certain changes made to already approved drug products, approved during the period January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is codifying the provisions regarding 5- and 3-year exclusivity; FDA is not codifying the other exclusivity provision because they have expired. The final rule also defines certain terms used in the regulations, and clarifies the agency's interpretation of each of the provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Comments on the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 314.50_Content and Format of an Application (21 CFR 314.50)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contained several additions to the existing requirements in &sect;314.50. The proposed additions focused on patent information and certifications and claimed exclusivity. Under proposed &sect;314.50(i), for example, a 505(b)(2) applicant would be required to include in its application one of four possible certifications: (1) That patent information on the reference listed drug had not been submitted to FDA; (2) that the patent had expired; (3) the date on which the patent will expire; or (4) that the patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the proposed drug product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

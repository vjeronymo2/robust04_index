			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Bin those reports: Which institutions and practices could quietly be disposed of? Andrew Jack suggests one They take years to complete, cost millions of pounds to research and rarely lead to any significant action. Critics are increasingly questioning whether the UK Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' examinations of corporate failures are worth the trouble. The latest example came last week when the DTI released its report into the collapse of Atlantic Computers, the leasing company taken over by the conglomerate British &amp; Commonwealth in 1988. Further DTI reports - including on Guinness's 1986 takeover of Distillers - are in the pipeline. Though they may make interesting reading, the minimal response to their suggestions is unlikely to justify the efforts involved in their production. Mr Hugh Willmott, of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, who has studied DTI reports over the past 20 years, says they have done little more than highlight the limitations of company regulation in the UK. 'They offer apparent reassurance but delay closer scrutiny,' he says. What little comfort the reports offer the public comes at a high price. The 380-page Atlantic report cost Pounds 6.5m to produce in fees and expenses paid to a barrister, an accountant and their assistants, making it the most expensive ever commissioned. Such expense might be worthwhile if the findings were definitive. But they are not. The accountancy profession's own regulatory committees stress that they need to carry out independent investigations for the sake of 'natural justice' before taking any disciplinary action against accountants criticised in DTI reports. Nor are the reports of much use in commercial litigation. British &amp; Commonwealth's administrators have launched legal action against auditors and advisers to Atlantic. But their action is based on a separate examination of the facts. In fact, the administrators began their legal moves before the report was published. The DTI itself may act on the recommendations of its inspectors and seek the disqualification of directors censored in its reports - as seems likely in the case of Atlantic and British &amp; Commonwealth. But the level of detail in the reports is greater than usually required by the DTI when it seeks in the courts the disqualification of directors. The only other sanction the reports offer is the public embarrassment of those mentioned. This is not always effective. For example, the late Mr Robert Maxwell was subject to scathing criticism in reports on his companies in the early 1970s, but it did not stop him from rebuilding his empire. Another problem with most inspectors' reports is that they take too long to produce. By the time the conclusions are reached, recommendations for reform may be overdue or irrelevant. For instance, the two Atlantic inspectors took more than four years to publish - a not untypical gap. So long after the events in question, individuals and companies concerned may not be active or even alive. There is also inconsistency in the launching of investigations. Under company and insolvency laws, the DTI can appoint inspectors to examine the circumstances surrounding a collapse or instance of fraud and then compile a report - some of which are made public. Such decisions appear arbitrary. No inspectors have been appointed to examine three recent high-profile collapses: Polly Peck International, the conglomerate built up by fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir; the Bank of Credit and Commerce International; or the Maxwell companies. A large number of other inspectors' reports have been commissioned but never made public. The DTI says it typically receives 1,000 requests for investigations each year and pursues a quarter of these. Most remain confidential - officially on grounds of public interest but adding to the impression that reports are commissioned and released according to ministers' whims. A handful is published each year. Moreover, the impartiality of the reports can be questioned. Accountants and lawyers are those who normally carry out the inquiries, yet they represent two professions often criticised in the reports, and are even sometimes drawn from firms that have themselves been criticised previously. All this suggests that inspectors' reports are an expensive indulgence. Though they are useful for academics and researchers, their price makes them inaccessible to many students: the Atlantic report costs Pounds 35. It may be time that the DTI reconsidered what purpose its reports serve and how it could meet these needs more effectively.</p>

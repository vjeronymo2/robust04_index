			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) The contaminants subject to treatment, as described in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.45(b); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) An indication that these contaminants are being treated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with &sect;268.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) For hazardous debris when using the treatment standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contaminating waste(s) in &sect;268.40: the requirements described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If a generator is managing prohibited waste in tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40 CFR 262.34,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is treating such waste in such tanks, containers, or containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> buildings to meet applicable treatment standards under subpart D of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part, the generator must develop and follow a written waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis plan which describes the procedures the generator will carry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records, and the following requirements must be met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this Part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the selected testing frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Such plan must be filed with the EPA Regional Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or his designated representative) or State authorized to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 268 requirements a minimum of 30 days prior to the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity, with delivery verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the notification requirements of &sect;268.7(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> files. If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in Appendix I of this part, all waste analysis data must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained on-site in the generator's files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or exempt from Subtitle C regulation, under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent to the point of generation, he must place a one-time notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stating such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous or solid waste or exemption from RCRA Subtitle C regulation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disposition of the waste, in the facility's file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications, demonstrations, waste analysis data, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or disposal. The five year record retention period is automatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6, or exempted from RCRA Subtitle C regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent to the point of generation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) If a generator is managing a lab pack waste and wishes to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alternative treatment standard under &sect;268.42(c), with each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment of waste the generator must submit a notice to the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that underlying hazardous constituents need not be determined. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generator must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (a)(6) of this section and must submit the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I certify under penalty of law that I personally have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pack contains only wastes which have not been excluded under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix IV to 40 CFR part 268 or solid wastes not subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to regulation under 40 CFR part 261. I am aware that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are significant penalties for submitting a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, including the possibility of fine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imprisonment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) [Reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Small quantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 40 CFR 262.20(e) must comply with the applicable notification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial shipment of the waste subject to the agreement. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, together with the tolling agreement, for at least three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record retention period is automatically extended during the course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as requested by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

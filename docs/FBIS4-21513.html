			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Simon Beavis, industrial editor: "Nuclear Waste </F> Safety Fears"]    [Text] The Government is under pressure to widen the scope  of its promised review of nuclear power after its safety  advisers warned of serious problems at installations, including  Sellafield, and said failure to plan for storage of waste could  expose workers to increased radioactive doses.    In a damning report the Health and Safety Commission's  advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations  (ACSNI) said failure to plan a deep depository for waste meant  there was uncertainty about how to package waste stored at sites  of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. This could lead to the "risk  of additional doses to workers dealing with waste at nuclear  sites."    The report also warned that there was a legacy of  "inadequate  storage" at Dounreay in northern Scotland and, referring to the  1957 fire at Windscale, now part of the Sellafield site, said  "there are still serious problems not cleared up since the  accident."    About 15 tonnes of damaged fuel remains in the core of the  atomic pile that was hit by the fire and a further five tonnes  of fuel in aid and water ducts. Great care was still needed to  avoid the release of materials during work on the site.    The committee's chairman, Dr David Harrison, made it clear  that the problem of waste should be a main question in the  Government's nuclear review, but he said the Energy Minister in  communications with the committee had failed to clarify whether  the problem would be investigated.    The review -- which the Government promised would begin in  1993 -- has been held up partly because the Department of Trade,  the Treasury and the Department of the Environment have failed  to agree on its terms of reference. The DTI wants a limited  study while the rival departments want to study the question of  nuclear liabilities and waste.    The ACSNI report concentrates on six UKAEA sites: Harwell,  Winfrith, Dounreay, Aldermaston, Springfields and Sellafield. It  highlights a store at Harwell which fails "to meet modern  standards" and "unsatisfactory" storage facilities for low level  waste at Dounreay.    Of Sellafield it says: "There is a very long programme of  work required to get the piles into an adequately safe  condition. At present they fall far below the `as safe as  reasonably achievable' criterion."    The UKAEA said the report recognised "considerable  improvements" it had made. Concerns about Dounreay and  Sellafield had now been resolved.</p>

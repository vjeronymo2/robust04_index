			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Xerox improves 11% to Dollars 135m XEROX, the document processing group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent increase in third-quarter net income and announced a Dollars 444m provision for restructuring at Crum and Forster, its property/casualty insurance unit. The provision was offset by the realisation of Dollars 444m in capital gains at Crum and Forster, but the subsidiary warned it expected to take extra provisions in the fourth quarter. Xerox shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 76 as analysts expressed disappointment over the results of its core copier business and concern as to whether Crum and Forster's remaining unrealised capital gains would be sufficient to cover any further provisions. Xerox reported net income of Dollars 135m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared to Dollars 121m, or Dollars 1.06, in the same period of last year, while revenues rose to Dollars 4.5bn from Dollars 4.3bn. Analysts expectations had centred on earning per share of about Dollars 1.29. For the nine months, it produced net income 11 per cent higher at Dollars 402m, or Dollars 3.53 a share, compared to Dollars 363m, or Dollars 3.18. Revenues were Dollars 13.1bn, against Dollars 12.9bn. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said the company's new range of document processing machines were 'meeting with excellent customer reception, despite the weak economic environment in the US and deteriorating economies in Europe, Japan and Brazil'. Third-quarter income from the document processing side was 10 per cent ahead at Dollars 128m, while revenues grew 9 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. Excluding currency effects, revenues grew 4 per cent. Mr Stuart Ross, chairman of the financial services business, said a new management team at Crum and Forster was looking at several alternatives for restructuring its insurance operations and strengthening its financial position.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: FOOTLIGHTERS PLAN A HEAVENLY NIGHT  </P> <P> The cabaret curtain will part revealing the gates of heaven. That's because the  Footlighters are angels. In the past decade alone they have raised more than $1  million for charity. They kick up their heels each year in a fund-raising  cabaret.  </P> <P> Now that they're celebrating their 50th anniversary, little surprise they've  opted for the theme, "Heaven Sent" for their Cabaret Ball on Saturday.  </P> <P> This year's honorary chairman, Barbara Billingsley, a longtime Footlighter, is  promising -- along with president Sandra Young, ball chairman Susie Gordinier  and production chairman Barbara Mortensen -- that this will be the most  fabulous cabaret yet. They will romp at the Beverly Hilton, raising funds for  the Footlighter Child Life Center, the Harbor/UCLA Medical Center and Stepping  Stone, a Santa Monica youth crisis center.  </P> <P> PASCAL: Glass sculptor Pascal, also known for her blond topknot and her  tailored men's suits worn with her own miniature jeweled sculptures (frequently  pastel green), is being honored at a Thursday dinner party at the Bistro after  her Diamond Year Retrospective at the Dyansen Gallery in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The retrospective and the dinner celebrate her 75th birthday. Joining to host  the party are Mary Jane and Charles Wick (former USIA director), Ginny and  Henry Mancini and Mr. and Mrs. Helmut Swarovski (he heads the Swarovski crystal  manufacturing company).  </P> <P> A couple of years ago Pascal was honored by the National Arts Assn. Her roster  of collectors is impressive: Prince Charles, Frank Sinatra, Winthrop  Rockefeller, Barbara Walters, the Vatican, U.N. headquarters in Geneva,  Longacres Race Track in Seattle, even the Louvre. She is currently creating a  limited edition of miniature sculptures, but, thinking big, too, she is  completing a 10-year project titled "Seated Torso" from an 18,000-pound hunk of  glass.  </P> <P> CREATIVE CONTROL: Andrea Gregg, chairman of Pasadena Junior League's Center  Stage -- the major fashion show that funds the league's community endeavors --  was explaining how important it was for the league "to regain control of the  creativity" of the annual fashion show it launched so successfully six years  ago. Thus, this year, with a whole lot of chat, the league opted to produce the  show themselves with a hired independent producer and think big and  differently. They had to raise $50,000 more than last year to produce the show.  That meant $200,000 was needed ($65,000 of it in underwriting) to net $115,000.  </P> <P> It seemed to work for the luncheon, evening party and double fashion show.  Chairman Gregg, president Cynthia Perucca, first chairman Karen Goodyear (who  flew in from London to support her friends) and production chairman Susan  Ralston-McCormick and finance chairman Michael Ann Ewing (daughter of former  Ambassador to Ireland Peter and Jackie Daily) were all in tears, happily so, by  the end of the noon luncheon when the audience was on its feet cheering.  </P> <P> They had hired Karen Burdett Productions to do the show, contracted  independently with purveyors for the fashions, worked closely with  Bonaventure's executive chef Werner Glur (white chocolate Formula I racing cars  for the evening menu). The show, in fact, started with the roar of engines and  the call, "Gentlemen, start your engines," just like Indy. That all was a  subtle way to increase male attendance at the evening show (the luncheon is  primarily female). "I have goose bumps," said Andrea Gregg, who had ordered up  racing jackets and white pants to be worn by her committee at weekly meetings  all year.  </P> <P> This is a fashion show in which members, husbands and children model. The crowd  was close to 1,000 -- including Bob Gregg, quick on his feet when son Kurt  walked out in The Prep Shop togs. Dan Baker had a big grin for daughter  Catherine. And most popular on the runway were Deborah McAbee, Lisa Halpern,  Judy Morse, Bo Gusstafson (Polytechnic basketball star), Adam Jones, Susan  Gilomen and Pamela Hillings Tegtmeyer.  </P> <P> FIRST-EVER: New Start for 14 years has quietly provided low-cost outpatient  substance abuse counseling in Santa Monica -- each year to 475 young adults and  150 teens, plus an additional 210 teens in the Santa Monica-Malibu school  district.  </P> <P> Now, it's on the receiving line. It holds its first-ever fund-raising dinner  Saturday at DC-3, the new restaurant on the north side of the Santa Monica  Airport. To be honored are Olympic Gold Medalist Jackie Joyner Kersee, L.A.  Raider Howie Long, Lakers Jerry West and Orlando Woolridge, All-American wide  receiver Erik Affholter and All-American quarterback Rodney Peete.  </P> <P> ANOTHER FIRST: For several years representatives of prestigious Wall Street  investment firms have participated in a basketball tournament, giving funds to  the New York Multiple Sclerosis Society. Last year the Wall Street Charity  Classic moved to Madison Square Garden.  </P> <P> Now Richard J. Capalbo, president, CEO and chairman of Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards, Inc., and Robert Juneman, director of the Southern California Region  of Dean Witter Reynolds, are spearheading next Sunday's tourney at the Great  Western Forum in Inglewood. The goal is $100,000 for MS research. The funds  will come from team fees ($5,000), contributions, and silent and live auctions.  We'll tell you the names (for short) of the participating teams -- Bateman,  Dean, Drexel, Kidder, M. L., Merrill, Morgan, Prudential, Morgan (yes, two),  Jones. Sounds like fun.  </P> <P> THEY CARE: Last year CARES, the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center  Auxiliary, cared so much with its CARES benefit California National Horse Show  that it netted $100,000 for its child and family program.  </P> <P> Jane Lombardo, Weta Mathies and Anita Tsuji are doing it again for the seventh  annual Wednesday through Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. The  National Horse Show will feature the $25,000 California National Grandprix, a  member event of the Michelob-AGA Series and a World Cup Qualifying Event.  </P> <P> President Carol Mishell, Polly Clark, Emily Peck and Gerry Williams have sent  the invitations for the Horse Show Dinner on Friday. Bill Shoemaker will be on  hand to autograph his book, "Shoemaker." Among those riding in the show will be  Bill and Marcy Shatner and Cindy Shoemaker. Admission is free every day between  8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. (except for the Sunday Grandprix). The evening events have  tabs.  </P> <P> WEARIN' O' THE GREEN: The Los Angeles Children's Museum's staff, in  appreciation of financial support, welcomes museum trustees and major donors  for Irish grog and buffet Thursday. . . .  </P> <P> Jimmy Murphy will be in kilt flanked by bagpipers when the Irish and the  Irish-for-a-Day arrive on a green carpet at Jimmy's Restaurant for St.  Patrick's Day Friday. Lunching will be Don and Barbara Rickles, Ed and Victoria  McMahon, Bob and Ginnie Newhart, Arte and Giesela Johnson, Sidney and Joanna  Poitier and Phyllis Diller. . . .  </P> <P> The decor will be green and white for the Rainbow Luncheon of the Children's  Service League of the Orthopaedic Hospital Wednesday at the Beverly Wilshire.  Mary Dumont plans a St. Patrick's theme. . . .  </P> <P> "A Touch O'Green" goes with the Kate and Advocate benefit when Paul Conrad  speaks to the Laws Affiliates of Los Angeles at brunch next Sunday at the  Bel-Air Bay Club. . . .  </P> <P> Irish smiles will be abundant for the Mary and Joseph League's St. Patrick's  Day Shamrock Ball Friday at the JW Marriott. Joe Moshay's orchestra plays.  Leonard and Bernadette Faye co-chair. . . .  </P> <P> MEMORIES: Charles and Mary Jane Wick, after eight years in Washington, were  welcomed home at a party at Chasen's hosted by Betty Adams, Beverly Morsey,  Betty Wilson and Virginia Milner. At one point, Wick took the piano away from  Ray Moshay's orchestra and improvised.  </P></p>

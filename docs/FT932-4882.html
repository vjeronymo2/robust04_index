			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Smith creditors to meet CREDITORS of Mr Clive Smith, the 1980s oil entrepreneur who will today seek to avoid bankruptcy, are expected to raise questions over the statement of his affairs showing assets of Pounds 1.7m and debt claims of more than Pounds 20m. The statement of affairs provides scanty information. In it, Mr Smith proposes to repay creditors, who will vote in proportion to their debt, by realising interests, including property, an outstanding debt, and contributions from his income as a financial consultant over the next three years. The two companies in which he has been most active according to associates are Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading last month, and Cellular Telecom, the mobile communications group. The companies have some directors in common and have shared office space and trading links. Cellular Telecom retails airtime on the Vodafone and Cellnet networks. It signs up subscribers, bills them for equipment and airtime use, and then pays the networks. 'Being a service provider is being a bank,' said Vodafone. CT is one of three UK companies seeking to act as a service provider on Vodafone's new Greek cellular network. Mr Smith's connection to CT dates back to 1990, when it was sold to the then publicly-quoted Image Store Holdings, as part of a reverse takeover. The vendors of CT, whose directors included Sir David McNee, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, were Mr Smith's two daughters, Mr Robert Pollock, a CT director, and Mr Edward Clucas, a financial adviser to Mr Smith. The financial adviser to the deal was Corporate Broking Services, a London stockbroker which went into liquidation in 1991 and in which Mr Smith held a substantial stake. At the time, the prospectus stated that neither Mr Smith nor trustees of his daughters' trusts would seek board representation. He has, however, retained an active role throughout and was at the company's Maidenhead offices last week in meetings with CT directors including Mr Pollock and Mr James Berry. Both men are also on the board of Alpine (Double Glazing), the windows company, which ceased trading at the end of May. Mr Smith personally guaranteed the purchase of Alpine from administrators in February 1992. Mr Pollock yesterday refused to comment on Mr Smith's precise link with Cellular Telecom. Mr Pollock, a discharged bankrupt, secured his Pounds 500,000 mortgage from the Bermuda-based Bank of Butterfield by a guarantee from Finchley Investments, an Isle of Man company which Mr Smith has often used to handle some of his investments. Finchley put up 500,000 shares in Western &amp; Pacific, a North American natural resources company as collateral for the loan. Western &amp; Pacific is also partly owned by Newsham Investment, another vehicle for the Smith family interests. Finchley Investments' name came up last year in connection a financing deal for Belling, the cooker manufacturer which subsequently went into receivership. Belling had tried to arrange a Dollars 50m capital injection through Global Prospect Funding. It agreed to pay Global Pounds 2.1m, borrowed from the pension fund, before the deal as the first year's interest. When the Dollars 50m loan was not forthcoming, Finchley Investments put up Western &amp; Pacific shares as Belling's security for the interest payment. It is not clear what Mr Smith's current offshore interests are. They are not mentioned specifically in the statement of his affairs supplied to creditors for today's meeting. Mr Smith's creditors include the Inland Revenue and Societe Bancaire de Paris. The largest creditor by far, however, is Richard Pearce and Son, a Hong Kong registered company with the same Irish address as Mr Kelvin Myles, who managed many of Mr Smith's offshore interests. Some creditors have been unable to secure satisfactory answers to questions over Mr Smith's affairs when they approached Mr Graham Wilson, the insolvency practitioner who called today's meeting on Mr Smith's behalf. Mr Wilson, who has also called a creditors' meeting for Alpine (Double Glazing) later this month, was arrested last year on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure and is on police bail awaiting possible charges. The DTI is believed to be taking an interest in his affairs. At the meeting in Southall this afternoon, creditors will vote on Mr Smith's proposals for an individual voluntary arrangement. Mr Smith is offering to repay 8.13p in the pound if creditors accept his proposals, against 0.1p in bankruptcy.</p>

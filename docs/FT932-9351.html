			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Japan facing pressure over market access JAPAN'S trade minister, Mr Yoshiri Mori, will come under pressure from his US and EC counterparts today to breathe new life into the stalled Uruguay Round by accepting a package of tariff cuts and other 'market access' measures, write Bernard Simon in Toronto and Nancy Dunne in Washington. The three trade officials and Canada's Mr Michael Wilson will hold an all-day meeting in Toronto described by a Canadian official as an 'intensive working session'. Both Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and EC Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan are said to be confident they are close to an agreement on market access within the framework of the Uruguay Round. US officials say they have made significant progress in negotiations on tariff reductions with the EC, and it is now time to 'begin to engage' Japan and Canada. Japan, with its Dollars 136bn (Pounds 88.3bn) worldwide trade surplus, has 'a disproportionate responsibility' to contribute to the process of trade liberalisation, a senior US official said. 'I want to stress the importance we see in Japan taking an active interest in a major package.' Tariff reductions  - in most cases to zero  - are sought by the private sector on paper, wood, non-ferrous metals, beer and other products where tariff peaks are still significant. Japan will be leaned on to 'cough up' market openings in financial services, the US official said.</p>

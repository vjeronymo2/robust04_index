Mr Lelyveld, who is 57, had long been regarded as front runner to succeed 64-year-old Mr Frankel. He has been managing editor since 1990, was foreign editor of the paper from 1987 to 1989 and had held many overseas reporting posts, including two spells in South Africa. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for 'Move Your Shadow', a book illustrating the impact of apartheid on South African society. He will be succeeded as managing editor by Mr Eugene Roberts, 61, a former NYT employee, who was editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer for 18 years and is now a professor at the University of Maryland's college of journalism. Mr Frankel will become a columnist for the NYT magazine, writing about communications and the media.</p>

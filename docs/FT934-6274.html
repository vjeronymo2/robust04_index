			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher sold Stores conglomerate Kingfisher came under pressure as poor French economic data, combined with the postponement of a subsidiary's results, hit the shares. They finished 13 down at 654p, although turnover was a low 1m. Analysts said the company had postponed preliminary results from Darty, the French electrical retail arm purchased last February for Pounds 560m, that were due next week. While Kingfisher said the one-month delay was to enable a more detailed set of results to be published, some in the market read the move with suspicion. The shares were not helped by publication of dull French household consumption figures. However, Kingfisher was not alone in a weak stores sector, undermined by press headlines forecasting a tough Budget next week for consumers following the base rate cut on Tuesday. Among those hurt, Dixons slipped 5 to 265p, Great Universal Stores 6 to 555p and Marks and Spencer 3 to 404p. Big turnover was seen in Burton as one US institution sold some 19.4m shares at 63p to Lehman Brothers, which sold them on at 63 3/4 p. With total turnover showing 30m being traded by the close, there were suggestions that possibly not all the stock had been placed. Burton shed 2 to 64p. Azlan, the leading value-added distribution group to the network computing market, made a highly successful debut in the market. The shares, offered at 230p, moved up steadily throughout the session to finish at 241p. Turnover totalled 7.1m shares. Another successful market debut was seen, this time from DFS Furniture, which came to the market at 260p and closed 11 ahead at 271p. The absence of any hard news from the Opec meeting in Vienna left the oil sector in limbo. Analysts said there were suggestions that a 2 per cent output cut may be achieved by Opec members. 'That would be viewed favourably by the market at the outset, but longer term would be cutting things too fine. A deep cut and stringent discipline is needed or oil prices could easily slip another Dollars 2 to Dollars 3 a barrel.' One senior oil analyst went on to say that the near term performance of the oil sector 'depends entirely on Opec's ability to achieve a workable output accord; if they do not, the sector will go sharply lower'. Shell Transport managed a minor improvement at 687p following a presentation in London to UK oil analysts. Analysts said the meeting produced an extremely solid performance by Shell, with the company communicating its determination to cut costs and raise the return of capital. 'There was not much for the bears to get their teeth into,' said one analyst who attended the meeting. Sugar and sweetener group Tate &amp; Lyle produced results at the top end of market forecasts and, together with an upbeat statement, sent the shares smartly forward by 9 to 395p. But analysts pointed out that operating profits, which were up 11.2 per cent, would have actually slipped once currency benefits and the effect of the pound's devaluation on EU sugar support prices had been stripped out. Figures from Kwik Save, the discount supermarket operator, met analysts' expectations. However, the company cautioned over the increasingly tough price competition in the industry. The shares retreated 9 to 573p. Further trouble for Euro Disney, the loss-making theme park operator, saw the shares driven sharply lower and prompted three separate suspensions of trading in Paris. A rumour that the group's creditor bankers were planning the setting up of a committee to help in any restructuring was being heard. On Tuesday, there was also speculation that big creditors were attempting to sell their loans at a hefty discount. In London the stock dropped 62 to 318p. Thorn EMI weakened on cautious comment after Tuesday's results, ending 19 down at 895p. There were also news reports that Thorn's music division had spent Dollars 200m aquiring Michael Jackson's music catalogue, but the company finally denied the story after the market had closed. Bank shares rallied after the mauling they received on Tuesday when the market reeled from worries about shrinking margins and talk that a leading broker had prepared a bearish review of the sector. Barclays ran up 6 to 554p, Lloyds 4 to 567p and National Westminster 6 to 531p. HSBC, with buying fuelled by the rise on the Hong Kong market, advanced 12 to 733p. Scotia, the research-based pharmaceutical group, jumped 9 to 287p after it was announced that a treatment being developed by the company to combat cancer might also be used to fight the HIV Aids virus. Wellcome, which manufactures the leading Aids treatment Retrovir, relinquished 5 to 618p. Automotive components manufacturer BSG International tumbled 12 1/4 to 56 1/4 p after issuing a profits warning. The news pulled down T&amp;N, off 4 at 190p, and GKN lost the same amount at 480p. There was also a profits warning from aerospace component producer AIM Group, which plummeted 30 to 143p. Glass manufacturer Pilkington managed a slight rise to 152p on turnover of 1.5m in spite of late hints around the market that the company may be about to launch a sizeable rights issue. News of the profits warning from Philip Morris came too late to impact on the London market, although tobacco-related concerns BAT Industries and Rothmans were down 5 at 485p and 2 at 416p respectively.

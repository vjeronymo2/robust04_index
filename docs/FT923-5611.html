			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Swan Hunter to shed 1,400 workers SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, is to make more than 1,400 workers redundant because of a lack of orders. The decision by the last shipyard on the Tyne cuts the Swan Hunter workforce by nearly half and will deal a severe blow to employment in the north-east. The redundancies follow the company's failure to find contracts to replace those now being completed, in spite of a worldwide search for business. Although Swan Hunter is building three frigates for the Royal Navy it did not win any of the last batch of frigate orders placed by the Ministry of Defence. The company is, however, about to challenge VSEL, the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, for the Pounds 150m contract to build a helicopter ship for the MoD. A total of 725 full-time workers and 700 on short-term contracts, which are due to expire in a few months, will lose their jobs. The move will leave 2,200 people on the payroll. It was greeted with dismay, although not surprise, by the workforce. Dr Roger Vaughan, Swan Hunter's joint chief executive, said the lack of orders meant a workforce which had been expanded to undertake existing contracts now had to be slimmed down. He added: 'We very much regret having to take this action but shipbuilding is a cyclical business.' Dr Vaughan said that Swan Hunter, which was privatised in a management buy-out six years ago, was confident about prospects for orders for the Royal Navy's amphibious fleet and for export business, but it was necessary to cut the workforce in the short-term. He added: 'Our order book runs through to the end of 1994. However, we must ensure our employment level is in line with that work until new orders are won. 'In an increasingly unsettled world we are well placed to meet a wide range of maritime defence requirements for the UK Ministry of Defence and overseas governments. We are also maintaining our capability to win merchant ship design and construction work when market conditions improve.' Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said he believed the decision would have a 'domino' effect on jobs in the region. He added: 'Many displaced yard workers have for the last 10 years been able to find employment in the offshore construction business but that no longer offers any opportunities.'</p>

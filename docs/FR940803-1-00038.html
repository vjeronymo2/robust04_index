			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On July 12, 1983, natural gas escaping under 60 psig pressure from a crack in a substandard butt-fusion joint in a 2-inch plastic gas main entered an apartment building in Clear Lake, Iowa. It exploded and then burned. Two gas distribution company employees were injured, one apartment building was destroyed, and the adjacent apartment building was damaged heavily. Damage was estimated at more than $1 million. Fortunately, none of the building residents were injured or killed. Company employees had been notified earlier about strong gas odors outside the apartments and were on site searching for the gas leak more than 2 hours before the explosion. They did not shut off the flow of gas to the leak and did not warn the residents to evacuate the apartment buildings before the explosion. NTSB recommended that the company train its employees, including supervisors, in procedures for responding to emergencies and protection of the public in areas exposed to leaking gas, and reinstruct its pipe fitters/operators in all elements of the procedures for fusion of plastic pipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 26, 1983, natural gas at 815 psig began to escape through a failed gasket in a compressor at a transmission company's field compressor plant near Bloomfield, New Mexico. The compressor station operator heard a loud noise, ran to the valve manifold outside the compressor building, and tried to shut off the gas supply to compressor No. 14. Another employee, who also heard the noise, ran into the compressor building and tried to shut down the compressor engine. Before either person succeeded, the escaping gas ignited, exploded, and burned. The two employees were burned severely, compressor No. 14 was destroyed, another compressor was damaged, the windows and doors of the compressor building were blown out, and other structural damage resulted. NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the improper tightening of compressor head bolts, resulting in the rupture of a compressor head gasket and the escape and ignition of gas. Contributing to the accident was the operator's failure to assure that maintenance personnel were trained in proper bolt tightening procedures. Contributing to the extent of damage and to the duration of the emergency was the failure by plant personnel, due to inadequate training in emergency procedures, to promptly relieve gas pressure in the piping by activating the blowdown system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a February 1987 report (NTSB/PAR&hyph;87/01) detailing two Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline Company accidents occurring in Kentucky in 1985 and 1986, NTSB determined that company employees who inspected corrosion damage had not been adequately trained to assess the effect of corrosion. It also determined that in the 1986 accident, supervisors had not been properly trained to cooperate with local officials during an emergency. In this report, NTSB recommended that RSPA:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Amend 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195 to require that operators of pipelines develop and conduct selection, training, and testing programs to annually qualify employees for correctly carrying out each assigned responsibility which is necessary for complying with 49 CFR Part 192 and 195 as appropriate (Safety Rec. No. P&hyph;87&hyph;2).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, in the May 14, 1987, letter from NTSB to RSPA identifying its 110 Safety Recommendations, NTSB urged OPS to require all pipeline operators, without regard to size or ownership of the pipeline, to develop, through job/task analyses, employee qualifications for all activities addressed by the pipeline safety standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More recently the NTSB released the following account of an accident in Chicago that was attributed to inadequately trained gas distribution personnel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 17, 1992, employees of a natural gas utility were performing annual maintenance on a pressure regulator station that reduced high pressure upstream gas to the low pressure requirements of the downstream distribution system. During this routine procedure the pressure regulator is taken out of service and the normally closed by-pass valve is manually throttled to control gas flow to the low pressure distribution system. Workers operating the by-pass valve normally determine the need to increase or decrease the gas flow to the low pressure system by monitoring the liquid levels in manometers installed on that system. A manometer is a clear plastic U-tube used throughout the gas industry to measure pressure (pressure head) in mains and services. When used on low pressure systems the open ended U-tube commonly contains water. By observing the difference in height of the water columns, workers can readily determine the pressure in the connected gas piping. Although, the workers saw the water blow out of their manometers, at least twice, they waited for instructions from headquarters before shutting off the gas supply by closing the 4-inch by-pass valve. The resulting over pressure condition (as high as 10 psig) lasted about 45 minutes, during which gas in the downstream distribution system escaped through gas appliances into homes and other buildings where it was ignited by unidentified sources. The resulting explosion and fires killed four people, injured four people and damaged 14 houses and three commercial buildings. While the NTSB concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine which way the 4-inch by-pass valve was turned or if it had been blocked by debris that become dislodged, it said that the accident could have been prevented or its severity lessened if the onsite supervisor had closed the by-pass valve as soon as he realized that the low pressure system was over pressured. Two of the workmen testified that they knew from their training that when water blew out of their manometers, it was caused by excessive high pressure gas flowing through the by-pass valve. However, none of the crew acknowledged having been trained to respond to emergencies, including those involving overpressurization. NTSB found that the gas company's training manual did not detail how to recognize or respond to those abnormal situations employees are likely to encounter nor did it tell supervisors the extent of their authority or reference the company's emergency plan. Nonetheless, the NTSB found that the gas company's service department responded very well after the gas was shut off.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NTSB also noted that such training deficiencies are not confined to Chicago, but are a nationwide problem. As a result of its investigation of this accident, NTSB reiterated its 1987 recommendation to RSPA that it require operators of pipelines to develop and conduct selection, training and testing programs to annually qualify employees for their safety-sensitive responsibilities under 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a review of alternatives analyzed in the EA, the Council selected Alternative 3 as the preferred alternative. This alternative is projected in modeling simulations to rebuild POP biomass to a target level (B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in about 14 years by harvesting POP at a fishing mortality rate lower than the optimum rate. The target biomass B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the total biomass of mature females that would produce the maximum sustainable yield, on average; this number is currently estimated at 150,000 mt. The optimal fishing mortality rate is the rate that maximizes expected biological and economic yields over a range of plausible stock-recruitment relationships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 1, which no longer represents the best scientific information about POP biomass and population dynamics. The Council also considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 2, which would harvest POP at the higher optimal fishing mortality rate. The Council believed that lower POP harvests and additional economic costs of Alternative 3 were justified because Alternative 2 would achieve the target biomass in a longer time (about 18 years) and with a lower probability of rebuilding success. Alternative 4 would harvest POP at a lower rate equivalent needed for unavoidable POP bycatch in remaining groundfish fisheries, at 1992 bycatch rates. The TACs resulting from Alternative 4 were considered too restrictive in relation to existing POP bycatch needs, causing unnecessary discards of POP that are killed in fishing operations after POP TACs are reached. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Alternative 3, the FMP would establish the procedure for deriving the annual GOA TACs for POP. POP stocks are considered to be rebuilt when the total biomass of mature females is equal to, or greater than, B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Annual TACs would be established as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Determine the current biomass, B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the optimal fishing mortality rate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Determine the fishing mortality rate halfway between the optimal fishing mortality rate and the fishing mortality rate estimated to be sufficient to supply unavoidable bycatch of POP based on 1992 bycatch rates; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When the current biomass of mature females is less than B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , adjust the resultant fishing mortality rate in (b) by the ratio of current biomass to B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  so that when B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MSY <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is attained, the fishing mortality rate will be the optimal fishing mortality rate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The GOA TAC of POP is the amount of fish resulting from the adjusted fishing mortality rate in (c); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The TAC is apportioned among regulatory areas in proportion to POP biomass distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to restricting the annual fishing mortality rate of POP, the Council seeks to reduce the total mortality of POP in other target fisheries. In the past, overfishing has been defined GOA-wide. Under Amendment 32, the overfishing level would be distributed among the eastern, central, and western areas in the same proportions as POP biomass occurs in those areas. This measure would avoid localized depletion of POP and would rebuild POP at equal rates in all regulatory areas of the GOA. The Council considers this management option necessary because, although POP biomass is greatest in the Eastern Regulatory Area, most trawl fishing activity and incidental catch of POP is greatest in the Central Regulatory Area. With an acceptable biological catch as low as the current, 3,378 mt in 1993, fishing mortality of POP can be expected to exceed the TAC available in the central GOA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 32 is necessary to improve conservation and management of POP and is intended to further the goals and objectives of the FMP. No regulatory changes are necessary to implement this FMP amendment because the FMP would provide the procedure for deriving TACs for POP, which are specified annually under existing regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dated: December 28, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Richard H.

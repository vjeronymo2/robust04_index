			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa voiced hopes Friday that North Korea will make  concessions in the controversy over its alleged nuclear weapons  program.    "North Korea, taking it seriously that the international  community will possibly take concerted sanction measures, is  sending the message that it could accept (nuclear) inspections,"  Kakizawa told an interpellation session at the House of  Councillors Budget Committee.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, also speaking before the  committe, reiterated that Japan would join the United States and  South Korea in economic support to the North provided Pyongyang  accepts full inspections of the country's nuclear facilities.    Hata also indicated that the ruling coalition would back  military measures within a framework of "universal security."  But he added, "of course we cannot participate in military  measures involving use of weapons, which is prohibited by  Article 9 of the Constitution."    Japan's pacifist postwar Constitution states in the article,  "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right  of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of  settling international disputes."    Legislator Makoto Taneda of the opposition Social Democratic  Party (SDP), however, urged the government to clarify from which  article in the Constitution it draws its support for collective  defense.    Takao Ode, head of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau,  acknowledged that the Constitution does not incorporate "a  concrete article" on the issue. But, he said, Japan's  connection with collective defense arises "from our joining the  U.N. Charter."    The interpellation session will be carried over to Monday as  Taneda was not satisfied with the government's answers.</p>

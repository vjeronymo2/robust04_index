			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / MMC finds takeover activity sharply down THE SHARP decline in takeover activity in the UK over the past 18 months was reflected in figures published yesterday for the number of mergers investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1991. After the busiest year in its 44-year history in 1990, when it investigated 27 mergers, the MMC completed only seven reports on mergers last year. Sir Sydney Lipworth, MMC chairman, said yesterday that in spite of the lower total, the intensity of the commission's work had been maintained. Presenting its annual review for last year, he said that was largely due to the six big monopoly inquiries carried out, including the largest investigation ever carried out by the MMC, into the supply of new cars. Overall, 21 reports were published during the year, compared with 35 in 1990. Sir Sydney said a feature of 1991 had been the growing trend for more than one national competition authority to become involved in transactions affecting multinational companies. The leveraged buy-out and restructuring of the company controlling the Wilkinson Sword razor business by a consortium that included Gillette, its biggest competitor worldwide, had led to investigations in the US, Canada, Germany, the UK and several other jurisdictions, as well as by the European Commission. In the UK, the MMC's reports into the merger itself and the supply of razors and razor blades are now both the subject of judicial review proceedings brought by Gillette and are expected to be heard by the High Court in March. A sharp increase in the number of challenges to MMC decisions by judicial review proceedings was another feature of last year, Sir Sydney said. In the past five years there had been 10 judicial review challenges to MMC decisions. In five cases, the decisions had been upheld; two were under appeal, including the commission's own appeal in the Sheffield Bus mergers case; and three were still pending - the two razor cases and a challenge to the commission's monopoly report on the supply of structural warranty services in relation to new homes. Sir Sydney said the increase in challenges was partly a reflection of the general trend towards challenging official decisions by judicial review. It would be a pity, he said, if judicial review came to be used as an accepted means of appeal against the substance of the commission's findings. On the role of the privatised utilities regulators, he said it was too early to judge whether the government had got the structure right. In the early days, there were advantages in having specialist regulators dealing with an industry. Whether enough competition would develop to make this type of regulation unnecessary remained to be seen, he said. Monopolies and Mergers Commission 1991 Review. MMC, 48 Carey St, London WC2.

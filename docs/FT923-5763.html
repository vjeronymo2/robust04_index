			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / People: . . . and advice Elsewhere, Allan Hargreaves (below) has been appointed as the first director of charity taxation and head of the Charities Unit at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, based in the Leeds office. The unit, which serves Peat's offices around the country, specialises in providing tax advice to charities and other voluntary organisations. Hargreaves joined the firm in 1986, having worked for the Inland Revenue since 1969, where he spent eight years as a charity specialist. He says he hopes to operate the unit as a central referral point for professionals in the firm around the country, in much the same way as the Inland Revenue operated a specialist unit for that purpose. Like a number of tax practitioners, he often sports a bow-tie. 'It's a little bit out of the ordinary. But there again, so is the voluntary sector.' Kleinwort Benson Charities, a division of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, has appointed 54-year-old former army Lieutenant Colonel Russell Wright as marketing consultant. He left the army in 1989, and then, as managing director, set up the direct dealing arm of a Lloyd's underwriting agency, which he subsequently left after a disagreement. Rupert Marlow, director of KB Charities, points out that trustees of many charities are developing increasingly high standards about the kind of service they demand of their professional investment managers. ***** Robert Morton, formerly head of conglomerates at BZW, has been appointed a director specialising in conglomerates and business services at CHARTERHOUSE TILNEY. ***** Peter Hunt and Nick Brown have been appointed directors of R P MARTIN Sterling. Richard Gardner-Brown has been appointed a director of R P MARTIN Exchange. ***** David Martin, from County NatWest Ventures, is appointed regional director for Yorkshire of GRANVILLE DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL. ***** Stuart Bell, md of Personal Pension Management, has also been appointed md of GMBC Financial Services; both are part of GUINNESS MAHON. ***** Peter Johnson, finance director, and Michael Robinson, personnel director, have been appointed to the board of HENDERSON ADMINISTRATION Ltd. ***** The City was not short of analysts who, with a nudge and a wink, professed close links with the Labour party shortly before the general election in April. Strangely enough, many have since fallen silent. By contrast, Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, has long been a staunch Labour supporter. Renowned for the accuracy of his gloomy economic forecasts as much as for his left-leanings, MacKinnon is to join Citibank as chief currency strategist for Europe, effectively replacing Paul Chertkow who left earlier this year for UBS. Born and educated in Liverpool, MacKinnon started out as an economist at the Treasury. After intervals at Nomura and Chase, he moved to Yamaichi, where The Times voted him best UK economic forecaster. Julian Simmonds, head of foreign exchange at Citibank, said he was 'delighted' with MacKinnon's appointment. 'He has an outstanding reputation in the City and he will be a tremendous asset,' he said. As for advising the leader of the Labour party on economic matters, Simmonds said: 'I believe that people's political views are their business. It doesn't worry me in the slightest what people's tendencies are.' The recession is hitting the City hard and economists can no longer be as choosy about their salaries as they used to be. MacKinnon, 37, said: 'The excess demand for economists is pretty small because of market conditions. That puts a squeeze on salaries. It's very tight.'</p>

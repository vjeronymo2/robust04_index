			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Troubled waters - The Uruguay Round may be concluded, but it leaves a handful of potential trade conflicts This week, the gleaming Geneva headquarters of the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may look a little scuffed. Officials, still worn after the marathon of the Uruguay Round, opened their doors at the weekend to 300-odd environmentalists and politicians from more than 100 countries. The subject was one of the most troublesome legacies of the recently-concluded Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures: the potential conflict between free trade and the environment. The message coming loudly, if chaotically, from the weekend's symposium was that messy and ill-tempered conflicts are simmering on many fronts. Peter Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt secretariat, left delegates in no doubt that, in his view, the environment would have suffered if the Uruguay Round had failed, because economic prospects in developing countries would have been harmed. Nevertheless, developed countries are still anxious that Gatt will erode hard-won environmental standards, while developing countries fear that these standards are protectionism in disguise. Gatt has set up a committee, due to meet for the second time next month, to address these worries and to tackle clashes between trade and environmental principles as they arise. According to Richard Eglin, director of Gatt's trade and environment division, potential conflicts fall into three categories. Much of the weekend's debate focused on the first of these: clashes between Gatt and high-profile international environmental treaties. These include the Montreal Protocol on curbing substances which damage the ozone layer; the Cites convention on trade in endangered species; and the Basle convention on trade in hazardous waste. Each of these treaties appears to give signatories the right to ban imports which have been manufactured in an environmentally damaging way, even if the products themselves are not damaging. For example, in a hypothetical case cited by lawyers in Geneva, signatories to the Montreal Protocol might try to block imports of Taiwanese electronics, as Taiwan is not a signatory to the protocol, even if Taiwan argued that the circuit boards were cleaned with ozone-safe substances. Phillipe Sands, an environmental lawyer who is the founder of London University's Foundation for International Law and Development, says: 'If you ask a trade lawyer which agreement takes supremacy, the answer is that Gatt prevails. But for a general international lawyer, it's not so black and white.' However, in Eglin's view, while these potential conflicts attract enormous attention because of the public interest in ambitious green treaties, they are largely academic at the moment. Tougher problems, he believes, are likely to arise from clashes between Gatt and national or regional environmental regulations. The now notorious conflict between the US and Mexico on tuna fishing falls firmly under this heading. Under the terms of the US Marine Mammal Act, the Americans want to ban imports of Mexican tuna because the fishing nets also kill dolphins. This week Geneva is due to send out to Gatt signatories the conclusions of its second panel on the dispute. The panel, it has widely been leaked, has again ruled that the US is wrong. Delegates in Geneva cited a host of other areas in which they expected similar squabbles to occur, including Brazilian shrimp fishing, which some environmentalists believe harms turtles, and Danish standards for drink containers. Ira Goldman, trade representative of the Governor of California, said that the state is bracing itself to defend its rules on car emissions and on package recycling against European complaints under Gatt. Importers 'are going to say 'how can you insist that California's high standards are necessary, as New York state has different ones?',' he said. California's response will be that levelling environmental standards would undermine regional diversity and opportunities for 'testing' new environmental solutions. One of the fiercest battlegrounds is likely to be European Union rules for a packaging directive, which would set mandatory levels for use of recycled packaging. Developing countries are also concerned about EU eco-labelling proposals, which would label goods with a description of the environmental impact of their manufacture. Martin Khor, director of the Third World Network, a Malaysian environmental group, said that Malaysian timber companies were acutely concerned that the eco-label would shut out imports of furniture made from Malaysian wood. But Gatt secretariat officials stressed that while they are expecting appeals from countries which believe their products are excluded from markets by European environmental rules, it may prove hard to enforce Gatt principles. Neil Robson, Gatt adviser on packaging exports, pointed out that as the European packaging directive does not specify where packaging must come from, it is far from straightforward to show that it contradicts Gatt principles of trade. Beyond these predictable squabbles lies an 'unexplored black hole', according to Eglin, containing questions of trade in services, transport and genetically modified organisms which, some might argue, were environmentally damaging. For example, some delegates suggested, a non-nuclear country might want to ban imports of electricity produced by nuclear power. These issues will clearly embroil veterans of the Uruguay Round in further years of committee meetings. But judging by the huddles of packaging industry executives on the shores of Lake Geneva last weekend  - and by the comments of Gatt officials - that unglamorous sector will provide some of the first battles. In Eglin's words, 'it comes down to brown paper bags - that's where the real issue is because that's where the money is'.</p>

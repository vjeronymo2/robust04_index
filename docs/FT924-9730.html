			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Jobs: The long fuse of the human time-bomb - Even after two years of recession, the crunch effects of plunging morale may be still to come The directors sit in the boardroom confronted by financial crisis. After grim discussion the decision is taken. They draw up orders for 15 per cent cuts in staffing all round. Getting wind of the plan, the personnel manager asks the board for a hearing. 'I've been reading some research,' he says, 'and it shows that if you just impose these cuts, they'll have a counter-productive effect on the staff we keep.' But the directors, after listening impatiently, put the plan into force. What happens afterwards was described by the American consultant, Dr Saul Gellerman, during the Institute of Personnel Management's conference in Harrogate. Adding gradually to a graph as he went along, he sketched the typical changes in a company's profitability and its staff's morale and productivity, which follow peremptory actions such as the sackings cited above. The first of the three graphs, A - just up to the right - shows the position at the end of the first period (which might be a year) after the cuts were imposed. The thick line represents profitability, which has risen quickly as a result of reduced costs. The double line represents the employees' morale, and the grey line below it their productivity, which have both gone on as before. At this point, the directors are apt to write off the personnel manager as a scaremonger whose forebodings have not proved justified. But the research he mentioned to the board a year earlier was the work of Rensis Likert, of the Michigan Institute of Social Research, who found that people's morale and productivity are conditioned by inertia. When life gets tough humans tend to go on as before for a while, hoping the hard times will go away again as suddenly as they came. 'The dawn comes slowly,' Dr Gellerman said, 'but when people see that this isn't just temporary, the inertia is overcome.' Graph B shows the position at the end of the third year after the cuts. Productivity first rose again, albeit less steeply, then levelled off. In the second year morale started to worsen, and very soon afterwards productivity also began declining as shown by absenteeism, substandard work, lack of co-operation and so on. Once the continue-as-before inertia is overcome, morale and productivity will go on falling with added momentum. But the less labour-intensive a company is, the longer the deterioration will stay hidden. In any case, it will probably be well down the slope before its effect starts to show in worsening profitability. And it is not until that point, if at all, that the top executives are likely to remember the personnel manager's warning and make efforts to regain the confidence and co-operation of their staff. But what then? According to the research, the same inertia that kept morale and productivity level for a while following the cuts, will keep them deteriorating after steps are taken to reverse the decline. So here we are at C, the end of the fourth year, with the vertical line P marking the point at which efforts to restore health were begun. If they were well devised, although profits will continue falling, morale and productivity will eventually level out for a while before starting to improve. A bit later, all else being equal, profitability will follow suit. On the other hand, the top executives may not appreciate the effect of inertia. Having taken the restorative action only to find it's still not noticeably working six months later, they might get tough again instead. If so, said Dr Gellerman, not only morale and productivity but profits to boot are apt to plummet through the bottom of the chart. AT which point, I'll pause and ask if any reader has noticed anything odd. Some who'll certainly have done so are people who were at the Institute of Personnel Management's conference in Harrogate only last week. For they'll know Saul Gellerman was not on the programme. The fact is that, although he has spoken at an IPM conference, it was 24 years ago. The Jobs column has reason to remember it. Except for minor changes, the above report on what he said was my first article the FT published, on October 15 1968. What has sent me back to it, however, is a very contemporary event. It happened in last week's conference session on motivating workers. Right at the end, after discussion of the latest research, one of the audience stood up and said his company had cut its staff savagely, and all those left were terrified of losing their jobs too. 'They're now working harder, longer and better than ever before,' he continued. 'What need do managements have of motivation, when so much can be achieved just by fear?' On the day, answer came there none - and the silence brought to mind the late Rensis Likert's work on inertia, as explained by Saul Gellerman so long ago. The problem was not cost-cuts as such, he added, but how they were interpreted by the workforce. Several firms studied had emerged unharmed, especially when staff had participated in making the crisis decision. And oddly enough, though that word has lost vogue over the past decade, the latest evidence is that letting people participate in deciding what's to happen, is one of the more effective ways of motivating them. As to whether Rensis Likert's venerable findings still apply in the 1990s, we'll have to wait and see. Although Britain's recession has been prolonged, it is only two years or so since the swingeing staff-cutting began. If the theory is right, where the effects of plunging morale are concerned, the crunch may be yet to come.</p>

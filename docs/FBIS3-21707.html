Same sources added that Captain Rodomiro Rada, the San  Matias  Police chief, informed Santa Cruz department Police Commander  Armando Morin Sanchez today that Puchol died on the evening of  10 February at the Monte Florida 14th Infantry barracks,  following a beating by a group of military men.    Radio Panamericana of La Paz reported that Army Lieutenant  Marco Antonio Mejia Alarcon is responsible for Puchol's death.    The San Matias Police report states that British subject  Douglas James Morrison and some San Matias residents saw Mejia  Alarcon brutally beating Puchol on the evening of 10 February.    After declaring that he witnessed the brutal beating of  Puchol by Mejia Alarcon and other military men, Morrison left  San Matias last Thursday, sought protection at the British and  Spanish Embassies in La Paz, and his whereabouts are now unknown.    Despite the statement by Morrison, Interior Minister German  Quiroga, Police Commander General Luis Rocha, and General  Reynaldo Caceres--the Army Commander in Chief--emphasized last  Friday that there was no evidence that San Matias military men  had beaten Puchol and that he died of a cocaine overdose.    Puchol, 33, was a Spanish Justice Ministry official who  arrived on 10 February in San Matias, in the Bolivian department  of Santa Cruz which borders with Brazil. A few days earlier, he  made a study of the Xingu Indian tribe in the Brazilian region  of Mato Grosso.    Interior Ministry sources informed EFE on 16 February that  early on February 11, Bolivian military men left Puchol's dead  body at a San Matias hospital, explaining that they found it in  a vehicle abandoned in a jungle zone.</p>

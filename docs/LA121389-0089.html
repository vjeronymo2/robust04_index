			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> TRAUMA CARE IS ON CRITICAL LIST  </P> <P> In two weeks, the Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center will  close its trauma center, which lost $1 million last year and had been projected  to lose $3 million in 1990. Almost nothing can be done to save the facility at  this late date.  </P> <P> Unless the Board of Supervisors and concerned officials and community groups  move quickly, the Orange County system that began eight years ago to save lives  -- particularly in the "golden hour" after a severe injury -- may be in danger.  Once there were five trauma centers in the county, but soon there will be only  three, all of them under added financial pressure as the system dwindles.  </P> <P> The loss of the Fountain Valley facility points up once again -- as if another  reminder were needed -- the crisis in health care affecting not only Orange  County but the rest of California and the nation as well. It is caused in part  by the inability of hospitals and physicians to absorb the cost of treating the  indigent and uninsured without sufficient reimbursement by the government.  </P> <P> On a broader scale, the entire system of health-care delivery in this nation  must be rethought. But in the meantime, the Board of Supervisors needs to find  ways to increase revenues to Orange County's trauma-care system that do not  steal from one health program to finance another.  </P> <P> The board must aggressively explore ways to increase state funding for health  care. At present, Orange County is shorted about $45 million a year by state  health officials, because of formulas that favor urban counties. While attempts  have been made to right this wrong, it is time for a no-holds-barred effort by  the board.  </P> <P> This was one of several recommendations adopted recently by the United Way  Health Care Task Force consisting of 45 Orange County provider, business,  civic, labor and other organizations. Unless the board moves quickly, there may  be little left of the trauma system to save.  </P></p>

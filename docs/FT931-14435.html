			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Clinton pledges continuity and change PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday promised both continuity and change in his administration's conduct of foreign policy. In a speech to diplomats at Georgetown University, his alma mater, he said he would build on the successes of his predecessors 'in specific areas'. He cited the Middle East peace process, nuclear arms control and proliferation, the humanitarian operation in Somalia, the support for reform in the former Soviet Union, and the creation of new and expanding markets around the world. 'Yet, the world has changed in fundamental ways and we must change with it,' he went on. 'We need to clearly state how we plan in the US to adapt our nation's foreign policy goals and institutions to this new era.' Mr Clinton said his foreign policy would be based on three pillars: first, to make US economic security 'a primary goal' of foreign policy. 'We cannot sustain an active engagement abroad without a sound economy at home.' Essential to this was a system of global commerce 'rooted in principles of openness, fairness and reciprocity.' Second, US armed forces would be restructured to meet new and continuing security threats. Prudent cuts in defence spending were necessary, but that did not mean a lessening of US resolve. 'When necessary we will not shrink from using force when all appropriate diplomatic measures have been exhausted.' Last, the US would encourage the spread of democratic values worldwide. 'Democracies do not wage war against one another. They make better partners in trade and diplomacy. And, despite their inherent problems, they offer the best guarantee for the protection of human rights.' Specifically, Mr Clinton promised to work through the United Nations and other international institutions to resolve contentious disputes. 'America cannot and should not bear the world's burdens alone,' he said, 'but the Gulf war and the humanitarian relief operation in Somalia demonstrate what is best about the UN.' Apart from the now obligatory warning to Iraq, his speech was essentially another of the inaugural rites of passage and was not intended to break new ground. Nevertheless his insistence that prudent cuts in defence spending were achievable serves as a reminder both to his domestic defence establishment, which is resisting them, and to US allies, from Japan to Nato, that this is one campaign promise that he intends to keep.</p>

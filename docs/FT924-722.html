			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recedes slightly after Friday's gains Wall Street US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday after investors consolidated some of the big gains earned in last Friday's 'triple-witching' rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 0.81 at 3,312.46, near its best level of the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.58 at 440.70, but the Nasdaq composite rose 1.17 to 662.46, another record high. Turnover on the New York SE was busy at 226m shares, and declines outscored rises by 1,019 to 858. The market's 44-point Dow advance on Friday was primarily the result of buying related to the 'triple-witching' expiration of stock and stock-index futures and options, so analysts expected prices to open easier yesterday. The underlying mood of the market, however, remained optimistic, which helped prices to pick up from early losses. Observers believe investors are increasingly confident about the economy and the long-term prospects for corporate earnings. This upbeat mood has fuelled the recent rally, and although some institutions had already closed their books for the year, some analysts were not ruling out further gains in the final days of the year. IBM dropped a further Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 48 7/8 in turnover of almost 7.4m shares following the announcement that two retired executives were being rehired to help Mr John Akers, IBM's chairman, run the computer group. Time Warner firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 in the wake of news that Mr Steven Ross, the group's chairman, had died of cancer over the weekend, and that eight senior directors would be leaving at the end of this year in an apparent culmination of a long boardroom struggle at the entertainment giant. USAir dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 11 3/4 as hopes faded that government authorities would approve the proposed alliance between the carrier and British Airways. A last-ditch attempt last weekend by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, to persuade President George Bush to give the green light appeared to have failed. National Health Laboratories plummeted Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 17 1/4 in turnover of 4.8m shares after the company pleaded guilty to charges of healthcare fraud and agreed to pay Dollars 110.4m to settle claims involving clinical testing procedures and the Medicare programme. On the American Stock Exchange, Ivax Corp plunged Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 29 in turnover of 1.5m shares after PaineWebber, the Wall Street broking house, had downgraded the stock from 'buy' to 'attractive'. On the Nasdaq market, Ross Cosmetics climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 12 after reporting fiscal first-quarter income of 22 cents a share, up from 17 cents registered a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks ended softer, weighed down by losses in Canadian gold shares and a round of profit-taking following last week's sharp gains. The TSE 300 index shed 10 points to 3,310.4 and declining issues outnumbered rises by 350 to 301 after volume of 42.1m shares valued at CDollars 358.4m. The gold and silver share index, taking its cue from a USDollars 3 an ounce retreat by bullion futures, dipped 101.6 to 5,225.7.</p>

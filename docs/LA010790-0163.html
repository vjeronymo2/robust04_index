			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELTICS, MINUS BIRD AND COACH, MANAGE TO BEAT BULLETS, 102-88  </P> <P> The Boston Celtics, missing Larry Bird and Coach Jimmy Rodgers, got 29 points  and 13 rebounds from Robert Parish and beat the Washington Bullets, 102-88,  Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Celtics lost their best player, their coach and the game against the  Clippers on Friday night.  </P> <P> Bird suffered a sprained left ankle, described by the team as "moderate to  severe," in the first quarter of the game in Boston, and Rodgers was suspended  for one game and fined $1,000 by the league after bumping referee Joe Forte.  Neither accompanied the team to Maryland.  </P> <P> Reggie Lewis, who started in place of Bird, had 21 points for the Celtics, who  snapped a five-game losing streak at Capital Centre dating back to Dec. 15,  1987.  </P> <P> The Boston offense revolved around Parish, who repeatedly was able to establish  position in the low post. Parish was 12 for 15 from the field despite frequent  double-teaming by the Bullets.  </P> <P> Washington, which has lost seven of its last eight games, was led by Jeff  Malone with 33 points, including 16 in the third quarter, and Bernard King with  17.  </P> <P> Boston has won five of its last six games on the road.  </P> <P> Assistant coach Chris Ford handled the team Saturday night, but Rodgers is  expected to be back on the bench when the Celtics play at New Jersey Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> NBA Vice President Rod Thorn said Rodgers was suspended because he bumped a  referee and did not leave the court quickly enough after being ejected.  </P></p>

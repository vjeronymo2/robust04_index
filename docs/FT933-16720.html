			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Seven shops - three raids a week: And teenage black marketeers send 7-year-olds in to shoplift for them ONE MAN who has no hesitation in supporting the views of Mr Stanley Kalms is Mr Leo Gillen, Hartlepool's largest independent newsagent. He has seven shops in the town and they are the target for an average of three attempted break-ins every week. 'What he's saying is basically right,' says Mr Gillen. 'The government is not addressing the issue of law and order properly. Retailers are having to fight crime themselves.' Security devices at Mr Gillen's shops, which stock a range of goods, consume 10 per cent of his net profit. All have steel doors and shutters with security locks and anti-ramraid bollards in front. They also have dedicated phone lines to a burglar alarm company - alarm bells proved useless when the thieves put them out of action by swamping them with foam. Most of the shops have closed-circuit television and all have vigilant staff. But they still suffer from organised thieving, especially of tights, hair mousse, coffee, tinned tuna, salmon and bacon. A black market exists for these products. The hair products are sold to small hairdressers, says Mr Gillen, and the other items are sold door-to-door. 'You have youths of 17 and 18 who send children of seven or eight into the shops to steal because nothing happens to them. It's a real problem.' The problems, which Mr Gillen has noticed accelerating in the past five to six years, extend to harassment of employees. 'You get children throwing stones at the staff and abusing them,' he says. Three weeks ago an employee quit because of problems with youths. Only this week two teenagers in balaclavas, carrying water pistols, walked into two of Mr Gillen's shops. 'We didn't know whether it was an attempted raid or a joke,' he says. In one incident youths pulled down and locked the security shutters of one shop, trapping the staff inside. Mr Gillen also owns a pub and fish-and-chip shop in Hartlepool. His annual turnover totals Pounds 5.5m. He is chairman of the Owton Manor police steering committee, a community consultation panel on one of Hartlepool's hard-up estates. The committee has helped, he says, but the problem goes deeper than anything police or magistrates can solve. 'I feel there are too many people cast out of society with the high unemployment figures,' he says. In Hartlepool, for a long time one of Britain's unemployment blackspots, many 15-year-olds have grown up in families where nobody works, he says. This breeds a lack of aspiration. 'When you have people running around lawless they have no comprehension of moral law.'</p>

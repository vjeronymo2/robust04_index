			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("YERKIR" daily), 06/01/94 -- RMK  [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Acting Minister of Foreign  Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan sent a message to the Chairman of the  CSCE Minsk group Ian Eliasson on 31 May.    "Dear Mr. Eliasson:    ``I shall give you some details about the actions of the  Azeri armed units in the captured RMK territories.    ``At the beginning of May 1994 the Karabakh army liberated  the villages of Talish, Seisulan, Yarmja and Karmiravan in the  Martakertskiy district of the Republic from the occupants.    ``Having to retreat, the Azeri command ordered to destroy  the  Armenian villages. The intercepted radio communications  evidence that this barbarous actions have been coordinated with  the Azeri high ranking political leadership.    ``The abovementioned villages, as well as other villages in  the RMK Martakertskiy, Gadrutskiy, Askeranskiy, Martuninskiy and  Shushinskiy districts, which have formerly been occupied by the  Azeri forces, are in fact razed to the ground. The retreating  Azeri army is only leaving ashes behind, thus forcing [the RMK  to take] [previous brackets are source-supplied] retaliative  measures.    ``We have irrefutable information about inhabiting native  Armenian lands by the Azeris. This has also been carried in  Azerbaijan on the level of state policy. The authorities in  this country are actively working on inhabiting the villages of  Leninavan, Maraga in the Martakertskiy district, Shahumyanov,  Kharkhaputi, Verishen, Hay-Boris, Rus-Boris, Buzlukh, Gulistan,  Garachinar, Hakhtut, Manashid, Nor-Shen and Yerkej in the  Shaumyanovskiy district [by Azeris] [previous brackets are  source-supplied].    ``The same fortune would have expected hundreds of other  native Armenian villages, if not the courage of RMK defense army  fighters who liberated the Armenian villages. To be more  precise, not the villages but the ashes which remained after the  retreat of the Azeri units.    ``I would be very grateful if you can send your  representative to the region for investigation of this problem  on the spot.    ``In all cases, we hope for immediate and effective measures  you will carry for preventing the possible negative consequences  of the political stance of the Azeri leaders and for the  peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict.''</p>

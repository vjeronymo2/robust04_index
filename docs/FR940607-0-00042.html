			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (i) States with no ash exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since states may maintain more stringent RCRA programs, some states may never have exempted ash from hazardous waste requirements. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Chicago <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision has no impact in these states. No permit deadline extensions are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) States with unauthorized ash exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA knows that, during the years of confusion over the status of ash, some states exempted ash from their Subtitle C programs. Most of these states, however, did not submit these provisions to EPA for authorization reviews. Although they arguably may have made the state programs less stringent than the federal program, EPA would have taken no action to force the states to eliminate them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Effect of court's decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of these states adopted provisions resembling 3001(i) and interpreted them to exempt ash. Whether the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Chicago  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> decision requires these states to abandon these interpretations is an issue of state law that can be answered authoritatively only by state officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other states promulgated rules under their solid waste authorities that established ash-specific management standards that implicitly_or explicitly_transferred ash management from their hazardous waste programs to their solid waste programs. The status of these provisions is again an issue of state law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Effect of today's deadline extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the state never obtained authorization for its exemption for ash, its authorized program still regulates ash as a hazardous waste. The regulated community, however, could have been confused about the status of ash, so the relief provided by the deadline extension would be appropriate. Whether or not the extension is in effect, however, depends on which entity is authorized to implement the TC. As explained above, where EPA implements the TC, it will apply today's notice. Where states implement the TC, today's notice cannot operate to revise state permit rules. The state would need to determine whether it wanted to provide equivalent relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Requirements for program revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the court's decision, states with unauthorized ash exemptions now have state law requirements that are less stringent than the federal Subtitle C program. EPA is today notifying those states that they must revise their laws and regulations to eliminate the less stringent provisions. Although EPA is not today initiating any withdrawals of state programs, it advises states to take timely action to eliminate their ash exemptions. Since these provisions are not part of states' authorized RCRA programs, no Subtitle C program revisions will be necessary. Rather, EPA advises states to notify Regional Offices informally by letter when they have eliminated their exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Where to file Part A applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where EPA implements the TC, owners and operators must file Part A applications with the appropriate EPA Regional Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where a state that is authorized to implement the TC decides to extend the filing deadline, owners and operators must file with the state hazardous waste agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) States with authorized ash exemptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may have authorized a few ash exemptions during the late 1980's and early 1990's. EPA has not found any such authorization during a limited review prior to the publication of this emergency notice. Consequently, EPA believes that there are very few states in this category. Nevertheless, in case such states exist, EPA is explaining their obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Effect of court decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether or not the decision affected the state law or rule that EPA authorized is a state law issue. State officials will need to make that determination. If a state determines that its state provision is still in effect, both the state law and the authorized RCRA program will continue to exempt ash until such time as the state revises its program and obtains EPA approval for its revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Effect of today's permit deadline extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If ash is still exempt under both state law and the authorized program, no permits are currently required. Today's filing date extension would not take effect. As explained in (D.) below, in some cases EPA will announce an extension when it approves a revision eliminating an ash exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) State program revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where ash exemptions remain in effect, state programs will be less stringent than the federal program. Formal state program revisions, including notice and comment rulemaking, will be required under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). The deadline for these revisions will be July 1, 1995 under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). An additional year is available where states must make statutory changes. 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(v).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Where to file Part A applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time that the state receives EPA authorization for the revision that eliminates its ash exemption, if EPA is still implementing the TC, it will make a finding of substantial confusion and extend the Part A deadline for that state. Owners and operators desiring interim status will need to file applications with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. EPA will not be able to provide this relief where a state is authorized to implement the TC. Those states must determine whether they want to extend permit deadlines. If they do, owners and operators wishing to obtain interim status will need to file applications with the appropriate state agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> REDS' O'NEILL PUT ON DISABLED LIST  </P> <P> The slumping Reds, hit hard by injuries in recent weeks, announced today that  they have placed right fielder Paul O'Neill on the 21-day disabled list because  he fractured his left thumb.  </P> <P> The Reds said O'Neill, 26, who bats and throws left-handed, could be out six to  eight weeks. He is leading the Reds in runs batted in with 62 this season, has  14 home runs and is batting .287.  </P> <P> O'Neill suffered the injury in a futile attempt to catch a Tim Raines line  drive in the sixth inning of Thursday night's 4-1 loss to the Expos in  Montreal.  </P> <P> The Reds said O'Neill's roster spot will be taken by Scotti Madison, 29, a  catcher and outfielder who has played first base with the Reds' Class AAA  Nashville farm team this year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Jun (PANA) -- Eight Burundian  opposition parties have threatened to name their own president  and form a parallel government if the ruling Front for Democracy  in Burundi (Frodebu) appoints a president in July.    "If Frodebu (which is mainly Hutu) names a head of state on  1  July as has recently been announced by Jean-Marie Ngendahayo,  Burundian foreign affairs minister, without the approval of all  political forces in the country, the coalition of opposition  parties will not hesitate to do likewise. If they form a  government, we will form ours," the opposition parties said  Sunday [12 June].    The announcement was made on Sunday in Bujumbura at the end  of a big rally originally called to raise funds for the  displaced persons in the war, by a member of parliament,  Francois Ngeze (Hutu) of the Union for National Progress  (Uprona) whose membership is mainly Tutsi. [Words indistinct]  Ngeze headed a self-proclaimed council of public salvation after  the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye last October.    Ngeze said that the naming of a new president has to be done  after 12 prerequisites have been met. These included the  drawing of a timetable for the disarmament of civilians. He  also called for the suspension of territorial and local  administration officials involved in the October 1993 genocide  and the distribution of weapons to the population, the recalling  of ambassadors "who behave like spokespersons for Frodebu and  not for the Burundian nation".    The opposition is also calling for the dismantling of the  Presidential Guard, which has been created along the Rwandan  model and an end to the forceful return of displaced persons to  their homes before the minimum security and housing conditions  were met.    Responding to the opposition pre-conditions, the Frodebu  government has insisted that a president nominated from the  majority party has to be installed first before anything else is  considered.</p>

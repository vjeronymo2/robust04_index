			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Spanish markets worried over budget: Concern grows over pension and wage pledge Unexpectedly high prices in Spain coupled with a government promise to index pensions and civil servants' wages to inflation have raised doubts in financial markets over Madrid's ability to reduce the public deficit when it delivers the 1995 budget this month. The market has pushed long-term interest rates above 11.4 per cent this week, the highest level since February last year and one that represents a spread of some 400 basis points against Germany. 'Spain is under suspicion,' said Mr Henrick Lumboldt, head of fixed income research at Madrid securities house FG. 'If there is a market sell-off, Spain is going to be sold more aggressively.' Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, echoing a more sombre mood about the domestic economy, was reported yesterday as saying a reduction in interest rates was 'now more difficult' and he 'hoped they will not have to rise'. Only a week ago Mr Solbes had forecast lower interest rates - the benchmark intervention rate set by the Bank of Spain has stood at 7.35 per cent since early August - before the end of the year. The minister's changed predictions came after an unexpectedly high 0.6 per cent rise in August's consumer price index, which put year-on-year inflation at 4.8 per cent and accumulated 1994 inflation at 3.2 per cent, just short of the 3.5 per cent target for the year's end. Although the Economy Ministry, which is due to deliver its 1995 budget this month, is officially sticking to a restrictive policy that will reduce the public deficit by a full point to represent 5.9 per cent of gross domestic product, the market appears to already be discounting a loosening of the professed tight monetary guidelines. The market perceptions are likely to be heightened following guidelines announced this week on pensions and civil servants' pay. Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez said in parliament that Spain's nearly 7m pensioners, whose retirement pay this year has been based on the 3.5 per cent CPI rise projection, would be fully compensated for what now seems likely to be an inflation rate of around 4.3 per cent at the end of the year. The government has also agreed to link salary increases for Spain's 2m civil servants to inflation over the next three years starting in 1995. The agreement with unions includes an undertaking to make up for a wage freeze on civil servants' pay over the past two years with increased pay awards in 1996-1997. The open-handed policy to both pensioners and civil servants has prompted speculation that Mr Gonzalez, re-elected in 1993 for a four-year term just as Spain dipped steeply into recession, could be laying the groundwork for a snap election next year, when the economy is forecast to recover rapidly and grow by as much as 2.5 per cent. 'The government looks as if it is throwing caution to the winds and risking a 'stop-go' economy,' said Mr Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros of Madrid economic consultants Global Research. 'There are a lot of inflationary tensions and restrictive policies should be kept in place longer.'</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Japanese equity purchases reduce after market fall INTERNATIONAL investors reduced their net purchases of Japanese securities last year by 85 per cent to Y841bn (Pounds 4.3bn) against a background of steep declines for Japan's three main stock markets, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday. The fall in purchases on the three largest exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, came in spite of government attempts to steady the markets in August, when the Nikkei stock average in Tokyo fell to a low for the year of 14,309.41. The government emergency package in August included a promise to invest more public funds in stocks. This is reflected in the relatively steady level of net purchases by Japanese banks during the year which at Y1,120bn was only slightly lower than the Y1,273bn of 1991. That figure includes public funds invested through trust banks, and disguises the selling by banks attempting to streamline their strategic holdings in corporate customers. It is known that banks have sold some cross-holdings, while industrial companies have sold stakes in banks which were not their main bank. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, in its annual survey of trading on the three exchanges, said non-financial companies were net sellers of stocks worth Y905.8bn, compared with sales of Y1,861.9bn in 1991. Both figures are a turnround from net purchases of stocks, on the TSE first section alone, of Y776bn in 1990. Investment trusts, which sold a net Y1,515.6bn of securities in 1991, slowed their disposals last year to Y4.2bn net. The net sales of individual investors also slowed, falling from Y2,531bn to Y117bn last year. The 26.4 per cent fall in the Nikkei average last year left many individuals with unrealised losses on their stock portfolios, prompting them to sit on the shares until prices improve. However, life and non-life insurance companies, whose net purchases totalled Y234.8bn in 1991, posted net sales of Y64.6bn last year, while securities houses trading on their own account sold Y561bn in stocks, after net purchases of Y62.7bn in 1991. There was increased selling last year when the Tokyo average rose above 18,000 after the announcement of the August emergency package, suggesting that many investors are looking to offload stocks as soon as willing buyers reappear.</p>

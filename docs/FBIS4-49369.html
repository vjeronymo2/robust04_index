			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li </F> Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "The Chinese Military Meddles in  Policy Toward United States"]    [Text] In the 1990's, the world has entered the post-Cold  War period.    However, some people in the world constantly keep the Cold  War in mind, because they enjoyed certain advantages during the  Cold War.    They are none other than the CPC authorities.    Whenever a popularity crisis appeared, the CPC authorities  certainly made full use of the Cold War. They found their  number one enemy outside the country, and then solicited the  people's support by resorting to nationalism in order to solve  domestic crises.    At present, "mountains" of contradictions and difficulties  are accumulating in mainland China, as Hu Yaobang noted many  years ago. A major crisis has again appeared in terms of the  people's trust and support for the government.    In June last year, CHENG MING published an article which  said  that a hundred generals had submitted a petition to Deng  Xiaoping. It exclusively revealed that the CPC military required  the party leadership to revise its policy toward the United  States. After one year of preparation, the new policy option  was eventually adopted. This is related to the crisis of trust  and support for the regime among the people.    On 1 April this year, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat  held an extremely important meeting at the Great Hall of the  People in Beijing, which was attended by the secretaries and  propaganda chiefs of the party committees of all ministries,  state commissions, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions. The meeting was chaired by Hu Jintao. Ding Guangen  announced the work arrangements. Zhang Wannian, chief of the  general staff of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], also  delivered a speech at the meeting.    Hu Jintao first gave an assessment of the current domestic  and international situation on behalf of the Political Bureau.  Part of the speech was entitled "Changes in Sino-U.S.  Relations." Hu Jintao said:    The whole party and the whole Army should make full  preparations and should be more profoundly aware that Sino-U.S.  relations will not be in a normal state in the near future, in  the next few years, and even for a longer period to come, and  further worsening and confrontations may occur. According to  the global hegemonist strategy of the United States, its main  rival at present is the PRC. Interfering in China, subverting  the Chinese Government, and strangling China's development are  strategic principles pursued by the United States. While facing  hegemonism, power politics, and the aggressive anti-China  strategy pursued by the United States, we have no room for any  choices. We must sternly and explicitly tell the United States,  and declare to the world also, that the normalization and  development of relations between China and the United States can  only be made on the basis of the two joint communiques signed by  the two governments. The Chinese Government and the Chinese  people have not, do not, and will not tolerate any indiscreet  criticism or the wanton interference of hegemonism and power  politics in China's sovereignty and internal affairs. In the  world today, even if there is an impasse in Sino-U.S. relations,  China will still be able to develop further and enhance its  national strength at a rather high speed.    Ding Guangen gave a speech on this subject, and arranged  propaganda work around Sino-U.S. relations. His speech included  eight main points:    1. The anti-China strategy of the United States is aimed  at strangling China's socialism and reducing China to a vassal  state of the United States.    2. The United States is carrying out a series of  activities to interfere in, harass, and attack China in the  political, economic, and ideological fields and also in various  international organizations.    3. The United States is interfering in China's internal  affairs under the pretext of human rights, and it makes  judgments in terms of ideology. This is a subversive strategy.    4. The United States supports and uses hostile forces and  elements in China to carry out subversive and seditious  activities, create political incidents, and thus disrupt and  undermine our country's construction, reform, and social  stability.    5. The United States itself does not participate in  international human rights conventions of great importance and  does not implement relevant UN resolutions.    6. In the last 20 to 30 years, U.S. aggression against  other countries has caused destruction and millions of  casualties to the victim nations.    7. Racial discrimination, murder, violence, and drug  trafficking inside the United States have become serious  disasters for its own people, and all of these expose problems  with its system.    8. International opposition to hegemonism and power  politics has grown into a force. Safeguarding national  independence and self- determination and opposing foreign  interference and subversion has become an irresistible trend of  social development.    Chief of the General Staff Zhang Wannian made a speech  entitled, "Reinforcing the Army, Accelerating the Army's  Modernization, Firmly Opposing Interference and Subversion From  Hegemonism, and Defending the Motherland" on behalf of the Armed  Forces.    Zhang Wannian said: When facing blatant interference by the  U.S. hegemonists in our internal affairs and their open support  for the debilitating activities of hostile elements inside our  country and hostile forces outside the mainland and overseas  opposing and subverting our socialist system, we must reinforce  the Armed Forces more intensively by grasping the current  opportunity and accelerating the modernization and reform of the  three services according to Deng Xiaoping's line on  army-building and Chairman Jiang's instructions on the work of  the Central Military Commission. We should strengthen and  develop relations with all friendly countries in the world and  oppose international hegemonism and power politics. Any  hegemonist attempt to interfere and meddle in our state  sovereignty and the nation's internal affairs is intolerable,  and our national dignity can never be harmed by hegemonism and  colonialism. We shall not challenge other nations, but we must  keep our strength in order to defeat the challenge from  hegemonism and colonialism.    According to information from the General Office of the  CPC's  Central Military Commission [CMC], the General Staff  Headquarters and the Policy Research Office of the CMC have  worked out a plan to form a global anti-hegemonist,  anti-interference, antisubversion, and anti-aggression united  front to unite all countries and organizations willing to oppose  hegemonism and power politics for a certain period of time, and  the target is the United States. Reportedly, 23 to 25 countries  have expressed support for the proposal, and nearly 40 countries  have consented to a similar form of organization. The opinion  of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau is  that China should not be the leader of such an organization, but  should continue to promote the development of this trend,  because this will be conducive to its work. China will support  the idea in principle, but will wait for an opportune moment and  mature conditions.    In fact, the CPC authorities have long been preparing for an  adjustment in relations with the United States. As of last  March, leaders of the economic, financial, and foreign trade  departments of various provinces, and of some large  export-oriented enterprises, were organized to study documents  issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, and  the documents included: "Sino-U.S. Relations Remain Tense,"  "Developments and Problems in Sino-U.S. Relations," and "China's  Principled Position Against the U.S. Policy of Interference and  Subversion." The purpose is for dual preparations to be made  against a worsening of Sino-U.S. relations and for the adoption  of countermeasures against any rupture in Sino-U.S. relations.    It seems natural that such an important meeting should be  chaired by Hu Jintao, a member of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee and a member of the Central Secretariat in charge of  day-to-day work. However, it seems somewhat unreasonable that  the keynote speeches were given by Ding Guangen, the Political  Bureau member in charge of ideology, and Zhang Wannian, chief of  the general staff of the Armed Forces. Qian Qichen, the  Political Bureau member in charge of foreign affairs and vice  premier of the State Council, was excluded and did not attend  the meeting. In addition, the organs which submitted the  proposal to set up a global anti-hegemonist united front at an  opportune moment were not those responsible for foreign affairs,  but the General Staff Headquarters of the PLA and the CMC Policy  Research Office. This is rather unusual. Although it is  necessary to oppose interference from hegemonism in internal  affairs, why did this allow the interference of the military in  internal administrative affairs? All such "subtleties" remain  unclear for the time being, and a clearer picture will appear  after the further development of events.    Another noticeable point is that, at present, the CPC  authorities are adopting highhanded methods to repress  dissidents calling for political reforms, but this is not  supported by the masses. The CPC authorities now call  dissidents "hostile elements" who are supported by U.S.  hegemonists. It seems that the CPC authorities are trying to  link pro-democracy activists advocating political reforms with  the number-one enemy, the U.S. hegemonists, so that such  activities can be denounced as "traitorous" and the crisis of  domestic trust can be resolved. This shows the sinister nature  of their intentions.    It should also be mentioned here that in the current  post-Cold War period, the attempt to create and use the "Cold  War" to mitigate and divert the people's attention from domestic  contradictions was not invented first by the CPC authorities,  but by North Korea. Of course, relations between the CPC  authorities and North Korea are not good, but they may come into  good terms again in order to join hands to launch an anti-U.S.  campaign.    What should the United States do in facing this readjustment  of the CPC's U.S. policy? It would certainly be an unwise move  if the United States showed weakness and made concessions, and  it may also incur losses if it takes a hard-line policy against  the hard-line policy of the CPC, because its rival does not play  fairly according to the rules of the game. How they adjust  their China policy appropriately will be a great challenge and  test for the political wisdom of U.S. statesmen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Meeting on Paris Agreement"] </F>   [Text] The world has tried hard to return peace to  Cambodia, end the genocide among the Cambodian people  themselves, and persuade them to help each other to restore  their country. It appears, however, that the world is failing,  as evidenced by the continued fighting between the Cambodian  Government and the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, the trend will be  towards prolonged fighting if foreign arms are poured into the  country.    Thailand's view, which opposes arms being supplied from a  dozen countries for the Cambodian Government to fight the Khmer  Rouge, may carry little weight in light of repeated remarks by  Cambodian Government officials accusing Thailand of aiding the  Khmer Rouge. Though Thailand has not supported the Khmer Rouge  as accused, if those countries believe those accusations they  could provide funds and arms to the Cambodian Government as  requested.    We wish to tell the world, especially the countries involved  in the Paris agreement, that arms or financial support for any  Cambodian side will make peace in Cambodia, which really is not  that far away, completely impossible to achieve. The civil war  will continue with more Cambodians becoming victims.    We sympathize with King Sihanouk being discouraged by  disunity among the Cambodian people, which is causing peace to  be unattainable. Couple this unity problem with foreign arms  support -- so the Cambodians can kill each other, so that one  faction will gain outright victory -- will fuel incessant  fighting in Cambodia and endanger the region and the world.    We feel that if the superpowers really want peace to return  to Cambodia, they should avoid arms support for any Cambodian  faction. They should convene another meeting of the countries  involved in the Paris agreement to find a solution to the civil  war and forge national reconciliation for the Cambodian people  and eventually for their survival.    We wish to warn the Cambodian Government that to completely  subjugate the rival faction by war requires an overwhelming  superiority. In the interest of the future of the Cambodian  nation, national reconciliation must not be forged by continued  violence.</p>

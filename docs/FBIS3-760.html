			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with newly appointed administrator of </F> Bophuthatswana, Dr. Tjaard van der Walt, by Leslie Mashokwe on  the "Newsline" program in Mmabatho; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mashokwe] Dr. van der Walt,  which law applies in this country, the Bophuthatswana law?  Because Bophuthatswana seems to have faded away. What are we  dealing with here?    [Van der Walt] There is a very small distinction between the  laws of Bophuthatswana and South Africa. In many respects, the  laws of Bophuthatswana are more advanced than those of South  Africa. But to make it easy, those Bophuthatswana laws that is  not in a position to be a free and fair election will still  apply.    [Mashokwe] What are we dealing with here, Dr. van der Walt?  Please explain to me. Is Bophuthatswana still in place, but  the government administration has been removed? Therefore the  laws of Bophuthatswana are still in place, and Bophuthatswana is  still an entity, as it were.    [Van der Walt] I spoke to the chief justice this afternoon  and asked him to continue with the legal procedures as usual, so  all the normal Bophuthatswana laws are still in place, and we'd  like to do this as legally as possible. But there has been an  outcry. There has been a deep-felt concern from the people in  Bophuthatswana that they want to participate in the election.  So that's why I say those laws in Bophuthatswana that inhibit  free and fair political activity is null and void.    [Mashokwe] Are you saying to me the laws in South Africa  will  now apply in Bophuthatswana, which is independent?    [Van der Walt] No specific law will apply there.    [Mashokwe] You don't need a parliament or anything to ratify  the [word indistinct] of the policies, the new governor, new  administer to somehow come in with all [word indistinct]?    [Van der Walt] Because of the agreement between the two  defense forces, and because of the fact that Bophuthatswana  Defense Force requested us to come in here, and because I've got  to (?read) reality, I value human life, human quality of life,  I'll remain within the confines of the law as far as humanely  possible in that sense, even to the niceties, but at this stage  the priority is to get the country moving once again.    [Mashokwe] Let's elaborate on moving once again. When are  people going back to work?    [Van der Walt] Tomorrow.    [Mashokwe] Have they been informed?    [Van der Walt] Yes, we requested them to go back. I had  discussions with senior civil servants. I meet a delegation  again tonight. I'll be speaking to civil servants again  tomorrow at nine. I had discussions with leaders of the public.  So we call on the civil servants and people in public to go  back to work as normal, and we will address their grievances.  But by all means, let this part of South Africa get moving once  again. And in that sense, let's say: Make what Bophuthatswana  has achieved in the past 16 years still alive and an asset for  the Province North-West.    [Mashokwe] Okay, the people of Bophuthatswana Broadcasting  Corporation, for instance, have been fired--all of them--lock,  stock, and barrel. Are they going to be reemployed and going  back to their posts tomorrow?    [Van der Walt] Yes indeed, and that applies to all civil  servants. My government will guarantee their salary, their  pension, their possessions. Whether they've been fired or not  in all departments. Secondly, we're urgently looking at parity  because, in quite a number of ways, Bophuthatswana is lagging  behind South Africa. Of course, this will take a bit of time,  so the civil servants at least can expect this month their  normal pay. Next month, we'll have had time to look at the  situation so that we can be all equal -- equal work, equal pay.    [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand this: They demanded 50  percent increase or they will strike. Are you saying you'll  give that to them come the first of May. You'll only have a  government of what, like 30 days after the [word indistinct].    [Van der Walt] Yes, we're meeting with them. Indeed there  are certain structures within the civil service who are 50  percent behind salaries, not only in the Republic of South  Africa, but in Transkei, Venda, and Ciskei. So what we want to  have is parity, equality. We will deal with each case with the  greatest responsibility and in closest consultation.    [Mashokwe] Are you talking of addressing....[pauses] Talking  of parity, Dr. van der Walt, is it going to be backdated? --  because parity that these people are looking for does not date  from the first of April or the first of May. They say other  civil servants in South Africa were given these increases years  ago, months ago. How are you going to deal with that?    [Van der Walt] I'm not a one-man-show. I have committees  working with this kind of thing, but I'd like to assure the  people that we'll see that justice is being done. I can't go  into the details. I do refer to the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting  Corporation, the remnants of the board, and unfortunately quite  often when you deal with structures here I've got to speak about  the remnants. They met this afternoon. They assured me that they  hoped to be on the air, television and radio, by 1100 tomorrow,  and then we'll have the possibility of direct communication with  the broader public. So our priority is to go back to work  normal. There is still communication, because that was a serious  problem in the past, and then we move ahead.    [Mashokwe] The chairman, is he still chairman, the son of  the  president?    [Van der Walt] No, he is out.    [Mashokwe] Is he out? What about the oldies, the pensioners  who haven't been paid? They are hungry sitting over there and  complaining?    [Van der Walt] We've got to get....[pauses] Our priorities  is  this way; deal with the bigger picture, see what we can do with  the general structure, and then the sooner we can look at  individual cases we'll do that, but I urgently ask people to be  patient at this stage. We referred earlier to political  rallies, et cetera, et cetera. My urgent plea would be, be calm;  Justice Kriegler will give us a program. Give us time to put  those things in order, and may I say I'm very happy that Mr.  Mandela already responded to our serious call to postpone his  coming here for at least a day. All political leaders are  welcome, but at this stage it is a risk to have a rally or  demonstration or mass meeting.    [Mashokwe] He's not coming tomorrow then. When is he coming?    [Van der Walt] He's not coming tomorrow. At this [word  indistinct] preliminary on Tuesday. My personal wish would be  just give us a little more time.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Tjaart van der Walt thanks for talking to us,  and thanks for your time.    [Van der Walt] Thank you very much. It's a privilege, and  let's do something to make Bophuthatswana an asset for the new  South Africa.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Mitsubishi and Aiwa to expand in S E Asia MITSUBISHI Motors, the car manufacturer, and Aiwa, the electronics manufacturer, are to increase production in south-east Asia. The announcement yesterday highlights a trend among Japanese companies to move production to the region. Mitsubishi Motors said it would expand capacity at its plants in Malaysia and Thailand, while Aiwa said it would increase investment in Malaysia and Singapore. The moves reflect the two companies' expectations of substantial growth in the south-east Asian market in coming years. However, it will also help both companies overcome pressures on their profits. Their industries have been most severely hurt by the domestic Japanese slump and the rise of the yen. Mitsubishi is expanding annual capacity in Malaysia from 120,000 to 150,000 vehicles. In Thailand, it is plannig to raise capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 by 1995. Aiwa, which expects to see pre-tax profits fall by 40-50 per cent in the year to March, is planning to increase production in Singapore where it will expand its three factories.</p>

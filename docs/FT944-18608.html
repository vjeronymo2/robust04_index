			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Trouble down on the farm: As the EU expands eastwards, Alison Maitland and Deborah Hargreaves examine the need to reform the CAP The European Commission has moved beef and grain mountains, but further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is an altogether more painful prospect. This did not stop the Commission last week publishing a report by an independent panel of experts calling for such reforms. The Commission distanced itself, officially, from the report's conclusions - produced by experts from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the UK - and watched as a wave of protests by farmers confirmed their resistance to further CAP reform. But it is clear that the report will be used by factions within the Commission to stimulate debate on an overhaul. The farming industry is still trying to absorb the shock of sweeping reforms brokered by Mr Ray MacSharry, former agriculture commissioner, two years ago. But many farmers privately acknowledge that further reforms are inevitable if the European Union is to meet its commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its ambitions to enlarge eastwards. The enormous burden of the CAP on the European consumer and taxpayer is also a powerful argument for reform. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the CAP cost each person in the EU Dollars 385 last year. This cost represents an average subsidy of Dollars 15,400 for each full-time agricultural worker, or Dollars 980 per hectare of farmland. The extent of these subsidies has become transparent as part of the MacSharry reforms under which farmers are paid direct compensation for the price cuts and the idle land they have to endure. There is nothing unusual about this scale of support. Indeed, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia, all OECD countries subsidise their agriculture heavily. But world farming markets are about to change, with the scheduled entry into force of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement early next year. Many farm experts, including the UK's National Farmers' Union, are unconvinced by the Commission's assurances that the 1992 reforms will be enough to meet the required cut in the volume of subsidised EU exports under the Gatt deal. Indeed, debate over the future of the CAP was sparked in the UK six months ago by an NFU study presenting members with stark choices over the future of farm policy. The sceptics argue that reductions in price support - together with 'set-aside', under which 15 per cent of arable land is taken out of cultivation - will be insufficient to offset annual increases in output of cereals per hectare. They expect beef production, too, to exceed the Gatt limits for subsidised exports by the end of the decade. Such constraints, the NFU argues, will present farmers with a tough choice before 2000: either production controls will have to be strengthened, or price support through intervention, the cardinal component of the CAP, will have to be abandoned. But the freeing of trade, which will expose EU farmers to greater competition, is not the only threat to the cosy world of the CAP. While Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden's accession to the EU next year should be broadly neutral financially, the eventual absorption of prospective members from central and east Europe poses an enormous challenge. Eventually their farming industries could be fiercely competitive, but they are currently in severe decline because of the loss of traditional markets in the former Soviet Union and the collapse of state distribution systems. The EU is committed to bringing these nations into the fold. In Germany, the most fervent advocate of enlargement to the east, there is growing political recognition that this expansion would involve a re-examination of the CAP. Agriculture officials in Brussels are drawing up plans this autumn to help get east Europe's farm sector back onto its feet. They have a tough task, given the conflict between the EU's desire to prevent political unrest in the east and its concern to protect its own farmers. Yet extending the CAP to east Europe would be beyond the resources of the EU. An overstretched CAP budget was one of the driving forces behind the MacSharry reforms. It could re-emerge as a pressure point in its own right, long before the accession of the first central European countries. Commission officials say inflationary pressures are building up which could break the spending ceiling next year. This could bring renewed calls for a renationalisation of the farm budget as suggested in last week's CAP report. But such pressure will be resisted by many governments and farm groups. Tied into the budget debate are growing public demands in northern Europe for farming to be kinder to the environment, such as using fewer chemical inputs. Environmental measures were built into the 1992 reforms for the first time. But this has only encouraged lobbyists to push for all payments to farmers to be tied to their adopting 'green' practices. Together these forces add up to a compelling case for overhauling the CAP. Yet among the Commission's agriculture officials there is a striking public reticence to debate the issue. Mr Rene' Steichen, the outgoing agriculture commissioner who has presided over implementation of the MacSharry reforms, says it would be wrong to create fresh uncertainty in the farming community when the reforms are working so well. He cites falling production - this year's EU harvest is forecast at 160m tonnes compared with 185m tonnes in 1991 - and drops of 52 per cent and 77 per cent repectively in the grain and beef mountains over the past year. Mr Steichen would like to see cuts in the high level of compensation paid to the best-off farmers for setting land aside. This compensation level was conceded by the Commission in 1992 only under pressure from the farm lobbies. He is also working on changes to sectors left untouched in 1992, such as wine. But provided these reforms prove effective, he says, 'I don't think there's a need to change the CAP.' Mr Steichen's view is not shared by all of his Commission colleagues as last week's CAP report shows. The report was ordered by officials in the Commission's economics and financial affairs directorate as a way of encouraging discussion on CAP reform. However, many EU members are also hesitant about broaching farm reform. Any suggestion that the 1992 reforms might be insufficient to meet the Gatt commitments could risk a trade dispute with the US in the run-up to ratification of the Uruguay Round accords. Moreover, agreement to the agricultural part of the Gatt deal was wrung from France in exchange for a commitment by the Commission not to increase the level of set-aside without full compensation. The French say the exclusion of small EU farmers from set-aside has left their big grain producers bearing 40 per cent of the total burden of set-aside. The lack of political will for further reform may also be linked partly to the forthcoming elections in Germany and France. Given these conflicts, it will be difficult to make even mild changes to the CAP, such as deeper cuts in support prices, without extra compensation for farmers that would overstretch the budget. Tacitly, the need for a new approach to the CAP in the light of the east Europe issue is acknowledged at the Commission. The issue is likely to be back on the agenda in 1996 when the enlargement debate will be more pressing. But ideas for far-reaching reform, such as paying farmers a one-off lump sum in exchange for abolishing all support, appear to be out of line with Brussels' thinking. UK officials, serving a government that says it would ultimately like the 37-year-old CAP abolished, argue that the policy's staying power cannot be underestimated. 'It has never collapsed under the weight of its contradictions,' said one. Indeed, the MacSharry reforms have arguably given it a longer lease of life by making it easier to adjust price support, set-aside levels and compensation while leaving the system's foundations intact. Mr MacSharry is convinced the CAP will still be in place in 2010. 'I see a fine-tuning but no revolutionary change,' he said. 'There's no doubt that while there will be a European Union there will be a CAP.'</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Murdoch to set up Indian TV company Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday announced plans to set up Star India, a separate television company in India, to augment his Hong Kong-based Star TV. Mr Murdoch, who met Mr Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, ruled out any interest in Indian print media. However, he is keen to expand his Star TV operations in India, which, with an estimated 60m viewers, has emerged as Star's largest market since China closed its doors on the network. Mr Murdoch attributes his interest in India to the fact that the country guarantees media freedom and there is great potential for advertising revenue. The new company would be set up within a year, and be controlled by News Corporation. 'We will be looking for investments with leading film and software producers in India. And one day, we will build our own major studios here,' he said. Soon after he had acquired the controlling stake in Star TV in July last year, Mr Murdoch bought 49.9 per cent of Asia Today, a Bombay-based company which transmits Zee, a Hindi language channel transmitted alongside Star's five channels. Mr Murdoch also expressed keenness to start separate regional language channels, including one in Hindi. Mr Murdoch is using his week-long visit to Delhi and Bombay to meet ministers, MPs, politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists. This week, he met President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and Mr Lal Krishan Advani, the president of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata party, besides Mr Rao. Mr Rao cautioned that Indian society was very unlike the west, and that Mr Murdoch's broadcasting needed to take that into account. 'The Indian government has welcomed Mr Murdoch very warmly, but he must realise that this does not mean he has a carte blanche to do what he likes here,' said an official in the prime minister's office. The government, which accepted Mr Murdoch's gift of Dollars 10,000 to the prime minister's National Relief Fund yesterday, has not been very happy with Star's increasing audience - an estimated 10,000 households are added every day in India - which undermines the influence of Doordarshan, the state-owned network.</p>

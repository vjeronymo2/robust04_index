			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: The Browning Version - Theatre At the Greenwich Theatre on Monday the audience took Terence Rattigan's best-known play as a sour comedy, decidedly less heart-wrenching than its reputation. It is debatable whether Philip Franks' smooth production diminished it, or merely cut it down to its true size. As you surely remember, The Browning Version is about a miserable couple, poor Crocker-Harris - a desiccated classics master at a public school - and his wife, the thoroughly monstrous Millie. In a well-made single act (followed at Greenwich by a cabaret instead of Rattigan's purpose-built Harlequinade) 'the Crock', facing a pensionless early retirement, is inordinately moved when his pupil Taplow makes him a farewell gift of Browning's verse-translation of the Agamemnon. In one way and another, that precipitates everything else: the wreck of the marriage, the wreck of Millie's affair with a reluctant young science master, the cauterising of the Crock's last shreds of feeling. Frightfully English, all this; and the old stiff-upper-lip premises are slightly blurred at Greenwich. Tim Matthews has a passable public-school accent as young Taplow, but his manners suggest Adrian Mole; likewise the clean-cut, decent science master is warmly played by James Larkin, but in the vein of Peter Davison's non-hero in the redbrick A Very Peculiar Practice - really too 'slack' for Rattigan's period. We needed more sense of a rigid institutional cramp, of an airless social order where any unguarded admission of feeling must be an infra dig embarrassment. The Crocker-Harrises, Clive Merrison and Diana Hardcastle, have - unusually]  -something in common: their frank theatricality. Merrison's 'Crock', finely detailed and believable, savours his convoluted, pedantic lines with a relish that belies Rattigan's intended dead soul. Nobody as resiliently, narcissistically verbal as that is going to wring our withers much. Miss Hardcastle plays Millie in two or three bright but inconsistent modes; her arch, eye-rolling school temptress, her melodramatic fury upon rejection, and her cruelly plain truth-telling - which has to deliver the final kidney-punch - never quite add up to one character. Rattigan's dramatic mechanism is far too well-oiled and 'natural' to betray any clanks or creaks, but much of the writing falls dully on the ear. Though I have not seen or read the play these many years, I found myself completing the actors' lines in advance, correctly, again and again. There are orotund cliches even when the chips are meant to be down and cold hearts bared. Across from me there was a gaggle of fifth- or sixth-formers, who laughed a lot and seemed to find the school-ritual manners utterly alien; a review by them would have been much more interesting than this one.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRVING JUGGLES 'CHRONICLES' AND A CRADLE  </P> <P> Amy Irving wasn't sure she wanted to return to the stage less than five months  after giving birth, but the producers made her a deal she couldn't refuse.  </P> <P> "My initial instinct was to say, 'No, I want to stay home with the ba" said the  actress during break from Wendy Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "The  Heidi Chronicles."  </P> <P> As she spoke, she cradled 4 1/2-month-old Gabriel, her son with Brazilian  director Bruno Barreto. Barreto directed Irving's recent film "Show of Force."  </P> <P> The Ahmanson Theater, which is presenting "The Heidi Chronicles," arranged for  a nursery next to Irving's dressing room and found rehearsal space near the  home of her mother, actress Priscilla Pointer.  </P> <P> In addition, they slated rehearsals around the kindergarten schedule of  Irving's 5-year-old son, Max, from her marriage to Steven Spielberg.  </P> <P> The production runs through Dec. 23 at the UCLA James A. Doolittle Theater in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Irving plays the character Heidi Holland during the years 1965-1989. Heidi is  an art historian and feminist who finds her beliefs challenged by the changing  times.  </P></p>

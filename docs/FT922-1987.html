			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Observer: All aboard How long should a non-executive director sit on the board of a major company? Sir John Hoskyns, who has almost finished revamping his Burton board, says that three years is 'absurdly short' while five to seven years, is 'optimum'. After that there is a danger that a director loses his impartiality by getting too close to the company. Since Sir John took over the Burton chair in November 1990 he has behaved like a model corporate citizen. The management team has been completely overhauled, the finances have been stabilised - thanks to last year's rights issue - and he has recruited an impressive array of non-executive directors. Yesterday, Whitbread's Peter Jarvis, and Caroline Marland, deputy managing director of The Guardian, were added to a list of non-execs which includes Bats' Brian Garraway and John Brown, an old property hand. Not only is their arrival another sign that Burton is over the worst but it means that whatever else the company lacks it will not be short of expert advice. But the presence of the new faces is yet another reminder that Mark Littman and Ladislas Rice, the last of the old Burton non-executive guard, have long since passed their sell-by date.</p>

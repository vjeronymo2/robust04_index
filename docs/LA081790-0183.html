			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COLLINS KNOCKS OUT CHIRINO -- BUT DON'T CALL HIM A PUNCHER  </P> <P> Steve Collins of Ireland doesn't want to get a reputation as a puncher because  of his knockout victory over Furmin Chirino in a WBO middleweight match.  </P> <P> "I'm punching harder, and tonight I proved I can punch when I have to," Collins  said after Thursday's KO. "But I'm not going to be labeled a puncher. I'm still  a boxer."  </P> <P> Collins knocked out Chirino, who is from Venezuela, in the sixth round of the  fight after pummeling him early on.  </P> <P> With the victory, Collins lifted his record to 17-1 (with seven KOs) and earned  the right to fight the winner of this Saturday's Iran Barkley-Nigel Benn match  for the WBO middleweight title.  </P></p>

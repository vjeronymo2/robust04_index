			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Exclusive Rafale Report: </F> What Flight Tests Revealed; the New MICA and Apache Missiles;  and Electronic Countermeasures"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Despite the budget-imposed slowdown in testing, the  Rafale program is moving ahead with development of the  multitarget electron-scanning radar, RBE2; SPECTRA  countermeasures; and Rafale weapons that include new-generation  MICA missiles and an Apache cruise missile.    The decision to place the aircraft carrier Foch on alert  status has interrupted sea testing of the Rafale M01 and M02.  Plans had called for catapult launches and decklandings of heavy  configuration aircraft in maneuvers similar to those begun at  the Lakehurst base in the United States (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1455). A  demonstration to Fleet Air Arm personnel of the Rafale's good  maintainability was also scheduled. The two prototypes did  manage to complete 10 catapult launches and decklandings before  the time out was called.    The testing reschedule will force program officials to  revise  the fighter's development timetable. Earlier plans had called  for a half-year halt in the M01 prototype's development after  completion of sea testing on the Foch at month's end, to comply  with the government's decision to delay the Rafale's operational  start-of-service date by six months. Barring any new changes  brought about by the next military appropriations bill, the Air  Force does not expect to take delivery of the first production  Rafale (a "B") until late summer of 1997. The Fleet Air Arm will  receive a Rafale M in early 1998 and should have a fleet up and  running by mid-1999.    The government officially proposed putting the brakes on the  Rafale program for budget reasons when it presented its draft  budget to Parliament. That bill eliminated 2 billion French  francs [Fr] in appropriations that had been slated for the  program as a whole in 1994. Industrialization and mass  production phases have been stretched out, and development work  slowed, as a result.    Work to research, prepare, and fabricate production tools  will be staggered, as will the study and manufacture of the  assembly-line test benches needed to industrialize equipment  such as flight control systems.    The manufacture of production aircraft and associated  equipment will also be spread out over a longer period. SNECMA  will deliver just one engine in 1996, instead of the eight  originally planned, followed by another 11 in 1997.    In terms of development work, officials have agreed to delay  the flight of the M01 prototype for six months, as soon as the  round of sea testing is over. Moreover, the appropriations' cut  will make it impossible to conduct all the research and test  work to integrate equipment and weapons that had been planned  for this year. This directly affects development of the  navigation and attack system, including the RBE2. The Rafale A  demonstrator, which made its maiden flight in July, 1986,  completed its flights last month after effecting a total of 867  test missions.    Despite the delay--which is more financially than  technically  motivated--Rafale has not lost its lead over European rivals. It  is still ahead of both the Eurofighter 2000, grounded for  fly-by-wire control problems, and Saab's JAS-39 Gripen, which  was first flummoxed by similiar bugs in its fly-by-wire control  system and is now unable to fly because its RM12 engine lost  compressor blades. The four French prototypes are flying,  including the last two (B02 and M02), which made their maiden  flights in the first half of 1993.    The Rafale program made several major strides in 1993,  including the completion of three Navy Rafale test rounds (two  in the U.S. and one on the Foch aircraft carrier). Essential  technical milestones included the firing of Giat Industries  30-mm M791 gun; the first launch of Matra's Magic II  self-defense air-to-air missile on 26 March; and the first  flight of Thomson-CSF's and Dassault Electronique's RBE2  electron-scanning radar aboard a Rafale B01 on 7 July. In  addition, the program's static test cell completed its first  phase of endurance tests--involving the equivalent of 10,000  flight hours, 3,000 catapult launches, and 3,000  decklandings--at the Toulouse Aeronautical Test Center [CEAT].    This year the Rafale program will concentrate on continued  testing of weapons systems and of the navigation and attack  system (NAS). The trials will be conducted on both the Rafale  B01 and M01, and on aircraft of the Flight Test Center (see  boxed material). The NAS is built around two Sagem Sigma RL 90  gyrolaser inertial units, plus a Dassault Electronique mission  computer that employs new technologies such as RISC (reduced  instruction set computer) processors and ASIC (application  specific integrated circuit) components. To allow for even more  precise navigation, the NAS is equipped with a GPS receiver  (incorporating a Sextant avionics receiver) for satellite  navigation, a laser telemeter, and a Thomson-CSF AHV 17 digital  radio-altimeter that can also correlate with the computer data  of a digitized terrain. Finally, engineers will continue testing  of the RBE2 electron-scanning radar, and begin trials involving  SPECTRA electronic countermeasures and Sextant  Avionique/Intertechnique's helmet-mounted sight. The latter is a  real sight that displays flight and attack symbols to the pilot,  enabling him/her to designate targets automatically with a  simple motion of the head.    Acceptance flights for Thomson-CSF's protected  radiocommunications system will also continue. The Saturn  (Second Generation Antijam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO) is still  compatible with current "Have Quick II" devices, despite its use  of very fast frequency-evasion and coding techniques. The same  manufacturer is also developing classic V/UHFs, a new Tacan NC  12E, and a new TLS 2000 approach and landing-assistance unit  that incorporates ILS/MLS and VOR/DME functions.    Weapons will be an important part of test runs. The Rafale's  14 carry mounts (13 for the Navy version) will initially enable  it to carry 6 metric tons of external load, a figure that will  increase to 8 for the last standards. Five of the mounts are  considered "wet"; that is, they can hold additional 1,250 or  2,000 liter tanks. Rafale's weaponry will gradually be put into  service in accordance with the fighter's standards. The first,  so-called SU0 "air-to-air" standard (user standard 0) involves a  mix of Magic II and Mica (electromagnetic version) missiles,  plus 1,250 and 2,000 liter tanks in three configurations. The  second "SU1" standard features the previous configurations plus  five new ones: three "air-to-air" configurations employing  infrared Mica missiles instead of Magics (with electromagnetic  versions under the fuselage and wing unit as well); and two  "air-to-surface" configurations featuring AS 30 L laser-guided  missiles (including a laser-designation nacelle) or Apache  cruise missiles. The final "SU2" standard involves a new  "air-to-air" configuration (interchangeable infrared or  electromagnetic Micas) and several "air-to-surface" ones that  include an array of classic bombs, laser-guided bombs (LGB), and  ASMP nuclear missiles or their successor.  <H5>  Boxed Material: Over 1,560 Flight Hours for the M88 Engines </H5>   Development of the Rafale engine is proceeding on time and  within costs. Everyone involved in the program--collaborating  manufacturers, official departments, and user armies--agrees  that the motors are performing as expected. To date, nine  development and 13 aircraft engines have logged in more than  6,800 hours of operation.    The program's 13 "flight-worthy" engines have racked up over  1,560 hours of flight, nearly 500 of them with afterburning.  "With two years to go before final qualification, these results  show the maturity and availability of the M88," says Jean  Mossot, the program's director at SNECMA. Since the 1992  qualification test (the so-called "T" trial) that showed the  engine was already performing very close to specifications,  several improvements have been made to the M88. The first is the  development of an anti-icing (as opposed to de-icing) and  corresponding control system on the inlet guide blade of the  adjustable, low-pressure compressor. The system automatically  regulates an air bleed blade that opens and closes as a function  of engine speed and air temperature. Tests on the CEPr (the  DGA's powerplant test center in Saclay) icing bench have  established its programming law. It is very important that the  Rafale have an engine with an adjustable inlet guide blade. By  regulating the air intake as a function of engine speed and  aircraft incidence, the guide blade boosts pumping margins,  enabling the M88 intakes to more easily absorb the enormous air  distortions created by Rafale's rapid travel.    Another enhancement involved substituting the composite  material PMR15 for the titanium used to make the cold duct (that  is, the engine's outer envelope). Engine weight dropped 4 kilos,  and 50 hours of endurance tests and flight  experiments--including an aircraft simulation campaign that  involved 50 simulated catapult launches and  decklandings--demonstrated that the duct's performance was  excellent. Engineers are now thinking about eliminating the  large vent line of the intershaft ventilation system, also to  trim engine weight and manufacturing costs. The long tube, which  runs the entire outside length of the PC channel, would be  replaced by a duct running directly into the PC channel.    The other improvements underway have to do with afterburning  (3-percent increase in efficiency) and control of the engine,  which is in final development phases. Redundant full-authority  digital engine control (FADEC) optimizes engine regulation  without pilot intervention and handles maintenance tasks.    Finally, technicians are still running endurance and aging  tests to validate life and reliabiilty projections. Scheduled  for completion before the qualification that will conclude the  M88's development phase (late 1995), the tests will include a  sand ingestion trial, a 700-hour endurance test conducted by  Techspace Aero, and a 150-hour endurance test in a high-altitude  simulator. Moreover, Jean Mossot's team must also devise methods  for assessing various engine risks such as compressor stalling  and chamber or afterburner shutdown. These are needed to cover  the operation of an "extreme" engine, should the mass  manufacturing under preparation produce one.    Indeed, SNECMA has already received an initial order for  eight mass-produced engines, the first of which will be  delivered in December 1996. The enginemaker is putting together  initial industrialization contracts, readying supplies for long  cycles, and conducting its first discussions with suppliers. At  the same time, it is drafting a production plan to select SNECMA  plants and subcontractors and establish a quality-control scheme  based on the new concept of "concurrent engineering."  <H5>  Boxed Material: CEV's Four Flying Test Benches </H5>   Development of the Rafale and its weapons system is a major  activity for the General Weapons Delegation's Flight Test Center  (CEV). The program requires a permanent fleet of four flying  test benches, a fleet of 10 other utility craft, new playback  and flight path analysis devices, and several simulators. It  also utilizes dozens of highly-skilled specialists (mechanical,  computer, and electronics engineers), who, in just a few hours,  can set up a complex rig on an aircraft or fix a programming  bug. CEV, which is headed by general engineer Herve Groualle,  has spent 20 to 25 percent of its time on the Rafale since  testing of the fighter began.    The four Rafale prototypes now flying will log in  approximately 2,450 missions before development of the fighter  and its weapons systems is complete. Over 2,000 of those  missions will be test flights, including 190 inspection flights  made by official departments and 175 by the two user branches of  the armed forces. Prototype test flights are meant to help  develop the platform and check its flight qualities (25 percent  of flights), navigation and attack system (56 percent of  flights), and various mounts and weapons/tank separation (19  percent of flights). Finally, additional flights (800 or so)  will be performed to develop the M88-2 engines and the Mica and  Apache missiles weapons.    Together with the 2,450 test missions, most of which will be  flown by Dassault-Aviation test pilots, the CEV will make nearly  5,000 other flights on its own aircraft. Over 2,000 will be  aimed at fine tuning weapons system equipment; another 2,800  will be classified as "ancillary" flights. "Decoy" aircraft, for  instance, will be set up to check the multitarget capability of  the RBE2 radar, and acceptance flights will be made for small  pieces of equipment such as the radio, GPS navigation, or  digital links.    To develop the weapons system that constitutes the bulk of  the Rafale program (the RBE2 radar and SPECTRA defense system),  CEV has four specially-altered airplanes. Indeed, engineers had  to add a Mil-Std 1553 (Rafale standard) bus to the digibus  (Mirage 2000 standard) of these aircraft, which consist of three  Mystere 20s and a Mirage 2000B each of which averages 80 flights  a year. SPECTRA will be developed on the M02 prototype. But  before that, the CEV will try it out on a Mystere 20 that will  fly in 1994, once the SPECTRA system now on a CEV integration  bench in Bretigny is ready. The other equipment, notably the  three RBE2 radars, is already flying on two other Mystere 20s  and a Mirage 2000B. A new Mirage 2000B, nicknamed "Bob" (a  two-seater, optronic bench), is being put into service to test  FSO (front sector optronics) components. Its flights compliment  those of another Mystere 20 that has been specially equipped to  conduct optronics research.    All these test flights aim to develop equipment and  software.  In the case of the radar, for instance, they verify that the  sensor operates properly and that signal processing is accurate.  The flights also validate such essential functions as air-to-air  tracking, telemetry, navigation, and guidance, as well as the  identification and memory storage of databases, such as those  containing navigational terrain pictures.    Finally, CEV has eight other aircraft in service to develop  weaponry. They are: one Mystere 20 and two Mirage 2000s to  develop Micas, and five others to develop the Apache cruise  missile; a Puma (radar resetting); an AlphaJet (TRI 60 engine);  a Mystere 20 (radioaltimeter); a Mirage 2000 (engine and fuel);  and a 2000N for separation and firing tests.    But in addition to aircraft, the Center employs three test  facilities in its work. Bretigny houses the flying test benches;  Istres features the four Rafales and the simulation benches that  are vital to preparing complex trials and "playing back"  flights; and Cazaux hosts the weapons tests. All these  facilities had to modernize their test rigs and acquire new ones  to adapt to the Rafale. Remote sensing is now coded (it used to  be possible to pick up aircraft display images on your TV set!),  and the aircraft have high-density Schlumberger recorders used  by NASA for its shuttles. Likewise, more powerful flight path  analysis devices are being installed. One based on differential  GPS and a multistate system can monitor the flight paths of  several moving objects. Finally, CEV is also renovating its  equipment for monitoring radar and infrared signatures. It will  be putting into service Dassault Electronique's "Hyper Brahms"  system--a more refined version of the current Brahms system for  measuring RCS (radar cross section)--as well as the CSEE's and  Steria's "Hyper Cerbere" for measuring infrared signature.</p>

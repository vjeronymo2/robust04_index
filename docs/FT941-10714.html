			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 5% rise to Pounds 151m at WMI Waste Management International, the aggressive UK-quoted arm of the US group WMX Technologies, yesterday signalled its intention to rein in the acquisition programme which has underpinned its growth in a difficult market. Mr Nigel Wilson, finance director, said the company intended to focus on organic growth in east Asia, rather than on expansion through acquisition in Latin America or a more difficult Europe. 'The opportunities there are coming much more quickly than expected,' Mr Wilson said. Between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m had been set aside for acquisitions, against Pounds 170m last year. Total capital investment was also being sharply curtailed, from Pounds 400m to Pounds 275m. The purchase of 48 companies was largely responsible for the group's 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 150.9m for the year to end-December. Sales rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 941.4m. On a like-for-like basis, however, sales were 6 per cent lower. The UK had returned the strongest performance, partly due to the joint venture with Wessex Water and the cost benefits from acquis-itions. WMI suffered a downturn in sales in Italy, where political problems were holding up approvals for landfill sites. Mr Wilson said he was confident that WMI would see some organic growth in Europe this year, in spite of the current economic difficulties. Legislation was creating new opportunities in France and Germany, he added. In the fourth quarter, WMI reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.9m to Pounds 40.5m, due to a turnround in interest. WMI paid Pounds 1.9m, against a gain of Pounds 6.9m. Sales were 12 per cent up at Pounds 250.6m. In line with previous policy, there is no dividend. Annual earnings per share increased from 23.3p to 26.5p. COMMENT WMI is taking the logical step of pulling itself away from a stagnant continental Europe. Yet while east Asia holds great promise, it is not expected to have a significant impact in the short term. Forecasts are for Pounds 166m this year, leaving a prospective p/e of 23.2. This looks more than up with events at the moment, although further out the focus on east Asia may prove more attractive. Perhaps the board will even reward shareholders with a dividend payment next year. See International Companies</p>

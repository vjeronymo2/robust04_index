			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Pounds 1.25bn UK package for Pretoria Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, yesterday ann-ounced a Pounds 1.25bn 'trade support and assistance package' to South Africa, which he described as the largest such facility offered by any country since the South African elections. The bulk of the package had been available before Mr Heseltine's visit to South Africa earlier this month, in the form of Export Credit Guarantee Department cover, ECGD officials said. The package also included Dollars 60m of bilateral aid and Pounds 30m channelled through the European Union. A further Pounds 10m will be made available through the Commonwealth Development Corporation. Mr Heseltine also announced the launch of a training scheme for entrepreneurs from Johannesburg's Soweto township. Under the scheme, to be known as the Soweto Initiative, the entrepreneurs will join British companies for periods of several months and be trained in management and other skills. Participating companies include Rolls-Royce, Samuel Montagu and Wimpey. The scheme will be funded partly by the Commonwealth Development Corporation and partly by private organisation. Mr Heseltine, who returned recently from a six-day visit to South Africa, said: 'Having witnessed at first hand the ideas bubbling up within the Sowetan business community, the drive, selling capabilities and sheer enthusiasm of Sowetan entrepreneurs, we on the mission decided that we could and should do something to help.' 'These are the business leaders of tomorrow - now is the time to forge friendships and partnerships with them.' Mr Heseltine was accompanied by 57 British businessmen on his trip. Up to Dollars 500m of business could come to British companies from South Africa as a result of the trade mission, said DTI officials. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: Still too many variations for global harmonisation / A look at at the continuing diversity of international accounting and auditing practice NUMBERS MAY not have quite the same visual power as drawings, but a recently published reference work is probably the nearest thing yet to the accountants' equivalent of an atlas of the world. The third edition of international accounting and auditing trends from the US-based Centre for International Financial Analysis and Research (Cifar) runs to 1,200 pages over two volumes in its portrayal of a widely varying global pattern. Perhaps the most impressive effort of the study is an exercise in re-stating companies' accounts according to different standards to highlight this variation. German and Japanese figures, it says, tend to under-report earnings and book values because of accelerated depreciation policies and unrestricted provisions. Recalculating the figures of several companies from each country according to standards recommended by Cifar, German businesses' net income rises on average by 44 per cent, book value by 41 per cent and the price/earnings ratio falls 35 per cent. For Japanese businesses, the corresponding figures are increases of 12 per cent and 14 per cent, and a decline of 42 per cent respectively. That pattern is borne out by the stated comparatives provided in a relatively small number of accounts - most notably those publishing under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) alongside those of their own country. For example, SmithKline Beecham reports net income of Pounds 638m under UK and Pounds 474m under US GAAP for 1991. The figures for shareholders' equity are Pounds 743m and Pounds 4,113m respectively. Volvo reports net income of (Kronor) SKr682m under Swedish and Skr816m under US GAAP, with shareholders' equity of Skr33,864m and Skr29,494m respectively. For an average of eight Japanese electronics companies which reported purely under Japanese accounting standards, operating margins were 6.31 per cent and price/earnings 41.42. For another comparable group which also provided figures under US GAAP, the recast numbers were 9.03 per cent and 26.33. But these analyses are not easy, partly because of questions over the 'neutral' standards by which the numbers are normalised, and partly because the level of disclosure and treatment of figures in companies' accounts varies tremendously between different countries. Based on its databases and a collection of some 25,000 annual reports, Cifar puts the spotlight on those which have seen the benefit of glasnost, and those still with a rusting iron curtain firmly wrapped around them, reluctant to let any treacherous numbers sneak into the public domain. The form and content of annual reports varies widely around the world. The most comprehensive and relevant data of industrial companies comes from Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scandinavia (except Denmark), South Africa, the UK and the US. There was below-average disclosure in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Spain. Cifar concludes that the main influence on disclosure is the pattern of ownership and the scope of companies' operations - shareholders or activities across borders. In reviewing accounting standards, Cifar identifies wide variations. One of the most inconsistently applied is depreciation, with the definition of the 'economic life' of an asset varying between five and 20 years. Variations in the treatment of goodwill vary from reducing shareholders' equity, through to amortisation over any period from 5 to 40 years. Different standards make it difficult to examine other items in accounts across borders, such as the cost of goods sold, expenses, fixed assets, deferred income taxes and retained earnings. Failure to consolidate and the use of multiple classes of shares also hinder comparisons. Cifar also attempts to summarise the principal accounting and auditing issues being considered by standards-setters. The Nigerians are looking at accounting in the petroleum industry; the French at financial reporting for political parties and groups; and the Germans at issues concerning the integration of the former East Germany, considering the audit of opening balance sheets of companies managed by the Treuhand, and accounting for deferred taxes in former socialist housing corporations. Yet again, there are few consistent patterns, suggesting little prospect of harmonisation among accounting standards-setters and international accounting standards. 'Every group is looking inwards and seems not ready for any serious attempts at global harmonisation,' the report says. One thing does remain almost constant around the world: the dominance of the 'Big 6' accounting firms. Their rankings may vary, but the shifts are among the mega-firms rather than between them and others in the next tier. The profession is also still highly concentrated. Partners in the UK, US and Canada make up more than half of all partners and 34 per cent of all offices around the world. None the less, the survey suggests that three clusters are emerging among these firms, with KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young leading; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the next tier; and Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse in the third. Contrary to any suggestions that the dominance of the Big 6 has created an oligopoly, the Cifar analysis argues that the audit market remains highly competitive. Audit fees as a proportion of sales or assets have remained virtually constant during the period 1987-91, stable at 0.022 per cent in the UK and 0.026 per cent in Australia, for example. They do vary between countries, going as low as 0.001 per cent in 1991 in Pakistan and as high as 0.045 in South Africa. But Cifar is not complimentary about the standard of audit reports around the world. The report reproduces a series of statements, which are often unclear, make vague references to auditing standards and give little indication of the work undertaken. 'There has been no improvement in auditors' reports,' says Mr Vinod Bavishi, Cifar's editor in chief. 'I cannot figure out the bad from the good reports. The accounting profession needs to get this under control.' International accounting and auditing trends. 3rd edition, 1993.

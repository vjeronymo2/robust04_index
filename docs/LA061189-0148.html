			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANG HAS LONG BEEN THORN IN SIDE OF CHINA'S REGIME  </P> <P> Given the exceptional boldness of Fang Lizhi, the dissident Chinese  astrophysicist who took refuge in the American Embassy last week, it is not  surprising that he is on the run now -- but rather that he did not go into  hiding long ago.  </P> <P> Even considering that he was once a protege of reformists in power, Fang had  long exceeded the usual bounds of public protest in China.  </P> <P> He had tweaked the tolerance of high officials by saying out loud what many  Chinese whisper: that top leaders have large foreign bank accounts. He  dismissed Marxism as passe and suggested that Taiwan, ruled by the heirs of the  Nationalist government that fled the mainland after the Communist triumph of  1949, should be the model for development on the Chinese mainland.  </P> <P> Fang had gone so far as to lead a drive to free political prisoners, a subject  rarely raised in China. The government denies there are any such prisoners.  </P> <P> By fleeing into the embassy along with his wife, Li Shuxian, Fang evidently  wants to avoid the fate of the dissidents he had hoped to free.  </P> <P> The police are moving to round up student and worker activists who took part in  the protests at Tian An Men Square. Increasingly, intellectuals such as Fang  believe that they too are about to be swept into a net of repression. Soldiers  have surrounded the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where many reformist  scholars work. Teachers at several universities believe they may be called to  account for pro-democracy sympathies.  </P> <P> "They're out for blood," said a young university instructor who had taken part  in the recent pro-democracy demonstrations. "They want total vengeance. It's  not safe for me to stay in Beijing."  </P> <P> Fang himself was not directly involved in the occupation of Tian An Men Square  by students, although his wife -- a Beijing University physics professor --  made speeches on campus in the weeks leading up to the unrest. Some student  leaders pointed to him as an inspiration. One, Wang Dan, an activist at Beijing  University and a key leader in the protests, said he is a personal friend.  </P> <P> In a complaint to the U.S. Embassy for having granted refuge to Fang, the  Chinese government labeled the scientist a "traitor," which is tantamount to  being given a death sentence in China.  </P> <P> China's aging paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, reportedly said of Fang last  fall: "We will not suppress people who hold differing political views from our  own. But Fang Lizhi has been indulging in mudslinging and spreading slander  without any basis, and we should take criminal action against him."  </P> <P> Fang, 53, was the center of a diplomatic storm during President Bush's visit to  China earlier this spring. Bush had invited Fang to a dinner along with other  Chinese notables and government officials. The police blocked Fang's way, and  he never arrived.  </P> <P> By criticizing China's government, Fang is playing a role out of China's  history and lore: that of the virtuous government monitor whose duty it is to  call to account the emperor -- even at the risk of his own life. This role has  been picked up by numerous Chinese intellectuals in the 40 years of Communist  Party rule, with often turbulent results.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, during the Hundred Flowers Movement, Mao Tse-tung called on  intellectuals to "bloom and contend" in criticizing government performance. The  surge of political candor went sour. Mao turned on the same critics he had  invited to step forward, persecuting them in what was called the Anti-Rightist  Campaign.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stinking' Category  </P> <P> During the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals were branded a "stinking"  category of Chinese society. Mao condemned them as "being basically bourgeois  in their world outlook," and many of the country's top intellects were banished  to the countryside, beaten or even killed.  </P> <P> Now, the conflict in the Communist Party over intellectual freedom is being  played out again. As tools in development, must China's best educated minds be  left unfettered? Or are the intellectual elites untrustworthy carriers of  foreign political viruses aimed at weakening the Communist system?  </P> <P> Disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, while stopping short of endorsing  calls for political reform that would undermine Communist rule, nonetheless  sponsored greater freedom for the intellectuals. His opponents, including  Premier Li Peng, want tighter reins imposed in the name of warding off  "bourgeois liberalization" and "spiritual pollution."  </P> <P> Fang has gone much further than the reformers in his calls for change. He has  also taken a theoretical position that puts him in conflict with Marxist dogma,  the underpinning of one-party rule here. He says that intellectuals are the  leading force in society, not the working class and certainly not the Communist  Party.  </P> <P> In 1987, Fang was dismissed from his job as vice president of the University of  Science and Technology in Hefei, in Anhui province, as well as from the  Communist Party. The government blamed him and a few other dissidents for  inciting a series of student democracy protests in Hefei, Shanghai and other  cities.  </P> <P> Fang was given a non-teaching post at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in  Beijing, but he kept speaking out in ways rarely heard since 1979, when an  earlier wave of democratic agitation swept China's cities.  </P> <P> A listing of just a few of Fang Lizhi's thoughts indicate his unorthodoxy:  </P> <P> On Marxism: "I feel Marxism is out of date."  </P> <P> On the Communist Party: "The Chinese Communist Party is an interest group which  will inevitably and firmly protect its vested interests and will never  voluntarily give up these interests or voluntarily take the road of  democratization."  </P> <P> On China's development: "China will not be able to modernize if it does not  break the shackles of Maoist and Stalinist-style socialism."  </P> <P> On government corruption and secret bank accounts: "I do not know how big some  of our comrades' foreign bank accounts are. Some of the bank accounts are the  privately acquired middlemen's money, the fruits of corruption and fraud. This  is a criminal act."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Basic Trust'  </P> <P> On the mood in China (before the Tian An Men incident): "The situation is very  dangerous. There is no basic trust in the government, the law or party."  </P> <P> On intellectual leadership: "Generally speaking, people who have internalized  the elements of civilization and possess knowledge have hearts which are  relatively noble, their mode of thought is invariably scientific and they have  a high sense of social responsibility."  </P> <P> On human rights: "Human rights means everyone has the right to think. You can't  say China's freedom of speech is different from foreign countries' freedom of  speech. Freedom of speech is the same everywhere."  </P> <P> On the building democracy: "Democracy can be achieved only gradually through  consistent effort. There is nothing to be afraid of."  </P> <P> At least nothing until last Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> SKINNY PUPPY OFFERS ALIENATING SPECTACLE  </P> <P> Skinny Puppy, an uncommonly popular death-disco band from Vancouver, plays  dance music that nobody dances to and bellows gloomy manifestoes that no one  understands. All beat, light and nightmarish distortion, a Skinny Puppy concert  can be one of the most profoundly alienating spectacles in rock. Friday's show  at the Palladium felt like a brutal slasher-movie killing drawn out to the  point of insensateness.  </P> <P> On the backlit, fog-enshrouded stage, mask-wearing vocalist Nivek Ogre moaned,  whirled a flail over his head, cringed from the proscenium as if he were  starring in a particularly claustrophobic Beckett play. The drummer thrashed  away from behind a thicket of gnarled twigs; the keyboardist pounded out  power-guitar sounding figures. Screens flashed slides of disembodied body parts  and endless blurry videos.  </P> <P> The music itself was kind of monochromatic stuff, circa-1984-era electro-hop  beats amplified to the threshold of pain, relieved occasionally by a  horror-movie soundtrack texture or a tinkly sequenced synth figure, though  never by a melody or an actual riff. Death-disco colleague Ministry might  leaven its performances with humor, Revolting C with some actual rock 'n' roll.  Skinny Puppy's show is as bleak as the world it describes.

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Papandreou halts Greece's telecoms privatisation THE NEW Greek Socialist government yesterday announced it would cancel the partial privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE, raising fears about the future of other sell-offs planned by the former conservative government. Mr Andreas Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement was returned to power in Sunday's general election, made the announcement on television at the start of his new cabinet's first meeting. Mr Papandreou had claimed during the election campaign that Pasok was now committed to co-operating with the private sector and to further liberalising Greece's financial markets. The previous conservative government had also earmarked two state-owned oil refineries for sale this year although plans were only at an early stage. A series of commercial plans, including the award of new casino licences and several development projects are also now in doubt. The telecommunications law, passed two months ago, provided for the sale of 49 per cent of OTE. Negotiations started earlier this year with six international operators shortlisted to buy a strategic 35 per cent stake in the company. Preparations were also underway to float OTE on the Athens stock exchange with the sale of 10 per cent of the company to the public and 4 per cent to employees. A group of international merchant banks, including Credit Suisse, First Boston, J. Henry Schroder Wagg and NM Rothschild, Morgan Stanley and Paribas Capital Markets, were handling the flotation. CSFB was also advising on the strategic sale. Pasok sources said agreements with several foreign merchant banks were being terminated. Mr Gerry Grimstone, a corporate finance director at J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank which had been appointed to handle the offer to the public of shares in OTE, said the bank had not yet received instructions from the Greek government. However, Mr Evricos Sarsentis, a Greek analyst at J. Henry Schroder Wagg, said Schroder hoped the flotation would still go ahead. Neither Schroders nor NM Rothschild, which has been advising the Greek government on the privatisation programme as a whole, are expected to sue the government for breaking their contracts. One banker said: 'It is all part of the rich tapestry of investment banking'. Schroders and other advisers have already done a lot of work on the OTE deal, which was originally planned for November, although it had been hitting delays before the election. The proposed sale was fiercely opposed by the OTE union and by local suppliers of telecoms equipment, who feared they would be squeezed out by competition from abroad once an international operator took over management of the company. The new prime minister has announced his intention of giving a cabinet post to Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, finance minister during Pasok's last term, who was convicted last year by a special court on charges of breach of trust while in office. The new cabinet was sworn in yesterday. Mr Papandreou did not appoint a deputy prime minister, but created a special cabinet post for Mr Antonis Livanis, a close adviser. The post of economy minister went to Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, who is suffering from cancer. The foreign minister will be Mr Carolos Papoulias. Ms Melina Mercouri heads the culture ministry.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS WINS 2ND TERM  </P> <P> Mayor Sidney Barthelemy won a second term in a primary election Saturday over a  white challenger after a campaign marked on both sides by accusations of  race-baiting.  </P> <P> With 425 of 465 precincts -- 91.3% -- reporting, Barthelemy had 71,716 votes,  or 55%, to 57,066, or 44%, for his fellow Democrat Donald Mintz.  </P> <P> Two other candidates drew votes of 1% or less.  </P> <P> Barthelemy avoided a runoff by winning more than half of the vote.  </P> <P> "We are in difficult times. We have laid the foundations for the future. But we  cannot build a great city divided," said Barthelemy, 47. "We all must work  together."  </P> <P> The black mayor, who spent 16 years in politics without losing an election,  faced a strong challenge from Mintz, who was making his first run for office.  The vote was expected to split along racial lines.  </P> <P> Barthelemy's easygoing, conciliatory style contrasted with the hard-hitting  intensity of Mintz, who resigned as head of the city's dock board to enter the  race.  </P></p>

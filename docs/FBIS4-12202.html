			<p>BFN     [Text] The golden jubilee session of the Economic and  Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific [ESCAP] begins in New  Delhi tomorrow. At a joint press briefing with the ESCAP  executive secretary in New Delhi today, the commerce secretary,  Mr. Tejinder Khanna, said India will voice its concern at the  meeting over any form of neoprotectionist measures in the  post-Uruguay round of Trade and Tariff Agreement. He said we  would not like any alibis to be trotted out to serve as a  roadblock to global trade. The ESCAP executive secretary, Mr.  Rafiuddin Ahmad, described the new GATT deal as a package of  mutual benefit. He, however, said the member countries have to  be watchful against any kind of protectionism and ensure that  the agreement is implemented in letter and spirit.</p>

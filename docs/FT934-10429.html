			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Property: Turnround at the tower - Canary Wharf's rise from administration It began with an urgent telephone call in March last year, and rapidly escalated into one of the world's most high-profile insolvencies. Eighteen months on, Canary Wharf, a potent symbol of the late 1980s UK property boom and bust, has formally been taken out of administration by the English High Court. The way is now open for Canary Wharf's new owners - 12 banks - to fulfil the site's original, ambitious aims. 'In the words of the judge, we have now returned the keys to the management,' said Mr Stephen Adamson, one of three administrators from accountants Ernst &amp; Young. 'It's all a bit of an anti-climax.' His co-administrator, Mr Nigel Hamilton, recalls responding to the first telephone call from Canary Wharf's lawyers. The message was clear: help was urgently needed to keep Canary Wharf solvent. 'We were running about trying to put a package together,' he said. 'It developed into all-night sessions. Until the banks finally met, they didn't know the true position.' The position soon became clear enough to Mr Hamilton and his colleagues: no more money would be forthcoming to sustain Canary Wharf, in spite of promises of financial assistance by its parent company in Canada. Initial calculations suggested that an extra Pounds 350m would be needed to service debts, complete the development and attract more tenants through special concessions. 'Different banks had different views,' he said. 'There was quite a mismatch of attitudes. Finally one of the bankers said: 'This turkey won't fly'.' That left open two options for the creditor banks: First, to appoint administrative receivers in a bid to realise as much as possible from their loans by selling Canary Wharf. But such a move would have sacrificed important tax breaks and left open the possibility that unsecured creditors would push for liquidation. Second, to use the less familiar insolvency procedure of administration  - which would have left existing directors in place and allowed the company to continue to trade. The banks opted for the latter. The danger, however, with administration was that directors or creditors in the US or Canada might file for bankruptcy protection for Canary Wharf in their own countries, triggering complex negotiations between lawyers over the different countries' insolvency laws. To prevent such an outcome, the banks approached a judge in his flat as soon as they had decided to opt for administration and before the decision became public knowledge. The administrators' immediate priority was to ensure that the Canary Wharf site continued to function. They had to move quickly to secure assets on the site, to speak to staff and reassure tenants. 'There was a big concern that the site would not be maintained. We were anxious to ensure that the landlords' obligations were met,' said Mr Alan Bloom, the third administrator. Meeting the landlords' obligations was unlikely to be easy or cheap: Olympia &amp; York, Canary Wharf's parent company, had provided what Mr Bloom describes as a 'Rolls-Royce' service to tenants. These included a commitment to subsidise the Riverbus service, which cost Pounds 900,000 during the administration alone. The banks initially agreed to put up a total of Pounds 10m between May 28 - the day the administration order was granted - and October last year to ensure that Canary Wharf continued to operate; to date, their support has topped Pounds 50m. 'Everything was complex,' said Mr Adamson. Many contracts had to be renegotiated and administrators had to pore over the complexities of 50 companies within the Canary Wharf group, set up to exploit tax allowances. At the same time, the administrators had to deal with about 1,400 creditors. English insolvency law only allows five creditors' representatives on a committee to scrutinise the work of administrators. But on this occasion, the Ernst &amp; Young team allowed many more creditors to attend to maintain goodwill. In addition, negotiations were continuing with the government on the vexed issue of the Jubilee tube line extention, linking Docklands with central London. The line, which had long been viewed as essential to the viability of Canary Wharf, was finally given the go-ahead last week. Ernst &amp; Young's aim in the first few months of the administration order was to find a buyer for Canary Wharf. Mr Adamson recalls one call in particular: 'We were offered Pounds 1bn to knock the tower down so that 'His Highness' could land his jet at London City airport. We never found out who His Highness was.' More serious offers came from Hanson, the UK conglomerate, and from a North American consortium backed by the Reichmann brothers, Canary Wharf's developers. Eight potential investors were eventually given information under confidentiality agreements and three went on to conduct further legal inquiries. In the event, no offer received by the administrators was considered a realistic commercial price. The administrators finally realised last Christmas that the banks would have to retain long-term ownership of Canary Wharf. The last few months of the administration 'were like six-dimensional chess', said Mr Adamson. It was this complexity, and the delicacy of the negotiations with senior government officials, which Mr Adamson believes justify the administrators' fees of about Pounds 7m and a further Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m in related legal fees. What finally emerged was a series of options - one plan to mothball Canary Wharf was codenamed Sleeping Beauty. The plan eventually put forward for creditors' approval - called a more mundane 1B - contained three elements: approval for the Jubilee line extension; the Department of Environment declining to move to Docklands in spite of initial interest in doing so; and a concerted bid to let the remainder of the building. To win support from the unsecured creditors for a voluntary arrangement to leave administration the banks agreed to offer Pounds 27m to creditors - up to 15p in the pound, with a further 25p for those contractors willing to provide warranties on work already carried out on site. Given the choice of something or nothing, the voluntary arrangement was overwhelmingly approved by creditors in September. Just two creditors - owed Pounds 53,000 out of a total of Pounds 86.3m - voted against. In spite of the successful restructuring of Canary Wharf's debts, the task now facing the directors under the new chairman, Sir Peter Levene, remains immense: to fullfil Canary Wharf's original aim of becoming London's premier office location.</p>

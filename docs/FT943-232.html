			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Clarke's 1.5% solution dissolving fast: Robert Taylor explains why it is proving hard to keep deals below the government's target The first results of the New Earnings Survey suggest it is increasingly difficult for any government to control or even influence the level of pay settlements in the economy. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, loses no opportunity in driving home his message that he intends to enforce a stiff public-sector pay curb of 1.5 per cent for the next three years. But the labour market is not the same as it was in the 1960s and 1970s when successive governments ran incomes policies from the centre with at least some success in ensuring pay restraint. The demise of much national wage bargaining in the private sector in recent years and the government's active encouragement of decentralisation and efficiency-related pay in the public sector has ensured that an increasing amount of wage bargaining is carried out at local level which is more sensitive to market pressures. 'The survey this year shows there is an enormous amount of wage drift in the economy,' said Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the independent Public Finance Foundation. It also suggests that those in work have been able to more than hold their own in the relative level of their pay as they have benefited from survival in a more flexible and insecure labour market where companies have cut staffing levels. Holding the line in the public sector is therefore going to be difficult as the economic recovery gathers pace. Incomes Data Services, the independent analyst, in its forecasts for 1995 believes most deals in the private sector will range from between 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent. 'Higher levels of output and increased profitability will increase employees' expectations in addition to whatever happens to inflation,' said Mr Alistair Hatchett, editor of Incomes Data Report. This could make it even harder for the government to keep the lid on public-sector pay costs. Rises are still running almost neck and neck with the private sector in spite of government policy and the first signs of private-sector revival. A number of public sector unions, particularly Unison with its large membership in local government, will be able to draw arguments from the earnings data to sustain their efforts to secure a substantial pay rise in that sector. Others may find it harder to whip up popular backing for their pay campaigns  -not least the Royal College of Nursing, which is trying to convince the review body covering nurses' earnings that they deserve a pay rise of at least 8 per cent. The survey evidence also looks set to fuel the debate inside the Labour party on the introduction of a national minimum wage - there is likely to be a fierce argument on this at its conference next week. The Public Finance Foundation calculated yesterday that the lowest-paid 10 per cent of workers would need a minimum wage of Pounds 4.15 an hour to ensure it is half the male median earnings, the target many in the Labour party would like to set.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Clinton pledge to sign biodiversity treaty PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised that the US would sign the biodiversity treaty, which former President George Bush rejected last year at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The treaty, which lays down obligations to list, monitor and protect endangered species, is open for signature until June 3. The Clinton administration has shared many of Mr Bush's reservations about the treaty, which has been criticised for vagueness which could imply a threat to the intellectual property rights of US biotechnology companies and over an apparently open-ended commitment for developed countries to finance less developed nations. However, the US has prepared an interpretative statement explaining its reading of the treaty, and has been working with other industrialised countries to get them to sign on to these interpretations. Mr Clinton also promised that the US would move to meet its obligations under the global warming treaty, also agreed in Rio last year, by stabilising its emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000. He promised to develop a plan by August to meet this commitment. The administration has been divided about how aggressively to pursue this goal, with Treasury and Energy Department officials, as well as influential members of Congress such as Mr John Dingell, warning that explicit measures to curb emissions needed to be analysed to determine their impact on the economy. Environmentalists had initially expected much of the Clinton presidency, but Mr Clinton has found that he faces much the same practical constraints on action as his predecessor. The Bureau of Land Management, which manages 270m acres of federal government lands mostly in the West and Alaska, has dropped plans to allow logging in Oregon within the habitat of the spotted owl. The sale of timber on 1,700 acres of federal land had been allowed last year during the Bush administration after a cabinet-level committee known as the 'God Squad' voted to override the Endangered Species Act, which requires the administration to protect the owl's habitat, in the interests of preserving timber jobs.</p>

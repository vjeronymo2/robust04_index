			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Robert Rifkin -- A statement in a Nov. 5 story about grand jury testimony in  the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan investigation was incorrectly attributed to  Robert L. Rifkin, a state Department of Corporations official.  </P> <P> William D. Davis, commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan,  testified that he believed that Lincoln's parent company could not repay debt  securities offered at Lincoln branches, and he provided information to  Corporations Department officials in an effort to block the sale of those  securities. The agency, though, approved the sale. Rifkin testified that his  agency considered ordering a halt to advertising for the securities, but the  agency decided not to issue such an order.  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bechstein rescued BECHSTEIN, one of Germany's oldest piano manufacturers, was yesterday rescued from bankruptcy after Berlin's ruling Senate bought the company's headquarters in the capital, clearing the way for banks to arrange a refinancing package. Bechstein, which has debts of more than DM38m (Dollars 22.4m), the result of expanding too quickly after German unification, will sell its headquarters in western Berlin for DM30m and rent the space from the Senate.</p>

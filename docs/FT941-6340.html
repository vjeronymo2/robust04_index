			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Exec options that reward Sir, I have been following your recent reports on executive share options and believe a central point has been overlooked: the benefits to companies of this type of plan. Executive options can attract, retain, reward and motivate key employees at no cost to the company's profit and loss account and with no risk to the company or participant. The cash flow benefits of options can be particularly important in smaller, growing companies that need to reinvest cash. They can use options to attract high-calibre executives who are prepared to take a lower salary and the chance of share option gains. Much of the recent criticism has been directed at the excesses of some option plans, neglecting the suitability of well-designed plans with allocation policies that have been given sufficient thought. Restricted shares may be appropriate in some cases but they have to be paid for out of profits and the gain is linked to the share price in the same way as an option gain. If the share price falls, the participant will not lose money. With an option, on the other hand, the share price has to rise for him to gain. If the company follows the guidelines of institutional investors, the dilution effect of issuing new shares on the exercise of options is very small - only 5 per cent of the company's share capital can be issued for executive options granted over 10 years.

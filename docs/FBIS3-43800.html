			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The situation in Kinshasa in Zaire is tense. Troops  are preventing the High Council of the Republic [HCR] from  meeting. The HCR was to have started expanding itself, thereby  turning itself into the transitional parliament. This goes  against the views of President Mobutu, who announced on Friday  evening that he was dissolving his government and fusing  together the HCR and the National Assembly.    Etienne Tshisekedi has come out against what he is calling a  takeover by force. Etienne Tshisekedi is one of the main  opponents of President Mobutu, and he is still prime minister of  one of the two governments disputing the running of Zaire.  These decisions are anti-constitutional, he says, and go  against all the agreements that have been made. He has called  on the international community not to allow itself to be misled.</p>

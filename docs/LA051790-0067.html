			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WAS THE MENU? ASK COLLECTORS  </P> <P> Restaurateurs interested in menu design, chefs wanting to recreate historical  dinners and food buffs looking for a slice of culinary past are among those who  use menu collections, according to those who collect them.  </P> <P> It can be tedious research, however. Because of their assorted sizes, varieties  and topics, menus are hard to classify and catalogue systematically.  </P> <P> A few collections, like the National Restaurant Assn.'s, are documented on  computer. (If you wanted to know, for example, which restaurants in its  collection served Welsh rarebit in Chicago in the 1940s, just punch a few  keywords into the computer and up comes a list.)  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, there are many private menu collections belonging to enthusiastic  diners, either stashed in desk drawers or piled in basement boxes. Private  cooking schools are another source, but are generally not open to the public.  Here is a handful of public collections. Call in advance if you'd like to take  a look:  </P> <P>  -- Department of Special Collections, University Research Library, Los  Angeles. Wonder what the Jonathan club was serving in the 30's? This collection  of menus, more than half from California, will tell you that. The collection is  open to everyone with a reference card for the UCLA libraries. Since the menus  are in remote storage, it's best to call ahead and have the material paged. The  collection is open Monday-Saturday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Call (213) 825-4988.  </P> <P>  -- National Restaurant Assn., 1200 17th St. NW., Washington, D.C. 20036.

(It was a catered  affair for 1,500 at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal).  </P> <P> The other half of Cornell's collection consists of menus from the 1920s to the  '40s, gathered by the university.

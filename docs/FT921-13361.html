			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Trafalgar may have won the battle, but the war is not over. Yesterday's court judgment confirming that the company keeps the title to Davy's ill-fated Ocean Emerald drilling rig until MSR comes up with the cash is good news as far as it goes. But there is still no guarantee that Trafalgar will ultimately get paid. The main concern for investors if the worst happens is the buoyancy of the second hand market for oil rigs, which can hardly be counted on. The shares, though, are hardly vulnerable given that the likely halved dividend would still make them among the highest yielders in the FT-SE.</p>

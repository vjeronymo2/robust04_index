The minister of regional  and land affairs, Mr. Andre Fourie, said in Pretoria that  although the government had no objection to Johannesburg as the  provincial capital, no decision in regard to any of the nine  regions had been taken. He said decisions on regional capitals  would be taken democratically after the election.</p>

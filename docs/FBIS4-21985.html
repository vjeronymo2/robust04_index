			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has announced that the security agencies recently  frustrated an extensive terrorist scheme involving 30 criminals  led by two dangerous leaders. One of the leaders, 'Adil 'Awad  Siyam, was killed and his brother-in-law, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim  Khalifah, was arrested.    During an international press conference today, al-Alfi  disclosed the schemes of that organization, which sought to  terrorize the safe citizens and destabilize the country with the  ultimate goal of striking at economic development in Egypt.    The minister said that the security agencies seized an  enormous amount of explosives, weapons, and ammunition in the  hideout of these terrorists. Al-Alfi noted that nine hideouts  of the terrorist group, which represents the military wing of  the al-Jihad Organization, were stormed in several governorates  at the same time and a large quantity of weapons and explosives  were found. The operations were carried out in the presence of  representatives from the Higher State Security Prosecution  Office, experts from the criminal laboratory, and explosive  experts. The three defendants, whose hiding places were  stormed, were found in possession of 17,000 dollars, 3,000  pounds sterling, and 9,000 Egyptian pounds, he added. A number  of firearms were also seized, including two automatic rifles, an  Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun, six pistols, 17 magazines of  automatic weapons, various types of pistols, 582 9-mm bullets,  three RPG projectiles, three silencers, and a large quantity of  firing pins, he added.    The interior minister added that searches conducted in the  nine dens led to the seizure of 335 bombs of various types,  explosives, quantities off sulphuric and nitric acids, ammonium  nitrate, mercury, chlorine, and ammonium chloride.  Approximately 150 kg of gelignite powder and another 150 kg of  (?nitrate) powder, a highly explosive material, also were found  in the terrorists' hideouts, in addition to a tricycle used as a  trap, three wireless devices, a cordless telephone, and magnets  used to attach explosives under vehicles.    The interior minister said that the security services seized  organizational papers and documents containing information about  the security of the installations and people and the method of  producing explosives and preparing deceptive traps. The  security services also seized a list of names of targeted  figures, various organizational plans, the code used by the  organization, and receipts for the transfer of foreign currency  from abroad.    The interior minister explained that the security forces  discovered in the possession of the captured terrorists a  quantity of forged official papers, including military  conscription cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates,  passports, and identity cards as well as a large quantity of  police and military uniforms and officers' ranks.    The interior minister noted that the security services also  seized various types of vehicles belonging to the organization,  including vehicles used in operations that members of the  organization have admitted they carried out.    The interior minister said that the security services found  a  Yemeni passport belonging to the first accused, 'Adil 'Awad  Siyam, commander of the organization's military wing, who was  killed in the al-Munib area in al-Jizah in the past few days.    During the international news conference, which was attended  by more than 100 correspondents from Egyptian and Arab  newspapers and Arab and foreign news agencies, the interior  minister noted that because of the detective work carried out by  various security services following the assassination of Sayyid  Ahmad Abu-Yahya, the first witness in the case of Prime Minister  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and the wounding of his friends who were with  him during the attack the State Security Investigations  Department was able to uncover an extremely dangerous terrorist  group commanded by 'Adil 'Awad Ahmad Mahmud Siyam, commander of  the military wing of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, who is  considered one of the most dangerous terrorists to be found in  recent years.    The interior minister said that members of the State  Security  Investigations Department also monitored the movements of the  second terrorist commander, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Muhammad  Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil.    The interior minister added that the organization was made  up  of a large number of terrorists who were given sophisticated  training, with the knowledge of the two mentioned commanders, in  the arts of combat, marksmanship, and the manufacture of various  types of explosives. He noted that the investigation confirmed  that terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam assumed responsibility for this  terrorist organization after his return to the country at the  instructions of the central command of the terrorist al-Jihad  organization abroad and after receiving advanced military  training on the use of all types of weapons and the preparation,  manufacture, and use of bombs and explosives.    The interior minister added: In light of the investigations  made by the State Security Investigations Department and after  taking all legal measures, the movements of the organization  were monitored on tape and by sound and accurate observations  were intensified until the aforementioned terrorist was  confirmed to be the link between the terrorist organization's  elements in the country and its leaders abroad.    He added that the investigations also confirmed that  terrorist leader 'Adil 'Awad Siyam was in control and had such  great influence on his group that he was convinced of the need  to commit suicide when arrested to maintain the secrecy of the  organization and its membership.    He said that the investigations confirmed that this  organization's members were experienced in criminal acts,  high-risk operations, and vehicle theft and were using aliases  and a secret code in their contacts and movements. He added  that these terrorists used the slums and remote areas as centers  for their activities, depots for their weapons and ammunitions,  and lairs for hiding. Investigations also showed that the  organization included a large number of cadres that were well  prepared and that 30 of these terrorist organization's cadres  were monitored.    The interior minister then said: After asking for permission  from the Higher State Prosecution Office and taking the  necessary legal measures, antiterrorist units that are highly  trained to combat terrorism and to undertake this type of  confrontation were prepared and sent on time to arrest the  organization's members and raid its lairs, which had been  accurately monitored beforehand.    He added that security action resulted in the death of the  dangerous terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam immediately after he  opened fire on the forces that chased him. He was in a Fiat 128  car with false license plates. The security forces opened fire  and killed him.    Another leading terrorist who was with him, Muhammad  'Abd-al-  'Alim Khalifah, was arrested. A quantity of uniforms similar to  those used by the Armed Forces and the police were found in the  car together with a pair of field glasses, a forged identity  card, and 4,260 pounds.    The interior minister said that the State Security  Investigations Department arrested 30 members of the terrorist  organization. He added that their names have not been made  public because the investigation and their confessions indicate  that other members are being chased and arrested.    He said that the names of the other members of the terrorist  organization will be announced in a detailed statement that the  ministry will issue after the operations are completed.    He added that the defendants gave detailed confessions on  the  terrorist operations they had carried out in the past, the most  important of which was the assassination of citizen Ahmad  Abu-Yahya on 4 February 1994, who was the primary witness in the  failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi.  He said that the weapons used in that incident have been seized  and noted that the results of the criminal laboratory's  examinations confirmed the defendants' confessions. The  vehicles used in that incident also were seized. He said that  this organization also carried out the attempt to assassinate  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on 18 August 1993, which  resulted in the death of terrorists Nazih Nushi Rashid and  Diya'-al-Din Dawud. The defendants also confessed that they  detonated the explosive device in the Shabab al-Jazirah Club on  13 July 1993, which targeted some of the state security officers  who were at the club for physical training.    Minister Musa noted that the defendants made detailed  confessions on the assassination of 'Adil Anwar al-Sayyid, a  dissident organization member, in front of his home in the Saray  al- Qubbah area [in Cairo] on 3 July last year. In their  confessions, the defendants stated that they had monitored and  reconnoitered a number of public, political, executive, media,  judicial, and military figures intending to assassinate them and  thus create a media uproar meant to tarnish Egypt's reputation  in the foreign media and shake the people's sense of security  and stability.    The interior minister added that for that purpose the  organization members took all the necessary steps to blow up  booby-trapped cars by remote control to cause the maximum degree  of demolition during the execution of these operations. All  defendants have been referred to the Higher State Security  Prosecutor's Office to proceed with the investigations, he added.    The minister described the uncovering of this major  terrorist  organization as one of the most successful security operations  conducted by security men in their confrontation with the  cowardly acts of terrorism carried out by a band of hired hands  who seek to disrupt security and stability; harm innocent people  such as the elderly, women, and children; and undermine the  successful economic reforms.    The interior minister stressed that the security men have  the  initiative in their confrontation with the forces of evil and  darkness. He added that these forces have deviated from their  religion and have pursued ways offensive to the noble Islamic  religion either to gain false leadership or to earn a few  dollars by the implementation of a tightly planned scheme that  primarily seeks to harm Islam and the Muslims.    He noted that the security agencies bear the brunt of  confronting this malicious campaign launched by the modern day  khawarij [members of a dissident Islamic sect that appeared in  the 7th century]. He noted that the security strategy depends  on broadening the circle of confrontation with all terrorist  elements to frustrate their schemes, uproot them, and eliminate  all the forces that stand behind them.    Reviewing the recent security measures, the interior  minister  noted that since the beginning of the year 20 major terrorist  operations have been aborted. These operations include a series  of planned explosions and assassinations of public figures that  would have harmed innocent people, he added. During the same  period, he added, 43 terrorists were arrested and a number of  others were killed during exchanges of fire with security men;  this was out of a total number of 52 terrorists wanted in  connection with these cases.    He emphasized that the security agencies are capable of  achieving the security and stability we all wish for, adding  that the security forces are the shield of the people that  safeguards the country with courage and boldness. He praised  the close cooperation among the security agencies, the media,  and the honest and courageous citizens who have supplied the  security agencies with information out of their sense of  loyalty. Thanks to this information, he added, this deviant  band and their hideouts have been attacked.    Responding to a question on whether the security services  have obtained new information on the assassination of Major  General Ra'uf Khayrat last Saturday night and whether those  services have been penetrated, the interior minister said that  the incident is still under investigation and action is being  taken to identify the culprits. He stressed that when an  incident takes place it does not mean that the security services  have been penetrated but, on the contrary, it is the security  services that have penetrated these fugitive terrorist groups  and this has helped abort dozens of attempts.    Replying to another question about the campaign and whether  there is coordination between all the services in confronting  terrorism, Hasan al-Alfi stressed that there is full  coordination between all the services, especially between the  security services and the media.    Regarding the sources of these weapons and how the  terrorists  are getting them, the interior minister said that many of these  weapons are surplus from former wars and others are being  brought in across the borders. He stressed that there are  strict measures to control the borders.    In reply to a question on the success achieved by the  state's  security services and whether a period of calm is expected, the  interior minister said that all things are possible. He noted  that the confrontation of every terrorist group with this  ferocity and vast financial resources and the security forces'  vigilance and readiness to make sacrifices for the sake of  Egypt's security and stability are bound to achieve positive  results.    On whether there is a link between the terrorist al-Jihad  organization and the terrorist Vanguards of Conquest  organization or whether the al-Jihad has more than one group,  the interior minister stressed that the Vanguards of Conquest is  one of al-Jihad's military groups. He noted that the Vanguards  of Conquest is a branch of the terrorist al-Jihad organization.    Regarding the leaders who have fled abroad, the interior  minister stressed that there are intensive efforts and constant  contacts at all levels to apprehend these leaders. But he  refused to divulge the names of these countries or persons  because progress has been made in this matter. He said: It is  in the public interest not to mention any details about them  until the time is right.    In reply to the correspondents' questions, he explained that  the terrorists began as a small group and then split into other  groups. He noted that they have a single objective and took  Islam as a cover, but that they are not Muslims.    Responding to a question on whether there is a link between  the Muslim Brotherhood and these extremist terrorist groups, the  interior minister stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood is a  propagator of religion only but that the terrorist groups are  advocates of violence and assassinations.    In response to a question on the possibility of a dialogue  with these terrorist groups, the interior minister categorically  denied that there is [words indistinct] and stressed that there  is no dialogue with these terrorist groups. He asked: Dialogue  with whom? A dialogue with killers and butchers? Does a state  conduct a dialogue with killers and criminals? There is not a  single country in the world that conducts a dialogue with  killers and criminals who order the killing of innocent people  with firearms and explosives.    On another question about reports that the extremist groups  are digging a tunnel under Salim Salih Street to be used for  explosives to ambush and assassinate important figures, the  interior minister said these reports are "irresponsible." He  said that the Public Prosecution Office is investigating these  reports and that everything will be announced when the  investigation is completed.    On the security services' success in eliminating 82 percent  of the terrorists and whether the rest have a major role in  terrorist operations, Minister al-Alfi stressed that the  remaining minority is behind these terrorist actions and the  sabotage.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 ITAR-TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI leads  with a number of reports from Russia's regions concerning the  memorandum of civic peace proposed by President Boris Yeltsin,  published under the headline "Russian society wants concord. Do  its political leaders want the same?".    Chairman of the Agrarian Union of the Novgorod Region  Vladimir Yezhov is quoted as saying that "Mother-Russia and its  people are sick and tired of the squabbles in the capital.  Unfortunately their destructive waves reach far and wide, even  in Novgorod Region. The prevailing instability hampers  effective land reforms. If we succeed in forgetting hurt  feelings and rally to reach a great and brilliant goal, we shall  be able to restore Russia's might and greatness. The fate of  the country is in the fate of its countryside".    The same newspaper carries an interview with Yegor Gaydar in  his capacity as the leader of the all-Russia association of  privatized and private enterprises, set up a year ago. "Today  the point is: Russia will have her chances of economic revival  only if it develops private businesses. As soon as private  enterprises begin to invest in the development of production, a  realist hope will arise for the overcoming of the crisis",  Gaydar said.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA interviewed the Democratic Party of  Russia's economic committee chairman Vladimir Leitland, who said  that "Russia will long remember Yegor Gaydar as the former  government leader, because under him "only 57 percent of the  country's 1990 economic potential remained intact". Leitland  calls for revising priorities for the transitional period and  leaving the key industries under direct state control for its  duration".    The newspaper highlights reports about the two-month  festival  devoted to the protection of the populace against ecological  hazards. The festival began on April 15. One report calls  Moscow one of the fifty ecologically "worst" cities, leading the  country in the amount of harmful effluents in the atmosphere and  liquid waste in its rivers and lakes. The newspaper publishes  an appeal to the citizens of Russia from the organizing  committee of the two-month action to join the ranks of fighters  against ecological hazards.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA splashes the title "Russia has little  time left to avert a nuclear disaster" above an article about  preparations for an expedition to the Komsomolets nuclear  submarine, which sank in the sea of Norway five years ago. The  article warns about the possible "ejection of the nuclear load"  from the ill-fated submarine. According to the newspaper, it is  most important at present to launch and complete an operation to  "conserve" the sunk submarine before it is too late.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Ramazan  Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council, the  upper chamber of the Russian parliament, who said that the  Russian state, even when it acted violently with regard to its  citizens, was somehow associated in their minds with an image of  "a severe and even unfair father who nonetheless was looking  after his children in one way or another". Abdulatipov calls for  the restoration and strengthening of the power of the state "in  its new functions and new authority". "The state is as strong as  its ability to protect the individual", he said.    The press pays much attention to PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat's  visit to Moscow. He is quoted as saying that the Palestinian  state favours the convocation of a second Madrid conference on  the Middle East settlement, and "hopes to see Russia participate  in the peace-keeping forces" deployed on the occupied  territories.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA believes that 'Arafat's "meetings in  Moscow are particularly useful" on the eve of Israeli Premier  Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Russia.    TRUD (Labour) leads with reports about spring fieldwork,  which is particularly difficult this year because thousands upon  thousands of hectares of land have been inundated by spring  floods, and Russian farmers often find themselves lacking the  essentials for coping with the task. More than 80 percent of  all farmers no longer "hope for government assistance", the  newspaper says. "One third of them lack fuel, seeds and  equipment. Few have secured loans ahead of sowing, and those  who have are awed by the crushing 200-percent interests on the  loans". Specialists predict that grain production is likely to  dwindle to 80 million tonnes this year, 24 million tonnes less  than the 1986-1990 average.    PRAVDA carries and interview with deputy head of the  institute of informatics of the Russian Academy of Sciences,  Shota Chipashvili, who speaks about the great role played by the  late academic Vladimir Semenikhin in designing and developing  the country's single automated system of control over its armed  forces. "Classified information that was uncovered recently  makes it clear that Semenikhin ranks with such great figures in  Russian Science as (nuclear researcher) Igor Kurchatov and  (chief designer of space vehicles) Sergey Korolyov.</p>

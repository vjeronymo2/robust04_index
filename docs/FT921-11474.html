			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: European insurers show signs of recovery - But some analysts are at a loss to explain the recent bounce Strange things are happening to Europe's insurance stocks, which are showing signs of recovery after two years in the doldrums. With profits depressed by fierce rate competition and steadily rising claims, the share prices of many major insurance companies performed sluggishly in 1990 and 1991, for the most part underperforming their respective markets, after strong growth in the 1980s, when the strength of their assets fuelled investor interest. Yet in recent weeks insurance stocks have risen strongly, with Europe's biggest companies, from Generali in Italy to Guardian Royal Exchange in the UK, outperforming the market. Figures produced by BNP Securities show the extent of the recent recovery. After a rise of just 1.6 per cent for the whole of last year, BNP's European insurance index - based on an index of 69 European insurance stocks - grew by 12.24 per cent from December 23, 1991 to January 30. This compared with a rise of 9.63 per cent for the FT-Actuaries Europe index over the same period. The best rises came in Norway, which gained 28.82 per cent, and France with 27.98 per cent, against respective increases of 13.31 per cent and 15.1 per cent for the markets themselves. Yet many of the sector's underlying problems are still there. The decline in property values has not only weakened balance sheets: in France, for example, it has also depressed profitability by reducing the scope for realised capital gains. Property sales have generated a significant share of the pre-tax profits of France's leading companies. Declining real interest rates could benefit the asset position of those companies which hold sizeable portfolios of bonds but, conversely, this trend will cut investment income for non-life companies whose investment portfolios are heavily weighted in this direction. Meanwhile, price competition is continuing to undermine underwriting profits in spite of rate increases - in the UK household and motor sector last year and, more recently, promised in French and Italian motor rates. In France a number of mutually owned companies have been winning market share hand over fist at the expense of their bigger rivals. France's three state-owned companies, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and the Groupe des Assurances Nationales (Gan), along with Axa in the private sector, have all come under pressure from the mutuals, which enjoy considerable cost advantages. The gradual opening up of the European market to cross-border trade is also increasing competition. According to Mr Angus Runciman, European analyst with BNP Securities: 'The underlying trend (of rates) is still downwards.' All this leaves analysts scratching their heads to explain the recent bounce. Ms Christiane Marcellier of James Capel in Paris says French companies are undervalued compared to their Italian or German counterparts. Market capitalisation as a percentage of premiums is only around 0.6 for most French firms against 1.8 in Italy and Germany. Ms Brigitte Cole of BZW in London points to the importance of a recent announcement by the French government that it is about to introduce legislation which will open up a private pensions market for the first time. Life business already generates 40 per cent of the revenues of UAP, Axa and AGF. Gan, which generates 60 per cent of its business from life insurance, is especially well placed to take advantage of the new market opportunities. 'We think that insurance share prices will outperform the market this year,' says Ms Cole. Mr Runciman is not so sure: 'There is no reason why investors should jump in. The industry is not suddenly going to start making oodles of money.' In France, the government's intention to raise cash by reducing its stake in the three state-owned insurers (to 51 per cent from its current level of 75 per cent) is another cloud on the horizon. Although the privatisation would normally lift market sentiment, the government is said to be at odds with the companies, which would prefer it to reduce its interest by, for example, issuing new shares for cash or by establishing cross-holdings in other European financial groups. BNP expects the resulting tension to depress investor enthusiasm. It says the sale could create a potential overhang of FFr22.1bn.</p>

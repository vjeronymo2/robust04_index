			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cambridge bids for Cadillac Fairview assets Developers and institutional investors are circling Cadillac Fairview in the hope of acquiring the financially-troubled Canadian developer's valuable assets. The latest is Cambridge Shopping Centres, another Canadian developer, which said it had submitted a bid for 'substantially all' CF's assets. Cambridge declined to provide further details of its proposal, which expires on July 8. Other bidders are expected to emerge ahead of the June 30 deadline set by CF for proposals from prospective equity investors. CF, whose 73 properties include such flagship sites as Toronto's Eaton Centre and the Pacific Place mall in Vancouver, is restructuring about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 4bn) of debt. It has already sold some properties. Mr Frank Mayer, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, said there was 'a very good chance' of the process culminating in CF's dismemberment. He noted the company had equity partners in many of its properties with a right of first refusal and other negotiating privileges. The partners include Markborough Properties, controlled by the Thomson publishing family, and Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is CF's partner in the TD Centre in Toronto, one of Canada's biggest office and shopping complexes. CF confirmed yesterday that it was considering several proposals 'from substantial investor groups with the resources to make a significant equity investment'.</p>

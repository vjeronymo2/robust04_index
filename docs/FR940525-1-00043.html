The authority citation for part 567 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  12 U.S.C. 1462, 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1476a, 1828(note). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 567.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (f) and (kk) and by adding new paragraphs (mm), (nn), (oo) and (pp) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;567.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Direct credit substitute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> direct credit substitute <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the assumption, in form or substance (other than recourse obligations as defined in &sect;567.1(kk)), of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim, that exceeds the savings association's pro rata share of the asset or claim. If a savings association has no claim on an asset, the assumption of any risk of loss is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Financial guarantee-type standby letters of credit that support financial claims on the account party;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Guarantees and guarantee-type instruments backing financial claims;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Purchased loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced (other than servicer cash advances as defined in &sect;567.1(nn)), or if the servicer makes or assumes representations or warranties about the loans (other than standard representations and warranties as defined in &sect;567.1(oo)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (kk)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recourse.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> recourse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred asset, that exceeds a pro rata share of the savings association's claim on the asset. If the savings association has no claim on a transferred asset, the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises when an institution transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets, or to absorb losses due to: a default of principal or interest; or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse arrangements include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Representations or warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties as defined in &sect;567.1(oo);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans serviced (other than servicer cash advances as defined in &sect;567.1(nn));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than a pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity of the underlying loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (mm)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public-sector entities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> public-sector entities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes states, local authorities and governmental subdivisions below the central government level in an OECD-based country. In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town or other municipal corporation, a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or municipal corporation. This definition does not include commercial companies owned by the public sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (nn)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Servicer cash advances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> servicer cash advances <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans, including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely collection. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse arrangement (as defined in &sect;567.1(kk)) or a direct credit substitute (as defined in &sect;567.1(ff)), if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For any one loan, nonreimbursed advances are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (oo)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standard representations and warranties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> standard representations and warranties <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means contractual provisions that a savings association extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing rights) or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are transferred or the servicing rights are acquired, and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the transferor or servicer. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return of assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties are not recourse obligations as defined in &sect;567.1(kk) or direct credit substitutes as defined in &sect;567.1(ff).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (pp)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standby letters of credit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) A financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit is any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however named or described, which represents an irrevocable obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, in the event that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A performance-based standby letter of credit is any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however named or described, which represents an irrevocable obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer to make payment on account of any default by the account party in the performance of a nonfinancial or commercial obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly assumed or retained means:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For a subordinated interest or security, the amount of the subordinated interest or security plus all more senior interests or securities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

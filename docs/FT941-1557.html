			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Receivers called in to NZ meat processor Fortex, the New Zealand company credited with leading the way in the reform of the country's meat processing industry, was yesterday placed in receivership by a group of trading banks. Talks about the company's financial problems began last week, following a statement that the company expected to lose up to NZDollars 50m (USDollars 28.5m) in the six months to February 28 because of intense competitive pressures in the meat industry. The failure of the company is an embarrassment for the government, which had extolled the virtues of its having the latest plant and machinery, new marketing technology and cost-saving union agreements at its two plants. Fortex had also been one of the darlings of the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The shares traded as high as NZDollars 2.65 in 1992 before falling to NZDollars 1.00 earlier this month and to only 6 cents at the close of trading last night.</p>

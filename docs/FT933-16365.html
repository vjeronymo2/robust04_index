			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: The land of Ali Pasha - In the remote Pindus Mountains, Nicholas Woodsworth finds a more beguiling, wilder Greece I AM all for progress. I am even soft-headed enough to believe in unified European economic development. At least, I was until a few weeks ago, when I drove northwards from Athens through the heart of mainland Greece. If this is progress, I decided somewhere between Thebes and Meteora, then we should give up on the idea altogether and let the Americans and Japanese get on with it. I did not expect leafy Arcadian landscapes dotted with temples and statues. I was even willing to admit that the Greece written of by Patrick Leigh Fermor 40 years ago - a Greece of old and vibrant rural traditions - might have disappeared. Who are we, after all, in our demands for peasants on donkeys or picturesque poverty? Mere cultural voyeurs, tourists with more money than sensibility. But I was not prepared for the wasteland each new vista opened up. In their rush to catch up with the rest of Europe, the Greeks seem to have left something of their Greekness, and their own sensibility, behind. Could this be the same race that developed the architecture of harmonious proportions, the aesthetic of man at one with nature? As I drove along I found it difficult to believe. Central Greece's towns were unrelievedly drab, an unzoned confusion of industrial hangars, squat apartment blocks, grubby motor repair shops and empty spaces strewn with rubble. Remarkable in their ugliness, villages of unsurfaced breeze-blocks and concrete-slab roofs lay scattered across the vast, flat farmlands of Thessaly. Everywhere, rusty reinforcing rods protruded, precursors to the next desperate phase of gimcrack construction. Despite the wild flowers and sunshine of spring, roadside landfill projects managed to turn parts of even the deepest countryside into a rubbish tip. I felt depressed. After only 40 years of modern European development, the birthplace of western civilisation looks like a dump. I was tempted to turn around and, like the great majority of visitors here, head for the tourist enclaves of the Greek islands and coasts; at least the commercialism of sea, sun and sand is predictable. But I did not. In some distant corner of the mainland an older, more distinctive Greece, a Greece in touch not with its classical roots but simply its recent past, had to exist. It does. At Kalambaka I turned west and began climbing the first of a series of switchbacks leading up 6,000ft to the Katara pass. The warm Easter weekend sun disappeared, as did cultivated fields, flowers, leafy trees and Thessaly's ghastly village clutter. In a thick fog I climbed up past the dead yellow grass of early spring. Higher still, I ran into winter itself - snow blanketed the mountain's pine forests and at the top of the pass a cold wind whipped a new fall of snow sideways across the windshield. When the road came down again and the snow disappeared I was still in Greece, but not the same country I had left behind. Wedged in between the Pindus mountain range and Albanian border, Epirus is the poorest, most isolated province in the nation. It has little to do with the popular image of Greece as a wine-soaked, sun-kissed land of hedonism. With the most distinctive regional identity on the mainland, it is instead an area that draws its character and history from its ruggedness, from the peaks and valleys, rivers and gorges of the Pindus mountains themselves. The further one goes into the fastness of the Pindus, the more one forgets that Greece is rushing pell-mell and none too tidily into the 21st century. Epirus's historic isolation from the rest of the country is reflected even in Ioannina, its busy capital. In the company of holidaying Epirots I spent an Easter Sunday morning on the shores of Lake Pamvotis, the tree- and cafe-lined lake that makes for such delightful strolls here. But directly behind Pamvotis I could see the first steep, snow-covered folds of the Pindus rising skywards. In the late 18th century the protection offered by these peaks allowed Ali Pasha, the Albanian-born 'Lion of Ioannina', to rebel against Greece's Turkish overlords and carve out an independent mountain fiefdom. Ali Pasha may have been celebrated by Lord Byron, the champion of Greek independence, but he was an unsavoury character, as harsh as the land he ruled. He discouraged opponents by breaking their bones with sledge-hammers in public executions. His omnivorous sexual appetite was notorious - when his son's mistress rejected his advances he had her and 17 companions bound together, weighted and thrown into Lake Pamvotis. Not even Lord Byron was safe. On meeting the poet, Ali Pasha took a particular fancy to him, and, so it is reported, became obsessed with his small and dainty ears. Like many tyrants, though, Ali Pasha came to a sticky end. Not far from the Frourio, his walled and minaret-topped citadel on the shores of the lake, you can today visit an island monastery where he finally got his come-uppance. Trapped by Turkish assassins on an upper storey, he was shot in the underside from the room below. The ragged bullet holes are still in the monastery's wooden floorboards to prove it. Epirus's essence, though, is to be found not in its towns, but high up in the valleys and villages of the Pindus. Just half-an-hour north of Ioannina I found myself driving up rocky limestone defiles and over deep river gorges in country so rough and broken that even herds of goats seemed to find it tough going. It is wild, surprisingly beautiful, and not wholly unpopulated. In the 46 villages of the Zagori, as this, the most attractive area of the Pindus is known, you will find some of the most impressive village architecture in all Greece. I came into the village of Monodhendhri almost without seeing it. Like all the villages here, it is nearly invisible, a natural extension of the world that surrounds it. From top to bottom, from roof to lintel, floor tile to terrace wall, church tower to cobbled pathway, Monodhendhri is built of the grey slate mountainside on which it sits. Just getting into the village was difficult enough; it is enclosed by semi-fortified walls and laced by a labyrinth of narrow stone pathways that time and again failed to take me where I wanted to go. Once at my destination, a small inn in the upper village, I found it impossible to get a meal - the place was packed solid. It was still months from the summer tourist season. Was Monodhendhri always as crowded, I asked Georgi, the young man who helps his parents run their small hotel. Not at all, he replied. This was a crowd of Greek city-dwellers who had returned for the holiday to visit the few relatives and friends who remain faithful to the mountain way of life. Later, when the family parties had thinned out, I sat down to a dinner of Easter lamb, a great chunk of ribs cut from an entire animal turning on a spit outside. Over a mountainously full plate I learned that people - not too many, but too few - have always been a problem in the Pindus. Prosperous under Ali Pasha, Epirus in the 19th century became an unsettled border territory, disputed by Albania and relinquished by the Turks only in 1913. In Nazi-occupied Greece the mountain terrain of the Pindus provided an ideal base for Greek resistance fighters, as it did for communist partisans in the savage civil war that followed. In each case vicious reprisals by the authorities led to the abandonment of entire villages. Many villagers left to start new lives elsewhere, never to return to their harsh and unproductive land. Only in the last decade has the discovery of the Pindus' natural beauty by outsiders renewed its prospects once again. Just yards from Monodhendhri's stone-colonnaded church begins a path that winds steeply downwards for more than an hour. At the bottom begins a spectacular trek through the Vikos Gorge, Greece's answer the Grand Canyon. Each summer the gorge attracts growing numbers of trekkers. Invigorated by sparkling mountain air and brilliant sunshine, who would not be tempted? I was. But at Easter, with snow-melt flooding the river on the gorge floor, I had to content myself with other, not-so-strenuous pleasures: giddy views over the gorge's sheer, 3000-ft walls; walks through high pastures beginning to bloom with spring flowers; picnics of feta, wine and fat olives by the side of clear green mountain streams; tramps through stone villages each as attractive as the last. It may not have been as exciting as the eight-hour walk through the gorge, but it was far more exciting than the prospect of the eight-hour drive out of the Pindus and back across the plains to that other Greece. Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Greece with British Airways, which has a Eurobudget fare, London-Athens return, of Pounds 524 (20 per cent cancellation charge) and Pex fares starting at Pounds 278 return. For those planning either trekking or touring holidays in Zagoria and the Pindus, a car is a great aid; public transportation between towns and mountain villages is rare. Also useful would be a smattering of basic Greek; although B &amp; B-style accommodation is becoming widely available, few people in these valleys speak other languages. There are dozens of wholly unspoiled walking routes in the Pindus range. Organised walks through the Vikos Gorge and elsewhere can be arranged through Robinson Travel, Ogdhois Merarhias 10, Ioannina, tel: 0651-29-402.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- International policy on  Bosnia must combine a determined military stance with diplomatic  doggedness, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Monday [25  April] in Paris.    "We must be firm on the ground and we must be strong-willed,  I would even say stubborn, to get a diplomatic process that  works" in Bosnia, Juppe said in a radio interview only hours  ahead of a meeting in London with his British and U.S.  counterparts Douglas Hurd and Warren Christopher.    The three top diplomats are meeting to prepare talks of the  three major powers, the United States, Russia and the European  Union, as well as the United Nations, to define a common policy  on the Bosnian question.    The goal is finally to tell the warring Bosnian parties "to  come to the negotiating table and talk seriously," Juppe said.    Juppe said Bosnian Serbs have acted "savagely, and continue  to do so, in Gorazde" but that the international community could  pressure the Bosnian Serb's sponsor Serbia with sanctions "which  hurt and which should continue to hurt."    Juppe said an overall settlement in Bosnia should be based  on  the European plan for the former Yugoslav republic to become a  viable state with institutions that loosely join the Serb, Croat  and Moslem communities. Territory should also be divided up "in  order to end the dialogue of the deaf in which we have been  stuck for months and months."    He added that what has happened at Gorazde showed that the  international community was reacting too slowly and that this  should be corrected in the future. [passage omitted]</p>

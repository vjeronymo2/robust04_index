According to reports, Ocalan  declared that the PKK is prepared to accept any formula for a  dialogue with Ankara that aims at finding a peaceful political  solution to the Kurdish issue, provided a general amnesty is  issued to all PKK members and there is a recognition of the  Kurdish identity in Turkey. He called on international and  European organizations, such as the European Parliament, the  European Union, and the United Nations, to play a mediation role  and supervise the dialogue for a peaceful solution to the  Kurdish issue. It is worth noting that Turkish Government  officials have turned down this peaceful overture.</p>

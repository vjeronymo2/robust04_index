			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VALENZUELA LOSES MOUNTS WHILE DRUG INVESTIGATION CONTINUES  </P> <P> Jockey Patrick Valenzuela was refused permission to ride today as the Board of  Stewards for the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita continued an investigation  into what one of them called the rider's drug use.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who rode Sunday Silence to victory in the Kentucky Derby and  Preakness Stakes last spring, was taken off his scheduled mounts by the  stewards for three days: today, Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, 27, has not ridden since calling in sick Oct. 13. He took a drug  test Friday, and it was reported initially that the results were negative.  </P> <P> But apparently there was disagreement between the initial report and the  written report, which stewards subsequently received.  </P> <P> Steward Pete Pedersen said the written report sent to the California Horse  Racing Board by BPL Toxicology Laboratory of Tarzana showed a positive result  for cocaine.  </P> <P> Valenzuela met with the Board of Stewards today, and the immediate result was  the continuation of the board's refusal to allow him to ride. Pedersen said he  and the other stewards will determine a penalty for Valenzuela, "hopefully by  10 a.m. tomorrow."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sakher Abu Eloun] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 30 (AFP) -- PLO  guerrillas who joined the new police force stormed out of their  training camp on Monday [30 May] demanding guns to protect  themselves, one of their leaders told AFP.    The walkout came after suspected Israeli agents in a car  chased four of the men from the Hawks, the armed wing of the  mainstream PLO group Fatah.    "Out of 90 Hawks who began training four days ago, 70 have  left," said Rajih Abu-Sita, one of the Hawk leaders.    "We are returning to the Hawks, to protect ourselves and  defend ourselves if attacked."    An AFP correspondent met several Hawks as they quit the camp  in the former Israeli base known as Ansar II on the Gaza City  seafront.    Abu-Sita and his cousin 'Amr killed a Jewish settler on the  Gaza Strip in March 1993 and were wanted by the Israelis before  autonomy began at the start of this month.    "We can't go on," Rajih said. "This is not a camp but a  bazaar. There is no security, neither inside nor outside the  camp. We don't even have any weapons.    "On Sunday when we went into town armed men in a Peugeot 504  chased us. We were lucky to escape."    The two cousins sent a letter Sunday to Palestinian police  chief General Nasr Yusuf to explain why they were leaving.    "There is no security in the camp," they wrote. "We are  still hunted by Israeli intelligence services even if there is  an agreement between Israel and the PLO.    "We want protection and weapons because we still feel we are  in danger."    Rajih said: "Rabin has left certain elements here to kill  us."    He also complained that the training camp was supposed to be  solely for former Hawks.    "We were surprised to find about 100 other recruits who did  not belong to our group, who were not wanted by the Israelis and  who had never even carried out any political activities.    "We want to be soldiers for our country and for Fatah," he  added.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also upset the new recruits  with  a hardline statement Friday that Israel vetted all the new  policemen.    "No Palestinian policemen from the territories has been  recruited without our agreement and we have never stopped  checking that is the case."    Rabin said Israel had vetoed the names of several hundred  Palestinians who had been due to join the police from abroad.    He was reacting to Hebrew press reports that the Abu-Sita  cousins had enlisted in the new force, which is about 4,000  strong and is due to swell to 9,000 men.    "What we say to Rabin is, 'You want to catch all those who  are wanted because they have killed settlers and collaborators.  But who killed all our martyrs? You have to answer that  question,'" Rajih said.</p>

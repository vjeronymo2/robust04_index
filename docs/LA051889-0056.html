			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SUITORS': A DARK COMEDY ON IRANIANS IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Ghasem Ebrahimian's "The Suitors" (Westside Pavilion) is so thoroughly  unpredictable that it takes a while to appreciate that its view of the Iranian  expatriate experience in America is as tragic as it is comic. It is remarkably  accomplished in its shifts of tone for a first feature and is so distinctive  that it was the only American film selected out of 50 entries for the Directors  Fortnight at Cannes last year.  </P> <P> Iranian-born, American-educated, Ebrahimian sets his story in motion with  terrific panache. He opens with a group of macho-looking Iranian men capturing  a sheep on a farm in verdant Upstate New York. Cut to Kennedy International,  where a middle-aged Iranian named Haji (Assurbanipal Babila) and his beautiful,  chador-clad wife, Mariyam (Pouran Esrafily), become accidentally separated  almost upon arrival, eventually reunited by the same men who went after that  sheep. They slaughter the sheep (for a feast) in an apartment bathtub, its  blood somehow drips into the apartment below, and a paranoid SWAT team leaves  Mariyam an instant widow.  </P> <P> "The Suitors" does not turn into a protest picture but instead starts living up  to its title as Haji's friends commence pursuing his stunning young widow, who  stands to inherit half a million dollars, not to mention a fortune in Persian  rugs. Far from grief-stricken, Mariyam married Haji, long a U.S. resident, only  to get to America to continue her eduction. For the first time in her life she  is experiencing an unexpected taste of freedom, a sensation that neither the  women, let alone the men, among her husband's friends comprehend.  </P> <P> The film's twists and turns prove to be as breathtaking as Esrafily's dark  elegance. "The Suitors" (Times-rated Mature for intense adult themes and  situations) is a sad reminder of the fate of Iran's women, who were in the  process of becoming liberated when the Ayatollah ordered them to resume the  veil.

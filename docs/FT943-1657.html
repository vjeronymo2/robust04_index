			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Round opponents make their mark US foes of the Uruguay Round world trade pact have been flooding the Senate with telephone calls as the focus of opposition has moved to the Dollars 40bn cost in the form of lost tariff revenues over the next decade. Urged on by groups on the right and left, opponents have been demanding that senators commit themselves to a vote against a waiver of budget rules, which could raise the deficit. The tactic is the latest in a lengthy battle against the new world trade pact. The Clinton Administration has made passage a priority, but time and election year pressures have become a serious obstacle in the effort. Opponents have turned the debate into an issue of fiscal responsibility six weeks before many Democrats are facing extraordinarily tight races. 'Gatt's complicated,' said Miss Lori Wallach, one of the anti-Gatt leaders, she said. 'But there's nothing complicated about busting the US budget to pay for foreign tax cuts. The Gatt package asks for increased taxes and budget busting. It makes this a nightmare for many Democrats.' Labour leaders, rightwing Christian groups, conservative talk show commentators and Mr Ross Perot, the erstwhile presidential candidate, have stepped up their opposition. Mr Perot's citizen brigades have targeted key Democratic senators who are up for re-election. These include Tennessee Senator Jim Sasser, the heir presumptive to Majority Leader George Mitchell, who is retiring this year. Senator Bob Kerry, a Nebraska Democrat, is also coming under strong pressure. Like most Democrats, both are already suffering from the political weakness of the president and could be helped by a delay in the vote until next year. With Congress due to adjourn in October for campaigning, the administration will next week be forced to submit the implementing legislation which has left key issues unresolved in Congress. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, must decide the timing of a controversial rule of origin for textile and apparel imports for one year - for one year as the House Ways and Means Committee wants it - or five years as the senate wants it. The opposition is targeted at the Senate, where 60 votes will be needed to waive budget rules before a vote can be held. The year-long struggle to pass the Gatt has lowered the stock of Mr Kantor, who was considered one of the most successful members of the cabinet in the wake of the Uruguay Round deal last December. Business lobbyists talk openly of wanting a new trade team.</p>

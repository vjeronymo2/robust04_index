			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ELIAS' PROMISING START TO A PROMISING WEEK  </P> <P> The marvelously talented Brazilian pianist Eliane Elias returned Tuesday night  for the start of what promises to be a bountiful week of contemporary jazz at  the Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Her opening set -- despite recurring problems with a sound system that seemed  determined to eliminate synthesizer keyboardist Rob Harris and bassist Lincoln  Goines from the band -- bristled with the high energy and passion that are  intrinsic to Elias' music.  </P> <P> Among the more attractive pieces were "So Far, So Close" (the title track of a  new album, scheduled for release later this month), a briskly sensuous samba  titled "At First Sight" and Elias' ever-rocking "Cumpari &amp; Soul."  </P> <P> A high point of the set was a totally unplanned solo excursion through "All the  Things You Are" that clearly identified Elias as an improviser with virtually  unlimited horizons. Mixing long, arching lines with lush harmonic clusters,  shifting into a slow, rhythmic left hand to support a stream of wildly soaring  notes from her right hand, Elias managed to incorporate a good chunk of jazz  piano history in one brief improvisation. It was a moment to remember.  </P> <P> There was, however, one disturbing thing about the Elias performance. Drummer  Vinnie Colaiuta -- gifted though he may be as a fusion performer -- was both  out of control and overbearingly loud. His usually crisp drum sound was harsh  and rattling, and he persistently obscured the subtleties of the music with a  storm cloud of shakes, rattles and rolls. Colaiuta is too good a player, and  Elias' pieces are too deserving of better treatment, for such an approach to  continue. One hopes it changes before the close of an otherwise  state-of-the-art week of contemporary jazz. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Board changes at Bullers' Britannia Collection BULLERS, the manufacturer and marketer of giftware, fine art and decorative accessory products, yesterday announced the resignation of one of its directors, Mr Terence Mason. Mr Mason was managing director of the Britannia Collection, the group's principal trading subsidiary. His departure follows the resignation of Mr Peter McBride, the group's managing director, announced in February. Lord Even of Winton, Levend Beriker and Mr John Goodger have been appointed directors of the Britannia Collection and will fulfil Mr Mason's former executive responsibilities, the company said. Earlier this month Bullers announced losses trimmed to Pounds 450,000 pre-tax for the half year to December 31 compared with Pounds 497,000 after stripping out losses of Pounds 838,000 for discontinued operations. The company's share price dropped in late 1990 after it revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.33m for the first half of the year against a Pounds 195,000 profit. At the same time the company disclosed an exceptional provision of Pounds 360,000 against money owed by the Iraqi government including debt for large Islamic swords pictured in television reports. The following year the decorative accessories division suffered when a majority of the staff at Glenlomond Fire Surrounds left and set up a rival firm. The company restructured its finances last year.</p>

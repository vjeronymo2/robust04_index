			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee </F> member and head of the Palestinian side at the Refugee  Subcommittee of the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Political  Committee, by Tawfiq al-'Abid; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Abid] A few days ago, a  senior PLO official said the Cairo agreement is not ideal. Do  you agree with this assessment?    [Ghawshah] That is correct. The agreement is not ideal. We  view what took place in Cairo as an incomplete step. It is not  a positive start for the resumption of negotiations on various  issues. We view what happened in Cairo as a new indicator, as  Rabin has resumed the policy of procrastination, extortion, and  imposition of the status quo. He went beyond that to ridicule  the entire [Oslo] agreement. Things got worse when Rabin said  there are no sacred dates. This is despite the fact that the  only issue that will not tolerate various interpretations or  double-dealing is the dates of 13 January and 13 April.  However, even this clear issue has been considered not sacred  by Rabin. Therefore, I say that what ttook place in Cairo is a  possible step. But it is not a step that responds to the  minimum level of our demands.    We see the negotiations as a long and arduous process. There  will be negotiating battles. Rabin and his generals will try to  impose their concept of the agreement and to delay the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP].    [Al-'Abid] Can I understand from what you have said that the  Palestinian negotiating team was subjected to extortion during  the Cairo negotiations? Were specific pressures put on the  delegation?    [Ghawshah] We can say the extortions were tremendous.  However, the Palestinian delegation did not accept all  extortions. It resisted some of them. If the Palestinian had  given in to extortions, the matter would not have required  rounds of negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Versailles, and Cairo.    On the contrary, extortions were even greater. Still, we  have to admit that the Palestinian delegation could not impose  its concept of the agreement in a manner that meets the minimum  [Palestinian] demands.    [Al-'Abid] Some of those who attacked the Cairo agreement  said President Yasir 'Arafat is not authorized to sign the  agreement, and that the PLO Executive Committee has not  authorized him do so. What is your comment?    [Ghawshah] I attended the PLO Executive Committee meeting  [prior to the Cairo agreement]. Many arguments took place. It  is known that it was an incomplete PLO Executive Committee  meeting and that arrangements had been for a liaison committee  delegation rather that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to  travel to Cairo. It was originally planned that brother  Abu-'Ammar would travel to the Egyptian capital only to meet  with President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. However, a host of  circumstances led to the participation of President 'Arafat,  including the Israeli insistence not to participate unless  brother Abu-'Ammar attended in person. Eventually, this issue  was discussed during a meeting of PLO Executive Committee  members who agreed to attend. A last-minute decision was taken  concerning brother Abu-'Ammar's travel. Still, it should be  noted that the PLO Executive Committee should be briefed on any  steps during its subsequent meetings. Its members have the right  to express their views. This actually took place during a  subsequent meeting on the nature of the Cairo agreement. Various  views were expressed. We should not forget that there are  various views. We express our views in a democratic way. What I  have said has been officially announced in a Palestinian Popular  Struggle Front's statement in which we discussed the meeting. I  believe that any faction is entitled to debate issues and  express their views within the framework of the Palestinian  institutions.    [Al-'Abid] What were the most prominent developments that  took place a short time before President 'Arafat decided to  participate in the Cairo negotiations?    [Ghawshah] Intensive international and Arab contacts were  held with President 'Arafat to remove the obstacles. The United  States was the most active country in this respect. The strange  thing is that the United States exercises its role only when  there is a need to bring pressure to bear on us, and not as an  honest and faithful mediator and sponsor. What was achieved in  Cairo could have been better had the sponsors of the conference,  specifically the United States, assumed the role of an honest  partner and mediator.    As yet, the U.S. Administration has not adopted a balanced  or  equitable stand. It tilts toward the Israeli concept and  viewpoint, irrespective of the justifications and the preambles.  We can say that up to this moment, the United States has not  adopted a balanced stand, and has not exercised the required  role. On the contrary, the role that is being exercised is to  bring pressure to bear on the Palestinian side and not the  Israeli side. [passage omitted]    [Al-'Abid] Many believe Israel will not abide by the 13  April  deadline and that it will put forth excuses. What can the  Palestinian side do to force Israel to respect timetables?    [Ghawshah] Those who believe that all barriers and obstacles  between us and Israel have been removed will reap disappointment  and failure. Israel is still an enemy which carries out a  policy of land confiscation, repression, and extermination. It  is only natural that it tries to maneuver and procrastinate to  empty the agreement of substance. From this premise, we are not  surprised by any Israeli stand. We expect the worst. However,  this does not mean that we keep silent. We should confront it.  But this depends on the balance of powers from which the Arabs  and the Palestinians are suffering. [passage omitted]    [Al-'Abid] There is a weapons-acquiring wave in the West  Bank  and the Gaza Strip. Most of it is not for militant purposes.  This heralds internecine fighting in the future. What do you  have to say about this?    [Ghawshah] The question of weapons-acquiring in the occupied  homeland is eye-catching. What is taking place is an increase  in the activities of weapons smugglers. This has taken place  recently. It seems that the Israeli security bodies facilitate  the possession of weapons so that the Palestinian people may  kill one another.    However, we say that the Palestinian people are so mature  and  have learned from past experience and will not fall victim to  the enemy's schemes. We are studying measures and arrangements  to prevent the shedding of any Palestinian blood by Palestinian  hands.    [Al-'Abid] What about the meeting of the committee on the  refugees and the displaced which met yesterday, and what about  the agenda of the negotiations with the Jordanian side?    [Ghawshah] We agreed on a draft agenda. We discussed at  length the issue of refugees, which we reviewed in all its  aspects, particularly from its strategic aspect based on the  fact that a just solution consists of their repatriation and not  their compensation, and forcing Israel to implement  international legitimacy resolution No. 194. We also discussed  various other issues, particularly the role of the United  Nations Relief and Works Agency.    We emphasized the need to effectively carry out coordination  and cooperation and reject the principle of resettlement.    Wuth respect to the displaced, there is UN Security Council  Resolution 237 which calls for their repatriation, and special  clause 13 in the DOP on the modalities of their return. This  will be studied through a four-way  Jordanian-Palestinian-Egyptian-Israeli committee.    There was also a Jordanian and Palestinian understanding on  the various issues slated on the agenda.</p>

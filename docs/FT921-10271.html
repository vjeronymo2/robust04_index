			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / BAe sheds 450 jobs at defence plants BRITISH AEROSPACE is to shed a further 450 jobs at its guided-weapons plants by May and has warned of more redundancies if it fails to win a Pounds 700m competition to make a new missile for the RAF, David White writes. The cuts continue a cascade of reductions in the defence industry. In the past week, about 350 job losses have been announced at Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilder, and 600 at the VSEL submarine yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, where further cuts are due. Unions say that about 40,000 job losses have been announced in the defence industry since mid 1990, when the government announced plans for cuts in the armed services. The latest cuts by BAe will reduce the workforce in its Dynamics division, which makes guided weapons, to 6,000 compared with 16,500 three years ago. All of its three main remaining sites are affected, with the principal plant at Stevenage, Herts, losing 300 out of 4,000 jobs. A further 130 will be lost at Lostock, Lancashire, and 20 at Bristol. The company yesterday asked for volunteers for an 'early-release' plan. Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, warned that delays in procurement decisions in the UK and abroad were 'increasing the pressures'. BAe is anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of its Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam), which would provide it with its biggest single source of business in guided weapons. It is competing for the RAF contract against rival weapons proposed by BGT of Germany and by GEC-Marconi in collaboration with Matra of France. Mr Laybourn said: 'If an early positive decision is not forthcoming on Asraam, our ability to bid for - or undertake - major guided-weapons projects for the Ministry of Defence will be damaged.'</p>

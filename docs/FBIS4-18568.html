			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Emily von Sydow: "EU Believes in Finnish WEU </F> Membership"]    [Excerpts] The EU [European Union] believes that Finland  will join the Western European Union, WEU. The Commission views  the applicant countries as support for the new foreign and  security policy, rather than an encumbrance, despite their  tradition of neutrality.    A strong argument voiced against expanding the union,  expressed by many countries, France for one, was the fact that  three of the applicants, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, were  neutral. But the concept of neutrality has been modified since  the fall of the Berlin wall, and the juxtaposition East-West has  ceased to be current.    "Finland is apt rather to promote a stronger security policy  than prevent such a development." Sweden's Prime Minister Carl  Bildt has no objections to joining the WEU. Nor will Ingvar  Carlsson, the Social Democrats' leader, try to stop such a  development. During a background briefing on Tuesday [15 March],  a high official at the Directorate General explained to a group  of journalists that he did not expect that the applicants would  create any kind of problem in the area of foreign and security  policy.    "When Finland joins the EU, it will share a 1,200-km-long  border with Russia. It is up to us to find a formula for  exporting stability, instead of succumbing to the insecurity  bacteria from the other side," noted the spokesperson. [passage  omitted]    "If the political willingness is there, then the Council of  Ministers can react to these proposals," said the official.  "However, in order for the Commission to make suggestions in  this field, we must define the common interest," he added.    "Currently, it is most important for the WEU to concentrate  on the standardization of weapons and to direct and monitor the  implementation of sanctions on the Danube," added the official.    At the Directorate General, the view is that the next  expansion phase will include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. This should take place around the turn of the century,  with negotiations taking place during the period 1996-98.    "The current scenario is that these three countries will be  part of the expansion. Other countries are currently lagging too  far behind," the official concluded.</p>

But if Europe is heading  for a new split, as the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks  for reform in Russia, and signs of a nationalistic Russian  foreign policy seem to indicate, then EU membership coupled with  a military alignment will become problematic for Finland. That  is the conclusion reached by the Foreign Policy Institute in a  study carried out by researcher Jukka Salovaara on the effects  of EU membership on foreign policy and security. The study also  emphasizes that the effects of EU membership will also depend on  Finland's alignment in defense policy and on the way Europe  develops.  <H5>  New Opportunities </H5>   EU membership commits Finland to a common policy on foreign  affairs and security, but only on such issues and areas of  activity as have been agreed on jointly, Salovaara writes.  This, in turn, opens up new foreign policy opportunities for  Finland. Salovaara groups the opportunities of influencing the  EU's common policy into three categories.    First, there are areas where EU policy is already very well  established and where Finland has more to learn in order to be  influential. These are mainly policies regarding the Middle  East, but also those regarding the CSCE and the United Nations.  Salovaara does not see any significant differences between  Finland and the EU countries in policies regarding the CSCE or  the United Nations. But he points to the example of Denmark,  which, despite being in the EU, has been able to align with the  other Nordic countries over South Africa, espousing a policy  that differs from that of the other EU countries. It is  therefore conceivable that the Nordic countries could cooperate  over the United Nations as well in the future.    Second, there are areas where new accents will be added to  EU  policy, for example policies towards Russia and East Europe. EU  membership would open up new activity areas for Finland within  the framework of its policy toward Russia.    Third, Salovaara believes that, as an EU member, Finland  will  add a new Nordic dimension to the Union's foreign policy. This  could increase the EU's interest in neighboring regions to the  east of Finland. Finland cannot solve all its regional problems  on its own.    If Finland stays outside the EU together with Norway and  Sweden, Nordic cooperation can develop. If Sweden and Norway  join the EU but Finland does not, its relations with Russia will  gain greater emphasis. The difference, compared with the Cold  War period, would be that West Europe's outer frontier would be  drawn between Sweden and Finland. That would make Nordic  cooperation difficult in its present form, the study maintains.    Salovaara deals with four alternatives in discussing  Finland's defense, depending on whether Finland joins the EU or  not and depending on Finland's military alignment or  nonalignment.    If Finland does not join, neutrality is a likely  alternative.  One possible solution would be a defense alliance with Sweden if  it, too, stays out of the EU. Salovaara does not see this as a  likely eventuality in view of these countries' geopolitical  situation and historical background.    Relations with Russia would then become of major concern  because of our region's increasing military and strategic  importance to Russia. This is because part of the Russian  Baltic fleet has been forced to withdraw to St. Petersburg and  the Kola peninsula now plays a more prominent role in Russian  strategy.    As a member of the EU, Finland can stay militarily  nonaligned  and maintain an independent defense. The Maastricht treaty,  however, points toward a common defense policy leading in future  to a joint defense system.    The Foreign Policy Institute study, however, gives no answer  to the question regarding the significance of a common defense  policy. According to Salovaara, it is highly unlikely that any  far-reaching decisions will be made at the government conference  in 1995. He does believe, however, that the EU will be watching  Finland closely after accession, mainly due to the long border  that the Union would share with Russia after that event.    The foreign and security policy survey on the consequences  of  Finland's EU membership is one of the studies presented  yesterday. There was another study on regional policy. [passage  omitted]</p>

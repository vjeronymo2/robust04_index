			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> $5.4 BILLION IN ROAD, RAIL PROJECTS OKD;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE BULK OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO UNCLOG  FREEWAYS AND INDUCE COMMUTERS TO USE RAPID TRANSIT IN URBAN AREAS.  </P> <P> Doling out the rewards of an increased gasoline tax, the California  Transportation Commission on Wednesday approved $5.4 billion in new road and  rail projects designed to unclog streets and freeways and nudge motorists out  of their cars and into mass transit.  </P> <P> With few exceptions the gubernatorial commission followed the recommendations  of its staff in voting to give the bulk of the money to projects in urban areas  like Los Angeles County where freeway congestion has become as much of a daily  irritant as smog and crime.  </P> <P> In the state's population centers, the commission allotted as much money for  commuter, urban and intercity rail projects as it did for road programs. Los  Angeles County alone was slated to get $1.4 billion in rail projects. "This  year's program is a very heavy rail program. We've never had anything like it  before," said Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance and  highways.  </P> <P> The rail projects included $500 million to help extend Metro Rail from the  North Hollywood station to Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys and $123 million for  computer rail improvements for lines from Los Angeles to San Bernardino, Los  Angeles to Ventura and from Fullerton to Redondo Junction. Another $105 million  was alloted for construction of a light rail line from Norwalk-El Segundo to  Westchester via Los Angeles International Airport and $350 million to construct  a 13.6-mile light rail line from Sierra Madre Villa in eastern Pasadena to  Union Station.  </P> <P> Both road and rail projects were spread out over seven years in a State  Transportation Improvement Program, which set a tentative date for construction  to begin and the total amount the state was willing to devote to each project.  Even though the dollars for each project stacked up into the millions, few were  given full funding. In most cases, commissioners expect local officials either  to come back in later years for more money or to match the state dollars with  local dollars.  </P> <P> While money for the projects came from a variety of revenue sources, a gasoline  tax increase and a $1-billion bond issue for rail transit approved by the  voters in June enabled the commissioners to endorse hundreds of projects that  had been delayed for years because of lack of funds. Motorists began paying a  5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase Aug 1. The tax will go up another penny  each January for the next four years.  </P> <P> "This is a milestone State Transportation Improvement Program because there is  finally some money," said Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the  Senate Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> Commissioners offered one note of caution, however, pointing out that their  funding program counted on voters approving two more $1-billion bond issues for  rail transit. If the two issues are either voted down or withdrawn from the  ballot, Hathaway said, there would have to be drastic cuts in the rail transit  program.  </P> <P> While projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars easily won commission  approval, it was one of the smallest projects -- $5 million to begin purchasing  right-of-way for closing the gap in the Long Beach Freeway -- that drew the  most controversy. Although the money moves the project forward, no specific  route has been designated. That awaits an environmental impact study.  </P> <P> Antonio Rossmann, an attorney for South Pasadena, appealed to the commission to  delete the project -- arguing that the money could be better used for other,  more popular, road programs. For decades South Pasadena officials have objected  to the construction of a freeway through their city.  </P> <P> Calling the project a "casualty" of years of controversy, Commissioner Bruce  Nestande urged the panel to abandon it. Nestande was outvoted, however, after  Commissioner Joe Levy called the project "the most important in the state of  California."  </P> <P> The commission will take a final vote on the transportation improvement program  today, but it is not expected to change its position on any of the projects  approved Wednesday.  </P> <P> The only matter left unresolved by Wednesday's vote was an attempt by the Los  Angeles County Transportation Commission to add more projects. Commissioners  said they would consider approving the additional projects if the local  officials would agree to take funds from other projects to pay for them.  </P> <P> Among those the Los Angeles officials wanted included in the program were  projects to widen California 126 through Santa Clarita and to widen the  intersection and replace a railroad crossing at Rosecrans Boulevard and  Aviation Boulevard.  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY ROADS: B1  </P> <P> </P> <P> ROAD AND RAIL PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P>  Following are road and rail projects tentatively decided by the California  Transportation Commission.

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Yeltsin seeks peace-keeping role around Russian borders RUSSIA has 'a heartfelt interest' in suppressing conflicts around its borders and must be given a free hand to act as guarantor of peace in the former Soviet bloc, President Boris Yeltsin told the international community yesterday. This might mean acting with special powers granted by the United Nations. Mr Yeltsin (right), pictured with vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, also warned his opponents in parliament he would not tolerate their blocking of constitutional and economic reform.

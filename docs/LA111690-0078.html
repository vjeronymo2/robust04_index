			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HALF-CENT SALES TAX HIKE WINS NARROW  APPROVAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles County voters narrowly approved Proposition C, a measure hiking  sales taxes by a half-cent to develop a five-county rail transit system, build  exclusive bus ways and widen freeways, nearly final election returns disclosed  Thursday.  </P> <P> The county registrar-recorder's office said that with only about 1,000 to 2,000  absentee ballots still to be counted, Proposition C had received 847,838 yes  votes to 833,336 no votes, a 14,502-vote margin.  </P> <P> The measure, along with a similar sales-tax proposition approved in Orange  County, is expected to raise $550 million a year to fight traffic congestion  with improved transit systems.  </P> <P> In other election results, a tally of the last 1,000 absentee ballots in Santa  Monica confirmed that tenant rights candidate Kelly Olsen narrowly beat out  incumbent Councilwoman Christine Reed for the third contested seat on the Santa  Monica City Council.  </P> <P> And Proposition W, a tenant-backed measure that would have allowed modest rent  increases on voluntarily vacated apartments, was defeated. The final unofficial  numbers showed that the measure lost by 266 votes.  </P> <P> On the morning after the election, before the absentee votes were counted,  Olsen led Reed by 827 votes. On Wednesday, about 1,500 absentee ballots were  counted, narrowing the gap to 519. The final tally showed Olsen edging out Reed  by 374 votes.  </P> <P> In the Santa Monica-Malibu school board race, nearly final returns reported by  the county showed Brenda Gottfried the winner of the last open seat. Gottfried  and Joanne Leavitt had been locked in a close race for fourth place in the  race, but Gottfried was ahead by 300 votes. Officials estimated that fewer than  100 absentee ballots remained to be counted.  </P></p>

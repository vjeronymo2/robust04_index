			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN'S SENTENCE  </P> <P> Judge Wood's sentence for Milken appears to be more of government vengeance  than justice. Her reasoning that he needs to be made of an example of is quite  unfair in view of more serious crimes that are going unpunished. Why not apply  and enforce the same standards of the law against all politicians in this  country who accept campaign contributions and then influence legislation to  benefit their donors? Does anyone come to mind?  </P> <P> DON FEIN  </P> <P> Brentwood  </P></p>

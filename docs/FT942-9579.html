			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Timing it right - Directors' transactions Tarmac, the construction giant, announced final results at the end of April. The figures were dragged down by a larger than expected FRS3 loss. Following the disposal of several businesses, though, the remaining core has been performing well. Sir Anthony Bamford is a non-executive director who has been notable for his strong sense of timing in the past. Prior to the disposal, he bought stock at 70p. His most recent purchase of 250,000 shares at 171p takes his holding to more than 1m. James Dickie, the Scottish engineering firm, has seen its share price rise steadily over the past few years. The prospects for the group are still very good as gearing is brought down. The sale by Joseph Grimmond, the chief executive, of such a large amount of stock has a special explanation. The group felt it lacked institutional shareholders and was keen to benefit from the support that they can bring. Accordingly, Grimmond sold what amounted to 7.8 per cent of the stock to M&amp;G Group. Trinity Holdings makes components for fire engines and rubbish trucks. It announced good final results at the end of April and the share price has been outperforming the market. Three directors have sold stock recently. The largest sale, by chairman Geoffrey Hollyhead, was made for domestic reasons.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                    Sector     Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ash &amp; Lacy                   Eng      50,000      86         1* Bilton                      Prop      23,864     138         5* BLP Group                    USM      50,000      70         1* Burn Stewart Dist.

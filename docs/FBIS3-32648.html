One  cannot speak of interference, according to former Chamber of  Deputies President Antoine Joseph, who considers it normal for  the United States to request President Aristide to choose a new  prime minister to fill the vacuum created by the departure of  Prime Minister Robert Malval. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph:    [Begin recording, in Creole] What you call giving orders is  what I see as the fact that the United States is now considered  the world cop. Second, the United States is very strong in the  United Nations and has played an important role in the Haitian  crisis. If they can call that giving orders....    Furthermore, the United States has given pretty substantial  support to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is true that  there are difficulties preventing his physical return.  Personally, I do not consider it a big deal that the United  States, seeing that there is now an executive vacuum and that  this vacuum is tempting, that this vacuum is a kind of bait,  believes that the vacuum entails the sort of resolutions  resulting from these national conferences. The United States may  deem it necessary for the vacuum to be filled as soon as  possible. It therefore asks President Aristide to name a prime  minister so as to begin filling the executive vacuum. [end  recording]    Furthermore, Antoine Joseph considers the resolution  recently  adopted by the employers' associations realistic. This  resolution supports the main themes of the Governors Island  agreement and of the New York pact. Joseph thinks the military  considers the UN Mission in Haiti [MINUHA] a real slap. The  MINUHA agreements can be revised by the Haitian parliament,  according to Dr. Joseph, former president of the Chamber of  Deputies. [passage omitted]</p>

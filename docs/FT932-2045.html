			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / People: Birrell's first brick for retirement home Sir James Birrell, who steps down as chief executive of the Halifax Building Society in August, has picked up his first retirement job. He is crossing the regulatory fence to become a part-time member of the Building Societies Commission at the start of next year. It would be highly unusual for a retiring chief executive of a major clearing bank to join the court of The Bank of England, which supervises the banks, but The Building Societies Commission, does not appear to suffer the same sort of inhibitions about possible conflicts of interest. The BSC, established in 1986, is responsible for supervising the industry. It meets every three weeks and reviews each society's activities fully at least once a year. Although Birrell will be the first Halifax man to join the BSC, until recently the majority of its part time members were drawn from the building society movement. Apart from Birrell, chief executive of Britain's biggest building society, the other members are: Herbert Walden, former chief executive of Heart of England Building Society, Jock Worsley, a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Graham Sunderland, former chief executive of Yorkshire Bank, and Nigel Fox Bassett, retired senior partner of Clifford Chance. Sir James, who has just been knighted, has been chief executive of the Halifax Building Society for the last five years, having first joined the Halifax in 1968 as accountant.</p>

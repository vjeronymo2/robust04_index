			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Some Advice for Grain Hoarders"] </F>   [Text] In some provinces in South China, grain prices rose  sharply recently. An important reason for this, among many  others, was that certain dealers hoarded grain for speculation.  Therefore, we would like to give some advice to these people:  Your speculative behavior is not in the interests of the  country and the people and you will end up ruining yourselves.    Grain dealers have played a positive and meaningful role in  enlivening the grain market and in promoting rural economic  development. However, as middlemen under the socialist market  economy, they must do business and make money honestly and in a  legal way rather then seeking high profits to the detriment of  the country and the people. Only in this way can middlemen play  a positive rather than negative part in promoting economic  development.    Some middlemen have played a negative role by hoarding grain  for speculation. This tells us that imperfect market rules and  immature markets make it possible for middlemen to hoard grain  for speculation and that some middlemen are likely to become  "profiteers."    Grain is a special product which is essential to the  national  economy and the people's livelihood and we cannot do without it  for even one day. Those who create social disorder and infringe  upon the people's interests by hoarding grain for speculation  are usually rejected by the people.    Most of the blame for the recent sharp increase in grain  prices in some places in South China should be ascribed to grain  hoarders. They boosted grain price by hoarding grain, disrupting  the relatively stable grain market and preventing the state, to  a certain degree, from introducing major reform measures.    Some people maintain that the state should allow grain  dealers to hoard a certain amount of grain under the market  economy. This is incorrect because ours is a socialist market  economy and the basic purpose of production and circulation is  to meet the people's increasing daily material and cultural  demands. We must improve economic efficiency, but we must also  take social effects into account. How can the government remain  indifferent to hoarding and cornering, which is designed to seek  exorbitant profits and which goes against the interests of the  state and the people?    It should be pointed out that the state is fully capable of  restraining businessmen who hoard grain for speculation. For  instance, the state can strengthen macroeconomic control. "With  enough grain in stock, we will not panic." The grain price will  fall when the state, which has sufficient grain reserves, sells  grain in large quantities. Will the excessive grain the  hoarders are stocking not become their burden if this happens?    We would like to advise the middlemen engaged in the grain  business: You had better do business in a legal way no matter  what economic status you have. If you try to seek exorbitant  profits by hoarding and speculation, which infringes upon the  interests of the country and the people, you will get nowhere.</p>

Thompson, 52, saying  discrepancies in the testimony of chief accuser Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, and  others would make it difficult to prove the charges in court. Thompson said a  "celebratory orgy" would be held at a local tavern.  </P> <P> Royally Late: Prince Charles and Princess Diana finally received a wedding gift  nine years after they were married, when they opened the Prince and Princess of  Wales Hospice in Glasgow, Scotland.

Mother Teresa is a winner of the Nobel  Peace Prize.  </P> <P> Recovering: Former Sen.

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte down on figures INTERIM results from Forte prompted a series of broker downgrades and sent the stock tumbling 10 to 227p in reasonable turnover of 5.1m. Leisure analysts said they believed the shares to be in for a fairly dull time for the next few months as the hotel group revealed its recovery was proving much slower than had been expected. The shares have run up in recent months as the leisure sector's chief recovery play, but talk of a slower revival saw some brokers yesterday change their recommendations from 'buy' to 'hold'. Profits came in at the low end of expectations and, together with Forte's cautious outlook, led brokers' forecasts down by some 15 per cent to around Pounds 90m. At this level the dividend would be uncovered, prompting further speculation that the group will at some stage launch a long-rumoured rights issue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A recent international  seminar on administrative reform and management revealed that  the three tasks of determining the respective functions,  internal setup, and staff size of the various departments under  the State Council had been achieved. One after another, the  various departments are beginning to operate with their new  functions and organizations. The implementation of local  institutional reform has also been kicked off on a full scale,  with a dozen or so provinces and autonomous regions such as  Liaoning, Jilin, Anhui, Shandong, and Guangdong having embarked  on their institutional reform programs ahead of schedule.    To further deepen administrative reform, the General Office  of the Central Organization Committee [COC] recently sponsored  an international seminar on administrative reform and management  in Beijing. Experts, scholars, and government officials from  Thailand, Hong Kong, France, the United States, Britain, India,  Australia, and China attended the seminar.    Zhang Zhijian, deputy director of the COC General Office and  vice minister of personnel, told the meeting that over recent  years, China has concentrated on changes in various social and  economic fields to unfold -- from top to bottom -- a round of  reforms in the administrative system and in institutions, to  meet the needs of building a socialist market economic system.  These reforms yielded first fruits in changing the functions of  government institutions, smoothing working relations,  streamlining organizations and personnel, and improving  efficiency, to bring about a major step forward in shaping a new  administrative and management system suited to the socialist  market economy.    According to Zhang Zhijian, in the process of reforming the  administrative system and institutions, China met with some  protruding problems in areas such as building a macroeconomic  regulation and control system and making administrative rules.  He said: This international seminar will have a very important  affect on further summing up the current practice of reform,  better drawing on useful ancient and modern experiences at home  and abroad, and vigorously advancing the next step of  administrative reform.    Gu Jiaqi [7357 1367 7784], deputy director of the COC  General  Office, gave a special speech to the seminar on the planning and  implementation of administrative reform by the Chinese  Government.    During the three-day seminar, participating centered on  administrative reform by the governments of various countries,  the comparison of administrative reform strategies with  international experience, relationships between central and  local governments, reform of public administration, and reform  of government legislation, and carried out in-depth discussions  on them. The seminar had the support and cooperation of the UN  Development and Planning Agency.</p>

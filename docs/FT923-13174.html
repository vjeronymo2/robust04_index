			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bio in deal with Glaxo BRITISH Bio-technology, the recently floated group, has signed a collaborative agreement with Glaxo to develop a new asthma compound. Glaxo is paying about Pounds 1m for pre-clinical development and will conduct and pay for clinical trials scheduled to begin during the third quarter of this year. Although final terms have not been agreed, Glaxo is expected to manufacture and market the drug worldwide if it is licensed. The medicine, known as BB-882, will be given in oral doses. British Bio-technology is also planning to develop an injectible version of BB-882 to treat acute shock. The Oxford-based company will conduct the early trials, and if successful, may conclude a further agreement with Glaxo. Mr James Noble, finance director, said: 'This is a perfect deal for us. It off-loads the whole burden of costs for the clinical trials. Glaxo is the best possible partner to conduct the trials and then market the drug.' The agreement with Glaxo follows a similar deal with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, to co-develop and market arthritis and cancer treatments.</p>

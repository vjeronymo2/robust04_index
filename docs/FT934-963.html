			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Price Waterhouse wins deferment Price Waterhouse, the former BCCI auditors, yesterday won a deferment, probably into the next century, of a disciplinary inquiry by the Institute of Chartered Accountants into its role in the bank's collapse, John Mason writes. Three Court of Appeal judges ruled unanimously that to allow the inquiry to proceed while civil litigation against the firm by BCCI's liquidators was continuing could cause substantial prejudice. The court granted an order quashing a decision by Sir John Bailey, the inquiry chairman, for the ICA's investigation to start immediately. It ruled that the inquiry could not start until the end of the civil litigation. This is not likely before 2000. The liquidators are claiming damages for negligence in connection with the 1985, 1986 and 1987 audits. The claim in regard to the 1985 audit is for more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn). Lord Justice Nolan said there was no urgency since there were no allegations of misconduct and no questions about the firm's fitness to remain registered auditors.</p>

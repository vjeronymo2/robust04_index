			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, June 15 (MAP) -- Morocco will maintain its  boycott of the meetings of the Organisation of African Unity  (OAU) as long as the `Polisario' [Popular Front for the  Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] continues to seat  [as received] there, said Ahmed Bensouda, adviser to King Hassan  II of Morocco.    In a statement published Tuesday by Saudi daily `UKAZ',  Bensouda said Morocco did not attend any OAU meeting since the  admission of the 'Polisario' and is still upholding its stands.  The so-called Polisario is bustling to hamper the holding of  the referendum in the Moroccan Sahara and wants a referendum  that fits its interests, said Bensouda recalling that several  members of the `Polisario' had joined Morocco, for they know  that the Sahara is Moroccan.    On Morocco's relations with Arab countries, Ahmed Bensouda  said King Hassan II is endeavoring along with Arab heads of  state to clear up the Arab atmosphere and preserve Arab  resources and capacities.</p>

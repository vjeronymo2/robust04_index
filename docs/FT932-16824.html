			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Week in the Markets: Breath of fresh air for gold bulls THE GOLD market moved out of the doldrums this week, bringing excitement back to the precious metals sector. The rise began on Tuesday on trade buying in Europe. US funds pushed prices higher, and the London bullion market broke through two important technical barriers at Dollars 334 and Dollars 336 a troy ounce to finish at Dollars 336.15, a rise of Dollars 4.30 over Monday. Such a bullish move spilled over into the silver and platinum markets. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed out that while volume had been thin, 'for a change producers did not spoil the show by selling forward.' This was probably because the Australian dollar price of gold had fallen, while the US dollar price was still relatively low. The rally continued full steam ahead early on Wednesday, taking the price above Dollars 340 a troy ounce. But the market closed at Dollars 337.80, a rise of only Dollars 1.70, leading to some suggestions that the rally would be short-lived as the Australian dollar was weakening and the price was near its peak in South African rand terms. However, Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation, suggested in his latest MetalsFax: 'In my view only a new wave of big sales can keep gold prices down.' He was particularly encouraged by the recent interest of institutional and substantial private investors in the gold share market. 'Retail (gold) investment activity in America and Europe - judging by demand for bullion coins and small bars - is showing renewed signs of life,' he said. On Thursday the entire precious metals market eased on light profit-taking. But all the charts - described by one observer as 'orgasmic' in technical terms - were indicating a breakthrough into a higher range. Yesterday the London bullion market was once again on the upward trail, with a morning fix of Dollars 339.40 and an afternoon fix at Dollars 340.10 - the highest level since October last year. News that Singapore had imported a record 414 tonnes of gold last year compared with 270 tonnes in 1991 added fuel to the flames, confirming the strength of demand in the Far East. Gold closed after a busy day at Dollars 339.75 a troy ounce, ahead Dollars 7.30 on the week, and dealers expect it to move into a new range above Dollars 340 a troy ounce next week. Silver closed at 394.50 cents a troy ounce, up 22.50 on the week, and appears poised to move above 400 cents. Platinum closed at Dollars 365.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 9.90 on the week. In contrast with the precious metals markets base metal prices on the London Metal Exchange have had a quiet week. The rise in warehouse stocks has continued relentlessly, and is likely to dampen any bullish sentiment. Copper stocks are up a total of 7,425 tonnes this week to 362,125 tonnes, the highest level for nine years. Cash copper shows a fall of Pounds 31 to Pounds 1,411 a tonne. But the important three-month dollar figure has been stuck below overhead resistance at Dollars 2,170 a tonne. The week's rise in aluminium stocks totals 11,025 tonnes, giving a fresh record of 1,736,325 tonnes. The gloomy fundamentals in this market took the three-month price below Dollars 1,150 a tonne on Tuesday to 14 1/2 -month lows, and it ended the week at Dollars 1,147.25, down Dollars 16.25 on the week. Zinc stocks rose above 600,000 tonnes yesterday to a new record. Three-month metal, which dipped below important psychological support at Dollars 1,000 a tonne on Thursday, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,006.5, down Dollars 4.75 on the week. If it falls below the contract low of Dollars 987 a tonne, some analysts believe it will rapidly retreat to Dollars 950. Stocks are likely to increase further, and recent production cuts have been nowhere near enough to boost prices. Production cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have failed to meet their target of 23.58m barrels a day by 700,000 b/d, estimates showed on Thursday. However, the figures were good enough to lift Brent crude prices out of their recent narrow range and above Dollars 19 on London's International Petroleum Exchange. In late trading yesterday the Brent June contract was holding above Dollars 19, although the opening of Nymex knocked the market back. The big news in the softs market this week was the collapse on Wednesday of talks on renewing the international coffee pact with economic clauses. The news arrived just after the London robusta market had closed, but in New York arabica prices closed around 2 cents a lb higher. On Thursday morning the London market moved sharply ahead on short-covering on the back of the New York close, but was unable to sustain the rally. Consumer stocks are high, and the peak roasting season has finished. The July contract closed yesterday at Dollars 839 a tonne, down Dollars 17 on the week and Dollars 26 since the start of the talks a fortnight ago. The markets have not expected the International Coffee Organisation negotiations over the past 12 months to produce anything positive. But nonetheless, each time an ICO meeting has ended in deadlock prices have been adversely affected. 'The talks have been a deterrrent to trading,' said one London dealer, welcoming the collapse. 'A cloud of uncertainty has lifted.'  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium        +9,200  to 1,736,325 Copper           +5,875  to 362,125 Lead             +700    to 246,475 Nickel           +702    to 87,612 Zinc             +1,350  to 601,175 Tin              -155    to 19,170  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: LBC frequencies under threat LBC, the London commercial radio station, is facing a powerful challenge for both its frequencies from a heavyweight consortium which includes Independent Television News and Reuters, the news and information group. The other consortium members are Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Evening Standard, SelecTV, the independent television producer, and GWR, the west of England commercial radio group which is also a significant investor in Classic FM. The group is applying for three franchises to offer three separate London-wide services dedicated to news, entertainment and business. The consortium is chaired by Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, and the appropriate consortium members would take the lead in running specific services. For example, SelecTV, which produces hits such as Birds of a Feather, would team up with GWR to provide the entertainment service. In addition to applying for both LBC frequencies to run news and entertainment the group also wants one of the two new AM franchises on offer to launch a dedicated business news channel drawing on the strengths of Reuters and the Evening Standard. In awarding the new frequencies the Radio Authority has made it clear it will favour applicants who propose to extend the choice available to listeners. LBC will go into the battle to hold on to its two London frequencies without a long-term managing director in place. Mr Charlie Cox, the current managing director, has resigned although he will not leave the company for at least two months. Mr Cox decided to quit now because he did not want to sign a new long term contract at LBC partly, at least, because he believes the style of the new owners will be different. Dame Shirley Porter, the LBC chairman, whose son Mr John Porter now controls the radio with his partner, Mr Matthew Cartisser, is expected to announce high profile new board members next Tuesday. Mr Christopher Chataway, the former LBC chairman, will be standing down as a direc-tor. Tuesday is the deadline for submitting applications to the Radio Authority for six existing London licences and the two new ones. Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank, has also put together a consortium to apply for one of the LBC frequencies. Mr Bruce Fireman, of Guinness Mahon, refused to say yesterday who the other backers were, but he confirmed that the group wants to run a news service. CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster, confirmed yesterday that it had teamed up with Trans World Communications to bid for a London licence. The applicants will want to offer a mixture of adult contemporary music.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Banks follow corporates into short-dated dollar sector Demand for short-dated dollar denominated debt finally persuaded some banks to follow the lead taken by the big corporates. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan both tapped the market, pushing the total raised via two-year and three-year dollar debt since AT&amp;T's successful issue last week to Dollars 2bn. Syndicate managers at the two banks were nervous about whether there was still enough appetite, but said they had been persuaded to issue by other banks who were continuing to see strong demand from continental Europe. Private investors who had liquidated their holdings in long-dated bonds to escape from volatile price moves at that end of the yield curve have recently been looking for a home for their dollars. JP Morgan served up the big deal of the day, raising Dollars 300m via three-year paper priced to yield 11 basis points above Treasuries. When the syndicate broke, the spread on the bonds widened to 14 basis points on the bid and some rivals argued that that niche had already been saturated and the US bank had come to the market too late. Syndicate managers were also bemused that a bank with such a high-profile name would need to joint-lead the issue with Morgan Stanley. JP Morgan said its banking arm was keen to maintain impartiality over the choice of syndicate managers and that Morgan Stanley had also bid aggressively for the business. In its view, the three-year debt offered a coupon of 6.5 per cent, compared with only 6 1/8 per cent for the two-year area, and demand was still strong. Deutsche Bank chose the two-year maturity for its Dollars 200m issue which was priced to yield 5 basis points over Treasuries and which maintained the spread after trading began. The bank, which arranged the issue with Goldman Sachs, said: 'We were sceptical but we had calls from intermediaries who had sold out of previous issues and wanted more and we got confirmation of the demand from our own investors.' Elsewhere, Olivetti raised L400bn through a five-year bond convertible into ordinary shares from January next year and offering an indicated yield of 7 to 7.5 per cent. The issue was targeted at Italian, US and European institutions.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS THERE A REBELLIOUS STREAK HERE?;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT: SOUTER CAME OF AGE AT THE DAWN OF THE '60S. DARE WE HOPE THAT  HE'LL EVENTUALLY VOTE THAT WAY?  </P> <P> I'd just been reading an interview with Justice William J. Brennan Jr. in the  June issue of Irish America when the news came that he was hanging up his  robes. What emerged in the interview was Brennan's consciousness of his  family's roots in immigrant and labor struggles, even though his father  eventually made it up the ladder, helping to capture Newark, N.J., from  upper-crust control.  </P> <P> Brennan's reminiscences are laced with a sense of history, a sympathy for the  travails of ordinary humans. The young crowd on the Supreme Court doesn't look  as though it spends much time thinking about what life looks like from the  bottom end of the barrel.  </P> <P> Brennan described how his father, an Irish immigrant, got a job shoveling coal  at Ballantine's brewery in Newark. He soon found conditions were very bad for  the workers there, so, in his son's words, "he started organizing within  Ballantine's and then spread around to the other breweries. . . . Remember,  there were no trade laws to help you in those days. You just had to fight your  way through."  </P> <P> Brennan's father did well enough in this strike to rise in the ranks of  organized labor around Newark. Next came a statewide trolley strike, eventually  broken because the police moved against it at the behest of the powerful  McCarter family that, as Brennan remembers, "really ran the state." In an  effort to ward off a more sweeping onslaught on their power, the city bigwigs  got Brennan's father appointed as a police commissioner, but "he promptly  showed where he stood in the labor disputes and that led to one fight after  another." In the end his father's forces "swept away the whole government" and  his father ended up running the Department of Public Safety. This paradigm,  that justice exists to serve everyone, evidently stuck with Brennan all his  life.  </P> <P> People poke through case decisions to try to figure out what a nominee to the  Supreme Court will be like. Another, sometimes more reliable guide is the  decade of birth and parental background. The old liberals, Brennan, Thurgood  Marshall and Harry Blackmun, all turned 21 around the time of the stock market  crash of 1929 and spent their early professional years watching the Depression  gnaw through the country. Marshall's father, William, grandson of a slave, was  a yacht club steward. Blackmun's father ran a hardware store in St. Paul. His  son has recalled that they lived in a blue-collar neighborhood and "because I  grew up in poorer surroundings, I know there's another world out there that  sometimes we forget about."  </P> <P> The next age cohort of justices are Byron White, John Paul Stevens and William  Rehnquist, born respectively in 1917, 1920 and 1924. White, a law-and-order  justice, had a dad in the notoriously anti-union lumber business. Alpha White  also served as mayor of Wellington, Colo. Stevens, as a justice somewhat of a  liberal individualist, was the son of a wealthy businessman and grew up in  Chicago's affluent Hyde Park. Chief Justice Rehnquist spent his childhood in a  well-to-do suburb of Milwaukee (which had a socialist mayor in the 1930s). His  father, William, was a wholesale paper salesman who never attended college. His  mother had a bachelor's degree. These parents instilled in young William a  reverence for Hoover, Landon, Wilkie and Taft.  </P> <P> The rest of Ronald Reagan's appointees -- Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia  and Anthony Kennedy -- all turned 21 in the swell of the Eisenhower '50s when  the tide still purported to lift all boats. O'Connor's father was a rancher in  the Southwest. Scalia's father, Eugene, was a professor of romance languages  who had immigrated from Italy. Kennedy's was a Catholic Republican lawyer and  lobbyist well-known in Sacramento.  </P> <P> It could be that from the liberal point of view, the great loss to the court  was Douglas Ginsburg, Ronald Reagan's failed nominee after the Robert Bork  debacle. Here was a child of the '60s who turned 21 in 1967, who left Cornell  for a year to run a dating service, who smoked at least one joint at Harvard.  His father, Maurice, was a mortgage financier, which always offers insight into  the human condition.  </P> <P> And David H. Souter, George Bush's nominee? He celebrated his 21st birthday in  the year that Richard Nixon lost the presidential race to John F. Kennedy, at  the dawn of the rebellious decade. His father was a banker. The family moved  from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. It doesn't seem good for liberals. But  there's always the encouraging shift of Blackmun, a Nixon appointment.  </P> <P> Souter looks to me like a pressure cooker of psychic repression. Maybe he  despised his father as a Nixon man and, if confirmed, will explode into  judicial activism and spend the next half century getting his own back. Let's  hope so. After the '60s, the soil that nurtured judicial greatness of the  Brennan type looks thin indeed.  </P></p>

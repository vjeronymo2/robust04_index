			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> WAR'S WAKE: You won't see Orange County in PBS' acclaimed Civil War documentary  this week, but the war had an effect here: It made possible the massive Irvine  Ranch. . . . At war's end, cotton trade with the South was so disrupted that  demand for wool skyrocketed. Four ranchers bought land here to graze sheep, and  one, James Irvine, above, eventually bought out the others and wound up owning  a fifth of the county's territory. Irvine's heirs later began development, most  notably in the city that bears his name. Michael Flagg and Mark Landsbaum  </P></p>

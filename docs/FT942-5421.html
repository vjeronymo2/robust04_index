			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Daily Mail Yesterday's Pounds 90m acquisition in regional newspapers is confirmation that Daily Mail and General Trust has moved onto the front foot. Gearing, which was uncomfortably high following the buy-out of Associated Newspapers in 1988, has been gradually lowered. Capital spending is now falling and the national newspaper titles are in fine fettle. With its bids for the national lottery and third national commercial radio licence both unsuccessful, Daily Mail is free to pursue other opportunities. Even allowing that T. Bailey Forman will improve on last year's Pounds 4.8m pre-tax profit, Daily Mail is paying a full price for a business already earning decent margins. But the Nottingham Evening Post is probably worth more to Daily Mail than to other bidders. Its Northcliffe regional newspaper empire has titles in most of the surrounding towns, so integration should yield cost savings. As one of the last independent regional newspaper companies, T. Bailey Forman was always likely to command a scarcity premium. Yet the main thrust of recent investments has been in other areas of the media. This week also saw a Pounds 7m acquisition in local radio. Substantial sums are being sunk into a cable television station for London and US multimedia interests. Given its record of picking winners  - the seed capital investment in Euromoney being a case in point - shareholders will be happy to back the company's judgment. The real test is whether Daily Mail can repeat its success outside the familiar world of newsprint.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW KIDS LEAVE TOWN A LITTLE POORER AFTER THEFT  </P> <P> With hundreds of frenzied young fans screaming farewells, the pop band New Kids  on the Block left town Saturday with a bang -- but without $100,000 cash that  was reported stolen along with their manager's briefcase, authorities said.  </P> <P> Amid a near mob scene at the Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood, someone allegedly  stole the briefcase from the group's business manager, James Rossi, 25, at  mid-morning Saturday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Rossi was checking out when he set his briefcase on the floor, only to discover  it missing a few minutes later, deputies said.  </P> <P> Deputies said they were uncertain why Rossi had so much cash, and he could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> About nine hours before the theft, deputies had to clear the hotel lobby of a  crowd of about 200 to 500 teen-age girls. Many fans followed the group to the  hotel after a Friday night concert at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> "I've been here three years," said hotel weekend manager Talia Levin, "and I've  never seen anything like this. It's just like the Beatles all over again."  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Tecs in a tangle MINISTERS should look hard at the FT's survey of Training and Enterprise Council directors, published today. It shows that these 1,220 individuals are committed to their task, generally satisfied with the progress of their organisations, but unhappy about the Tecs' relationship with government and in a fearful muddle about priorities. These findings are not difficult to explain. When it started setting up the Tecs three years ago, the government's official prospectus defined their task as 'to reskill the workforce and stimulate business growth.' It said the weighty task of running existing government programmes for the unemployed and young people would be 'a foundation' from which local leaders would 'assess economic and social needs, set priorities for action and direct resources accordingly.' This was the pitch that attracted an impressive crop of business leaders across the country to serve on Tec boards, alongside officials from the public sector and trades unionists. The reality has been that the Tecs have struggled to run these schemes, at a time of rising unemployment and constrained public spending. They have felt hemmed in, overburdened and subject to stifling bureaucratic oversight. This is why over 80 per cent of Tec directors say that their top priority is either local economic regeneration or in-company training rather than running the schemes. Denied freedom Two striking ironies occur. The first is that of the Tecs' budget this year of Pounds 2.3bn, Pounds 1.8bn will go on these programmes. The Tecs are thus being paid huge sums of money to do a task they do not much rate, while being denied freedom and funds to get on with the things their leaders think are most important. The second irony is that much to the Tecs' irritation, the government continues to encourage a proliferation of other types of agencies to stimulate economic regeneration. Two have been formed in London in the last six months, even though the capital has no fewer than nine Tecs. It is not that the Tecs' grumbles should all be taken at face value. Many of them have struggled to achieve acceptable levels of performance, although without published audits on individual Tecs it is difficult to gauge the scale of this problem. But there is a desperate need for some clear and co-ordinated thinking by government. Compound the muddle These are some of the questions ministers need to address: 1. How can responsibility for business advice, inward investment and local economic regeneration be rationalised at the local level? Mr Michael Heseltine's programme of one-stop shops will, on present plans, take years to implement. 2. How can Whitehall better co-ordinate its own efforts on training? Divisions between the departments of education, employment and trade and industry continue to compound the muddle and to make government a weak advocate for 'partnership' among competing local interests? It is notable that this problem is much less serious in Scotland, where the Scottish Office provides the necessary co-ordination. 3. What is to be done about the evident need (also highlighted in the survey) for greater national co-ordination of the Tecs' views and objectives? There is still a woeful inability at the national level to measure Britain's skills gaps and to plan to fill them. 4. Are Tecs, as currently constituted, the right bodies to run training schemes for the unemployed? At their best, the Tecs are emerging as dynamic local agencies, fostering the partnership upon which government rightly sets much store. But there is now a serious danger that having engaged the interest of business leaders, government is failing to follow through. It was an insight of the Thatcher years that government should not try to do business's job. There is currently a risk that the opposite fallacy will become entrenched - that business is able to do the government's job. If the government does not recognise its responsibilities, the still tender plant of the Tecs will run to seed.</p>

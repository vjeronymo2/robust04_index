			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cost control helps boost Sherwood 36% to Pounds 14.5m TIGHT CONTROL of costs and a high level of automation helped full-year profits at Sherwood Group, the lace and sock manufacturer, rise 36 per cent, from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 14.5m pre-tax. The Nottingham-based company is applying to move from the USM to the main market from May 11. It also announced a 4-for-1 scrip issue and the addition of a non-executive director to the board. These changes will 'help attract a wider shareholder base,' said Mr David Parker, chairman and chief executive. Turnover for 1991 rose to Pounds 118.2m (Pounds 95.8m) and earnings per share climbed 25 per cent to 54.5p (43.5p). The total dividend is lifted to 11.4p (9.1p) via a proposed final of 7.5p. The company was cash generative and saw gearing fall from 78 per cent to 44 per cent. 'It should be below 40 per cent by the end of 1992,' said Mr Parker. Sales by the company's garments operation were boosted by the acquisition last year of sock maker Samuel Eden. The acquisition of a second sock supplier, Charles W Hall, came too late to affect the figures. The division's turnover rose to Pounds 40m (Pounds 30.3m) and trading in the first few month of this year was 'ahead of budget' and close to a 10 per cent improvement on 1991. By contrast, lace sales this year have been virtually flat. In 1991, they were worth Pounds 79m (Pounds 66.7m). Margins in both lace and garments showed small improvements over the year. The company is sharply increasing capital spending from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 7.65m. The shares rose 10p to 790p. COMMENT Recent visitors to the company's headquarters may have wondered how it could afford to refurbish its offices with wood panelling in the middle of a recession. Now they know the answer. Sherwood employs as few people as possible and lets machines do the work. The six years since flotation have seen earnings grow 29 per cent compound each year. It will be hard to maintain that pace, especially since lace sales are flattening after two years of strong growth. Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 19m for a p/e of less than 13. The fickle world of fashion might yet deem lace to be passe, but Sherwood is one of the few growth stocks in a yield-dominated sector.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow supported by hopes of a rate cut Wall Street US MARKETS settled down with share prices holding their ground amid mounting speculation about a possible interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81 at 3,178.19, the index having spent all but the first few minutes of the day only a few points either side of Monday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also virtually unchanged at the finish, down 0.41 at 407.16, while the Amex composite added 1.09 at 367.71 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 5.34 to 570.55. Turnover on the New York SE was 197m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1033 to 727. Although the concerns about the economy and corporate earnings that were behind Monday's volatility were still dogging the market, investors switched their attention yesterday to the Federal Reserve's open market committee (FOMC), and prospects for a cut in interest rates. There was no sign from the committee of any policy shift yesterday, but many analysts were predicting that the FOMC would agree to a 25 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate, or a 50 basis point cut in the more important discount rate, or both. Normally, such predictions would have stimulated anticipatory buying, but in light of the market's unstable mood, investors were holding off until they had proof that rates were being cut. Among individual stocks, Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 in turnover of 3.3m shares after the bank announced that its third quarter profits would come in between eight cents and 13 cents a share, well below analysts' expectations. The stock's fall also represented investor concern about the sudden departure of the banking group's president, Mr Richard Braddock, who resigned on Monday night. Advanced Micro was one of the day's best performers, advancing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company unveiled third quarter net income of 51 cents a share, up sharply from the 16 cents a share of a year ago. Advanced Micro also said that it expected profits to grow even faster in the fourth quarter. Tyco Toys dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 13 3/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at the broking house Salomon Brothers, downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and cut his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates, citing weak retail sales, an unfavourable sales mix and rising advertising costs. On the Nasdaq market, some of the leading stocks which tumbled on Monday bounced back, including Microsoft, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 82 1/2 and Amgen Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 60 3/4 . Optrotech dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the Federal Trade Commission asked the company to delay its merger with Orbot Systems because of concerns about the effect of the link-up on competition. Canada TORONTO stocks broke a week-long down fallending with marginal gains after a day of cautious trade, dealers said. After losing more than 150 points last week, the TSE 300 closed up 1.96 points at 3,229.49, after swinging within a 21-point range in the morning. Volume was 25.5m and transactions were valued at CDollars 371 m.</p>

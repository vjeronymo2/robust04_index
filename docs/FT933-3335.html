			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian aluminium faces cost blow AN ENERGY price increase the Russian government is attempting to impose would drive the operating costs of the republic's aluminium smelters up to an average of Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above the present international market price, Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing at VAW, the German group, said yesterday. Already the domestic price for aluminium to Russia's consuming industries had risen to a level that was forcing some mills to consider importing metal from London Metal Exchange stocks, he said. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the Russian government was trying to lift energy costs to the world level in stages. Mr Peters said the government was unlikely to make the aluminium smelters pay all the latest price increase. The two big Siberian smelters, Bratsk and Irkutz, had already refused to accept the increase on the grounds that their power plant was dedicated to supplying them and was too far away from any other potential customers. However, he suggested at Metal Bulletin magazine's annual aluminium conference, that there would be some energy price increase, if not as large as the government contemplated. Those smelters that could not cover their costs would quickly have to close because they would not be able to pay for raw materials. Mr Peters' comments highlighted the complex background to the dispute between the European Commission and the aluminium producers in the CIS that resulted in restrictions being imposed on CIS aluminium imports into the EC until the end of November. Negotiations have re-started after the European holiday season and in talks last week the commission representatives made it clear that the EC was offering help to modernise the CIS industry and to revitalise domestic aluminium demand in the CIS in return for export restraint. According to Mr Peters, aluminium consumption in Russia dropped between 1988 and 1992 from 2.6m tonnes a year to 1.8m tonnes.</p>

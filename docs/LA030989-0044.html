			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MICHELLE SHOCKED: THE GAP BETWEEN ART AND ATTITUDE  </P> <P> Michelle Shocked, who headlined the Palace on Tuesday, is a Texas vagabond who  has been hailed as everything from a Joan Baez with humor to a female Woody  Guthrie.  </P> <P> In an age obsessed with technology and flash in pop music, Shocked favors plain  attire (a black cap, black sweater and jeans) and plays her songs on a $75  guitar she bought 10 years ago in a pawn shop. Even the lanky performer's songs  are simple -- at least on the surface.  </P> <P> Employing a folk singer's restlessness and innocence, she writes in her most  affecting numbers about such everyday matters as old dirt roads, volunteer fire  departments and kids' pranks.  </P> <P> In last year's highly acclaimed album "Short Sharp Shocked" she turned those  down-home images into wonderfully perceptive and original commentaries on  people's aspirations -- and the factors that sometimes crush or defuse those  dreams. Like much of Guthrie's work, the commentaries are occasionally laced  with a sharp social bite.  </P> <P> At the Palace, the freshness and warmth of the album's songs were especially  endearing. How surprising then that Shocked's manner seemed far less generous  and engaging.  </P> <P> While working hard at disarming the audience with a folksy informality (lots of  shy winks and aw-shucks smiles), she seemed discouragingly programmed.  </P> <P> Many of the song introductions were word-for-word and wink-for-wink repeats of  her set when she opened a few months ago for Billy Bragg at the Wiltern  Theatre. Even worse, there were signs of the ultimate protest singer's disease:  a patronizing attitude.  </P> <P> Shocked explained to the supportive Palace audience that she now lives in  London because she is disenchanted with the social apathy in her native land.  </P> <P> Rather than offer the charitable spirit of someone who wants to encourage  people to be more understanding, she acted as if anyone who disagreed is an  inferior being in need of scolding.  </P> <P> "This is a song about Vietnam," Shocked said sarcastically, in introducing an  anti-war song by the late Steve Goodman. "That was a war about 15 years ago."  </P> <P> Later, Shocked took on a discouragingly easy target: evangelical hucksters.  </P> <P> The obvious and heavy-handed moments contrasted sharply with the grace of the  album. They also raised questions about the future of Shocked's work -- work  that to this point has been exceptionally promising.  </P> <P> Because Shocked is female and sings in a folk-based style, she has been  frequently linked in pop trend pieces with Tracy Chapman and Suzanne Vega. But  Shocked is in no way a shadow of either artist.  </P> <P> There is a rural, open-spaces feel to her music, as opposed to the urban  tension of Chapman or the uptown sophistication of Vega. On record, where she  uses a band, Shocked offers inviting folk, rockabilly and roadhouse blues  touches.  </P> <P> At the Palace, where she was accompanied by just the $75 guitar, the music was  more plain, but the themes were no less engaging.  </P> <P> In songs such as "Memories of East Texas," Shocked sets the scene with a  greater sense of landscape than most pop writers. She speaks of the "pine-green  rolling hills" and "all the curves down by Kelsey Creek and the detour by  Lindsay's pasture."  </P> <P> In establishing the comfortable, everyday images of hometown sentimentality,  she is just setting up the listener for a twist at the end: a reflection on how  small towns can be intolerant and break the spirit of young mavericks.  </P> <P> The same sense of understated commentary -- and even fury -- is found in  "Graffiti Limbo," a story of a New York graffiti artist who died of  strangulation under reportedly cloudy circumstances after being arrested by  police.  </P> <P> But Shocked's artistry isn't limited to confrontation. "Hello Hopeville" is a  sweet tale of two people on the run, one eager to leave home and the other  looking for one after a long time on the road. Sample line, "He was waiting for  a station / Just like some people wait for a train."  </P> <P> With songs this graceful, there is no need to hammer people with sarcasm or  turn them off with smugness. The humanity of Shocked's work carries its own  power and persuasion. At the Palace, she needed to show more faith in that  humanity.  </P></p>

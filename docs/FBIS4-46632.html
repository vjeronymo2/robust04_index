			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KNGU press service officer Vira Valerko under </F> the rubric "The National Guard Trains Cadres": "New  Reinforcements for the Rear Services Troops"]    [Text] The Department of Military Management of the Kharkiv  Higher Military School of the NHU [National Guard of Ukraine]  was called before August of last year the Department of Food and  Mat&eacute;riel Support, and employed military-economic gaming as  an experiment with the cadets of the graduating class. Many  changes have occurred today, and games have now become a  constituent element of the educational process. Its title is  "The Operations of the Rear Services of the NHU Regiment in  Various Economic Situations."    This is, true, not just a game. The cadets took it  seriously,  since it revealed their capabilities and, most importantly,  their ability as future military specialists.    The dynamism with which the action began during the game did  not give them an opportunity to think for long, forcing the  immediate resolution of any problems and, later--profound  theoretical knowledge. The cadets played many roles over just  one day: senior officers and deputy commanders of units, chiefs  of the food and mat&eacute;riel services, young specialists in  rear  services. Business manager, say, or the chief of a bathhouse etc.    The point of the game, in the broadest sense, was to check  the quality of the assimilation of the basic curriculum,  evaluate the ability to orient themselves in situations that  arise unexpectedly, and evaluate their decision-making skills  and ability to plan and forecast their activity under the new  conditions of economic activity and supervise subordinates.  There was also one more important purpose of this game--to  assist the cadets in understanding and being aware of the harsh  realities of the present day.    It was carefully arranged into three stages: business,  role-playing and organizational-business games. And while the  first stage was an entirely pre-programmed affair with a plan  known in advance and a finish that was a hundred percent  predictable (the cadets were even permitted to use a great deal  of reference material), just the problem was put before the  cadets in the remaining ones. The actual methods, ways and  quality of their resolution depended on the level of training of  the cadets. Stereotyped scenarios thus had no success at all.  Only new, fresh and original solutions were suitably evaluated.  Each graduate was left alone with himself in the final stage,  and could count only on his own knowledge, quick thinking and  resourcefulness. Acting decisively, sometimes improvising, but  only within the bounds of the law, they were able to achieve  their aims and find foodstuffs, dress, technical gear, to  achieve precise reasoning in a persuasive key in their  discussions with the supplier, and to select that combination of  actions that would lead to success. The cadets, in other words,  were placed in extreme conditions that were as close as possible  to the actual state of affairs in our life.    It can be believed that they will withstand the difficult  trials of life in worthy fashion, as well as the rest of their  educational ones. The good results of the military-economic game  undoubtedly testify to that.</p>

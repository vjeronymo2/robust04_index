			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister  Chong Chae-sok said on Wednesday [12 January] he would reduce  the number of rank-1 posts of the Economic Planning Board [EPB]  by two to six from the existing eight to ensure an increase in  administration productivity.    In a press conference, Chong who concurrently controls the  board as its minister said the duties of the remaining six  rank-1 officials will be readjusted after the reduction.    "As other offices are expected to ask for increases in their  authorized manpower when they formulate their 1995 budgets in  May, it would be difficult to turn their requests down unless  the EPB scales down its organization first," Chong said.    He added that he would effect a reorganization of his board  on the condition that his board's senior officials endorse it.  "But, I will wind up the matter sooner or later without dragging  it on through April," Chong said.    The deputy premier also said that the major goal of this  year's economic operation is to bring about economic  energization in stability.    "We will display our determination to ensure stability by  pegging price rise down within 6 percent this year," he said.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Subsidies for farming attacked Arable farmers in England are receiving Pounds 759m a year in subsidies from taxpayers which bring virtually no environmental benefits, the Council for the Protection of Rural England said yesterday. Publishing a regional and county breakdown of Common Agricultural Policy subsidies to arable farmers, Mr Paul Wynne, the council's land use officer, said: 'The public is getting a bad deal. This expenditure compensates farmers for reduced price support but bears no relationship to environmental quality or management and asks remarkably little of them in return.' By contrast, he said, schemes which actively encouraged English farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices received just Pounds 27.1m in the past financial year. The survey highlights how the largest subsidy payments go to farmers in the country's most intensive cereal-growing regions, where wild plant and animal life are especially vulnerable. The government's Countryside Survey last year showed that the number of plant species had fallen 30 per cent in arable fields between 1978 and 1990. Lincolnshire arable farmers received the biggest payments last year, totalling nearly Pounds 68m, of which Pounds 55m was for growing crops and Pounds 12m was for leaving part of their land idle as 'set-aside'. Humberside ranked second in the survey, with its arable farmers receiving Pounds 40m, of which Pounds 7.4m was for set-aside, and Norfolk came third. English farmers were paid Pounds 253 a hectare for the 15 per cent of their land they were required to set aside in order to cut grain surpluses. They received Pounds 140 a hectare for growing cereals, and Pounds 400 a hectare for oilseeds such as rape. The council pointed out that only the set-aside payments, which make up Pounds 125m of the total, have environmental conditions attached to them. Mr Wynne urged the government to make all arable compensation payments conditional on farmers adopting 'positive management' of the environment.</p>

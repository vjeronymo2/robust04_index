			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA ADOPTS STRICT DOWNTOWN PLAN DESPITE CRITICISM  </P> <P> Concerned that Laguna's downtown business district is losing its quaint,  village charm, the Laguna Beach City Council on Tuesday adopted its  long-awaited Downtown Specific Plan, a sweeping design measure 7 years in the  making that many merchants believe is too restrictive.  </P> <P> The plan, which council members hope will keep the district from being overrun  by yogurt stands and T-shirt shops that abound in many California beach cities,  will require downtown's more than 400 shops and businesses to tow the line  regarding colors, building size, outdoor displays and even the kind of plants  they use.  </P> <P> However, many merchants decry the plan as heavy-handed and say that this time  the city has gone too far.  </P> <P> The City Council has "no damn right to say who goes in and who goes out," local  pharmacy owner Mack McCalla roared earlier Tuesday. "I think you'll find  everyone in downtown will call them a bunch of turkeys." And Jack Hansen, owner  of Axline's Village Shoes, groused: "I think the specific plan is  anti-business. Let's let free enterprise take its course."  </P> <P> But Councilman Dan Kenney said that free enterprise has run its course and that  in the process Laguna's unique identity has become diluted by a crush of  outside, tourist-oriented businesses. At the same time, he said, an alarming  number of resident-serving businesses have been pulling out.  </P> <P> "One of the questions I was first asked as a councilman was what can we do to  preserve our small-town atmosphere," said Kenney, who conceived the specific  plan shortly after being elected to the council in 1982. "Well, this is a real  major step in the right direction."  </P> <P> The plan becomes law in 30 days. According to a Downtown Specific Plan report  adopted by the council, the city then will have power under its zoning and  planning authority to:  </P> <P> * Curb the sizes of new businesses to one story and no more than 5,000 square  feet. Previous city ordinance allowed downtown businesses to have two stories.  </P> <P> * Forbid the use of fluorescent colors, large marquees, simulated materials and  highly reflective glass.  </P> <P> * Discourage businesses with a mass-market line of products, "since these  detract from the sense of distinction that is important to the downtown's  identity."  </P> <P> Under the plan, the city also plans to spend about $5 million on a number of  capital improvements, including: paving crosswalks with brick or textured  material, consolidating parking meters along Forest Avenue to make room for  pedestrians, paving alleys with cobblestones and putting in street lamps to  lure more pedestrians and landscaping Broadway at the entrance to downtown to  "create a boulevard effect."  </P> <P> No timetable has been set for the capital improvements.  </P> <P> The introduction of the specific plan report, which was prepared by the city  Planning Commission, explained that the new design rules were needed because of  "considerable concern" in recent years over downtown's changing character.  </P> <P> "In order to maintain Laguna Beach as a community with a unique character,  efforts must be made to protect the downtown with its eclectic mix of  architectural styles, small-scale buildings, pedestrian orientation, rich  variety of shops and services and sense of community," the report states.  </P> <P> Considerable public input went into the preparation of this report. Dozens of  meetings have been held over the years, first before a citizens' advisory  committee that was impaneled to draw up a set of recommendations and then  before the Planning Commission, which voted Dec. 14 to ask the council to carry  them out.  </P> <P> At its Jan. 10 meeting, the council voted 4 to 0 in favor of the first reading  of the plan, with Councilwoman Martha Collison abstaining because she owns  downtown property. The second and final reading of the plan was passed 3 to 0  Tuesday night, with Collison again abstaining and Councilman Neil G.  Fitzpatrick absent.  </P> <P> At a Jan. 10 public hearing before the council, local merchants asked the city  to postpone a vote on the matter until after an economic impact study could be  conducted to gauge the effect of the downtown plan. Tim Howell, secretary of  the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce and a vocal downtown plan critic, said the  study was needed to determine what impact the plan would have on taxes and  property values.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that this plan does not have any economic or marketing basis,"  Howell said. "This is nothing more than a land-use document."  </P> <P> The council members, concerned that such a study would dictate the plan,  decided to press on without commissioning a study. City Planning Commissioner  Becky Jones noted, though, that the downtown plan is to be evaluated for  problems on a regular basis. She also tried to assure merchants that the city  would not be inflexible in the implementation of the plan.  </P> <P> "We certainly do not dictate any color or that you will put this type of plant  there," Jones said. "We're not trying to create any kind of artificial,  Disneyland-type main street. We're trying to keep what we have."  </P> <P> But many downtown merchants were skeptical about the city being so tolerant,  charging that it has been inflexible in the enforcement of controversial sign  and outdoor-display ordinances adopted in recent years. The ordinances restrict  the size of signs and prohibit outdoor displays unless they are expressly  approved.  </P> <P> And as far as preserving downtown's ambiance, the merchants insist that they do  a good job of that without any outside help.  </P> <P> "We've already made it gorgeous," said one shopkeeper who asked not to be  identified. "And the city has done nothing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DOWNTOWN LAGUNA'S NEW LOOK  </P> <P> Here are some provisions of Laguna Beach's new Downtown Specific Plan:  </P> <P> New buildings are restricted to one story, unless second floor houses the  elderly or artists.  </P> <P> An entire street is set aside for the exclusive use of resident-serving  businesses such as barbershops, hardware stores and food markets.  </P> <P> Natural materials such as stone, brick, tile and wood are appropriate for  building use. Simulated materials must be "carefully reviewed for quality."  </P> <P> Clear or lightly tinted glass and glass blocks may be used, but highly  reflective glass is inappropriate.  </P> <P> Marquees should be in scale to the door they cover and the building facade.  They should not run the length of the facade. Large marquees are inappropriate.  </P> <P> The number of colors used on a building should be limited. Too many contrasting  colors can become "garish." Fluorescent colors "are not appropriate to the  village character."  </P> <P> Trash and storage areas must be screened by landscaping, fencing, berms or  other devices. Trash will be collected daily to avoid "intense" odors.  </P> <P> A list of recommended trees, shrubs and flowers will be established.  </P> <P> Alleys should be paved with cobblestones and decorated with street lamps to  encourage pedestrian use.  </P> <P> Parking meters along Forest Avenue, downtown's main pedestrian thoroughfare,  should be replaced with a less obtrusive meter.  </P></p>

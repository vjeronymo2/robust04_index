			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading offices in Singapore WIMPEY-WOH HUP, a Wimpey Group joint venture company working in Singapore, has won a Pounds 37m contract from the United Overseas Bank to carry out extensive structural alterations and a total refurbishment to a 32-storey tower block in the city. The company's 82-week project involves removing the roof structure of the Plaza 2 development to construct six additional floors of office accommodation and plant rooms. Other features of the scheme include the demolition of a banking hall which adjoins the base of the tower and the replacement of all electrical and mechanical services. The building will be completely reclad in new aluminium and granite panels. In this way, Plaza 2, which was built in the 1970s, will be modernised to reflect Plaza 1, a newly-built, 66-storey development on the same site. Internal partition walls, floors and ceilings will be removed and upgraded. The fit-out of all the building services in the tower - including installation of air-conditioning, fire, electrical, lifts, escalators and plumbing services - forms a major part of Wimpey- Woh Hup's contract. When the new work is complete, Wimpey-Woh Hup will have created some 39,000 sq metres of commercial office accommodation which will be available for rent.</p>

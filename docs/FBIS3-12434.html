Once again,  casualties and arrests.    In the territories residents defied the curfew in effect  almost everywhere in the West Bank and Gaza, blocking roads,  burning tires, and throwing stones. The most severe incident  took place in Salfit, near Tulkarm, where some 60 residents  surrounded an Army outpost, showering it with stones, bottles,  and petrol bombs. Soldiers emerged on foot to disperse the  demonstrators. They opened fire when one of the youths  brandished a knife. Five demonstrators were wounded, two  seriously. [passage omitted]    More troubling for the authorities are the ongoing  demonstrations in Arab communities within the Green Line. The  focus of the unrest shifted to Galilee today, where some 50  Israeli Arabs were arrested. In Nazareth youths blocked the main  road and threw stones at the bank, the post office, and  government offices. Police initially refrained from entering  the city in large numbers, but moved in early in the afternoon  to break up the demonstrations. Thirty three people were  arrested in the city. There were also large demonstrations in  Kafr Kana and Baqa al-Gharbiyah.    In East Jerusalem, two policemen and eight Palestinians were  wounded in clashes today.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 February  adds that "a Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car at  the Armon Hanetziv neighborhood this evening. The car was not  damaged. A rented car was set on fire at Wadi al-Jawz in East  Jerusalem, and a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Border Police  vehicle in the Old City of Jerusalem, but the vehicle was not  damaged. There were no casualties in these three incidents.    ["In the center of Hebron, several shots were directed at an  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrol not far from Gross Square.  There were no casualties. The patrol soldiers returned fire  and began searches."    [Also, "six masked people were caught in the village of  Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem; two youths who threw Molotov  cocktails at the security forces in Khan Yunus were detained;  and five youths who were on their way to committing arson were  caught at Wadi al-Jawz in East Jerusalem."]</p>

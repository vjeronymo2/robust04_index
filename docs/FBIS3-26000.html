Addressing a party held in the Great Hall of the People, Li  said that over the past 15 years, China has sent 200,000  students to study in other countries and 70,000 of them have  returned.    The leader praised returned students for their outstanding  contributions to reforms, opening up and China's modernization  drive.    "The present international and domestic situations are very  favorable to China's modernization drive," said Li, who is also  a member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee.    By deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside world,  promoting economic growth and maintaining stability, China is  trying to create a socialist market economy and step up the  development of social productive forces, he told the party,  sponsored by the State Education Commission.    According to the vice-premier, to achieve these goals, it is  imperative to continue opening wider to the rest of the world,  boldly draw on all useful experience over the world and score  achievements in the high-tech field.    In all these areas, returned students shoulder a "major and  glorious" task because of their expertise and knowledge, and  should make their due contributions, he told the party, attended  by 6,000 people.    The leader also praised those still studying abroad for  loving the motherland and supporting China's economic  construction and development. He invited more such students to  return home and work for the motherland.    He urged governments and departments at all levels, as well  colleges and universities, to provide fine working and living  conditions for returned students so that they will be able to  play a major role in the reform, opening up and the  modernization drive.    Hu Jintao, a Standing Committee member of the Political  Bureau of the party Central Committee, attended the party.    Before the party began, Hu Jintao and Li Lanqing met with 20  representatives of returned students.</p>

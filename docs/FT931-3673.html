			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Behind the public face of the Swedish labour model WHILE SWEDEN's unemployment record was the envy of the developed world in the 1980s, at home the popularity of Swedish-style social democracy waned. But the last two years of conservative government have yet to provide an attractive alternative. So far Prime Minister Carl Bildt's attack on the public sector has delivered a deep recession, a rising budget deficit and an increase in unemployment to very un-Swedish proportions. If his minority government loses next week's vote of confidence, forcing a general election in the summer, then the Swedish labour market model may yet be granted a reprieve. The evidence of the last two decades certainly suggests that voters should think twice before ditching Sweden's labour market institutions. From similar starting points in the early 1970s, Sweden's unemployment rate remained around 3 per cent throughout the 1980s while rates in most other OECD countries soared into double figures. Sweden's average unemployment rate actually fell by 0.2 percentage points between 1968-73 and 1985-90 compared to a rise of 5.1 percentage points in Germany and 5.9 percentage points in the UK. Yet the conventional explanations for Sweden's success - centralised pay-bargaining and re-training schemes for the unemployed - do not seem satisfactory. Even countries such as Australia, which had relatively successful co-ordinated pay-bargaining systems and thus above average real wage flexibility, suffered a large rise in structural unemployment in the 1980s. And while Sweden's active labour market programmes pushed a quarter to a third of outflows from unemployment into relief work and training, the OECD has not been able to find empirical evidence to suggest that they actually improved the job prospects of participants. In any case, they absorbed on average less than 3 per cent of the labour force in the 1980s. The missing element in Sweden's success story is public sector employment. Sweden has traditionally had a larger government sector than other European countries, as the chart shows. But while the share of government employment in total employment rose by 2.1 percentage points in Germany between 1974 and 1990, and actually fell marginally in the UK, it rose by 6.9 percentage points in Sweden over the same 16-year period. Sweden was not alone. Aside from the dramatically small size of Japan's government sector, the striking feature of the chart is the rapid growth of public employment across the Nordic countries, all of which, with the exception of Denmark, maintained very low unemployment rates by European standards in the 1980s. This growth of public sector employment also helps how the Nordic countries were able to avoid the rise in wage inequality that plagued many other developed countries as a result of the declining demand for unskilled labour. The growth in part-time employment among unskilled workers in the UK and US in the 1980s, largely in the private sector, required a large fall relative in the wages of low paid workers. But in Sweden, the burden was borne not by low paid workers but by taxpayers who financed the growth in better-paid public sector jobs. By 1988, total Swedish taxes had risen to 55 per cent of gross domestic product, compared to a European average tax share of 41 per cent. The choice for Sweden's voters ought now to be relatively clear: a smaller public sector should allow lower marginal and average tax rates but it will also mean European-style unemployment rates. Sweden's wage-bargaining system has again delivered a rapid fall in inflation by international standards but this time Mr Bildt's public sector cuts mean it has been accompanied by a rise in unemployment to more than 7 per cent of the labour force. Yet there is one complication: unemployment benefits in previously low unemployment Sweden are worth 90 per cent of previous earnings, much higher than in other countries. So unless the government is prepared to cut welfare payments while unemployment is still rising, it may find tax cuts hard to deliver, a fact which could simplify the electorate's choice.</p>

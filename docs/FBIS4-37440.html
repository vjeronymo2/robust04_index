			<p>BFN     [Text] Fresh trade worth $20 million has been contracted  between India and China during the current visit of the Chinese  minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation, Ms Wu Yi,  to India.    This was disclosed by Ms Wu while addressing a meeting  organised jointly by the Federation of Indian Chambers of  Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Associated Chambers of  Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) under the aegis of the  Joint Business Council (JBC) here on Wednesday.    The trade contract envisages an import of $5 million worth  of  raw silk and $7.5 million worth of pig iron from China and an  export of $7.5 million worth of iron ore to China, she said.    She said the Indian government and China were striving for a  direct trade link to do away with the intermediaries. She said  both the governments were already seized of the issue.    Exuding optimism about the two-way trade and economic  cooperation between the two countries, she said there would be  more exchange of business delegations and also economic  cooperation in areas like science and technology between the two  countries.    Later, addressing a press conference, she said the Chinese  government was very strict about anti-dumping regulations, and  said penal legislation would be brought out shortly for those  exporters who were indulging in export of products at  artificially low prices, and also indicated that the  international trade licence of these exporters would be  cancelled if warnings on dumping are not heeded.    Earlier, at a meeting between Chinese businessmen and  members  of Ficci and Assocham, a senior official of the external affairs  ministry disclosed that a double taxation avoidance treaty would  be signed shortly between the two countries.    Other steps being taken to establish direct trade links  between the two include setting up of bank branches in each  others' country to circumvent the problems being faced in  opening letters of credits and establishing direct shipping  lines and air services.    Officials of the external affairs ministry present during  the  meeting informed that the Reserve Bank of India and the Peoples  Bank of China would shortly sign an agreement for setting up  branches in each others' country. They said the State Bank of  India was ready to set up a branch in Shanghai soon.    In his address, the Assocham president, Mr G H Singhania,  said that taking advantage of the recent spurt in Sino-Indian  bilateral trade, which presently hovered around $600 million,  the JBC should set a target of $3 billion in the next three  years.</p>

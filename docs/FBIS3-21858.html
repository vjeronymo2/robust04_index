			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, March 7 (AFP) -- A crisis is  brewing in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley where farmers are  determined to defy a ban on planting hashish unless the  government keeps its promise to help find an alternative crop.    Farmer say they are ready for a new confrontation with the  authorities, two years after the government eradicated hashish  and poppy fields in cooperation with Syrian intelligence  services.    "I'm afraid of God and no one else," said 65-year-old Zayd  Sharif, banging his cane on the ground where hashish once grew  freely and earned farmers and smugglers between 500 million  dollars and one billion dollars per year.    The season to grow hashish in eastern Lebanon begins at the  end of March.    Sharif and other farmers, according to experts, earned about  15 percent of hashish earnings, with the rest going to smugglers  and merchants, but it was enough to secure what many people here  call "a decent life."    "Hashish meant I could build a stone house to replace my mud  house. It helped me feed, clothe and educate my children,"  Sharif said. "If my son went hungry, I'd even kill my brother to  feed him."    Sharif said his family was now in need because the  government  reneged on promises to help find an alternative crop to hashish.    Like other farmers Sharif never saved money from his hashish  earnings for a rainy day. "I never thought that day would come,"  he said.    A security official in the region said farmers had been  warned time and again to avoid dealing with hashish. Violators  -- farmers, merchants and smugglers -- can face up to seven  years in jail.    The authorities in 1992 launched a massive crackdown on  widespread hashish and poppy growing in the al-Biqa' with the  help of Syrian troops who have been deployed in Lebanon since  1976.    Around 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of hashish were destroyed  in 1992. The following year, some farmers took up arms to  resist but the authorities burned 100 hectares (250 acres) of  hashish.    Bernard Frahi of the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) told a  regional meeting in Damascus last month that the Syrian-backed  campaign had been "successful in eradicating illegal crops" from  the al-Biqa'.    But the former director of the state-run Green Plan project,  'Abdallah Yazbik, dismissed this as wishful thinking.    "They are fooling themselves unless they adopt a grass-roots  plan to improve agriculture in the region, provide farmers with  subsidies, financial and expert assistance and a means to sell  their produce," Yazbik told AFP.    On February 7, Lebanon signed a 4.2 million-dollar deal with  the UNDCP and the UN Development Programme to help farmers grow  alternative crops, sell their produce and improve irrigation in  the Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil area of eastern al-Biqa'.    Yazbik said the project had been on the back-burner since  1990. He linked its full implementation to peace in the Middle  East.    "It's a five-year plan. The first phase of it which was  signed last month involves lending farmers money to get started  on planting new crops," he said.    "But how can you sell a 4.2 million dollar project to people  who were earning between 500 and 600 million dollars annually  from hashish? It's ludicrous," he said.    Yazbik, farmers and experts agree that the authorities are  not addressing the problem seriously and that the issue is not  only hashish but the overall situation of agriculture in Lebanon.    The al-Biqa', dubbed Lebanon's bread basket, has  traditionally suffered from a lack of private and public  investment, and because of the war the situation has  deteriorated.    'Ali Ra'd, a veterinarian employed by the UN's International  Fund for Agricultural Development, called for a long-term  project in which international organisations would work hand in  hand with the farmers.    "The frightening thing is that during a recent survey of the  al-Biqa' an expert told us `there is no alternative to hashish,'  and that's the truth unless we launch a long-term project to  rehabilitate the entire sector.    "We need to survey our animal wealth, establish studies to  see what are the best cash crops for the area, improve  irrigation but also build schools, roads, and clinics for the  villages and set up cooperatives," he said.</p>

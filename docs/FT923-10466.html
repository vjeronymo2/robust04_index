			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin American Debt Crisis: Two principles of 1970s lending that now seem dubious - Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? MANY an international bank director must have grimly muttered 'never again' when Mexico declared itself unable to meet its international debt obligations. Ten years later, as those self-same bankers ponder the losses they have notched up on property loans, they must be wondering whether they can ever exercise the right degree of self-control in lending. Perhaps one lesson from the past 10 years is that banks are condemned to lose money. Market pressures to lend are such, and creditworthy borrowers so few, that bankers will never learn to cope with risk. In that sense, the developing country debt crisis was only a manifestation of a deep natural flaw in the banking industry. The philosophy underlying the boom in syndicated lending to developing countries in the late 1970s rested on two principles that now appear highly dubious. The first was the claim, expounded by Mr Walter Wriston, head of then mighty Citibank, that sovereign borrowers can never go bust. The second was the belief that an ever-increasing volume of loans could be syndicated indefinitely to an ever-widening community of banks. By the time Mexico finally ceased paying 10 years ago, big US money centre banks were hawking Mexican credits to domestic banks in Thailand. At a time when US inflation was well into two digits, real interest rates were negative and commodity prices were rising, the argument that countries could never default seemed seductively convincing. Mr Wriston used to claim that governments could come and go, but countries - the real debtors - would always survive. They had assets which could be seized if necessary. Only a few officials, such as Mr Henry Wallich, the late Federal Reserve Board governor, voiced doubts. He memorably described the notion of sovereign immunity from default as being as elusive as the smile on the vanishing face of the Cheshire cat. Of course, no one really ever expected the borrower countries actually to repay debts. The idea was simply that they should always be seen as creditworthy enough to ensure they could borrow more when old loans became due. Yet the sense of well-being proved illusory. When the crisis struck, it was fashionably interpreted as a problem of liquidity. The debtor countries were still capable of repaying their debts over the longer term, but for the time being they simply required more cash than the market was capable of providing. The underlying assumption was that as soon as confidence returned, the market would restore the flow of credit. Even after the first trouble struck there was no real challenge to the central assumption that the banking system could generate an infinite amount of credit. The process whereby new lenders bought out old ones had come to be seen as perfectly acceptable. The rush of lending to developing countries had been encouraged by industrial country governments in the early 1970s as a means of shoring up the world economy after the initial oil shock. Nonetheless, as syndicated lending developed, it acquired some of the characteristics of the chain letter. At some point capacity was almost bound to be exhausted. Once the crisis struck, the natural inclination of the banks was to turn away from sovereign lending to domestic business. They thought they could understand the risks, there would be no problem with transfer payments, and they could more easily take security. The problem was that the banks themselves had become less creditworthy than many of their best customers. Top corporations were able to borrow in the commercial paper market at rates lower than the banks charged each other for deposits. Where banks continued to lend domestically they were thrown back on lesser credit risks, which may help explain the headlong rush into leveraged buyout lending in the US. Where they wanted a continued relationship with better-quality borrowers they were thrown back on to techniques such as note issuance facilities which were borrowed from the securities market. Such facilities allowed borrowers to raise long-term funds by the continuous issuance of short-term securities. The paper was placed with investors by the same leading banks which had once dominated the syndicated loan market. The attraction for the arrangers was the generation of fee income through a service which did not necessarily use up space on the balance sheet. The attraction for investors, which often included smaller banks, was that they were under no obligation to repurchase the securities every three or six months as they fell due. Their portfolio thus became more liquid. It all looked like another wonderful wheeze, but the catch was that the managing banks also had to promise to provide back-up credit to ensure that the borrower could always redeem the short-term securities even if his financial position unexpectedly deteriorated. Suddenly the world's largest banks were piling up multi-billion dollar contingency obligations which were not carried in their balance sheets and against which they had no formal obligation to provide capital. Worry about these hidden obligations was an important driving force behind the establishment in the mid-1980s of the so-called Basle ratios for bank capital. The ratios, however, will doubtless also be seen as a lasting legacy from the debt crisis. Agreed under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements, they are meant to ensure banks have enough capital not just in relation to total assets but also to reflect the type of risk they are running on and off the balance sheet. One hope was that this would encourage banks to price business more directly in relation to risk. To judge by the way in which even the most reputable of international banks, such as Barclays and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, have burned their fingers on property lending, the stricter Basle ratios have failed to persuade the industry to take this point on board. The debt crisis itself is on the wane, but the central bankers may not yet have had their last word. Editorial Comment, Page 16</p>

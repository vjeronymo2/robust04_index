			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League General  Secretariat has urged the international community and the two  sponsors of the peace process--Russia and the United States--to  immediately and urgently adopt the necessary measures that would  guarantee Israel's respect of international legitimacy's  resolutions.    The Arab League also called on the Security Council to  provide as soon as possible the mechanism necessary to protect  the Palestinian people against the atrocities carried out by the  Israeli occupation forces.    In a statement issued today, the Arab League General  Secretariat says that in the past it had warned of acts of  violence against the Palestinian citizens in the occupied lands.  In its statement, the Arab League says: At a time when the  world is waiting for the implementation of Security Council  Resolution 904 concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the  Israeli occupation authorities have carried out an 18-hour siege  of a three-story building in Hebron. The Israeli forces opened  artillery fire on Palestinian citizens, killing a number of  them, including two women, one of them pregnant.    The statement affirms that Israel has once again proved its  disregard of international resolutions and the appeals of  international society.    The Arab League said that Israel is endeavoring to torpedo  the peace process despite its claims on the issue of peace.  This might undermine the Arab public's confidence in the  on-going efforts, in view of the clear contradiction between the  call for peace and the efforts to achieve it.</p>

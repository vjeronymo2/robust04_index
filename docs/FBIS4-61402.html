			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and </F> Lyudmila Yermakova]    [Text] Moscow, 5 May -- Civil accord is essential now "more  than ever, so that we can roll up our sleeves and work for  Russia," said Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian  Government, opening the second phase of signing of the Treaty on  Social Accord in the Kremlin today. He called the document "a  good medicine for treating the civil war syndrome not only in  politics but in the economy, too".    In the opinion of the head of government, people "who are  advancing the reforms, and by whose hand the domestic economy is  being moved, remaking itself" had assembled in the Vladimir Hall  of the Kremlin. Addressing industrialists, bankers, and  farmers, Chernomyrdin stressed that the Treaty meets the main  task "of seeking out civilized ways of bringing together  personal views and approaches in order to develop the economy."  In his view, this search should go beyond the field of  political confrontation, "where nothing can be grown except  weeds."    The head of government noted that the president, government,  Federal Assembly, political parties, and public movements had  made considerable efforts to get going the kind of machinery  which could generate ideas and bring conflicting sides together.  He believes that the Treaty "is only the start of the search  for accord. The most important part of this idea is still  ahead."    The prime minister assured people that the government had  taken on specific pledges to deal with the paramount tasks "to  stabilize the situation, move the economic reforms forward,  reduce the inflation rate, implement structural reorganization,  increase investment activity, and create the conditions for  development of the agro-industrial sector". Chernomyrdin  expressed the hope that active support for this would come from  the entrepreneurs, bankers, leaseholders, and all businesses.  He sees implementation of the Treaty only through working  together. He also gave assurances that the government was  obliged to pursue an active social policy aiming to target  support at the vulnerable in society.    "We are now at the height of the crisis, but we can already  feel solid ground beneath our feet," the head of government  noted. In his opinion, "we need to push off from here and move  upwards. To do that we need accord and the conscientious work  of every member of society". "We cannot allow ourselves to have  a crumbling state," the head of government stressed.</p>

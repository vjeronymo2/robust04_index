			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 26 (YONHAP) -- The four-day-old strike  by railroad and subway workers entered a new phase Sunday as  police launched a pre-dawn raid on two Seoul universities to  disperse thousands of striking workers and round up more than 80  of them.    Over 5,000 police forces broke into Kyung Hee University in  northeastern Seoul around 5 A.M. Sunday to scatter about 1,800  striking railroad and subway workers and sympathizing students  and arrest key striking members.    Most of the workers and students who had been staging a  sit-in at Kyung Hee University against the government's  hard-line policy on railroad and subway labor disputes fled the  Kyung Hee campus just before the police raid.    Some of the students and workers resisted strongly to the  police raid hurling hundreds of firebombs and wielding steel  pipes for about 20 minutes before running away to Dongduck  Women's University where their colleagues fled.    Police then raided Dongduck Women's University again around  6:30 A.M. to apprehend 62 unionized workers and 23 students and  to forcibly disperse others. The operation lasted about 20  minutes.    Informed about the imminent police raid, most of the workers  and students had escaped Kyung Hee University around 4 A.M. and  about 800 of them gathered at Dongduck Women's University later.    Police, in the meantime, secured arrest warrants for 12  leading striking workers including Kim In-hwan, head of the  labor union of Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp. (SMSC) and So  Son-won, chairman of the unauthorized unionized group of train  engineers and mechanics "Chongihyop" for their suspected  violations of labor dispute laws and obstruction of official  duties, according to a police spokesman.    Police said in a statement that it was forced to mobilize  the  police forces to arrest the SMSC union leader Kim In-hwan and  four other core members in the strike and to soon reinstate  those who want to return to their works so that the crippled  subway and railroad operations could be normalized.    Police accused the striking workers of violating labor  dispute laws because they embarked on a general strike last  Friday despite the fact that the laws prevent unionists from  staging a strike or any form of collective actions within 15  days from the central labor committee announced the cooling-off  period for mediation. The committee had issued the 15-day  cooling-off period last Wednesday.    Police, meanwhile, decided not to break into Myongdong  Cathedral in downtown Seoul, the largest opposition Democratic  Party (DP) headquarters in Yoido and a Seoul church hall where  striking railroad and subway workers are staging sit-ins, taking  into consideration the status of the venues as religious and  politically sensitive ones, according to the police spokesman.    The SMSC unionists have been staging a general strike since  Friday, three days earlier than they originally set for the  strike in protest against the police raid last Thursday on the  place where Chongihyop members were staging a sit-in. Since  then they have occupied the DP headquarters, Myongdong  Cathedral, and a few other religious and academic institutions  to stage sit-ins.    The SMSC has so far filed a complaint with the prosecution  against 41 leading union members for their alleged labor dispute  law violations and relieved 24 union leaders of their posts in  connection with the ongoing strike.    In the meantime, 3,647 workers or 55.7 percent of the total  railroad workers reported to work by 10 a.m. Sunday, the  deadline set by the Korean National Railroad (KNR), arousing  hopes that the operation of railroad could be put to a normal  condition sooner or later.    The KNR said that it expected part of the railroad services  in Seoul and its vicinity to be normalized starting Monday,  adding it was still accepting intentions by striking workers to  return to their works although the initial deadline expired  Sunday morning.    Only 36.7 percent or 3,204 workers of the total Seoul subway  workers, however, reported to work as of Sunday morning,  thwarting hopes to resume normal subway operations as early as  possible, according to the SMSC.    In particular, only 5.0 percent or 46 of the total 920  locomotive engineers returned to their works and just two  percent of the total conductors reported to work.    To help normalize the railroad operation, the Ministry of  Defense decided to provide the KNR with 350 additional 350  military personnel who are capable of assisting in the operation  of locomotives, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman.    The Ministry of Defense also said that it will soon put into  service 270 military locomotives in Seoul and Pusan to ease  traffic congestion stemming from the railroad workers strike.    Last Thursday, the Defense Ministry had sent 64 soldiers  capable of operating locomotives to the Transportation Ministry.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Personal View: An ill-advised way to manage trade In his recent book, Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic Conflict, and his article in the FT ('Good and bad of managed trade', August 18), C Fred Bergsten defends his case for voluntary import expansion agreements. He differentiates them from protectionism - namely voluntary export restraint agreements - and argues that expansion agreements are pro-trade and useful to improve access to the Japanese market. I believe there are real risks in implementing voluntary import expansion agreements (VIEs). It is possible to introduce them only with the Japanese government's active meddling with the market. Vague words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'encourage' used in existing VIEs are synonymous with an invitation to open-ended government interventions. It is very confusing that, on the one hand, the US government urges more market-oriented, pro-consumer policies in Japan while, on the other, it calls for more market intervention through VIEs. If we want to let market forces work in consumers' best interests, intervention will be counter-productive. It will result in further control and market regulation. Mr Bergsten argues that VIEs expand trade and enhance competition. But they are also anti-competitive. How can an agreement enhance competition if it pro-hibits at least 20 per cent of Japanese users from buying domestic chips? Regarding Mr Bergsten's call to use VIEs only temporarily, it seems unlikely that once they are in place there will be any inclination to get rid of them. For example, after the initial five-year period, the Reagan administration's semiconductor VIE was extended for another five years. Is a 10-year period temporary? What makes Mr Bergsten confident they will not be used indefinitely with increased import targets? It is much more difficult to terminate VIEs than to initiate them, and no one has ever succeeded in doing so. In spite of Mr Bergsten's second caution that VIEs be used sparingly, how can business executives resist them when their governments will do the job of developing a foreign market free of charge? The cost of forced imports is borne by the targeted country, and the other country loses nothing by demanding a VIE. Mr Bergsten suggests VIEs should be open to all countries and denounces the Bush VIE on car and car parts, which benefits only US companies and which, according to Mr Bergsten, Mr Clinton firmly rejects. But in our bilateral consultations, the Clinton administration seems to be pursuing the same approach vigorously. In Reconcilable Differences?, Mr Bergsten writes that the semiconductor VIE can take substantial credit for the increased share of foreign companies in that Japanese market. But market share depends on the efforts of companies and the market situation, and it is not something that an official text can determine. At present, we see some worrying signs of deterioration in the Japanese economy. It would come as no surprise if the economic environment became less conducive to imports. Business people tend to be discouraged by VIEs from making their products more competitive. Instead, they are encouraged to press their governments for a guaranteed slice of a foreign market. The fact that when then-President George Bush visited Tokyo he was accompanied by three car industry executives supports this view. It is imperative in our market economy to get straight what the government is supposed to do and not to do, and to have business people take responsibility for business matters. They should not be given a way to blame others for what is their own fault. VIEs are becoming increasingly out of date as corporate activities become more globalised. The sourcing of parts and components, foreign investment and the movement of technology and money on a global scale are now a matter of fact. Corporate alliances among companies of different nationalities in research and development, production and marketing are spreading throughout the world. As a result, the nationality of a company and product is now so complex and difficult to identify that any definition of imported or foreign product is arbitrary and incomplete. Mr Bergsten plays down the risk of inviting unrestrained government interventions, and blurs distinctions between public and private sectors. Consequently he fails to appreciate the self-perpetuating and contagious nature of VIEs. Our experience suggests that they will not work in the way he expects.

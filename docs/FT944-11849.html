			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Warhol leads Christie's auction Christie's held one of its most successful auctions of contemporary art ever in New York on Wednesday night, raising Dollars 14.56m (Pounds 8.8m) and with 44 of the 50 lots finding buyers. In terms of value the auction was 96 per cent sold. Given the nervous state of the market in the last four years this was a great achievement, suggesting that Christie's had been shrewd in its choice of works to sell and in its reserves and estimates. The top price was the Dollars 3.63m paid for an Andy Warhol silkscreen portrait of Marilyn Monroe, 'Shot Red Marilyn', which had a Dollars 3m top estimate. The work, considered the best of Warhol's many Marilyn portraits, gained its title after a would-be assassin shot the picture rather than the artist. In May 1989, at the top of the market, it had sold for Dollars 4.07m to the Japanese collector Masao Wanibuchi. There were new auction records for four artists, including Donald Judd, Sigmar Polke, Francesco Clemente, and the notorious Jeff Koons - Dollars 233,500 for a stainless steel bust of Louis XIV. Other high prices in an auction dominated by American collectors were the Dollars 596,500 for 'Untitled' by Anselm Kiefer, which was bought by the North Carolina Museum of Art; Dollars 574,500 for 'Canopic Head, 1951', a steel sculpture by David Smith, the leading abstract expressionist sculptor of the 1950s; and Dollars 530,500 for another large steel sculpture by Smith, 'Primo Piano I'.</p>

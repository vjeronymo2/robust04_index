			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Prokofiev's 'Fiery Angel' Among the many artistic effects of glasnost, few have been as extraordinary as the way in which the Kirov Opera has been galvanising opera worldwide. Not only has the Kirov company made influential tours to London, New York and other Western cities, but its individual members are also making regular appearances with Western troupes. And, with their help, certain Russian operas are becoming more widely known in the West. Prokofiev's Fiery Angel is a case in point. Suddenly it has become the property of Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus. They performed it at the 1991 Albert Hall Proms, and again in 1992 in David Freeman's staging - a co-production between Covent Garden and the Kirov. The central role of Renata is notoriously taxing, but it has become Gorchakova's international calling-card. After she and Leiferkus sang Renata and Ruprecht in London - conducted, both at the Albert Hall and at Covent Garden, by Edward Downes - they sang it in New York as part of the Kirov's 1992 season at the Met, with Valery Gergiev conducting. Now, in a new production by Giancarlo Cobelli, conducted by Riccardo Chailly, they are singing it at La Scala, Milan. Let me say at once that I doubt whether any lesser singers could keep me in an opera house for the length of this awkward opera. The Fiery Angel - or L'Angelo di fuoco - is on one level a drama of remarkable psychic possession; Renata and Ruprecht are like characters out of Dostoyevsky. On another level, however, it is terribly static. And the musical modernism of Prokofiev's vocal writing, though always intense and alert, is strangely externalised. We want to enter the nervous systems of the haunted Renata and her obsessively loyal knight Ruprecht, but the music keeps us out. Cobelli's La Scala staging could hardly be less like Freeman's. The basic story is told in terms of fairly straight-forward realism in the front half of the stage, while distant visions show the symbolic characters of whom we hear: the fiery angel, Renata herself as a young girl. Gradually, the real and unreal worlds become more and more mixed and confused. I am grateful for the degree to which the story's basic historical setting is maintained - nor do I miss those lumbering acrobats, covered in talc, who so percolated Freeman's staging. (Freeman, however, achieved greater force in the final scene, when the nuns start baring their breasts. Cobelli's nuns wear artificial bosoms: which one observes with altogether greater detachment.) But the opera itself lacks moment-by-moment dramatic tension, and neither staging can solve this problem. Chailly's conducting is of the highest order, combining power, intensity and beauty. Every vocal line is clear and the international cast is fused into an impressive ensemble. Leiferkus, with his wonderful blend of virile integrity and stern psychological force, remains an ideal Ruprecht. And it is a thrill simply to hear the exceptional clarity of his diction. You feel that no other singer in the world could make so much simply from singing Renata's name; he gives it ardour and urgency, while at the same time enouncing it as firmly as if he were engraving it on marble. As for Gorchakova, I am as obsessed with her as Ruprecht is with Renata. Her voice is huge, dark and heroic; and, as she wields it in marvellously sweeping phrases, it makes an incomparable effect in a large opera house. I use the word 'incomparable' advisedly; never in live performance have I heard a voice that has so excited me. I hope that La Scala soon can hear her in other Russian roles. And, remembering that Leiferkus is now as well known here in French and Italian music as in Russian, may we hope that we can soon hear Gorchakova sing Verdi? She has sung Trovatore and Force of Destiny in Russia. Glasnost should work two ways. These Russians singers have much to reveal to us of their own heritage, but the Western repertory can help reveal them yet further, both to us and to themselves. Prokofiev's L'Angelo di Fuoco, sung in Russian, continues in repertory at La Scala until January 28</p>

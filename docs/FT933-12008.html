			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke pledge to maintain tax relief on mortgages MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, has given a new commitment that the government will maintain mortgage tax relief. His statement came in the Treasury response to a cross-party committee report which said that ministers were phasing out the tax relief 'by stealth' through limiting its value and coverage. The response rejected the invitation from the Treasury committee of MPs to state explicitly the policy of gradually reducing mortgage tax relief, explaining instead that the purpose of the changes had been 'to improve the targetting of the relief and contain its substantial costs to the Exchequer'. The Treasury said: 'Some 10m borrowers continue to benefit from mortgage interest relief, the largest number ever. The government intends to maintain mortgage tax relief.' Relief will be restricted to the 20 per cent tax rate from 1994-95, under proposals made in the March Budget this year, following its restriction to the basic rate in 1991. Tory rightwingers have long argued for the abolition of the tax relief, which is estimated to cost the Exchequer Pounds 4.3bn in 1993-94, but its continued existence has been protected because its removal would be so unpopular. The need to tackle public borrowing had raised speculation that the scale of the relief might be cut further in the November Budget - perhaps by time-limiting it or making it available to first-time buyers only. Mr Clarke's commitment appeared to rule that out. Mr Clarke gave a rough response to the general part of the committee's analysis, which was the result of an ambush by opposition MPs during discussion of the draft report. He described it as a 'garbled and inaccurate criticism of the Budget and the government's economic record . . . They are a peculiar introduction to a select committee report and the government does not propose to respond to them'.</p>

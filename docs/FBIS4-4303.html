			<p>BFN     [Text] The puppet prime minister showed up at the "Seoul  City Police Office" on March 27 and ordered it to "maintain a  perfect public peace and alert posture", according to a radio  report from Seoul.    On March 26, while making a round of frontline units of the  puppet Army, he incited war fever for a northward invasion,  crying for a flawless "posture for countermove".    Facts that have been revealed show that the South Korean  puppets are getting more frenzied with the passage of time in  driving North-South relations to a phase of confrontation and  war [taekyolgwa chonjaeng kungmyon].</p>

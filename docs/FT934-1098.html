			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime shows 22% advance to Pounds 2.77m Buoyant stock markets around the world helped Ivory &amp; Sime, the investment management group, increase pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 2.27m to Pounds 2.77m in the six months to October 31. The advance was achieved on a 22 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 6.85m to Pounds 8.38m. Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said about half the increase in revenue was due to the recent rise in global stock markets. He added, however, that Ivory &amp; Sime had been particularly successful in attracting new business from North America. This had helped the company to offset the loss of two significant contracts. These included the termination of the new Frontiers Development Trust, for which the company received compensation of Pounds 511,000, and the loss of the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. Ivory received Pounds 750,000 for the termination of the latter account. Funds under management rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.7bn. Since the period end several smaller contracts had been concluded, bringing total funds to Pounds 4bn. Mr Neilly said further progress was expected in the second half, assuming the global markets remained buoyant. Administrative costs rose for the first time in four years, from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 5.4m. The dividend was increased by 29 per cent to 2.25p, reflecting the decision to pay one third at the interim stage and two thirds at the year end. Mr Neilly said that Ivory &amp; Sime expected to pay a final dividend of at least 4.75p, making a total of 7p (6.5p). Earnings were 20 per cent higher at 5.9p (4.94p). The company also announced the appointment of Mr Richard Muckart, who has been with Ivory since 1983, as an executive director. Mr Neilly said Mr Muckart's experience in managing portfolios for Ivory &amp; Sime in emerging markets was the first step in the company's strategy to increase its presence in these regions.</p>

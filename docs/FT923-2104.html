			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wharfedale makes Pounds 4m buy as losses increase to Pounds 2.94m WHARFEDALE, the loudspeaker manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 4m takeover of Centralforce Holdings which owns the Mission and Cyrus brand names for loudspeakers and electronics. The loss-making Leeds-based company is raising Pounds 5m through a placing and open offer on a 12-for-11 basis at 10.5p per share. Its shares yesterday closed at 11p. The name of the merged company is being changed to Verity Group. Wharfedale separately announced that its pre-tax deficit had risen to Pounds 2.94m (Pounds 1.22m) for the year ended June 30. The outcome was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 915,000 (Pounds 129,000) covering reorganisation and rationalisation costs. Centralforce is owned by Mr Farad Azima and his family. Mr Azima, who will join the merged company's board, will receive Pounds 4m of which Pounds 3.08m will be cash and the balance in shares. He will also receive 10m warrants to subscribe for one new share each at 16p, exercisable between January 1 1994 and December 31 1996. Turnover fell to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 11.3m). Losses per share were 9.1p (7.9p). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 361,000 related to costs incurred in closing its hi-fi electronics division and metal-working factory.</p>

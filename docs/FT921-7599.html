			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fall in US wheat sewings may lead to spring surge AN UNEXPECTED decline in the acreage of US farmland planted with winter wheat might encourage farmers to increase their planting of spring wheat, a US Agriculture Department economist said yesterday. The drop in winter wheat acreage to 50.22m acres, along with tight US stocks, has helped boost wheat prices in recent weeks. Instead of the 4 to 8 per cent increase in wheat sewings the industry had predicted this year as a result of a steep reduction in the 1991 US acreage set-aside programme, farmers created a stir in the commodity markets by reporting a 1.6 per cent decline in planted acreage. 'Because prices have gone so high, we can expect higher planting of spring wheat,' the USDA economist said. 'There could be late planting of winter wheat in places like Kansas, which may not be high yielding but could have a little effect on supply.' Wheat farmers in Texas and parts of Oklahoma, who often use their wheat acreage for grazing or haymaking, may be encouraged by the high prices to harvest it, thus adding further to wheat supplies. Cargill, the giant US grain house, is attributing the decline in winter wheat acreage to the US farm programme. 'Where is all the land that was in production in the early 1980s,' it asked in its recent bulletin. 'In some cases, it sits idle. . . the Conservation Reserve Program has locked up 35m acres, making them unavailable for planting at nearly any price. 'The reduction - nearly 11m acres once devoted to wheat - simply means the US productive base is significantly smaller, capped at current levels.' According to Cargill, USDA 'tinkering' with set-asides has disrupted US supplies, jeopardised market reliability and interfered 'with the few remaining price signals that come from the market rather than the government'. Other farm organisations have differing explanations. An official for the Family Farm Coalition said many farmers had difficulty borrowing operating capital; others had been going out of farming without selling their land. The USDA, in a report still to be released, attributed some of the decline in planted wheat acreage to the 'flexibility' provision in the 1990 farm legislation, which allows farmers to plant whatever crop they want on 15 per cent of their land and still receive production subsidies. However, because they get no payment on that 15 per cent, they may have decided to leave it fallow. Planting of soft red wheat dropped 7 per cent. According to USDA, producers have had such poor yields and quality problems in recent years that they may have decided not to bother planting wheat this year. Dry weather in the hard red winter wheat areas could have also discouraged production.</p>

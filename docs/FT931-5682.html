			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses await word from Bundesbank OPINION was evenly divided among observers yesterday as to whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at today's meeting, writes Our Markets Staff. Among the reasons offered for at least a 0.5 percentage point reduction were progress on securing wage settlements at around 3 per cent, and a cut in minimum reserve requirements announced on Monday. The pro-camp also noted that the next council meeting on March 18 was very near to the French elections and the Bundesbank might not want to lower rates at such a politically sensitive time. Others commented that the need to reach an agreement on the solidarity pact might delay a decision. As many bourses marked time yesterday observers agreed that whatever happened today German rates were set to decline by up to 2 percentage points over the year, and that this would sustain momentum in the medium term. FRANKFURT moved in a narrow range during the day, the DAX index shedding 3.01 to 1,693.73 as turnover rose to DM8.1bn from DM6.8bn. Among financials Commerzbank put on DM1 to DM290, Deutsche DM2 to DM713 and Dresdner DM1.20 to DM408.50. Chemicals remained under pressure with Basf down DM2.40 to DM231.20 and Hoechst easing DM4.30 to DM256.60. PARIS retreated from Tuesday's 2,000 level as Chargeurs surprised the market with 1992 earnings below most forecasts and the shares lost FFr115 to FFr1,285. The CAC-40 index finished 6.26 lower at 1,995.24 in turnover of some FFr3.2bn. Suez, which reported an estimated 1992 loss of some FFr1.9bn after the close, saw the shares ease in anticipation FFr4.10 to FFr296.40. Eurotunnel was off FFr1.35 at FFr39.90 as talks with TML in London ended without agreement, while Peugeot lost FFr18 to FFr621 on further warnings of depressed European car sales. AMSTERDAM saw a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.6 to 99.9 as Philips advanced 90 cents to Fl 21.10 ahead of today's results which are expected to disappoint, while Polygram, up Fl 1.20 at Fl 47.20, improved after Tuesday's good results. Hagemeyer rose Fl 1.40 to Fl 155.20 on plans for a two-for-one share split. DSM and Heineken, which complete today's batch of results, were respectively 30 cents lower and Fl 1.20 higher at Fl 71.60 and Fl 186.30. ZURICH succumbed to profit-taking after a firm start but prices picked up towards the close with investors encouraged by lower Swiss money market rates and Wall Street's opening. The SMI index closed 11.3 ahead at 2,142.0 after a day's high of 2,151.98. The market took its lead from renewed interest in Roche certificates, after their recent consolidation and the shares rose SFr60 to SFr4,010. Banks were mixed with some swapping noted out of Union Bank of Switzerland and into CS Holding and Swiss Bank. UBS bearers eased SFr1 to SFr944 while SBC bearers rose SFr1 to SFr366 ahead of next week's annual news conference. CS Holding bearers added SFr20 to SFr2,230 ahead of Friday's 1992 earnings figures from Credit Suisse. Nestle put on SFr10 to SFr1,140 as the European Commission said that the proposed sale of four French mineral water brands were sufficient to make Nestle's takeover of Perrier compatible with EC competition rules. MILAN found private domestic investors making the running, in the absence of the institutional and foreign buyers, and attention switched to second-line stocks and some recent laggards among the blue chips. The Comit index dipped 3.54 to 533.14 Among blue chips regarded as recent under-performers, Olivetti rose L170 or 7.4 per cent to L2,450 and Montedison firmed L50 to L1,290 after hours. STOCKHOLM moved higher encouraged by lower domestic interest rates and the Affarsvarlden general index ended up 4.3 to 1,018.6. Turnover weakened to SKr709 from SKr729. ISTANBUL shares rebounded 3.1 per cent in active buying after the 7.5 per cent decline of the previous three sessions as investors ignored a severe cash shortage faced by banks due to TL16,800bn of auction payments to the Treasury. The market index rose 176.72 to 5,813.97 after losing 454.33 points since last Wednesday's all-time-high close.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 3                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes              Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1163.41   1162.47   1161.62   1160.30 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1223.60   1221.84   1222.63   1222.65  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1160.66   1161.11   1160.55   1158.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1223.62   1222.97   1222.10   1221.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 2     Mar 1     Feb 26    Feb 25    Feb 24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.71   1158.20   1139.80   1125.06   1116.05 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1211.84   1213.57   1194.07   1178.13   1172.14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1163.41 ; 200 -  1224.58 Low/day: 100 -  1158.92  200 -  1220.91 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

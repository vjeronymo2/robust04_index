			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHALIDI ON ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> The exceptional cartoon by Conrad with the caption (Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir telling President Bush) "I've drawn six lines in the sand!" (Oct. 18) is  sure to enlist more rage and anger from Zionist interests against Conrad.  </P> <P> The fact remains that his message is brief and straight. Conrad has always  called the facts as they are.  </P> <P> The American foreign policy should be made by Americans and in the interest of  America and world peace. U.S. foreign policy should consistently be against  occupation, annexation and oppression.  </P> <P> ALI M. KHAJAWALL, Diamond Bar  </P></p>

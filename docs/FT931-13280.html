			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Kenya poll overseer was removed from bench: Commonwealth report likely to reinforce opposition claims that election victory was unfair MR Zachaeus Chesoni, the former judge who supervised Kenya's general election last month, was dismissed from the bench in May 1990 following the discovery that a state-owned bank was seeking his imprisonment in a bankruptcy action, according to the Commonwealth report on the poll published last night. This and other disclosures from a Commonwealth file on Mr Chesoni, appointed chairman of the electoral commission by President Daniel arap Moi a year after his dismissal, are likely to reinforce opposition claims that Mr Moi's election victory was not free and fair. Opposition leaders sought Mr Chesoni's replacement as chairman of the electoral commission, but failed to get Commonwealth backing. The documents, summarised in an annex to the report, were given to the Commonwealth observer group before Christmas. No mention of them was made in the group's initial assessment of the poll, issued on January 1. The heavily qualified endorsement of the election process was reaffirmed in yesterday's final report. The annex says in 1984 Mr Chesoni's 'business involvements caused him severe financial embarrassment'. Bankruptcy proceedings were filed against him personally and winding up proceedings against the company through which he operated his business. The action was initiated by the Kenya Commercial Finance Company, a part of the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank. In a letter to Mr Chesoni cited in the annex but not published, Mr Mathew Muli, then attorney-general, writes: 'His Excellency the President. . . has sadly accepted your retirement.' It goes on: 'With regard to bankruptcy proceedings against you personally, the bank has been directed not to press with bankruptcy proceedings but may proceed with the winding-up of the company. Any proceedings that may have been commenced are to be terminated or withdrawn from the court record in accordance with the rules.' In February 1990, says the annex, Mr Chesoni was reappointed an acting justice of appeal 'presumably on the basis that his financial affairs had been brought to order. In fact that was not so. An application to commit him to prison in High Court case 1234 of 1984 was listed for hearing on 18 May 1990. He was asked to resign but did not do so.' The Judicial Service Commission found Mr Chesoni's conduct 'inconsistent with the position, dignity and judicial integrity' of a judge. A letter to Mr Chesoni from the Chief Justice, Judge Robin Hancox, demands his resignation 'in view of your extreme financial embarrassment' and says Mr Chesoni 'did not see fit to apprise' him of the application for his imprisonment. On May 15 Mr Chesoni was told that his appointment as acting justice of appeal would be revoked. Earlier this month the Financial Times reported that in 1984 a state-controlled bank was ordered not to implement a bankruptcy judgment against Mr Chesoni. The action was revived in 1990, said the article, but in 1991 the bank was again ordered not to pursue it, say Nairobi legal sources. In a statement issued before the Commonwealth report was made public, Mr Chesoni said: 'It is absolutely untrue to suggest that the government played any part in resolving the (bankruptcy) dispute.' Mr Chesoni says in April 1984 he faced a claim for KSh18m (Pounds 322,000) plus interest. Of this, KSh17m was repaid, and agreement reached on payment of the balance. 'Prior to April 1990 execution proceedings had been taken against me,' says Mr Chesoni: 'As a result an order was made that I pay KSh3.5m and the balance to be agreed.' His lawyers subsequently 'negotiated a full and final settlement of my liability'. The sale of family property had raised KSh3m and he is no longer indebted to the bank, says the statement. The Commonwealth report says Mr Chesoni's conduct as electoral commission chairman 'cast a cloud over the electoral process', but his performance 'improved dramatically' from mid-November. It adds that the observers 'have not received information which would cast doubts' on denials by Mr Chesoni and other commission members that they 'were associated with' or 'taking directions from' Kenya's ruling party.</p>

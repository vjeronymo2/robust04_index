			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Bad timing and stark decisions in Chicago WHEN farm trade ministers from the US and EC abandoned efforts to solve their farm subsidy dispute, they knew the world had moved closer to a trade war. However, they were almost alone in their knowledge. The television crews had already begun to focus on the imminent Bill Clinton presidential victory and the UK's Maastricht vote the following day. Few noticed the lines for a trade war had been drawn. For six years, negotiators have tried to complete a trade package to open markets and inspire global growth. The broader Gatt talks have stalled over a row between US and EC oilseed producers about subsidies. World trade in the 1990s, it seems, hangs on the soyabean. The curious timing of the Chicago talks, stretching over the three days before the US elections and the Maastricht vote in the UK, seemed to put unusual pressure on the negotiators to achieve a resolution and deliver a boost to their fading governments. In the end, the timing proved unfortunate. The US envoy's negotiating power ran out with Mr George Bush's projected defeat at the polls. Mr Bush was notified of the failure of the Chicago talks only hours before he conceded his Presidency. As he spoke on live television, his chief trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, was reviewing her list of possible sanctions against the EC. Champagne, flowing at many a Clinton victory celebrations last night, is expected to be among the first commodities to be sacrificed to a trade war.</p>

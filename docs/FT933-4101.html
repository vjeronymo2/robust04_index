			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Pits to close after low bid turnout PRIVATE-SECTOR mining companies have bid to operate just seven of the 19 pits put out to tender by British Coal following its decision that it could no longer run them. As a result British Coal will prepare the 12 pits that did not receive bids for closure. The final tally of bids is even less than was expected earlier this week when the deadline closed for the last tranche of five pits to be put out for licensing. This is because RJB Mining has withdrawn a bid for Easington colliery in County Durham after it failed to agree with British Coal who should bear the costs of pumping water in the area. Three of the 19 mines are the subject of tenders which involve the use of surface assets only. The low number of bids is a blow for thousands of miners who have been made redundant, and provides little comfort for the government as it prepares for a new round of closures. In all, there were 19 tenders for 11 collieries but three have since been withdrawn. The bids involving mining proposals were led by Edwards Energy, headed by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, which submitted five tenders, and RJB, which submitted four, not including Easington. Apart from them, only two mining offers were received, both for the same pit, Betws, in Wales. In the final tranche of five pits only one, Coventry Colliery at Keresley, attracted an offer which involved mining. Parkside, Sharlston, Shirebrook and Taff Merthyr received no offers. The withdrawal of RJB's bid for Easington will heighten concern about water pumping in the Durham coalfield. The National Rivers Authority this week named Easington as a mine whose closure threatens to contaminate water supplies. British Coal said that talks with the NRA would continue. Redundant British Coal employees are satisfied with the career advice they receive as part of their severance packages, a survey has found. The study was conducted among 526 former British Coal employees recently made redundant. Half those interviewed were already in employment or self-employment, the majority finding a new job within six months. More than half said the job shop and career centre run by British Coal Enterprises, a British Coal subsidiary, contributed directly to their finding new employment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHITE KNIGHTS IN BLACK FIELDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PIT                 BIDDER                        PLANNED USE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Betws               Edwards Energy                Mining                     Ryan International            Mining                     Management buy-out team       Mining Bevercotes          RJB Mining                    Mining Bolsover            None Clipstone           RJB Mining                    Mining Cotgrave            UDM/Vista                     Surface assets (waste                                                   recycling) Coventry            Edwards Energy                Mining                     Undisclosed                   Venture involving                                                   surface assets Easington           None after RJB withdrew                     earlier bid Grimethorpe         None Houghton Main       None Markham Main        Edwards Energy                Mining                     RJB Mining                    Mining Parkside            None Rossington          Edwards Energy                Mining                     RJB Mining                    Mining Sharlston           None Shirebrook          None Silverhill          UDM/Vista                     Surface assets (waste                                                   disposal) Trentham            Edwards Energy                Mining                     Undisclosed                   Venture involving                                                   surface assets Taff Merthyr        None Vane Tempest        Undisclosed                   Venture involving                                                   surface assets Westoe              None  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): PC mini-modem switches to radio A MINI modem which could enable users of palmtop and notebook PCs to send data across radio networks has been launched in North America by Ericsson GE, of Paramus, New Jersey. Mobidem, as it is called, weighs less than one pound and can be connected to any PC with a standard serial port. It then transmits data at the rate of 8 kilobits per second over the Mobitex packet-switched data network operated in the US by Ram Mobile Data and in Canada by Rogers Cantel. This eliminates the need for PC users to find a phone socket in which to plug their 'wireline' modems. In addition, the Mobidem acts like a radiopager by constantly scanning the network for incoming messages which it can store when the PC is turned off. The Mobidem will sell for Dollars 1,795 (Pounds 1,000). Ericsson GE: US, 201 265 6600.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bridging decades of mutual mistrust"] </F>   [Text] Today marks an important milestone in the long  history of relations between Thailand and Laos. The Thai-Lao  Friendship Bridge, which was conceived more than three decades  ago and whose construction was funded by Australia, will be  formally opened today in a ceremony to be jointly presided over  by Their Majesties the King and Queen and Laotian President  Nouhak Phoumsavan and Mrs Phoumsavan. His Majesty will also  take this auspicious opportunity to visit Laos -- his first  foreign visit in almost 30 years -- and to inaugurate a  Royally-sponsored agricultural centre.    His Majesty's visit to Laos today shows the importance the  Thai monarchy attaches to relations between Thailand and its  landlocked neighbour which, in most of the past two decades,  have been marred by suspicion, misunderstanding and conflicts  which, at times, have turned violent and resulted in bloodshed  on both sides.    The opening of the bridge will certainly facilitate  communication and transport links between Thailand and Laos. It  will also improve contacts between Thai and Lao peoples who  share several cultural and ethnic similarities. Foreign  visitors will also have a better chance to explore the pristine  Laotian environment and traditional cultures and experience the  friendliness and gentleness of the Lao people.    The friendship bridge symbolises the cooperation between  Thailand, Laos and Australia which funded the bridge  construction. It also stands as testimony that, despite  political ideological differences, countries can overcome  suspicions and work together for their mutual benefits if they  are genuinely sincere enough and willing to set aside their  mutual distrust.    But it would be totally unrealistic to believe that the  first  bridge across the mighty Mekong River will suddenly bring to an  end all the problems that have long existed between Thailand and  Laos. It would also be self-deceiving to expect the two  countries to suddenly bury the hatchet, embrace each other  affectionately and walk hand-in-hand together towards economic  prosperity.    Bangkok and Vientiane need to hold talks on a regular basis  to settle some outstanding problems which still stand as an  obstacle to the improvement of relations between the two  neighbouring countries. One sticky problem is the Laotian  resistance movement. Vientiane has always harboured the  suspicion that Bangkok is clandestinely giving support and  asylum to the resistance rebels, several of whom are suspected  of having taken refuge in refugee camps in Thailand. However  when Thailand suggested that Laos take back all the Laotian  refugees in order to remove suspicion, this was rejected by  Vientiane, claiming it is not in a financial position to accept  them all.    Endowed with abundant natural sources, Laos is an ideal  source of energy and raw materials for Thai industries. But  Thai businessmen who wish to invest in Laos must tread a careful  path and must not repeat the exploitative business practices  employed by their predecessors who were branded as "ugly" Thais.  The days when Thai businessmen could plunder at will and  exploit Laos' natural wealth are over. Business deals should be  done in a mutually beneficial manner.    The opening of the Friendship Bridge should usher in a new  era of cooperation, friendship and relations between the two  neighbouring countries which are based on the principle of  respect of sovereignty and independence, mutual benefit and  trust. And to achieve these goals, a lot has to be done by both  sides earnestly and sincerely. The task will prove to be more  difficult -- yet not insurmountable -- than just building a  bridge.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: API advances 30% to Pounds 7.02m Pre-tax profits at API Group, the packaging, coatings and office consumables company, rose 30 per cent from Pounds 5.41m to Pounds 7.02m in the year to October 1. Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 73.4m) and operating profits expanded 33 per cent to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.11m). Within these, Arnold Belford, the specialist coatings company bought in June for Pounds 1.7m cash, contributed Pounds 799,000 to turnover and Pounds 73,000 to profits. Diffusion, the only company left in the heating and ventilation division until its sale in February for Pounds 1.5m, made Pounds 185,000 (Pounds 208,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 3.93m). Mr Michael Smith, chief executive, drew attention to the margin increases, both across the group on continuing operations from 7.1 to 8.5 per cent, and within the two divisions. In foils and laminates, the margin rose from 8.1 to 9.3 per cent and in converted film and paper products the growth was from 10.1 to 11.7 per cent. Mr Smith said that so far the group had managed to pass on raw material price rises, mostly experienced in the final quarter, and expected to be able to continue to do so. However, he stressed that API was not beholden to the whims of raw material suppliers as other packaging groups were: rather, it made premium products often for niche markets. Again, the alliances API had created with both suppliers and customers - accounting for 30 to 40 per cent of sales - were cited as strengths to help offset the pressures on prices, as was the group's commitment to reduce waste, which accounts for 5 per cent of sales. From an R&amp;D budget that works out at about 3 per cent of sales, API is developing an alternative to holograms for banknotes, for example, which cannot be copied. It has also developed a universal foil, which Mr Smith said could 'revolutionise the foil business'. API has an exclusive contract with Polaroid for the laminating of film for the medical and graphics markets, and the market for thermal transfer systems is growing at 20 per cent a year. The group is investing Pounds 8m over three years in a greenfield plant to manufacture metallised paper, a market estimated at Pounds 300m. On the acquisition front, Mr Smith said API would announce 'something significant' in the next three to six months, in the UK, Europe or the US. Earnings grew to 21.8p (16.8p) per share and a final dividend of 5.38p lifts the total to 9.08p (8.25p).</p>

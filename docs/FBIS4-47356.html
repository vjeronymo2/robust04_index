The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of  Petroleum Refining [VNIINP] has been researching the conditions  of synthesizing different types of zeolites and zeolite  production processes since the 1960s. The VNIINP has recently  developed promising processes for producing type Y zeolites. A  no-waste process has been developed to synthesize NaY zeolite  that entails producing the silica needed to synthesize the  zeolite by electrodialysis of a sodium silicate solution and  then using the alkaline solutions formed during electrodialysis  and crystallization to dissolve the silicate materials for  return to the production process. Other studies performed at the  VNIINP resulted in the establishment of six general laws  governing crystallization of pentacyls of the TsVK series that  were in turn used to develop a method of synthesizing zeolites  with 100 percent phase purity. In 1989-1990, the VNIINP  developed a no-waste process for producing pentacyls with a very  low (0.1 weight percent) sodium oxide content, i.e., TsVN  zeolites, according to which the mother liquors are returned to  the process in the stage of preparing the starting reaction  mixture. Working jointly with Byelarus Technological Institute,  the VNIINP synthesized molecular sieves with different  structures: AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5, AlPO[.sub]4[/]-20,  AlPO[.sub]4[/]-44, SAPO-5, SAPO-44, etc. Catalysts based on  them are now being tested. The wide-pore sieves  AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5 and SAPO-5 have shown the most promise and  highest stability: They do not break down when heated up to  1,040C or when treated with steam at 600C. Both sieves  also have rather high sorption volumes. Modified TsVM and  TsVK-XI zeolites have been used as a basis for developing the  catalyst SGK-1m for dewaxing the base of I-20A and I-12A  industrial oils and the heavy oil distillates used as a base for  ASV-5 high-viscosity motor oil. The catalyst SGK-1R has been  developed for single-stage hydrorefining of highly aromatized  catalytic cracking gas oils. New processes have also been  developed for two-stage hydrocracking of vacuum distillate at a  pressure of 15 MPa to produce jet fuel and for light  hydrocracking at a pressure of 5-7 MPa to produce diesel fuel.  The new process has been used to create the zeolite-containing  catalysts NMG-70 and GKO-1. A series of zeolite-containing  catalysts has also been developed for light hydrocracking of  vacuum distillate with a transformation depth of more than 70  percent. The zeolite RZEU is used as a splitting component.  Catalysts of the series GKR consisting of 40 percent RZEU  possess good splitting activity but are not selective enough  with respect to the diesel fuel fraction. Catalysts of the  series LGK are more active and selective than their rival  counterpart ZMAG 95 AS produced by Haldor Topso. Tables 10;  references 31 (Russian).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wu Keqiang (0702 0344 1730) and Shen Haixiong </F> (1957 3189 7160)]    [Text] Hangzhou, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- These reporters have  learned from the national market work conference that opened  here today that, to meet the internal demand of establishing a  socialist market economic system, the State Planning Commission,  in carrying out the plan of the party's Central Committee and  the State Council, is now in the process of drawing up the  "Ninth Five-Year Plan" and programs for fostering and developing  a market system for 2010.    As far as market establishment is concerned, the State  Council has entrusted planning departments with such  responsibilities as guiding and promoting the establishment of a  national market system; and formulating plans, overall  strategies of, and major regulatory policies for the development  of key markets across the country. Based on investigations and  studies, the State Planning Commission has shaped its basic  strategies in drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan and programs  for nurturing and developing a market system for 2010. Main  features of these basic strategies, which have been submitted to  the ongoing national market work exchange conference for  discussion, are: 1) to take circulation as an industry to  reverse the sluggish and backward conditions encountered in  developing China's circulation industry; 2) to prioritize  service to both agriculture and peasants, paying special  attention to the reform of the circulation system for  agricultural producer goods and the establishment of rural  markets; 3) to better serve urban and rural residents through  availability of more living facilities; 4) to take advantage of  regional superiority -- particularly superiority enjoyed by the  central and western regions -- so as to gradually narrow the gap  between the coastal and the central and western regions through  nurturing and developing regional markets; and 5) to stress  linking of domestic markets -- particularly factors of  production and high-level markets -- with international markets,  amid protection and promotion of development of national  industry and commerce.    Hao Jianxiu, vice minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, presented the conference with a report entitled,  "Try Hard To Create a New Situation in Market Work To Accelerate  Fostering and Development of a Socialist Market System."  Centering on speeding up nurturing and developing a market  system, the meeting will focus its discussions on such questions  as planning strategies for a market system, establishment of a  major commodities reserve system, and market information  networks.</p>

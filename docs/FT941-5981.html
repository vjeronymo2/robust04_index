			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices slide as Ottawa talks disappoint Aluminium prices tumbled yesterday as sentiment was affected by two factors: nervousness about the steep drop in bond and share prices and disappointment among some traders over the outcome of international trade talks in Ottawa about measures to bring supply and demand back into balance. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the Noranda subsidiary, said that it was unusual for disturbances in share and bond markets to spill over to metals but yesterday it was obvious some investment trusts had decided to take profits on metals while they could. Meanwhile, the two-day Ottawa meeting merely approved proposals drafted last month in Brussels and Ms Karen Norton, researcher at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggested the aluminium market had also wanted to see more substantial ideas about how the Russian industry would meet its proposed target of cutting production by 500,000 tonnes and how these cuts would be monitored. Aluminium for delivery in three months closed on the LME last night at Dollars 1,272.75 a tonne, down Dollars 33.75. Both analysts suggested that there was important technical support for the price at Dollars 1,260 a tonne but if it breached that level the next support was at about Dollars 1,235. Ms Norton said the price might stabilise, however, waiting for the announcement of more production cuts. So far western producers have cut about 850,000 tonnes of annual production but the has industry agreed that global cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes are needed to bring the market back into balance.</p>

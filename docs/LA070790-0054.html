			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> JACKIE &amp; ROY STILL SPARKLE  </P> <P> Hearing Jackie Cain and Roy Kral is a bit like traveling through a time warp.  Their opening set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill Thursday night was filled with  the same buoyantly swinging, brightly spirited vocal jazz that has been the  duo's stock in trade for more than 40 years.  </P> <P> Cain's blond tresses have turned to silver, and Kral has added a few more worry  lines, but the blend of their voices -- one of the most distinctive sounds in  jazz -- has lost none of its sparkle. What made this evening different was a  marked increase in Cain's ballad singing, and an unusually varied program of  unfamiliar material. The heart of the set was a collection of Alec Wilder  songs. Familiar items like "It's So Peaceful in the Country" and "I'll Be  Around" were included, of course, but Jackie &amp; Roy also dug deeply into the  more obscure depths of the Wilder ouevre.  </P> <P> Kral's richly harmonic piano playing, aided by the able assistance of bassist  Seward McKay and drummer Curt Moore, provided a sturdy foundation for the  ballads. Cain made the most of the support, especially on a lush version of  "You're My Thrill" and a serene interpretation of a "Spring Can Really Hang You  Up the Most." DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

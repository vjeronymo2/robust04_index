			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Supreme Council chairman Eduard </F> Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- live]    [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are presenting a  radio interview with the chairman of the Georgian parliament and  head of state, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Batono Eduard, the  Abkhazian side again violated an agreement, the Geneva  Memorandum last week. In addition, the work of the commission  for drawing up the statute of Abkhazia, held in Moscow under UN  auspices and with the participation of the CSCE, was virtually  fruitless. Jointly with Yeltsin you have addressed Butrus  Ghali, emphasizing that all chances of a peaceful settlement  should be tried.    [Words indistinct] said on TV that any political decision is  better than war. And if this does not produce a result, if the  killing of the civilian population continues, what way will  remain?    [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I would not say that the Moscow  talks on a statute for Abkhazia were a complete failure.  Generally, talks about the statute will be complex and [words  indistinct]. The next stage should be in Geneva on the 22d and I  think the issue will be clearer then.    As for the principal problem of the issue, I mean an overall  settlement of the conflict, I believe there should be no doubt  that we were right to have chosen a peaceful way toward a  settlement from the very beginning in spite of the fact that it  appeared to be ineffective. A peaceful way is the best and most  reassuring way to settle conflicts in our time. Those who can  analyze all that has been happening on our planet for the last  20, 30, or 40 years will be convinced that a peaceful settlement  is the most reliable way.    Both the Russian president and I were guided by this as we  appealed to the UN Secretary General to have international  peacekeeping forces in their classical form deployed or, if that  were impossible, a Russian contingent would be a major force  there.    Every opportunity should be used. I realize that many  people feel upset when I keep speaking of a peaceful settlement  to the conflict. I am not really surprised that this can upset  someone whose house has been burned down and who does not know  when he will be able to return home. He will naturally be  looking for an extreme decision, which in his opinion could  represent an earlier return home and the beginning of a normal  life. But this is a superficial impression which is created by  emotions and it cannot be fruitful. I would like to say the  following. If we fail to bring in peacekeeping forces -- and  this is the only way out and the shortest way to peace -- if we  fail to bring in peacekeeping forces, (although I believe that  this can be done as a result of consultations in New York and  other capitals), if this fails and proves useless, everyone  should remember that if this proves to be ineffectual, the worst  thing will happen, there will be bloodshed.    I see this as a dreadful prospect. This will happen  spontaneously irrespective of the will of the Georgian  authorities or bodies of other countries. Processes will become  uncontrollable and the conflict will spread over large areas,  however grave it might be to think of this. Everyone should  understand this. As I say this I mean our listeners, the  listeners of our country, I mean the Abkhazian leaders who are  in Gudauta and Sukhumi, and of course members of the UN Security  Council and Russia in the first instance, because Russia has  understood the reality of this danger of the spread of the  conflict over large areas. Regardless of what we want,  additional forces will be dragged into the conflict and this  would be a disaster not only for Georgia but for this big region  as a whole.    [Oniani] You say that Russia understood it partially and  this was felt when several members of the Russian State Duma  made a statement on television last night. Almost the same  ideas were expressed. However, a politician differs from an  ordinary mortal by the need to take unpopular decisions without  being guided by emotions. At a parliament sitting you said that  the Abkhazian issue could not be settled without Russia's  participation. Your and Yeltsin's appeal says that if UN forces  cannot be deployed in the conflict zone, Russia is ready for  this. We are said to be asking Russia to do what Russia itself  has taken an interest in.    [Shevardnadze] I would like to make the official Russian  stance clear. Either international forces in their classical  form arrive, and Russia agrees to the participation of the  international forces and it will cooperate with the forces even  by being a part of those, or it will make a commitment to bring  in its contingent on a peace mission. There is no other way.  If we speak of a peace settlement, there should be either  international forces or a Russian contingent.    There is a third way, I mean another decision can be taken  within the CIS but this will apparently be a repetition of a  Tajik model. And this is obviously not quite desirable. It is  difficult to argue against the righteousness of this stance. I  mean the Russian statement that supports the introduction of  international forces but, if that is not possible, Russia will  undertake to bring in its contingent. It is really difficult to  argue against this. We ourselves are primarily interested in  what we are asking Russia to do. The idea that we are asking  Russia to do what Russia is interested in can be reversed like  this: We are asking Russia to do what we ourselves are  interested in. No other way out can be seen.    [Oniani] One deputy has suggested that Russia close off the  border and we shall fix Abkhazia.    [Shevardnadze] There is that idea. But this request is  rather naive and I think the main point is what I have just said.    [Oniani] I would like to remind you of your words said at  the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. The whole country  should turn toward the economy. A morbid politization of our  community is a deviation from the proper coursel.    An anticrisis government program was made public last week.  How effective do you think this program will be and how likely  do you think the government crisis or even resignation is in the  near future in the light of numerous complaints against the  government and an idea that our government is not a unified  team?    [Shevardnadze] The presented program is a maximum of current  abilities. All existing forces participated in the work; I mean  ministries, agencies, institutes, individual experts, and so on.  The work took months. I also joined at the final stage and I  was also involved, in a way. The principal thing is that the  country should really turn toward the economy and everyone  should care about the economy and think and care about escaping  from the crisis.    The presented program is realistic. I said in a speech that  an optimistic scenario was mentioned as well as a pessimistic  scenario. I can say that the maximal version is a realistic  one. But it can be realistic only if we are able to find  additional resources to overcome the energy crisis.    Armenia receives several-fold less power and fuel and they  run 70 percent of their industry. The population experiences  extreme hardships there but they all realize that if the economy  stopped the country would lose all prospects for the future.    I do not mean that we can still take something away from the  population but we obviously have to look for additional  resources, additional sources of fuel and power. This could be  received either through foreign credits or other ways, such as  through relations with Russia or with Iran and a lot of other  ways.    As for an idea that there is not a unified team, I am not  aware of anyone in Georgia who is capable of summoning his  people and creating a united team. I think these ideas create a  very primitive image of a team. A team cannot be created just  like that. In order to create a team, like-minded people,  people who understand each other easily are needed and, in  addition, a very high professional level should be guaranteed  and this takes years. It needs years of experience and  sometimes decades.    Thus, we cannot demand that the present authorities do  something that is very difficult and almost impossible to do.  We have not got an ideal and strong team like this at the  moment but, anyway, the present Cabinet of Ministers is the most  we could afford in a difficult situation like this.    As for a government crisis, there will probably be certain  complications during the endorsement of the members of the  government by the parliament. I would like to ask everyone to  refrain from extreme demands. A government crisis will make the  desperate situation in the economy even more complicated and  difficult. Those who put forward revolutionary slogans  demanding, in particular, that the Cabinet of Ministers be  replaced, certain statesmen resign and so on are driving the  country to a deeper crisis. It is impossible that a person  learn how to be a minister in just three or four months. This  should be realized.    When we were changing the previous Cabinet, I was against it  because one needs at least one or two years to have an idea  about one's department. That is why we have to take care of the  people and we have to be more kind to individual statesmen and  even to the Cabinet. Today, we have to be guided by a common  responsibility rather than by a desire to amuse ourselves.  Unfortunately, the latter is often observed in one part of the  community and especially in the parliament.    [Oniani] I would like to recall yet another point from your  speech at the Cabinet of Ministers. You said: We have to  introduce private ownership as soon as possible. There are  people in the government, including the staff of the head of  state, who hamper the activities of entrepreneurs.    Incidentally, the mafia is not happy because of the  development of entrepreneurship in Georgia, either. They have a  significant network and not only in our republic, unfortunately.    [Shevardnadze] Speaking of the country's development in the  long run, of course proprietors, businessmen, industrialists  should be considered as major components of the society required  for the expansion of the economy. We have to do our best to  switch to the market economy as soon as possible. I agree with  you that this idea scares certain structures and it scares the  mafia, too, because a proprietor has a well-developed sense of  responsibility and aspiration to protect his own property, which  is the basis of his personal happiness.    Despite the opposition, this process must be sped up and it  will be sped up. Apart from that, our population has to realize  that something should be done so that a proprietor, an  entrepreneur will not become a leech. An antagonistic attitude  to leeches can be observed in people at the initial stage. We  have to support and help the establishment of serious business  and the preparation of a whole school of businessmen, the  businessmen who will come forward thanks to their intelligence,  cleverness, and hard work rather than dishonest ways. The  earlier we manage to establish businesslike ties and have such  proprietors on the scene, the sooner the country will find a way  to improve the situation.    [Oniani] You accepted the defense minister's resignation  last week and temporarily assumed the duties of minister. I  would like to recall your words at the meeting with the army  high command. I have been quoting you very often today but this  is due to necessity. The state has to provide for the army. The  army cannot exist on charity or depend on someone's mood. The  army cannot be built on sand. You also spoke about building a  modern Georgian Army. On what is your optimism based? Is there  a basis in Georgia to allow the building of a new army?    [Shevardnadze] When I speak about a new army I do not mean  that those who are in the armed forces now have to quit and new  people have to come in. When speaking with a certain optimism  that we will soon have a truly modern national army, I mean the  cadres who comprise the basis of our army now and who already  have combat experience. Many of those are model heroes and  brave fighters fully devoted to the interests of the country.  We were defeated but this loss is also a certain experience  which this generation has acquired. This is obviously one of  the bases for my optimism. The main thing is that we have  cadres.    Second, there are people, I mean in our community, who  realize the importance of the army and its purpose for the  building of an independent state. I believe that youth will say  a decisive word in the building of the army. I will do my best  to make military service the highest duty, an honorable mission,  and even a kind of privilege for the best of our youths.    My direct and active involvement in this process is due to  my  desire to use all my power and rights and have the army built on  a legal basis and financed through legal sources. And this  should improve two- and three-fold the conditions of the  servicemen rather than aggravate them. I did not use the word  privilege accidentally. Speaking of the army I also mean border  guards, interior troops, and all [word indistinct].    [Oniani] And a final question. An Armenian delegation led  by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is arriving in Georgia today.  What is the chief purpose of this visit and is it not linked  with an idea you expressed during President Yeltsin's visit to  Tbilisi, namely, that it is necessary that leaders of the three  large Transcaucasian states meet regularly to handle conflicts  in the area. Plus Russia.    [Shevardnadze] We agreed to meet before. The Armenian  president was in London and he asked me to arrange this meeting  as soon as he returned. I spoke to Mr. Aliyev as well as Mr.  Ter-Petrosyan about the necessity of such meetings. All three  of us share a view that the meetings; regular, systematic  meetings are essential. These may start on a bilateral basis  and then later all three of us will probably meet. Then Russia  as well as other countries will be able to join us.    Obviously, a major topic will be a Caucasian dialogue and  how  promising, how reassuring, and realistic the beginning of a  Caucasian dialogue will be. Speaking of dialogue, I do not mean  an ordinary conversation. I mean a certain (?quorum) which will  be regulated chronologically; in other words we will meet two or  three times a year and discuss problems.    In addition, bilateral relations could predominate today,  problems that concern the two countries. We will have a serious  conversation. We have many interests in Armenia, and the  Armenians strongly depend on how well the Georgian  communications network works.    I would like to add that Mr. Aliyev will not be involved in  our present dialogue personally but I have had preliminary talks  with him and after my meeting with the Armenian president has  ended, my meeting with the Azernaijani president will take  place. I think we are approaching the phase when our contacts  are to become more vigorous and we have to do our best so that  the Caucasian factor will play its decisive role in fighting for  peace and stability in the region.</p>

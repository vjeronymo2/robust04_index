			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SOME RESIDENTS OF MARYLAND FIND COUNTY'S SALE OF OWN BRAND OF LIQUOR SOBERING;  </P> <P> SOME SOBERED BY THIS BRAND OF LIQUOR  </P> <P> When high school senior Susan Bergeron learned that Montgomery County was  selling its own brand of liquor, the local official of Students Against Drunk  Driving was furious.  </P> <P> "How can a county, with its innumerable drug task forces and anti-drug  campaigns, run liquor stores and, even worse, bottle its own brand of liquor?"  the 17-year-old wrote recently in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.  </P> <P> The question has grown old for county officials, who had hoped the furor over  its County Crest brand would have died away by now, nearly two months after the  discount brand of gin, vodka, rum, Bourbon and Scotch went on sale in  county-run liquor stores.  </P> <P> Introduction of the house brand liquor brought out a flurry of news coverage  and critical letters to the editors of newspapers. But county officials say  they only received three critical letters and the issue has quieted.  </P> <P> "Let's put this in perspective, for God's sake. A private label doesn't make  anyone drink," said county liquor control director Jerome Baylin. "All we're  saying is if you choose to drink in Montgomery County, please shop here."  </P> <P> Montgomery County buys directly from producers, wholesaling beer and wine to  retailers but handling sales of liquor through its own stores. County officials  maintain County Crest is no different from house labels of other large liquor  retailers.  </P> <P> The house liquor is made by a Baltimore distillery, which bottles it in two  sizes under the County Crest label.  </P> <P> A 1.75-liter jug of County Crest ranges in price from $10.95 for vodka to  $15.99 for Scotch -- $2 or $3 less than comparable brands, but more than the  cheapest products.  </P> <P> The affluent county outside Washington, D.C., whose voters opted to control  alcohol sales at the end of Prohibition, is the first local government in the  nation to retail its own liquor, said Baylin, who is president of the National  Alcoholic Beverages Control Assn.  </P> <P> According to the association, which represents governments that directly  control the sale and distribution of liquor, 19 states purchase liquor and  either sell to retailers or directly to the public, in addition to Maryland,  where only Montgomery County does so.  </P> <P> County Executive Sidney Kramer said the sale of County Crest was in keeping  with the county's goal of controlling liquor sales, as well as a source of  extra revenue. Some of the revenue raised by the liquor control office pays for  substance abuse programs, he added.  </P> <P> According to Baylin, the liquor control office has netted $62 million above  expenses in the last five years.  </P> <P> He said it is too soon to know how much money the sale of house brand liquor  will raise, but the products appear to be "doing exceptionally well, thanks to  the press."  </P> <P> Bergeron said she was angered by the introduction of County Crest at a time  when Montgomery County officials have been pressing SADD to abandon its policy  of neither condoning nor condemning teen-age drinking in favor of a "zero  tolerance" stance.  </P> <P> "Basically, they are saying SADD is sending mixed messages when they themselves  are doing that," said Bergeron, who is treasurer of the county's SADD chapter.  "I'm not going to listen to someone who's a hypocrite."  </P> <P> The county government says controlling alcohol sales is better than permitting  liquor stores on every corner. Neighboring Prince George's County, which does  not have liquor control, has more than 140 liquor stores, compared with the 23  government outlets in Montgomery, Baylin said.  </P> <P> Virginia Bright, head of the Montgomery chapter of Mothers Against Drunk  Driving, said there is nothing wrong with liquor control but thinks the county  should not both regulate and participate in the liquor industry.  </P> <P> "We have enough brands to choose from without the county making its own," she  said.  </P></p>

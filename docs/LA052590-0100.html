			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STATE MORE LIKELY TO FIRE BLACK WORKERS  </P> <P> Black state employees in California are more than three times as likely as  Anglo workers to be disciplined or fired, according to a two-year state  Personnel Board study. Blacks make up less than 12% of the state government  work force in California, but they accounted for 38% of the firings and 33% of  the dismissals during probation, according to a report on the study.  </P> <P> Latino workers also are disciplined more often than Anglos, the report  concluded. Asian and Filipinos had a low percentage of sanctions. Figures for  American Indians, Pacific Islanders and other minorities were not at wide  variance. The findings were compiled by the Adverse Action Task Force, a group  of more than 40 state workers, managers, union officials and civil rights  activists.  </P></p>

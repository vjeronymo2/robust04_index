			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir </F> Muhammad by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Ustuwani] Were there signs pointing to  what is happening now, signs which the various parties failed to  deal with before the situation deteriorated?    [Muhammad] I had warned from the beginning that unless the  Yemeni institutions (Presidential Council, Cabinet, and House of  Representatives) convened, the Pledge and Accord Document  implemented, and the problems which appeared from time to time  contained, the alternative would be a power vacuum, anarchy,  accusations, explosions, and war. [passage omitted]    [Al-Ustuwani] Missiles entered the arsenal of the South  Yemeni forces when you were president, when you received them  from the Soviet Union. Did it never occur to you that they  might be used in some wars?    [Muhammad] I remember that after signing the agreement to  purchase that weapon, Brezhnev told me that "this is a lethal  and dangerous weapon and should only be used to threaten and  intimidate, not to be fired." We saw it as an element of  Yemen's strength against any foreign threat. We never used it  in any of our past battles because we wanted stability for  Yemen, the region, and our neighbors.    [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, should be done to end this  grinding war?    [Muhammad] I am in favor of dialogue and I will not change  my position even though that may not be in harmony with what is  going on now or its consequences; but that is my position and  sole responsibility. I call on them to resort to dialogue to  resolve the crisis despite the fact that there have been  considerable losses and clashes.    [Al-Ustuwani] The Arab League had proposed sending Arab  forces. Are you in favor of such a solution and of Arab League  intervention, bearing in mind that President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih rejected that?    [Muhammad] I support dialogue and the efforts being made by  the Arab League and some Arab and friendly states to contain the  crisis, but that, in my view, does not justify sending Arab  forces to Yemen because the crisis is a Yemeni crisis and the  solution must be a Yemeni solution. I am against partition and  division in this case. The Arab efforts cannot succeed unless  all parties respond, which is not what we are seeing now.    [Al-Ustuwani] How do you feel about foreign military  intervention?    [Muhammad] As a matter of principle I am against the  dispatch of any Arab or foreign forces. I reject that. Somalia  is maybe an example of the failure of that to solve the problem.  This is a Yemeni problem and it is up to the Yemenis to define  it and to solve it.    [Al-Ustuwani] There are those who claim that neighboring  states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are behind the crisis and  that they have provided aid for the south. What do you think?    [Muhammad] We should not apportion blame haphazardly or hold  the brothers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or other foreign  powers, responsible in any way because the problem is an  internal Yemeni problem and the conflict an internal conflict,  and the solution must be a Yemeni solution. We should not blame  fraternal or friendly states for our own mistakes and failure in  Yemen. The brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other  Gulf states have made statements reaffirming their interest in  Yemen's stability, and we have felt these sentiments from them.    [Al-Ustuwani] In your view, what role can the United  States play to contain the crisis?    [Muhammad] We have, from the beginning, welcomed the  positive U.S. role in containing the crisis. The U.S.  initiative emphasized Yemeni unity, democracy, modernization,  and stability. We saw these proposals and initiative as a  special stance by Washington toward the Yemeni people.  Washington realizes that stability in Yemen means stability in  the region.    [Al-Ustuwani] Are you in favor of raising the issue at the  Security Council?    [Muhammad] I do not believe that is necessary. What has the  Security Council got to do with it, if these are internal  differences? We have rejected Arab military intervention, so  are we to accept foreign solutions? This is an internal matter  and we do not allow intervention in it.    [Al-Ustuwani] Are you holding any consultations or contacts  with the Yemeni parties?    [Muhammad] There have been contacts between me and the  Yemeni president and vice president, and Salim Salih Muhammad,  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] assistant secretary general who  is now in London, and other political figures in Yemen and  abroad such as Brigadier General Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib.  In all these contacts I emphasized -- and still do -- that the  crisis must be contained and resolved peacefully and that the  army and people of Yemen must be saved because anything else  would weaken Yemen and its standing in the world.    [Al-Ustuwani] What about your own personal initiative for  the settlement of the Yemeni crisis?    [Muhammad] I am now making contacts with the aim of finding  a way to halt what is happening now. The Yemeni people are  always my concern because they are suffering for no fault of  their own. I want peace and security for the Yemeni people. I  had previously made an initiative, and last month I submitted  another initiative to the political leadership -- but they did  not respond to it, nor did they respond to the other Arab  initiatives made by our brothers and friends.    [Al-Ustuwani] Can you tell us about your second initiative,  concerning which nothing has been published?    [Muhammad] It is a practical program for the next phase. It  would not be beneficial to divulge its details now. My role is  not one of mediator but of someone who cares about national  unity, Yemeni unity, and sparing Yemen the dangers of war,  destruction, and partition. It is not a role in pursuit of  personal gain or interest, nor of achieving personal political  objectives. At any rate, we are awaiting what happens next.    [Al-Ustuwani] So, you are not at present contemplating  returning to Yemen to help stop the deterioration?    [Muhammad] Quite the contrary. I am willing to go to Yemen  if the general interest requires it and if the leadership is  willing to respond to such an initiative. I am prepared to  sacrifice for Yemen and for the future and security of Yemen,  whatever the consequences. [passage omitted]    [Al-Ustuwani] It has been claimed that forces loyal to you  have now joined the military battles on the side of the northern  forces to topple the Aden [leaders]. Is that true?    [Muhammad] I have instructed the forces and people loyal to  me to put Yemen's unity above all other considerations. They  are fighting for that now. Wherever my forces are, they are a  part of the Yemeni forces working for Yemen's future...and I am  in contact with them and with all the Arab brothers and friends.  We await the settlement of the situation and the restoration of  calm for the Yemen people, but there are still fears about the  possible consequences of victory by either side.</p>

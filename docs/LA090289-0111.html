			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAINTED MILK IS RECALLED BY ADOHR  </P> <P> Santa Ana-based Adohr Farms on Friday recalled more than 30,000 gallons of milk  and other dairy products contaminated with penicillin, but as much as 5,000  gallons of the tainted product may have been sold, officials said.  </P> <P> The milk, which contains beta-lactam, an antibiotic residue of penicillin,  could cause an allergic reaction in some people, but does not pose a general  health risk, state health officials said.  </P> <P> The tainted milk contained levels of penicillin "slightly above legal levels,"  said Jan Wessell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and  Agriculture. She cautioned that people sensitive to penicillin should avoid the  product.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dairy Cows Suspected  </P> <P> Officials still are trying to determine how the milk was contaminated but have  speculated that it could have originated with dairy cows treated with  penicillin for various ailments.  </P> <P> Products affected by the recall are one-gallon containers of whole milk dated  Sept. 10, half-gallons of nonfat milk dated Sept. 9 and pints and quarts of  Nestle's chocolate milk dated Sept. 12.  </P> <P> Gary San Filippo, vice president and general manager of Adohr Farms, said  30,230 gallons of milk were found to have traces of the antibiotic. He said all  but 5,000 gallons had been recovered.  </P> <P> "Of the 5,000 gallons that we have not been able to account for, I would think  a good deal has been sold since it had been on the shelves since early  Wednesday," San Filippo said.  </P> <P> San Filippo said the milk was shipped this week to 80 7-Eleven Food stores in  Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and 40 of the convenience stores  in San Diego County.  </P> <P> An Adohr spokeswoman said the recall was a "voluntary precaution," adding that  no illnesses had been reported.  </P> <P> "State (health officials) have said it is not too much to be concerned about  because levels in individual cartons are too low to pose a risk," Adohr  spokeswoman Deborah Sarden said. "We are doing this to ensure there are no  problems and that nothing could happen."  </P> <P> An ice cream mix -- used to make milkshakes and other products -- that was  shipped to warehouses, was also found to have traces of penicillin, but company  officials believe all of that mix has been recovered, Sarden said.  </P> <P> Company officials said they have not determined how or where the penicillin was  introduced into the milk products. The company buys its milk from independent  dairies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inquiry Opened  </P> <P> The contamination was discovered Thursday, after the state Department of Food  and Agriculture conducted tests on the milk.  </P> <P> Adohr officials have begun an inquiry into why the company's own tests did not  reveal the contamination, San Filippo said.  </P> <P> "We have a very strict policy in testing all incoming milk by two different  tests that should indicate the presence of antibiotics," he said. "It appears  there was a failure in methodology, either with the people who handled this or  with the equipment."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, state health officials said they are investigating the source of the  contamination.  </P> <P> All farmers are supposed to ensure that immunized dairy cows are separated from  those used for production, Wessell said. The dairy at fault in this instance  could face suspension, she added.  </P> <P> "This shouldn't have happened. Dairies are supposed to keep this from  happening," Wessell said. "Our concern would be to stop operations until we  have assurances that there is an adequate system for segregating cows and that  there is no possibility of contamination."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Complaints  </P> <P> Karen Minor, a dairy buyer for the San Diego division of Southland Corp., which  owns the 7-Eleven chain, said her company had received no consumer complaints  or calls from individual stores about the recall.  </P> <P> "I spoke to Adohr at about 8 a.m., and they indicated they had gone out to  stores and were reasonably sure the products were all pulled," Minor said.  </P> <P> She said milk sales at their stores were not disrupted because Adohr was able  to deliver fresh, untainted milk the same day.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ROK Government has mapped a plan to build a  North-South expressway network linking Seoul and Pyongyang and  Seoul and Wonsan in preparations for the North-South  reunification. The plan calls for building an East-West express  railway linking Seoul and Chongjin via Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon,  Mt. Sorak, and Mt. Kumgang. The government reported this plan to  the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] on 19 May.    The "three-stage plan on building traffic networks in  preparations for reunification" the government reported to the  party that day calls for linking the severed roads and railways  between Seoul and the DMZ in the first stage; building roads and  railways in preparation for the North-South exchange of  materials in the second stage; and building high-speed roads and  railways after reunification in the third stage.    The government and the DLP plan to hold joint meetings soon  and discuss how to raise funds and other matters for building  roads and railways linking the North and South.    The first stage of this plan calls for renovating the  National Road No. 1 linking Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan as a  preliminary step toward linking Seoul and Pyongyang. It also  calls for expanding National Road No. 39 linking Seoul and  Panmunjom via Pyokche, as a detour to Panmunjom.    As a preliminary step toward building a Seoul-Wonsan line,  it  calls for expanding National Road No. 3 linking Seoul and  Chorwon via Tongduchon and Yonchon and National Road No. 43  linking Seoul and Kimhwa via Pochon and Chorwon from two-lane  roads to four-lane roads.    As for the railway system, the plan calls for restoring the  Munsan-Panmunjom line to link Seoul and Sinuiju.    The second stage of the plan on building Seoul-Pyongyang  links calls for expanding the Seoul-Kaesong road to a six-lane  expressway and link this road to Seoul's outer beltway. It also  calls for extending the Freedom Road to link Seoul and Pyongyang  via Koyang, Munsan, and Kaesong.    As for the Seoul-Wonsan road line, the plan calls for  linking  Seoul and Wonsan via Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and  Pyonggang. It also calls for extending National Road No. 43 to  link Seoul and Pyonggang via Pochon, Chorwon, and Kimhwa.    As for the railway system for the second stage, the plan  calls for expanding the Seoul-Sinuiju Line to a double-track  line or a quadruple-track line. The first two-track line for an  electric train will link Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan, and the  second two-track line for an ordinary train will link Seoul and  Pyongyang via Munsan, Panmunjom, and Kaesong.    The plan also calls for expanding the Seoul-Wonsan railway  line to a double-track line or a quadruple-track line. The  first two-track line for an electric train will link Seoul and  Chorwon via Uijongbu, and the second two-track line for an  ordinary train will link Seoul and Pyonggang via Uijongbu and  Panmunjom.    The plan also calls for building an East-West electric  railway line for tourists. This line will link Seoul and Mt.  Kumgang via Chunchon and Mt. Sorak.    The third stage of the plan calls for building a six-lane  expressway linking Seoul and Nampo via Kimpo, Kanghwa, and  Haeju. It also calls for expanding the four-lane National Road  No. 3 to a six-lane expressway to link Seoul and Chongjin via  Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and Wonsan.    As for the railway system, the plan calls for renovating the  Seoul-Sinuiju railway line into a high-speed railway line and  connect it to the Seoul-Pusan high-speed rail system. Then,  Pusan and Sinuiju will be linked via Taegu, Taejon, Seoul,  Pulgwang, Munsan, Kaesong, and Pyongyang.    The Seoul-Wonsan railway line will link Seoul and Wonsan via  Uijongbu, Panmunjom, and Pyonggang. And the East-West  high-speed railway line will link Seoul and Chongjin via  Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon, Mt. Sorak, Mt. Paektu, and Wonsan.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Pressure over Maxwell report grows CALLS FOR the government to publish the report by Imro, the investment management regulatory organisation, into the supervision of the Maxwell companies intensified yesterday. MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners believe that the way the government is allowing the row over publishing the report to continue while extracts are selectively leaked jeopardises the work of the special unit set up to recover pension-fund assets. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and one of the MPs leading the campaign on behalf of the pensioners, has warned the government that it risks accusations of a 'cover-up' if it continues to allow attention to focus on what might still remain secret in the report, rather than on the role of the banks and others. Pressure has been heightened by a report in the London Evening Standard that the Imro report says the Bank of England prevented Robert Maxwell purchasing two British merchant banks in the late 1980s. The Bank of England declined to comment on the report, saying it could not discuss its supervisory activities. The newspaper report said the Bank told Imro Maxwell wanted to purchase Guiness Peat in 1987 and in 1989 sought to take control of the private merchant banking group Robert Fraser. The Bank confirmed its policy would be to require any purchaser of a 15 per cent stake in a UK bank to pass a 'fit and proper' assessment and Maxwell never acquired a stake larger than that in any UK bank. The Financial Times last week received a telephone call from a woman claiming to have a copy of the report and offering it for sale. Sources in the Evening Standard said the paper had not bought the Imro report, although it had heard that an individual had been offering to sell it. Last night the Securities and Investments Board and Imro were considering a formal investigation into allegations that the document had been offered for sale. Only limited numbers were printed and each was numbered. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, yesterday demanded a government statement in the Commons about publishing the Imro report. Rescue for MGN, Page 21</p>

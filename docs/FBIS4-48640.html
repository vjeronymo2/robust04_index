			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>   [Text] Like many of his colleagues on the new cabinet,  Justice Minister Dullar Omar has first-hand experience of  apartheid's harsh security laws. In fact, one of the most  important cases on detention and government powers to infringe  individual rights, bears his name. In 1985, while he was still  a member of the Cape Bar, Mr Omar was detained under the State  of Emergency and brought an unsuccessful application for his  release.    The resulting Appeal Court judgment in Omar vs the State  President was one of the low points in Emergency case law.  However, when the Cape Supreme Court first heard the case, Cape  Judge President Gerald Friedman dissented from his two fellow  judges. He filed a decision which human rights lawyers say will  go down as one of the great judgments in a particularly dark  period for the rule of law in this country.    Following the Appellate Division decision against him, Mr  Omar spent two months in emergency detention. Earlier that year  he had already been detained for two months under security laws,  with only 10 days' freedom before being detained a second time.    The experience has left him a fierce opponent of detention.  He says it has a devastating effect on detainees and their  families and dehumanises those who "do the detaining".    Mr Omar wants to use his portfolio to transform the justice  system, making it respectable and legitimate in the eyes of  society, so that it can help create and maintain a human rights  culture.    "The first priority in achieving this aim is to implement  the  new constitution. The Judicial Service Commission and the  Constitutional Court must be set up, along with the Human Rights  Commission, the Commission on Gender Equality and the public  protector's office. All are urgent and we must help get them  going."    "Fortunately, the department began working on these matters  even before I got here, so we will be able later this month to  present to the first sitting of Parliament any legislation  needed to establish these bodies."    Giving his personal view on capital punishment, he says that  as a member of the ANC and the National Association of  Democratic Lawyers, he has long been opposed to the death  penalty.    On the problem of how to make the judiciary better reflect  society's composition, he hints that he might consider borrowing  from the Continental system, in which potential judges are  selected early in their career and given specialist training.    Mr Omar was admitted as an attorney in 1960 and as an  advocate in 1982 and he has previously gone on record supporting  fusion of the two professions. In his new capacity, however, he  wants any decision on this issue to be taken with community  needs in mind. "The yardstick is improved access to justice and  reduced expense for people who need to go to court."    He wants lawyers countrywide to become involved in deciding  the issue. But not only lawyers. "It is important that the  public also participates in this debate."    On the relationship between government and the  Constitutional  Court, he says that since World War 2 similar courts in Europe  have played a "politico-constitutional" role. "But that does  not mean they must descend into the political arena, and  political parties must ensure that they respect the position of  the Constitutional Court as standing above party politics."    All judicial officers, from magistrates to judges of the  highest court, must take a new oath of office. Some legal  activists have long supported the idea, saying it might help  keep out judges or magistrates unable to identify with the  values of a democratic society. The oath, however, is still a  controversial issue with argument in legal circles both for and  against. But Mr Omar favours the idea. He says taking the oath  implies "the values underpinning the new constitution are part  of your approach".    "This is exciting. It means that irrespective of the past,  everybody is given an opportunity to become part of the new  human rights culture and help promote it in their work."    His political life began at Trafalgar High School in Cape  Town, when he joined a boycott of the Republic Festival in 1952.  Eight years later, he had hardly opened the doors of his new  legal practice when the whole PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress]  executive walked in and asked whether he would act for them.  The next day they were all arrested.    That started a legal career acting for political trialists,  and for prisoners on Robben Island which he visited several  times a week to see clients. For many years he was a staunch  member of the Unity Movement, only quitting at the time the  United Democratic Front was formed. His decision to join the  Congress movement was partly influenced by President Nelson  Mandela whose attorney he had become by that stage.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / 'Dove' parties in electoral pact: Alliance to promote a Palestinian state THREE Israeli parties which advocate acceptance of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have agreed to form a pact in the coming general election which will almost certainly make them the third largest group of MPs after Likud and Labour, the main parties. As legislation to call an election on June 23 passed smoothly through the Knesset yesterday, the three small parties predicted their alliance would increase their joint representation from 10 at present to at least 15 seats in the 120-seat parliament thanks to the country's extreme form of proportional representation. The alliance was confirmed when Mapam, a democratic socialist party with three Knesset seats, voted on Monday night to form a combined list of election candidates with the Citizens Rights Movement, with five seats, and Shinui, which has two seats. Although Mapam's socialist ideology is at odds with the free market beliefs of the other two, their virtually identical views on the overriding political issue of the occupied territories makes them natural partners. They hope to increase the chances of a 'dovish' coalition emerging to succeed the hardline government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir. However, their alliance will more likely damage Labour's already slim chances of defeating the Likud in the race to be the biggest Knesset party. Their acceptance of Palestinian independence, still officially rejected by Labour, poses no threat to Likud's support but could attract more 'dovish' Labour voters. If the more uncompromising Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the former premier and defence minister, ousts Mr Shimon Peres from the Labour leadership later this month, the new alliance of the doves may ultimately make a revived Likud-Labour coalition the likeliest election outcome.</p>

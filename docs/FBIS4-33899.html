			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Carlos Amat by </F> correspondent Pedro Manuel Otero at the Hilton Hotel in  Cartagena de Indias; date not given; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Otero] We are here at the Hilton Hotel, which is  the seat of the 10th conference of justice ministers. We will  take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor  Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we  would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed  and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban  delegation?    [Amat] The meeting of Ibero-American justice ministers is a  conference that has been held for several years. As you stated,  this is the 10th conference. On this occasion we touched on  topics that appear to be permament topics on our agendas. One  is the topic of the fight against drug trafficking. This topic  does not have the same implication in Cuba as in other countries  because our society does not engage in using, trafficking, or  producing drugs. For other countries, however, it does have a  serious connotation. Some of those countries are drug producers  and are hard hit by the drug trafficking problem. Although we  do not have this problem in our country, it is a very useful  topic because the experience of countries that are victims of  this situation can always be learned from. They are teachings  that benefit us because Cuba is fighting hard to prevent drug  trafficking from invading us. This does not mean, however, that  we are immune to it or are exempt from it. It could happen to  us. Our duty, therefore, is to prepare technically and to learn  about the problem, to be able to wage an anti-drug program if  necessary. There are isolated cases, however, involving  tourists. It is not a problem that affects us to the extent it  affects other countries, however.    Another topic, which has been very important, is the topic  of  the family, which was discussed in recognition of the  international year of the family. In this sense, the essence of  the debate has centered on children who are abandoned and on the  problem of adoption.    Of course, such topics are discussed fundamentally from a  legal standpoint, considering juridical aspects. In the case of  the family, the social aspect also plays an important role.  Cuba has had many years of experience in which it has dedicated  much attention to minors and devoted much attention to working  mothers, so that children can be taken care of. Legally, our  laws recognize the adoption problem. We have a family code  which provides for discussion of the topic with special  relevance. This shows the importance the revolution has always  placed on the family, as the nucleus of society. In this sense,  Cuba was able to contribute to the discussion. We had the  opportunity to explain our experiences. Our proposal was well  received. Many questions were asked and we heard of situations  that exist in other countries.    [Otero] Thank you, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat, for  your statements for Radio Havana Cuba.</p>

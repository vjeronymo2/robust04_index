			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Members of a band of Chippewa Indians in Mole Lake, Wis., voted against a state  proposal for a $10-million buyout to limit the band's hunting and fishing  treaty rights. Arlyn Ackley, tribal chairman, said the vote was 131-24 against  the proposal. The state's offer called for paying $1.25 million the first year  and $1 million a year for the next nine years, he said. In exchange, the band  would give up treaty spearfishing rights, except for certain ceremonial  purposes, and lumbering rights on non-reservation public lands. The money would  have financed the band's tribal administration, economic development projects  and health and welfare programs.  </P></p>

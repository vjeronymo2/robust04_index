Inmarsat is a cooperative with 71 member countries which  operates a system of satellites to provide mobile voice and data  communications to land-based users, ships and aircraft. At  present, more than 30,000 Inmarsat mobile terminals are in use  in more than 165 countries.    The Ministry of Communications is Inmarsat's Chinese  contracting party, while the Beijing Marine Communications and  Navigation Company (BMCNC) joined the organization on behalf of  China.    Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director general, said at a press  conference in Beijing today that the aim of the resident office  is to promote exchanges between Inmarsat and China, trying to  introduce advanced telecommunication technologies to more  Chinese departments.    At the primary stage the office will mainly develop its  business in China, while in the future it will expand its  business to the whole Asia-Pacific area.    Building of Beijing Inmarsat earth stations, constructed and  managed by the BMCNC, was finished in June 1991 and July 1993,  respectively, and Beijing Inmarsat-A and Inmarsat-C earth  stations have already been operational to cover the Indian Ocean  and Pacific Ocean areas.    By the end of 1993 Inmarsat had more than 550 various  terminal users in China.</p>

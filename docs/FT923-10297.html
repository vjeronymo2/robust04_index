			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Midland management shake-up set in train - Pearse announces break-up of branch network into five regions MR BRIAN Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, yesterday sounded the death knell for the group's complicated management structure. He also performed the last rites over two of its trading names, Midland Group, which since the mid-1980s has been used to describe the parent company, and Midland Montagu, which embraced investment banking and some corporate banking. Under the ownership of Hongkong Bank, Midland is being simplified. However, Mr Pearse said many of the changes had been planned long before the takeover. 'When I joined the bank (in the spring of 1991), it was a nightmare', he said. 'The management arrangements were too complicated.' There will now be six business units. Branch banking, under Mr Chris Wathen. Corporate and institutional banking, run by Mr David Thornham. Financial services, under Mr Kerry Alberti. Forward Trust, the finance house, and Firstdirect, the telephone bank, under Mr Graham Picken. Treasury, run by Mr Guy Heald. Merchant banking, run by Mr Christopher Sheridan. These posts report directly to Mr Pearse. As a result, two senior Midland jobs become redundant - the head of the UK bank and the head of Midland Montagu. So Mr Gene Lockhart and Mr George Loudon, who filled these respective roles, have left. In the coming weeks, about 100 middle managers employed by Midland's head office and centrally managed operations will also depart due to the integration with Hongkong Bank. Meanwhile, commercial banking on the Continent and support services - the finance department, risk management, personnel and legal services - will report to Mr Keith Whitson. The newly appointed deputy chief executive, who was transferred from Hongkong Bank, will also report to Mr Pearse. But probably the most important management change is the break-up of the branch network into five regions, each with its own general manager. Mr Pearse stressed that these were senior posts and that the general managers would have direct contact with him - so in that sense, Mr Wathen is primus inter pares in his relations with these managers, Mr Pearse said. Mr Pearse is at pains to stress the seniority of these new posts for two reasons. First he needs to reassure the incumbents, at least two of whom - Mr Bob Wyatt, formerly deputy managing director of corporate banking, and Mr David Baker, retail banking director - may feel that they have moved down a notch in the hierarchy. Second he is genuinely committed to devolving power to the regions. He believes that in the 1980s the big banks' ability to control risk and meet customers' needs was impaired by a centralisation of decision-making - and that the huge loan losses they all face has been the price paid. The regional general managers will devote considerable resources to improving the service offered to corporate customers, aided by a parallel process of unifying Midland's corporate lending operations. About 300 Enterprise branches and branch sections, providing loans of up to Pounds 75,000 to small companies, will disappear. They will be integrated into the main branch network, thereby abolishing the distinction between very small business loans and slightly bigger loans. In addition, over the coming year, the regions will also assume responsibility for banking relationships with all UK companies, except the 700 biggest ones. These more medium-size relationships are currently managed by David Thornham's corporate banking unit. He will, however, gradually take control of Hongkong Bank's UK corporate banking operations. As a result of these changes, some of Midland's specialist corporate lenders will be redeployed. The aim, said Mr Pearse, was for the bank to increase market share in order to achieve any serious growth in the business. This was necessary because Mr Pearse is pessimistic about the outlook for growth in the UK banking market. Mr Pearse also stressed that the regional managers were conscious that they must not drop their lending standards in order to win new business. However some companies and individuals may choose to bank with Midland simply because they perceive it to have become more robust under Hongkong Bank's ownership. Indeed, Mr Pearse said that the bank had indeed attracted a significant number of new clients for this reason. But the task of rebuilding Midland is only half done, he said. Only days away from his 59th birthday, he does not know when he will retire - but he will be around until 'the job is complete.'</p>

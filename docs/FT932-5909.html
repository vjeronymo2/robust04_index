			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Visions of Europe: Mass trick treaty The ordinary British man and woman no longer believes that dreadful Johnny Foreigner lurks menacingly on the quayside of Calais. We really are a lot more sophisticated than that. When The Sun recently offered its readers the chance to sail to France for Pounds 1, an estimated 400,000 took up the offer. No Europhobia there. What Sun readers - one in six of the UK population - want from Europe is simple: an open, free and liberal trading area within which we can create wealth and jobs, make our own laws, retain our own culture and run our own lives. We welcome the freedom to travel, to work, to compete on level terms, to attract investment by offering working conditions which suit our people. We want to be able to decide how much fish we can take from our own waters and which crops our farmers can grow. Most of all we want the other members of this supposed partnership to obey the rules as scrupulously as we do. The more contentious issues are those that Sun readers do not want. They do not want to be dictated to by an unelected European Commission, which is run by expatriate civil servants detached from domestic reality, and backed up by an unelected, politicised European Court. The issue is not whether sausages should be pink or cucumbers should be straight. It is about the sovereignty of a British parliament to act on behalf of a British electorate which can choose every five years, to kick out the whole darned lot if it so wishes. Sun readers have no desire for a common currency. They want a pound, just as the French want a franc and the Germans want a D-Mark. Britons see no need for an exchange rate mechanism that locks us to the currencies of countries which, quite properly, put their interests before those of their competitors. Sun readers don't want political union in a Federal States of Europe. We want to be British, not because we have a blinkered John Bull mentality, but because we want to maintain our own traditions and values. Putting it crudely, the British have nothing in common with the Greeks, just as the Portuguese have nothing in common with the Danes. When Ted Heath talked us into joining Europe 20 years ago, it was sold as the Common Market. It was a place to sell our wares, not our souls. Slowly our eyes are opening to the reality that the architects of the European dream have a more sinister plan than we were led to believe. That is why The Sun has derided Jacques Delors with front-page headlines like: 'Up Yours, Delors]' That is why the Maastricht treaty fills us with suspicion, no matter how much Mr Major protests its innocence and even irrelevance. Britain has seen the way Europe twists the rules to suit itself. We know about the Pounds 4bn fraud within the Common Agricultural Policy. We've seen French farmers burn our lamb then drive off in tractors bought with subsidies from the British taxpayers. We've seen our fish destroyed, our apple crops crushed. Petty complaints in the scheme of world affairs, maybe, but ones which come from the heart. Twice this century, Britain has gone to war to bring peace to Europe. Among our partners we detect few indications of a willingness to stand up and fight for a cause that is just. We wish to retain our Nato and transatlantic links that have stood us in such good stead. Can we trust the likes of the Belgians, for example, who refused to supply ammunition for the Gulf War? We won't have our foreign policy dictated by them or our armed services answering to a Ruritanian defence union which would be more interested in ducking the flak than fighting for a principle. One final issue shines like a beacon. What Sun readers want most of all is for their voices to be heard. They have been denied a referendum on Maastricht for one good reason - politicians know that, despite support from the three main parties, it would be defeated by we reckon at least 65-55 per cent. So politicians should be warned. One day, Sun readers may get their own back. The author is editor of The Sun</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Canada to axe bases in budget curbs Canada will close more than a third of its military bases and severely curtail its CDollars 1.8bn (Pounds 910m) share of the international space station programme as part of a wide range of spending cuts announced in yesterday's federal budget. Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, also ended various corporate and personal tax breaks with the aim of bringing down the budget deficit from CDollars 45.7bn (Pounds 23.1bn) in the year to March 31 1994 to CDollars 39.7bn in 1995 and CDollars 32.7bn the following year. Mr Martin said, however, that the budget was only the first step towards meeting three challenges. These challenges were a framework for economic recovery, reform of social security programmes, and the restoration of 'fiscal sanity' to government. As an initial step towards overhauling the social security system, unemployment insurance premiums will be rolled back next year to 1993 levels. But benefits will be significantly curtailed. The projected closure of 21 out of 60 military bases, stations and units is part of a projected 12 per cent cut in defence spending over the next five years. Mr Martin also announced a two-year extension of a civil service pay freeze. Tax measures included the abolition of a CDollars 100,000 capital gains exemption, and moves to prevent Canadian-based companies from using foreign affiliates to avoid paying tax. Various other measures will be taken to close corporate tax loopholes. Mr Martin said Canada's foreign aid would be cut by 2 per cent next year and frozen until 1997. Grants to business are to be reduced by CDollars 225m a year. By 1997 these grants will be 10 per cent lower than in the present fiscal year. The budget projections are based on real growth in gross domestic product of 3 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent in 1995. Real GDP growth for 1993 was put at 2.5 per cent. Consumer prices are forecast to edge up by 0.8 per cent in 1994, with inflation accelerating slightly to 1.3 per cent next year. Last year prices rose by 1.8 per cent. Mr Martin said the budget moves set a clear path to achieve the goal of reducing the budget deficit to 3.0 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97. Over the next three years the government plans to cut CDollars 5 in spending for every CDollars 1 raised in new revenues.</p>

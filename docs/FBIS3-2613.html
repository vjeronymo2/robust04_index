The "Circular" noted: As rural reform deepened and as a  market economy enjoyed development, a number of peasant  specialized trade associations, including specialized technical  associations and research societies, emerged as the times  required. As of the end of 1992, there were over 1.4 million  various peasant specialized trade associations spread over all  fields of endeavor in the rural economy. Peasant specialized  trade associations are privately run organizations for technical  and economic cooperation initiated by peasants on a voluntary  basis. They were established for the purpose of increasing  members' income. Based on management by peasant households,  they encouraged members to assist and cooperate with each other  in respect of funds, technology, production, and supply and  marketing. Practices have proved that the development of  peasant specialized trade associations is conducive to  increasing peasants' income more quickly, and gives tremendous  impetus to peasant households' economic development and to the  governments' market cultivation.    The "Circular" stressed: All areas must correctly guide  peasant specialized trade associations to develop steadily in  line with the objective needs of establishing a socialist market  economy. They must pay attention to grasping the following  points when actually carrying out work: 1) The principle --  "run and managed by the private sectors who will benefit from  their management" -- must be adhered to. The will of peasants  must be respected when establishing and developing peasant  specialized trade associations. They may join the assoications  of their own free will and quit as they wish. An internal  management system must be gradually established and improved.  All areas must persist in the orientation of serving  agricultural production, rural areas, and peasants; they must  conscientiously focus efforts on offering good services to  members.    2) Adhering to the principle of establishing and  developing various forms of specialized peasant associations.  As far as cooperation is concerned, technical-exchange  associations, associations providing services for production and  management, and associations in the form of technological and  economic entities may be established in line with local  conditions. With regard to initiation of such associations,  both individuals as well as scientific and technical personnel  may take the lead in initiating the establishment of such  associations. With regard to their scope of activities, such  associations may carry out activities within a community; they  may also carry out inter-community activities. In line with  practical needs, various types of specialized peasant  associations may carry out various forms of cooperative  activities. 3) It is necessary to respect the rights of  specialized peasant associations to make independent decisions,  and the relationship between them and other organizations should  be handled properly. Being a part of the social service system  in rural areas, state economic, scientific, and technological  departments; township and village collective economic  organizations; and specialized peasant associations should pay  attention to exploiting their respective advantages, share work  in a cooperative manner, and strive to provide service to  peasant households to help them develop production. No unit or  individual is allowed to transfer the property of specialized  peasant associations and their members. 4) In establishing such  associations, the authorities in various localities must take  into account the practical needs of peasants and offer specific  guidance in light of local conditions; under no circumstances  should they insist on uniformity, still less should they rush  headlong into mass action. 5) Higher and lower levels should  coordinate with each other, and all sectors should cooperate in  creating a good external environment for the development of such  associations.    The circular urged all localities to further create  favorable  conditions for the vigorous development of specialized peasant  associations, adding that at present all localities should focus  on carrying out the following tasks: First, they should conduct  investigations and studies to get a good picture of the main  types of specialized peasant associations, their number, and  their organization in their respective areas, and should study  new situations and new problems. Second, they should sum up  experiences, and guide and help the steady development of  various types of specialized peasant associations through  experimentation and example. Third, they should organize  various forms of training classes to gradually improve the  skills of the managerial personnel of such associations.  Fourth, all localities should assist specialized peasant  associations in establishing sound regulations and rules in  order to strengthen internal management. At the same time, it  is necessary to provide specialized peasant associations with  markets, scientific and technological information, and other  services in order to help them grow.</p>

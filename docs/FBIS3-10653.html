			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese and Finance </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso has threatened to reduce the import tax rates to prevent  speculation. Cardoso promised: "We are going to reduce the  import tax rates and bring cheaper products into the country."  His strategy is based on the "surprise factor." Whoever doubts  the government's capacity to discourage abusive price increases,  Fernando Henrique maintains that he is prepared to face  speculators. "We are prepared to act firmly, especially against  prices established by oligopolies. These increases have a short  life if we have a firm government -- and we do. We are  determined to lower those prices, and we are not going to  announce how we are going to do so," he exclaimed.    Fernando Henrique said that he is going to use imports only  to halt price markups. The minister hopes that with the  beginning of the harvest prices will start to drop, but insisted  he is going to fight price increases. "These increases were  attributed to a possible price freeze, but the government did  and will not freeze prices. Therefore, it is mere speculation."    As for salaries, the minister does not believe in an  automatic salary adjustment for the inflation rate because "the  URV [real value unit] will automatically adjust salaries."  "There will only be a real salary increase when prices do not  increase. That business of increasing salaries by 80 percent  and prices by 120 percent is deceitful, and I do not agree with  it." Once again Fernando Henrique said that the minimum salary  is "very low," but insisted that this problem cannot be solved  by decree. "I want the minimum salary to become a mere  reference figure, that in practice it not be the salary earned  by anyone, because if this could be solved by decree I would  increase it to $500 instead of $100."</p>

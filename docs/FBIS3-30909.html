			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "Who Is Interested in Making Us </F> Appear in the World as a Nation of Cunning People"]    [Text] The government coalition has made and continues to  make a big fuss about our image in the world. Through this  image, one certainly understands not only opinions about Romania  of today but also about the Romanians as a nation. Therefore,  the left-wing coalition, sprinkled with nationalism, has  protested against Romania being presented abroad either as a  bloodthirsty nation or a nation of profiteers. From this point  of view, the criticism of certain exaggerated adventures of some  of our fellow citizens abroad was more than justified. On the  basis of the fact that in who knows what capital city of the  world, a Romanian has been caught stealing something, the  conclusion often drawn is that the Romanians are a nation of  petty thieves. Less justified were the explanations given by  the government coalition for the bad image of Romanians in the  world. The domestic and foreign press were accused of  practicing falsifications and exaggeration. The pro-government  and pro- presidential correspondents have carried out quite a  few attacks against the so-called defamation of the Romanian  realities by the domestic press, which is sold to the enemies of  the country.    It is not excluded that the international press has also  played a certain role in establishing our image as a nation. In  the search for a sensation, it sometimes chooses something that  is shocking in the life of a nation or a country. However, the  major responsibility for the negative image, with which the name  of Romania is associated in the world, should be sought  elsewhere, namely some of the current actions of the ruling  coalition -- that is, precisely the force that is complaining  everywhere about the distortion of our image abroad. A ominous  example in this respect is the stand of the Romanian officials  regarding the fulfillment of conditions that were set to us when  we were admitted to the Council of Europe. When the famous  amendments to the admittance documents were formulated, we stood  at attention and shouted more than the gentle soldier Svejk:  Yes, sir! We pledge to fulfill them and overfulfill them!  Since they are serious people who know what a pledge means, the  Council of Europe admitted us. However, they pointed it out, in  a polite but firm manner, that the amendments must be  implemented in Romania's social and political life. At that  time, they could not imagine that anything else might happen  except that after our admittance to the Council of Europe, we  would immediately and enthusiastically start implementing the  solemnly made commitments. At that time, I was among the  analysts who issued a warning -- namely, that we should not play  with fire. Some of the amendments -- we said then -- were  absurd. They expressed the aberrant tendency of West Europe to  impose rigidly its own living standards on the specific  realities prevailing in East Europe. Thus, I was saying that it  would have been much better if we had stated that we would not  be able to fulfill all the conditions. Maybe we would not have  been admitted to the Council of Europe, but we would have been  much more honest, more correct, and, mainly, much closer to the  national interest. All this, because it would be much more  serious if the West had created an image about us as a nation  that does not know how to keep its word than not admit us into  the Council of Europe. Since we have been accepted, considering  that we gave our solemn word, we should by all means start  fulfilling the conditions set by the Council of Europe. My  warning was based on a suspicion -- that the Romanian officials  do not intend to do anything toward the implementation of those  amendments. When we were admitted to the Council of Europe, we  acted in accordance with our old Dimbovita [river crossing  Bucharest] style -- that is, "We say as they say, but we do as  we want." Unfortunately, my suspicion has been justified.  After we had been accepted to the Council of Europe -- that is,  after we crossed the bridge -- we did nothing to fulfill our  promise. In Strasbourg recently, our parliamentary delegation  was placed in an uncomfortable situation. When asked about the  stage of implementation of the respective amendments, the  delegation had to hum and how, stammer in embarrassment, and  even lie. Considering that the people at the Council of Europe  are very polite, they did not tell us what they thought about  our attitude. However, I am sure that, among themselves, they  thought immediately about the accusations voiced against us --  that we are a nation of cunning and boasting people who promise  a lot and do nothing. Then, is it not natural to ask who is  contributing to the negative image that is circulating in the  world about the Romanian people?</p>

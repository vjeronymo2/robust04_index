			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Government outlaws loyalist UDA THE GOVERNMENT yesterday outlawed the Ulster Defence Association, the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'satisfied that the UDA is actively and primarily engaged in the commission of criminal, terrorist acts and so merits proscription'. For those purposes it acted as the Ulster Freedom Fighters, he said. The ban, which came into effect at midnight, means it is an offence to be a UDA member, to solicit funds or membership for the organisation, or to participate in any acts of the organisation. The UDA is the fourth loyalist group to be proscribed - the UFF is already banned, along with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commandos. The move was broadly welcomed in London and Dublin and by nationalists in Northern Ireland. It was strongly criticised by Unionists on the grounds that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, was not also banned. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said he did not understand why Sinn Fein 'which is also an organisation deeply involved in sectarian killings of Protestants' was not proscribed. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the decision not to ban Sinn Fein showed that the UDA ban was a sop to the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland security minister, said Sinn Fein's status was also kept under review. 'Sinn Fein is an organisation which does not condemn violence, which is thoroughly reprehensible and repugnant,' he said. 'If the criteria for banning an organisation under the emergency provisions were to apply to Sinn Fein then we would, in the course of a review, come to a different decision from what we have come to at the moment.' The UDA is thought to be responsible for the deaths of about a third of the more than 2,000 civilians killed in Northern Ireland in the past 23 years. It said yesterday that it would always be there to 'defend its community'. Six nationalist terrorist groups are proscribed - the IRA, the Irish National Liberation Army and four smaller groups.</p>

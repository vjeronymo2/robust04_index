			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Carsberg tells life houses to make 'daunting' reforms SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday gave the life assurance industry a 'daunting shopping list' of reforms it should carry out if it wanted to head off tighter regulation. He said at Chartered Insurance Institute meeting in Preston, Lancs: 'There should be a shift in competition away from who gives the best commission to who gives the best value to the customer.' His remarks come amid speculation that the Office of Fair Trading will call for much tighter regulation on disclosure of charges when it advises the government on the competition implications of the Securities and Investments Board's review of retail financial regulation. A decision is expected in the next two months. Sir Bryan's speech brought instant condemnation from the Association of British Insurers, which said he had 'betrayed a lack of understanding about how the insurance industry operates'. Sir Bryan suggested that, to stimulate competition, 'league tables' should be published showing the charges levied by different companies for equivalent policies. He also attacked the heavy penalties suffered by investors who surrender endowment policies early. 'No other investments result in such heavy automatic losses,' he said, calling for life offices to publish figures on how many of their policies persisted to maturity. Sir Bryan also criticised 'front-end loading' of charges and commissions so that they are all paid at the beginning of a policy. 'This gives inappropriate incentives,' he said. 'If commission depended more on the maintenance of policies over their extended lifetime, salespeople might give more attention to whether the policy fitted the needs of the customer.' The ABI said the proposals would damage independent advisers at the expense of tied agents and direct sales forces. The Consumers' Association welcomed Sir Bryan's speech, however, saying that the industry tended to blame consumers for its own deliberate obfuscation.</p>

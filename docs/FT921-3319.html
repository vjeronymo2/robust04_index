			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Party may be over for Pravda: Paper faces closure just short of 80th birthday PRAVDA, the most famous communist newspaper in the world, is 48 days short of its 80th birthday. The chances are, however, that it will not achieve octogenarian status, with the after-life it has managed to preserve since the death of the party in August being snuffed out at last. It has run out of money, and is several million roubles in debt. Its publisher, Pravda Publishing House - which it used to control - has given it a final warning: if it cannot pay, today's edition will be the last. After nearly 80 years of propaganda, lies, distortion, calumny and invention, Pravda has at last fallen foul of what it was founded to destroy: the iron law of profit. Mr Vselevod Ovchinnikov, a foreign affairs commentator for the paper, said last night that hugely increased costs for paper, distribution and services mean it costs Rbs600 to provide a copy of Pravda to each of its 1.5m subscribers and casual buyers - while the price of a subscription was set last year at Rbs29. The network of foreign correspondents - the finest flowers of Pravda and often skilled, if inevitably ideologically limited, observers of the international scene - once totalled nearly 50. It now has foreign bureaux only in Washington, London, Paris, Berlin and Beijing. Pravda's cost structure, should any western press baron be interested, is now horrendous. It gets Rbs30m a year from subscriptions, Rbs10m from kiosk sales and Rbs40m from advertising, making an income of Rbs80m. Its annual outgoings, however, are Rbs300m, of which only Rbs26m are editorial expenses. 'We want to try to survive until May 5, our 80th anniversary,' Mr Ovchinnikov said. 'We are planning a big festival.' However, the publisher, taken over after the August coup by the Russian Information Ministry, has called in its debts. A bank loan is being negotiated but Pravda executives do not believe that the publisher, now in the hands of ideological opponents, will wait. A gloomy board meeting yesterday came up with no new ideas, nor any new money. 'I think that this is connected with the events of March 17,' Mr Ovchinnikov said. 'The Russian authorities would be happy not to see us appear then.' A session of the defunct Peoples Congress of the Soviet Union is planned for that day in the Kremlin, together with a demonstration of former Communists and other anti-government forces in Moscow: Pravda has supported both initiatives. Mr Alexander Ilyin, a deputy editor, said: 'This is a sad loss for the country. Whatever you think of the paper and its past political allegiance, it is a national institution.' Once selling some 10m and required reading for all party members, as well as for all observers of the Soviet Union, because of its scanty and heavily coded glimpses into official policy, Pravda's circulation dropped to 1.3m at the end of last year. However, its staff say the circulation has risen to 1.5m as the paper gained readers because of its strong line of opposition to the Yeltsin government and to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. Ironically, the former Soviet Union's second-most famous paper, the evening Izvestia, celebrates its 75th anniversary today with a glitzy reception. Izvestia, once the government newspaper, now claims a circulation of 3.8m and follows a line of critical support to the Yeltsin government. However, it too will have a struggle to survive.</p>

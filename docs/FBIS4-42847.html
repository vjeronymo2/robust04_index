			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francoise Varenne report: "Clinton-Chirac </F> Discussions"]    [Text] Jacques Chirac [mayor of Paris and Rally for the  Republic, RPR, president] met yesterday with U.S. President  Bill Clinton. The half-hour meeting took place in U.S.  Ambassador Pamela Harriman's residence on the rue du Faubourg  St. Honore. The mayor of Paris was accompanied by Didier  Quentin, the city's international relations director, and Pierre  Lellouche, his foreign policy and defense adviser. Bill  Clinton's delegation included U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and Thomas McLarty, the President's chief of the  staff. Jacques Chirac and Bill Clinton spent most of the  meeting discussing international affairs, and in particular the  Bosnian conflict. On this issue, they were agreed that the arms  embargo should not be lifted. The RPR president also stressed  the seriousness of the situation in Algeria, which threatens to  destabilize the whole Maghreb region. Where nuclear testing is  concerned, Jacques Chirac stressed the need for France to carry  out a few more tests before switching over to test simulations.  For his part, Bill Clinton expressed his concern about the  growing risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological) and the danger that  this represents, insofar as they could be used by terrorist  groups.  <H5>  Working Group </H5>   Moreover, Jacques Chirac explained at length to the U.S.  President his views on the urgent and vital need to tackle the  narcotics problem at the production stage. In particular, he  stressed the considerable increase in the production of heroin  and its consequences, especially for young people.    Chirac also underscored the need to define a policy and take  action, possibly under the aegis of the United Nations, to  encourage countries producing narcotics to think about promoting  alternative sources of revenue for their farmers.    President Clinton showed much interest in this proposal. The  two men decided that regular contacts would be established  between experts on both sides and that a working group would be  set up to define a policy for the fight against narcotics  production.</p>

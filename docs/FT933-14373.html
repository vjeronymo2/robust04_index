			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe strong Positive news from Taiwan, along with the upgrading of profits expectations by BZW, once again led to strong demand for British Aerospace, sending the stock up a further 7 to 427p. As speculation continued about a lucrative order for Airbus Industrie, in which it has a 20 per cent holding, demand for the stock was boosted by news that Taiwan's Economics Ministry and a local banking consortium had agreed on financing for the planned regional jets venture with BAe. Sentiment was further enhanced by BZW, which increased its estimate of current year profits by Pounds 30m to Pounds 125m. It also raised the following year's forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 235m. The 1995 prediction is now at the top of the range. BZW cited the improvement of sales at Rover Group, BAe's carmaking subsidiary, for the change.</p>

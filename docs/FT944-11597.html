			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Resolution of HK airport row near The end to Hong Kong's protracted dispute with China over the financing of the colony's HKDollars 158bn (Pounds 12.6bn) airport project appears in sight after Britain and China signed an agreement yesterday which finally settled the financial structure of the project. The Hong Kong government was hopeful last night that China would approve the final details of the financial plan, possibly as early as next week. Sir Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said he was 'enthusiastic' to build on yesterday's agreement in talks which resume on Wednesday. The dispute over financing surfaced in late 1989 when the Hong Kong government said it would push ahead with the project in an effort to boost confidence in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. China, which never recognised the need to boost confidence, objected to the cost of the project from the outset. Yesterday's accord has cleared the way for the government to approach the Legislative Council for HKDollars 23bn of equity finance for the airport railway. It plans to begin this process next Friday. However, the agreement fell short of being comprehensive, as China wished to deal separately with two ancillary agreements between the government and the corporations building the airport and the railway. These will allow the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) and the soon-to-be incorporated Airport Authority to approach financial markets to borrow up to a further HKDollars 23bn. According to yesterday's joint statement China understood the importance of these accords, known as financial support agreements, and undertook to give its assent as soon as possible. It was hoped that the MTRC's support agreement could be settled next week. It is important for the MTRC that an accord is reached soon. It has been largely absent from public bond markets for the past two years. The long-running dispute over finance has not materially delayed the project. Over the past three years the government has awarded 73 construction contracts worth HKDollars 53bn for works related to the airport and its ancillary projects. In all, 11,000 people are employed by the project. Sir Hamish said the government would endeavour to complete as much of the airport and its railway as possible before British rule ceased in mid-1997. As part of yesterday's agreement it undertook to review timing and financing of the project with China during the second half of 1996.</p>

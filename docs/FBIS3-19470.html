After an  automatic emergency shutdown at noon on Wednesday [16 March],  the restart program was continued around 2315 [2215 GMT], power  plant manager Klaus Distler said on Thursday morning. The Hesse  Environment Ministry also agreed with the decision. The reactor  will probably be on line again by Friday morning, Distler said.    The power plant manager stated that the accident, which  caused the latest shutdown of the nuclear reactor on Wednesday,  was a "trifle": The short-circuit relay of a oil pump for  controlling the turbine activated for no reason and thus caused  the emergency shutdown. When the part was checked, no defect  was found. The oil pump is needed only during the start-up  phase; it is not important for the safety of the facility.    The Environment Ministry in Wiesbaden said that the Hesse  nuclear supervisory body agreed to restart Block A after an  on-site inspection in the nuclear plant and discussions with  operators and experts during the night and into Thursday  morning. After a faultless test run of the pump engine, which  took several hours, and a positive assessment by the experts,  the nuclear supervisory body was able to withdraw its order to  stop the restart until matters were clarified, which had been  given early Wednesday evening.

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM GRANT PACT APPROVED;  </P> <P> MUSEUMS: THE INSTITUTION HAS RETURNED $64,000 TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE  FOUNDATION IN A DISPUTE OVER ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History has agreed to return nearly  $64,000 to the National Science Foundation, ending a dispute over museum  accounting procedures.  </P> <P> The foundation, which last November had declared the natural history museum  ineligible for new government grants, contended the funds were improperly  spent. The grant ineligibility, which lasted until May 18, was the first time  the National Science Foundation had ever imposed the severe suspension penalty  on a museum.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the county Board of Supervisors has called off discussions  concerning the merger of the museum and the county Arboreta and Botanic Gardens  -- apparently acting to quell protests among support groups for the separate  institutions.  </P> <P> The county board action came Tuesday when a motion to terminate the merger  study by Supervisor Mike Antonovich was approved without debate. It occurred  after top museum officials -- conceding that protest had been overwhelming  among community and support groups -- asked that the proposal be withdrawn.  </P> <P> "In light of the concern . . . the (museum) board of trustees is opposed to  such a merger," said a letter from the museum to Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the  board chairman. "We believe it would not be in the best interests of either  institution and that, if merged, both could suffer in the loss of goodwill and  support from the community."  </P> <P> The termination of merger discussions represented the second setback in less  than three years for the natural history museum in attempts to take over other  facilities. In 1987, it tried to absorb the private Southwest Museum in Mount  Washington, but the proposal was abandoned in the wake of outraged protests by  community groups led by City Councilman Richard Alatorre.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Craig Black, the museum's director, said Black would not  comment on the abortive arboretum merger beyond what he and two top board  officials said in the letter to Schabarum -- dated May 31 and released by the  museum Thursday.  </P> <P> Existence of the merger proposal was disclosed in April by The Times after a  series of discussions between the museum and county Chief Administrative  Officer Richard Dixon. The merger talks apparently had their origin in  previously undisclosed discussions dating to April of 1989 in which the museum  proposed that it take over the arboretum department.  </P> <P> The arboreta agency includes the state and county arboretum in Arcadia,  Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge, the South Coast Botanic Gardens in  Palos Verdes and the Virginia Robinson Estate in Beverly Hills. The museum  complex includes the main facility in Exposition Park and the George C. Page  Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits.  </P> <P> The merged organization would also have provided new facilities for the Western  Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, an internationally known collection of bird  science materials originally incorporated by Ed N. Harrison, president of the  natural history museum's county-appointed board of governors.  </P> <P> After the merger discussions were revealed, a variety of arboretum support  groups launched a concerted protest, led by Alice Frost Thomas, president of  the California Arboretum Foundation. The arboretum groups branded the takeover  attempt a "land grab" and demanded that it be abandoned.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, arboretum supporters apparently got everything they asked for when  the supervisors approved Antonovich's motion to discontinue a feasibility study  of the merger and to launch a nationwide search for a new arboretum director.  The previous director, Francis Ching, retired earlier this year. Ching and  arboretum supporters have contended he was forced out by the supervisors  because he would not agree to the merger.  </P> <P> "We realized we were about to be swept under the rug and no one was doing  anything about it," Thomas said Thursday. She said arboretum support groups  enthusiastically supported the board action terminating the merger study. "I  just hope we can rapidly get a new director," she said. "We really are without  much direction at the moment."  </P> <P> At the National Science Foundation in Washington, meanwhile, officials released  a copy of the May 18 agreement between the foundation and the museum that  terminated what had been an acrimonious dispute between the two organizations  over the natural history museum's grant eligibility. The museum was declared  ineligible after a science foundation audit last year found numerous accounting  deficiencies at the museum and demanded return of as much as $254,000 in  government grants.  </P> <P> The settlement disclosed in the agreement released by the science foundation  earlier this week indicated that the federal agency was satisfied with  alterations in the museum's accounting procedures. The amount of money the  museum actually had to return was $63,601. The museum and the science  foundation also signed a new agreement on rates the museum is entitled to  charge on government grants to recover its indirect costs devoted to the  research.  </P> <P> "We are pleased that we have signed an agreement that meets our mutual best  interests," said Black, who is the only museum director on the National Science  Board -- the science foundation's governing body. "We look forward to  continuing our cordial relationship."  </P></p>

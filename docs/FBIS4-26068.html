			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Tibet is stepping up  economic development in line with the various characteristics  across this remote Chinese autonomous region, to rationalize its  economic set-up.    According to a plan mapped out by the regional government,  Tibet has classified itself into the central, north, east and  west parts, according to the areas' economic structure.    The 18 counties in the central part of the region have been  designated as the bread-basket of the autonomous region. A  comprehensive agricultural development program is now being  initiated in the areas, with two billion yuan from the central  government.    The project has already produced an extra 10 million kg of  grain, over one million kg of vegetables and another 1.6 million  kg of meat.    A group of manufacturing and processing enterprises has shot  up in the area, as energy and communications facilities have  been greatly improved, making it a major production center of  commodity grain, vegetables and foodstuffs, textiles and light  industry.    The northern part of Tibet has been listed as a center for  animal husbandry. About 60 million yuan has been invested in  Nagqu alone to build livestock-raising facilities and provide  local herdsmen with shelters to settle down. The move has added  an average 250 yuan per capita per year for the local herdsmen.    The development of forestry products will be emphasized in  Nyingchi and Qamdo. In the region's west and south, focus will  be on an export-oriented economy, as the area shares 3,800 km of  borders with neighboring countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Yves Haberer, dismissed Credit National </F> president and former president of Credit Lyonnais, by Gaetan de  Capele and Dominique Mariette; place and date not given: "The  Government Was Perfectly Aware of the Situation When It  Appointed Me"]    [Text] [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Yesterday the government  dismissed you from your position as president of Credit  National. What is your reaction?    [Haberer] I was very surprised at this sudden change. In  November 1993, the prime minister asked me repeatedly to take on  the presidency of Credit National, and wrote to me that: "The  government wishes to call on you to preside over this  establishment. This is an important mission for a person who is  capable of guiding Credit National in the future." This affair  brings together all the elements characteristic of an abuse of  power because the state, which does not hold one share in Credit  National, has nothing to rebuke me for in my management at the  head of this bank. It accords itself the power to punish the  head of one bank for reasons which are to found in another. This  is the first time such a thing has happened and could constitute  an interesting case of jurisprudence for the Council of State.  I ask myself: Was not my fate sealed from the time of my  appointment? All this is unseemly. Credit National is a  prestigious business, with an outstanding team, and it is  regrettable that the state should interfere in its management  because of the political climate. This demonstrates a harmful  lack of concern for this 100-percent privately owned company  which, in the competitive world in which it lives, needs  stability.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What reasons have you been given for  your dismissal?    [Haberer] When I asked for explanations, I was told that  media pressure on Credit Lyonnais was such that I should  withdraw from Credit National. I find this very worrying for  democracy and for the government's authority. Another  explanation I was given was that Credit Lyonnais' losses were  higher than the public authorities thought. This is wrong.  Before succeeding me, Jean Peyrelevade carried out an audit and  wrote to the prime minister informing him of the bank's  situation and of the provisions which would have to be set up.  On the day the government appointed me, it was perfectly aware  of this situation. Moreover the results published last week  conform exactly with those announced in that letter.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What is your reaction to Credit  Lyonnais' results and its restructuring plan?    [Haberer] It is an excellent plan. For me, Jean Peyrelevade  is a skillful negotiator who has defended the bank's interests  to the best of his ability, and I would never have been able to  obtain as much as he has from the government. With hindsight, I  also tell myself that I should have used the same method on my  arrival at Credit Lyonnais in 1988. At that time, the shortfall  in provisions for risks was higher than the bank's shareholders'  equity. If I had put Credit Lyonnais into the red, I would later  have been considered a savior. But I took a different approach,  by gradually making good this lack of provisions and by  strengthening the bank's equity through financial operations  with the public shareholder.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Even so, you have left Credit  Lyonnais  in a difficult situation.    [Haberer] When you use figures, you must place them in their  right context, in particular against the background of a purge.  One cannot say -- as some have not hesitated to -- that Credit  Lyonnais is in a state of quasi-bankruptcy when the 6.9 billion  francs [Fr] of losses represent no more than 7 to 8 percent of  the Fr85 billion of shareholders' equity. This situation is  incomparably less serious than that of banks which everyone  knows have lost all their equity. In the same way, when one  talks of the Fr20, 30, or even 40 billion of property loans  which will be transferred within the scope of the streamlining  operation, this should be seen in the context of the Fr2,000  billion of the bank's total balance sheet. If these figures had  been used in the right context, taking into account Credit  Lyonnais' size, they would not have had anywhere near the same  meaning. A few years ago two private banks, Barclays and  Citibank, posted losses which were proportionally larger than  those of Credit Lyonnais. Their top managers are still there  and the banks are in a better situation.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Risk monitoring nonetheless does not  appear to have been Credit Lyonnais' strong point.    [Haberer] It is true, but internal controls exist at Credit  Lyonnais as they do elsewhere, and I was very much concerned  with strengthening them. For example, I reformed the bank's  internal audit department, its methods, and its management. I  also created a centralized control function, as no consolidated  control body existed to centralize the risks relating to the  same customer at Credit Lyonnais' 100 or so subsidiaries. To  emphasize the importance of this function, I installed it in the  general directorate. Finally, I created a participation  committee: Every time a significant investment was made in a  business, a file was prepared, which ended up on my desk. But  control can never be perfect, as there are procedures and the  people who apply these procedures. At Credit Lyonnais, as in  all major groups, fiefdoms exist which can block these  mechanisms. I recognize that there were defects in the  monitoring of certain of our French and foreign subsidiaries,  and that it takes time to detect and correct these.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What share of the responsibility are  you prepared to accept for Credit Lyonnais' difficulties?    [Haberer] As the president, it is natural that I am in the  front line. I will not go into details on the major cases for  which I am being reproached, but a certain, not insignificant,  number were not begun while I was president. But I would point  out that the major goal of my strategy -- both the bank for  industry and the European bank -- are in no way the cause of the  bank's difficulties. This second direction, which is extremely  profitable in the long term, has moreover been maintained by my  successor. My main mistake is not to have seen the crisis  coming nor to have estimated its size. From that standpoint, I  am also in pretty good company. And then Credit Lyonnais has  not always had the managers which its strategy required.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Some people are maintaining that you  did not always cooperate as you should have with the Treasury  and the Banking Commission.    [Haberer] Not cooperating with these two bodies is  inconceivable! Every time the Treasury or the Banking  Commission asked for explanations or documents, I sent them.    Moreover, as a public bank, Credit Lyonnais submits all its  accounts, quarter by quarter, to its supervising authority, that  is the Treasury. As for the Banking Commission, it is finicky,  but it is effective and offers good advice.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you mean when you affirm that  you received recommendations from the government until March  1993?    [Haberer] Pierre Beregovoy believed that it behoved a public  bank like Credit Lyonnais to support the growth of French  companies. There was no particular request with respect to  specific cases, but a desire for backing in his campaign to  support growth and employment. I complied with his wishes,  which became more urgent when the recession began in 1991. I  believe that I can say that many corporate customers appreciated  Credit Lyonnais' dynamic approach.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS FAITHS DECRY HIGH COURT RULING;  </P> <P> CONSTITUTION: CRITICS SAY A BASIC FREEDOM IS IMPERILED BY THE OPINION IN THE  PEYOTE CASE THAT RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS ARE A 'LUXURY.'  </P> <P> Asserting that spiritual freedoms in America are at great risk, religious  organizations this week decried a U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed  constitutional protection not only for American Indians who use the drug peyote  as a sacrament but also for other religions whose practices may conflict with  state laws.  </P> <P> "This was a shocker; the nation's first liberty has become a constitutional  stepchild." said Oliver Thomas, legal counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee  on Public Affairs.  </P> <P> "It was a terrible decision for religious liberty," said Amy Adelson, staff  attorney for the American Jewish Congress. "The court's majority members  completely revamped the 'free exercise' (of religion) clause of the First  Amendment as we know it."  </P> <P> The lament over the court's ruling extended from experts on church-state  matters to believers who are most directly affected, such as 91-year-old Native  American Church leader Truman Dailey of Red Rock, Okla.  </P> <P> "This medicine has been our faith . . . we use it with a spiritual attitude in  prayer and singing," said Dailey in a telephone interview. The cactus peyote  "button" is chewed and its hallucinogenic drug ingested in rites central to the  Native American Church, which combines native traditions and Christian beliefs.  </P> <P> The justices, by a 6-3 margin, on Tuesday upheld the dismissal of two members  of the Native American Church who were fired from their jobs as drug counselors  in Oregon after they admitted ingesting peyote during a religious ceremony.  </P> <P> Beyond that, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's majority, declared  that "we cannot afford the luxury" of striking down laws just because they  limit someone's religious practices.  </P> <P> Although Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented by saying the majority opinion  changed religious liberty from "an essential element" to a "luxury," Scalia  asserted that the justices "have never held that an individual's religious  beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting the  conduct that the state is free to regulate."  </P> <P> Scalia advised religious groups to seek protection through laws that allow  exceptions to cover their beliefs and practices.  </P> <P> Indeed, 23 states have laws allowing the controlled use of peyote by the Native  American Church, according to Americans United for the Separation of Church and  State, an interdenominational group based in Silver Spring, Md. But religious  libertarians say that legislatures cannot always anticipate how laws will  affect religious groups. In addition, they say, changing public moods can swing  against the idea of religious exceptions.  </P> <P> The court system, and especially the U.S. Supreme Court, frequently has  defended small and often unpopular groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses, the  Amish and Seventh-day Adventists when laws appeared to violate their First  Amendment guarantees.  </P> <P> Scalia, in his opinion, conceded that the new ruling "will place at a relative  disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that  unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system  in which each conscience is a law."  </P> <P> The opinion spells trouble to Mike Burgess, a Comanche who once edited the  now-defunct Talking Leaf newspaper for the Los Angeles Indian community. "There  aren't enough Indians in any one state to have enough strong political clout,"  he said.  </P> <P> An inactive member of the Native American Church, Burgess said that peyote acts  as "a communicator between the participant and the Creator, but using it this  way does not make it addictive."  </P> <P> More than one critic of the court decision said the peyote case "could not have  come at a worse time" for American Indians. Observers believe the justices did  not want to open the door to small religious bodies claiming that marijuana is  important to their beliefs, such as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  </P> <P> But courts have made reasonable distinctions before between authentic religious  tradition and less-established practices, and could do so again, according to  attorney Steven C. Moore of the Native American Rights Fund. The Boulder,  Colo.-based organization filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Oregon case  on behalf of the defendants. Moore said the bitter-tasting peyote button is not  sold on the street and only has a ceremonial use.  </P> <P> Indian leaders, in both mainstream Christian and non-Christian circles, said  they were disappointed that Tuesday's ruling showed anew the lack of impact of  the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1979, a non-binding declaration of  Congress which asked that the federal government show sensitivity to the  religious practices of Indians, Eskimos and native Hawaiians.  </P> <P> "There is definitely an eroding away of American Indian rights," said Little  Crow, also known as the Rev. Carl Bryant of the American Indian Unity Church of  Garden Grove. He said Indians should nevertheless continue in their ways: "If  we give up our world view, then (the government) will do it with the Sikhs, the  Buddhists and the Baptists."  </P> <P> Similar fears were expressed by organizations concerned with religious  liberties.  </P> <P> "This case tells us a lot about how the court will react in future cases on the  free exercise of religion," said Rob Boston, a spokesman for Americans United  for Separation of Church and State. He said that the decision is a harbinger of  a narrowing interpretation of the First Amendment by the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The American Jewish Congress' Adelson, interviewed by phone from the  organization's New York headquarters, said, "Until this decision, it was  generally believed without question that while individuals may lose a claim of  religious exemption, the state would have to make an attempt to justify the  burden on the religious practice."  </P> <P> The state no longer has that burden, she said.  </P> <P> "We can only hope that those states will keep those exemptions . . . but they  don't have to," Adelson said.  </P> <P> Oliver Thomas, the counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee in Washington, said  he believes there is "a strong probability" that the Supreme Court decision  could affect mainline churches in the areas of taxation, church property,  church schools and day-care centers.  </P> <P> However, Ron Garat, professor of law and religion at USC, said that large  religious bodies probably have the ability to use the political process to  protect their interests.  </P> <P> But Garat said smaller religious groups are likely to encounter difficulties  with the direction being taken by the present Supreme Court under Chief Justice  William Rehnquist.  </P> <P> "It's a direction making it harder and harder to obtain exemptions," he said.  "If the purpose of a statute is legitimate and not designed to suppress a  religious group," Garat said it would not be unconstitutional under the new  ruling.  </P> <P> Even with the best of motives by legislatures, however, Garat said "it is  hopeless to foresee all the burdens they might impose on religious groups."  </P></p>

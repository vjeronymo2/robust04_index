			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] On 24 January, U.S. President Clinton nominated U.S.  Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry to replace current  Secretary of Defense Aspen, who abruptly tendered a letter of  resignation for reasons of poor health last 15 December.    The day after Aspen resigned, Clinton nominated Bobby Inman.  When Clinton nominated him, some U.S. Congressmen and the public  opinion stated that Inman was fully qualified for the Pentagon  post.    However, in a letter to Clinton, Inman asked Clinton to  withdraw the nomination because he did not want he and his  family to be subjected to personal attacks.    According to [word indistinct], Inman voluntarily gave up  the  nomination because he is involved in a company that resells  military equipment illegally.    When announcing Perry's nomination, Clinton said Perry  taught  at school, [words indistinct], and had a lot of experience in  the military. He also said Perry had leadership and was honest  and well versed in current affairs.    Perry, 66, was born in Pennsylvania. He studied at Stanford  University and received a bachelor's and a master's degree in  mathematics from this university. He later received a doctorate  in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania.    For the one year he worked as U.S. deputy secretary of  defense, he silently oversaw the Pentagon's daily affairs and  demonstrated his talent in management and technological affairs.    It is said that Perry very rarely appears at public meetings  and strongly insists that the U.S. capabilities to build  military materiel be maintained. He also insists on arming the  military with high-technology weapons. He became famous when he  supported the (?deployment) of Stealth bombers, cruise missiles,  and precision guided (?missiles), which played an important role  in the Gulf war.    When Clinton announced the nomination, Perry said he  accepted  the President's nomination at a time of great changes and  challenges.    The decades-long Cold War ended because of the Soviet  Union's  disintegration. This has not brought security and peace to the  world but opened a post-Cold War phase that is more complicated  and very difficult to handle.    Aspen reluctantly (?resigned) because he could not do  anything about a civil war in Somalia and the conflicts in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    When Perry was nominated, the Pentagon and military experts  assessed him favorably, saying that his nomination would easily  lead to an actual appointment. Perry must win the confirmation  by the U.S. Senate before being formally appointed as secretary  of defense.    The post of secretary of defense is an important job that  many people compete to grab in the United States. Therefore,  one must wait and see whether Perry will be able to smoothly  pass the confirmation process.</p>

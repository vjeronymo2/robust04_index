			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / How to Spend it: An Auction house might just surprise / An exciting exhibition and sale by young artists For those who think of auction rooms as the repositories of the dusty, the musty or the exorbitantly expensive, the selling exhibition coming up at Bonhams, in West London, early next month will come as a surprise. There, lurking where normally Jacobean coffers, walnut bureaux and French fauteuils are to be found, are the freshest, brightest and most contemporary of objects. There is the chance to see the work of some 130 different leading British designers and artists. How an auction house, normally associated with things old and secondhand, has come to be associated with one of the most lively selling exhibitions of interesting modern artefacts, is quite a story. It began when Bonhams realised that supplies of good quality antiques at reasonable prices were running low and that there was a wealth of talented designers producing imaginative new pieces but who lacked an outlet for their wares. Bonhams started with the auction formula - having a pre-sale view and then selling by bids - but found that it was not the best way to sell daring modern pieces. Many viewers were excited and interested but a little nervous. They needed more time to browse and contemplate and so they hit upon the idea of a selling exhibition. Peta Levi, an ardent supporter of our best young designers - she helped establish an exhibition at the Business Centre in Islington, north London - was asked to be curator and it was immediately a huge success. Levi is still collecting work together, sifting out designers, initiating new projects for them. This year the selection seems as rich, as diverse, as tempting as ever. Many of the big names in modern design will have pieces there - people such as John Makepeace, Fred Baier, Ron Arad, Richard la Trobe Bateman, Mark Brazier-Jones, Pat Booth - and all have been asked to submit at least one piece that costs under Pounds 500. This means that you could have an adjustable dressing mirror from John Makepeace for Pounds 425, a wooden jug by Fred Baier for Pounds 500, a beautifully streamlined bedside table in maple by Lime Design for Pounds 180, a tea service by Jessica Ball for Pounds 220. Pieces have been chosen not only for their diversity and liveliness but also for their quality. Everything on show dates from the 1990s and you could buy something as small as a papier mache bowl (by Hazel Dolby, Pounds 200) or as large as a solid English elm dining table (by Richard La Trobe Bateman, Pounds 5,000). If you are looking for furniture this is a chance to see some of our very best modern makers - I particularly recommend the work of Lime Design (its work is imbued with a calm, almost Zen-like air), Glenn Hinton (his Eye chair in scorched carved oak, patinated copper and hide seat is remarkable) Philip Hearsey (a marvellous organic-looking table made from forged steel and green tinted glass) and Pat Booth (a calm and tranquil designer who uses wood and steel with great style and simplicity). But if you are not in the market for something as large as a piece of furniture there are colourful jugs by Marianne H Buus and even more colourful glass and decorative mirrors by Jennie Burns. There is jewellery by Susan Cross, Tom McEwan, Sophe Harley, Tina Engells and Mark Woods. If you are looking for a chandelier you are spoiled for choice - there is a wonderful glass and copper one by Eryka Isaak (Pounds 900), a polished steel and blue glass eight-arm chandelier by Caroline Rebecca Vivian-Metalhouse (Pounds 1,350) and one made from clear and colour glass beads, brass and steel by Clare Thatcher (Pounds 1,950). It is a perfect chance to find something with character, personality or charm for the house - the lively mirror, console table, vase, chandelier or rug will do for it what the right scarf, shoes or hat does for a woman. 'Decorative Arts Today' will run from Wednesday May 4 to Wednesday May 11 at Bonhams, Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge, London SW7 1HH, from 11 am to 6 pm weekdays and 11 am to 4 pm on the weekend. There is a fine illustrated catalogue which costs Pounds 5 and allows you free entrance. Otherwise there is an admission charge of Pounds 3.</p>

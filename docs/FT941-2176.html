			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kemper and GE Capital closer to proxy bid battle Kemper, the embattled US financial services group, said yesterday it was preparing to hand a list of its shareholders to GE Capital, in a move which would allow the General Electric subsidiary to step up its Dollars 2.2bn campaign for control. The request from GE Capital could signal the start of the first big proxy solicitation battle in the US for more than two years. It is the first since the introduction of regulations making it easier for shareholders to launch attacks on incumbent managements. GE Capital said on Sunday it had written to Kemper asking for a list of shareholders. The request followed a unanimous decision by Kemper's board last week to reject a bid. In a proxy battle, one shareholder seeks support either to force a board of directors to pursue a policy it has rejected - such as putting a company up for sale - or to engineer a change in the composition of the board. Such battles, a familiar part of the 1980s corporate landscape, have become rare in recent years. In the most recent case, USX, the steel, energy and chemicals group, fought off an attempt from the corporate raider Mr Carl Icahn to break up the group. Kemper said yesterday it was consulting its lawyers about whether it should hand GE Capital a shareholder list. It added, though, that it expected to hand over the list, 'once we establish that they are a shareholder of record'. Regulations introduced last year allow shareholders to communicate directly with others, in theory making it easier to build an alliance against an incumbent board of directors. GE Capital is believed to have hired D. F. King, which along with Georgeson is one of the two biggest US proxy solicitation firms, to help with its campaign. King was active for QVC in its recent unsuccessful fight for control of Paramount Communications, while Georgeson worked for Viacom, the eventual victor. In the letter to Kemper, Mr Gary Wendt, chairman and chief executive of GE Capital, said: 'You leave us no choice but to proceed unilaterally and communicate directly with our fellow shareholders, who surely will feel the time-sensitive urgency to consummate this transaction as promptly as possible or risk seeing their values decline.'</p>

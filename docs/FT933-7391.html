			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Suddenly, the yen heads for the heights - London THE RISE in the equity market this week has had stock market commentators rushing to change their forecasts for the year-end. While many were predicting that the Footsie would reach 3,100 by then, they are now looking at 3,200 by next weekend. The rise in the index this week, of 47.5 points to a close of 3057.6, was concentrated entirely in a 48.6 point jump on Wednesday, the largest one-day increase since January 26. It is easy to see the gain as driven by the good news that the market has been using to justify rising thus far: falling interest rates; the prospect of another base rate cut this autumn; and low inflation which should continue for some time, combining to drive down gilt yields and push equities higher. That is backed by the economic recovery which is becoming more evident with each week's crop of economic statistics - such as higher retail sales; a lower public sector borrowing requirement than expected in July; strong growth in borrowing; and a rise in corporate profit margins as wage growth lags profit growth. But market strategists have begun to latch on to a significant new element. While people have been pre-occupied by the break-up of the exchange rate mechanism and what that means for the UK, the yen has been rising. It almost broke through the Y100-Dollars 1 level this week, but turned back abruptly after heavy intervention from the US authorities. The Japanese, anxious to reflate their economy, want the yen to come down from this peak. Thus, there is now strong pressure inside and outside the country to reverse the currency's rise. Nick Knight, equity strategist at the Japanese-owned Nomura Research Institute - who should know - says that, within Japan, the large institutional investors will be encouraged to sell the yen and shift their money overseas. Which important currency has been one of the worst performers against the yen and might, therefore, be the first to which Japanese investors turn their attention? Sterling. The beginning of the yen's latest surge coincided with sterling's devaluation last September, and the yen has risen from Y245-Pounds 1 to Y150. Which large and liquid stock market is on the rise anticipating, yet not fully discounting, economic recovery? The UK. Put the two together and Knight's theory of a Japanese 'wall of money' buying the UK stock market is not so fanciful. He has long predicted the Footsie would rise to 3,500 by the end of this year, and is looking for a smaller increase - to 3,700 - by the end of 1994. If you miss this move in the market, you might as well forget UK equities for the next five years, he says. Buying from overseas investors was much in evidence this week in heavy turnover, and retail investors have been buying, too. Fears earlier this year that hefty gilt sales, rights issues and flotations would put too much of a strain on cash flows, and keep the market down, have proved groundless. Even the generally more cautious Michael Hughes, at BZW, is pointing to the yen story. He notes that someone could borrow in yen, switch the money into sterling and buy UK equities yielding enough to cover the yen interest cost, giving a free play on the currency and the UK market. Like nature abhorring a vacuum, markets abhor this kind of discrepancy. And stock markets (to quote Knight again) do move in straight lines every so often. Once it becomes obvious to all that a market should be higher, it will move there fast. In January 1989, for instance, the Footsie rose 250 points with barely a down day. It went on to gain nearly 300 more points by the year-end. Since July 21 this year, when the Footsie hit its recent low of 2814.1, the index has risen 243.5 points, again with hardly a pause. Any market that rises that far that fast might need a couple of days' consolidation, though, as it did on Thursday and Friday this week. Hughes can find another reason why the equity market is undervalued. He draws a parallel with the 1930s, a period when companies reduced the proportion of earnings paid out in dividends, preferring to retain profits internally as the economy recovered. This is happening again now, so the market can rise without dividends increasing as fast as earnings - meaning yields on equities can go lower. A 3.5 per cent yield implies the Footsie at around 3,250. The market is not expensive at present levels, he says. So, what of the concern from some companies this week about the fragility of the economic recovery in the UK and Europe? Argos, the catalogue retailer, which reported a 39 per cent profit rise to Pounds 13.2m pre-tax for its first half on Monday, warned that a tough budget could kill the 'fragile recovery.' First, the recovery might be more fragile in retailing than elsewhere, given the competitive state of that sector. Then, the hints about November's Budget indicate it will not be such a tax-raising exercise as first thought. The better news on the PSBR helps. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research predicted taxes would rise by Pounds 2.5bn in the Budget - but with interest rate cuts, too, that would be neutral for demand. The other fear is that the continued recession in continental Europe will hold back UK profits. BICC, the cables company, made this point on Tuesday when recording a 12 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m. The figures were depressed by a reduction in profits from its European business. Similarly, a fall in exports to Europe was blamed for the first drop in UK car production for 18 months. But that is yesterday's story. The collapse of the ERM - which has so far happened in theory, but should happen in practice after the summer holidays  -will sort that out.</p>

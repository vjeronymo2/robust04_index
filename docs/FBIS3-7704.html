			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akira Washio, political commentator: "Hosokawa's </F> Agony"]    [Text] Every now and then a person seems to have  premonitions.    The reason that Morihiro Hosokawa met two figures from whom  he had become somewhat distant after he won government power was  probably not because he foresaw a situation verging on the brink  of failure, but because of a feeling of uneasiness.    It was late in the year [1993] when Hosokawa humbly invited  Noboru Takeshita, who resigned from the LDP [Liberal Democratic  Party] after being questioned about his relationship with  Kominto [right-wing group] and appeared to be shut out from  Nagata-cho [prime minister's official residence]. In an attempt  to escape from the one-man axis of Ichiro Ozawa (secretary  general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), is it eventually  this man that enters everyone's mind?    [Hosokawa] The reason that I have met with you today is  because the Ministry of Finance [MOF] is strongly against  separating tax reduction from the consumer tax. At this rate the  budget cannot be planned. Your assistance will be appreciated.    [Takeshita]It is quite difficult. The MOF wants a clause  inserted stipulating that the deficit will be made up by the  consumer tax regardless of how many years later it is. However,  I will try to talk to them.    [Hosokawa]I would also like to ask your advice regarding  economic stimulus measures.    [Takeshita]Naito has submitted his resignation, so nothing  can be done about it; but I cannot approve of others doing the  same thing.    Hosokawa persevered with the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party  of  Japan], which tended to dissociate itself from the  administration concerning political reform and the rice market  under the cause of "preserving the coalition." However, with the  final stretch of political reform and the planning of the next  fiscal budget overlapped, he is faced with the gravest crisis  since the advent of his administration.    The reason is that, even if bold steps are taken to reduce  tax for business recovery, when he makes his intention clear to  raise the consumer tax as a source of tax reduction, they might  really drop out of the coalition. There is a saying that "there  are limits to one's endurance" (the SDPJ left-wing faction).    The separation between tax reduction and the consumer tax is  based on advice by Kiichi Miyazawa at a meeting in Karuizawa  last summer. However, aside from Miyazawa who is a financial  expert, the MOF, which advocates sound finance, would not agree  with Hosokawa regardless of his efforts. It would not give an  inch even if Hosokawa, Chairman Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito  (deputy prime minister and foreign minister), and Chairman  Koshiro Ishida of Komeito (director of the Managenement and  Coordination Agency) all acted in unison.    If so, whatever Ichiro Ozawa may think, there is no  alternative except to depend on Takeshita who has practical  clout with the MOF.    Takeshita criticized the firing of Masahisa Naito, director  of the Industrial Policy Bureau of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI], for favoritism concerning personnel  changes, and he casually warned: "It will not do to continue  such firings."    Although the truth cannot be verified, it is rumored that  Kyosuke Shinozawa, director of the Budget Bureau of the MOF, and  Hisakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, could become  the second and third "Naitos."    Ozawa may be displeased if it were said that everything is  based on Ozawa's suggestions, but the LDP's view is that it is  not unrelated to Ichiro Ozawa's concept of "controlling the  bureaucracy" to suppress the bureaucracy by broadly introducing  a "political appointment system" for the positions of vice  ministers and parliamentary councillors.    The former Soviet Communist Party used to deploy its party  cadres to battleships in order to control the powerful "Red  Army." There is a view that Ozawa may be imitating this strategy.    It is said that, unlike Jiro Saito, administrative vice  minister who is friendly with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinozawa is close  to Ryutaro Hashimoto, Ozawa's rival. However, Saito and  Shinozawa have worked as a team for many years in the budget  field, and there is reason to doubt that they will be targeted.    As for Kuriyama, he once angered Ozawa by admonishing him to  "think like an adult" when the latter strongly advocated  rearguard support for the multinational forces against Iraq as  part of Japan's international contribution when Ozawa was LDP  secretary general.    It is a matter of opinion as to whether this fuss is seen as  incidental or as a link in the subjugation of the bureaucracy.  It appears at least that public opinion has sided with MITI  minister Hiroshi Kumagai who fired Naito.    "In the United States, a mass change of the bureaucracy  takes place with a new president."Although unrelated to MITI  personnel moves, upper house member Sadao Hirano, Ichiro Ozawa's  confidant, stresses the need to probe into the bureaucracy which  has become rigid following political reform.    However, Takeshita cites the bygone struggle between the  "Seiyukai" [Constitutional Party of Political Friends] and  "Minseito" [Constitutional Democratic Party] parties which even  replaced policemen with changes in the administration, thus  throwing national politics into chaos, and he asks that the  morale of the bureaucracy not be damaged.  <H5>  Told To "Cut Takemura" </H5>   Following this meeting, Hosokawa visited an elderly and  long-time friend.    [Hosokawa] It has been some time since I last saw you."    [Friend] You seem to be working very hard.    [Hosokawa] At the end of last year [1993], Ichiro Ozawa whom  you know came alone to see me and strongly demanded: "Are you  going to choose me or choose Takemura?" His point was: "Cut  Takemure, or I will not cooperate." I believe that is why Ozawa  announced his decision to take a leave of absence."    The elderly friend facing Hosokawa was Yoshitaka Yotsumoto,  president of Sanko Construction Industry.    He once held a Zen session with Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was  the prime minister like Hosokawa, and taught him how to control  his mind as a person engaged in politics.    After becoming involved in the Ketsumeidan [Blood  Brotherhood  Society] incident, he became friends with Kantaro Suzuki, the  prime minister toward the end of the war. He was also secretary  to Fumimaro Konoye, Hosokawa's grandfather, and talked with  Konoye at his villa in Mt. Hakone immediately prior to the  latter's suicide.    After the war, aside from Kakuei Tanaka, he was spiritual  adviser to numerous prime ministers including Shigeru Yoshida.  Noboru Takeshita followed Nakasone in seeking his advice on  various occasions.    It was Hosokawa's first assignment as a reporter for the  ASAHI SHIMBUN in Kagoshima Prefecture when he met Yotsumoto and  became devoted to him, praising him as "the most respectable  person I know."  <H5>  Encouragement From Yoshitaka Yotsumoto </H5>   "That is nothing."    Yotsumoto talked about the past:    "During the Kishi cabinet, Bamboku Ono who  greatly disliked Eisaku Sato, Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother,  demanded that Kishi `cut Eisaku Sato.'    "In those days, Kishi was weak-kneed and  promised anything to save his administration. I joined with  Ryugo Hashimoto, Ryutaro Hashimoto's father and a great man, to  scold and encourage Kishi to `absolutely not cut Sato.'    "An interesting episode is written in  Bamboku Ono's Memoirs.    Ono removed Hirokichi Nadao as the minister  of posts and telecommunications in the fifth Yoshida cabinet and  appointed Juichiro Tsukada, his follower, to the post.    "However, there are a lot of shrewd people in  this world. A man phoned Tsukada to tell him triumphantly: `I  recommended you for minister and it was successful.' I hate to  mention the name of the caller, but his name is was Eisaku Sato.    "Speaking of Sato, I recall cooperating with  Ichiro Kono to give another chance as justice minister to Ken  Inukai, who had spoiled his chance as the justice minister due  to his use of authority in connection with the shipbuilding  scandals. However, the prime minister absolutely refused. I  learned later that it was strongly opposed by Sato whose own  political life was spared due also to the exercise of authority."    It is an episode that illustrates the bad relations between  Ono and Sato.    After relating the above, Yotsumoto encouraged Hosokawa,  saying: "That is that. There is nothing for to you to fear. You  must do what you think is right."    Yotsumoto has always contended that a leader must make  decisions without consulting anyone. "If you act according to  what someone tells you, the person who tells you will become the  leader."    He is telling Hosokawa, who is at an impasse concerning  political reform and shows signs of desperation: "If you move  ahead prepared for cabinet dissolution and a general election,  it is the LDP that will suffer. In other words, a breakthrough  can be made by grappling with the problem through conviction.  <H5>  One Cannot Cross a Bridge Without Taking Risks </H5>   Yotsumoto acts swiftly. After the meeting with Hosokawa, he  immediately called Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura,  with whom he is on intimate terms.    Yotsumoto, who thinks that Takemura will someday become  prime  minister, quoted his friend Eizaburo Nishibori, commander of the  first Antarctic winter expedition, who said: "A bridge cannot be  crossed by avoiding risks," counseled Takemura as follows:  "Hosokawa has crossed a bridge by not being cautious. Your job  is to be extremely cautious and supportive. In doing so,  relations between the two of you will never go sour.    The coalition is sustained by the heads of the seven parties  and factions joining hands, and the administration could be  dismantled by a single defector.    Despite such a fragile administration, it seems rash to  demand that a choice be made between the options of choosing or  not choosing Ichiro Ozawa. However, from the standpoint of a  strategy of unifying the coalition into a single party and  demoting the LDP from a "mammoth party" to an "ordinary party,"  the fight with Masayoshi Takemura who, given the opportunity,  wishes to revive an administration centered on the LDP by  joining with the LDP reform faction, transcends a mere struggle  over leadership and is a struggle over direction itself. That  is why "Masayoshi Takemura is said to have replaced Nakasone as  Ichiro Ozawa's real enemy."    The lack of a clear perspective concerning the political  reform bill overlapped with this confrontation that pressures  have swiftly built for dissolution. Hosokawa himself is  reportedly prepared to use his trump card as a last resort and  to be the toughest hardliner.  <H5>  Shinseito's Declaration for Dissolution </H5>   Within the Shinseito, Moriyoshi Sato called the younger  members together and declared: "Dissolution will surely come.  Mr. Kanemaru also says so."    Borrowing Kanemaru's words is typical of Sato who was  Kanemaru's close associate. Shin Kanemaru, former LDP deputy  prime minister who was indicted on suspicion of violating the  income tax law (tax evasion), moved from Azabu, Tokyo, to his  home district of Shirane-cho in Yamanashi Prefecture; however,  Sato visits Kanemaru from time to time to comfort him.    Sato emphasizes that, if political reform is crushed, public  criticism will focus on the LDP and it will inevitably suffer  defeat.    Like being alarmed by the flapping wings of waterfowl, its  members will waver and scramble to abandon the LDP. The party  may split even further.    The "sleeping lion" called the "considered rejection" in  Article 59, paragraph 4 of the Constitution suddenly arose and  loomed menacingly.    The gist is as follows: If the upper house receives a bill  but does not offer a decision within 60 days, the lower house  "will consider it to be rejected by the upper house," and if the  lower house reapproves it by a special two-thirds majority, it  can enact the bill. The aim of the legislation is to prevent  sabotage by the upper house.    If the stipulation is invoked, the upper house would be  powerless. The aim is not to invoke the stipulation, but to  offer the LDP an opportunity to realize political reform and to  try to force it to take a "loyalty test."    It probably implies that "If you agree with political  reform,  prove it by your action." Therefore, if it opposes it, it must  clarify its stand before the people and move toward dissolution.  This will be painful. The reason the upper house can openly call  for political reform is simply that the upper house does not  have to worry about dissolution.    However, former Defense Agency Director General Keisuke  Nakanishi who attended the meeting rebutted: "Despite what is  said, can you really win?"    It may sound plausible to say that a solution will be  reached  through dissolution and a general election, but it is not  certain whether victory or defeat will result from a general  election. From Nakanishi's viewpoint, holding a general election  based on the current medium-size constituency system would  merely play into the hands of the LDP.    Providing the backdrop for the threat to push dissolution  and  a general election is the high rate of support for the Hosokawa  cabinet. A shadow has begun to appear in the support for the  cabinet.    A blade with a sharp cutting edge could end up cutting the  holder if things go wrong.    One source of apprehension is that the empirical rule  concerning elections called the "pendulum principle" may come  into play.    If a sense of disappointment grows that, although it caused  the LDP an overwhelming defeat, the Hosokawa cabinet itself has  done nothing to boast of, the votes could revert to the LDP.  <H5>  Runner-Up's Resilience </H5>   Another point is the "resilience of the runnerup." The LDP  had as many as 36 runners-up in the general election in July  1993. Beware of these "second-place candidates."    In the 1990 general election, 45 of the 73 candidates who  were in second place in the previous general election garnered  wins (61.6 percent). In the LDP, 23 of the 31 previous  runners-up (74.2 percent) were elected.    A simple comparison cannot be made because of replacements  among LDP members. However, according to this theory, at least  20 or more comebacks will be possible if a general election is  held on a medium-constituency basis.    The LDP currently holds 222 seats, which is 34 short of a  majority (256 seats). Therefore, it cannot achieve a majority  unless all of the previous runners-up win.    Consequently, while it will not be easy for the LDP to  regain  ruling power, the presence of Sakigake must not be forgotten.  Rather than Sakigake itself, it is the presence of its leader,  Masayoshi Takemura, who is competing against Ichiro Ozawa.    Assuming that the LDP succeeds in gaining a total that is 10  seats short of a majority, the choice by Sakigake (12 seats) can  be decisive.    Although it is said that Sakigake will not be so foolish as  to assist the LDP's restoration to power, if the Sakigake should  entice the LDP by making a drastic request concerning political  reform and economic reform, a coalition between the LDP and  Sakigake cannot be ruled out. At this point, the LDP will  probably accept anything. It will be much more expedient than  tottering toward reform.    Nonetheless, it is unlikely that Ichiro Ozawa would stand by  idly. In fact, he is said to have already made advances to  Sakigake and to have tried to persuade a number of members,  except Takemura, to come to Shinseito. That is probably why he  requested "Takemura's transfer."    On Yotsumoto's advice, Takemura visited Ozawa early on the  morning of New Year's Day, bowed his head, and sought to heal  their differences. He was probably determined to endure in order  to reverse his fortunes in the future.  <H5>  Kono With No Trump Cards </H5>   On 6 January 1994, LDP President Yohei Kono et al gathered  at  the LDP headquarters for a New Year's party.    Kono spotted Takushi Hirai, chairman of the joint houses  general council and head of the upper house, and told him: "The  rest is up to the upper house. I hope you will do your best."    Kono probably intended it to be a New Year's greeting.  However, Hirai did not interpret it that way.    "President, you asked me to do my best, but how and  concerning what am I to do my best? Please give me some  direction. Are you saying that I should crush political reform  at this stage, or what do you ask me to amend? I cannot do  anything unless I have some direction."    At this rebuttal, Kono remained silent.    However, the situation changed abruptly.    The SDPJ, the Achilles' heel of the coalition, has finally  exposed its weakness. The recent split in the SDPJ appears to be  virtually irreparable. The future of political reform has  suddenly become murky.    Across-the-board resignations or dissolution of the lower  house?    Regardless of the twists and turns, the ultimate result will  inevitably be one or the other. Political reform can only be  postponed for the time being. However, everyone knows that the  public is not so naive as to let it pass unheeded. Already  "political reform" in another sense with "political  restructuring" in mind is on the rise.</p>

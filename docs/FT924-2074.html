			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Technology: Ups and downs of downsizing - Emotions are running high as the computer industry debates whether to phase out expensive mainframes in favour of less cumbersome units Anyone in the computer business seeking a quiet life would be well advised to avoid the complex topic of downsizing - the practice of replacing expensive mainframe computer systems with networks of smaller, cheaper computers. It can provoke strong emotions. One of its strongest advocates is William Connor, director of information technology for the general systems sector of Motorola, the US electronics company. Connor and other proponents of downsizing usually point to two main goals. The first is to achieve a new responsiveness to business needs. Much business software is delivered too late to take advantage of market opportunities. The second is to cut costs. A study by Hoskyns, the UK-based computing services company, indicates that most organisations downsize for cost reasons, although claim to be seeking enhanced performance. Cost containment is, according to a Price Waterhouse survey, still top of a data processing manager's priority list. Motorola moved its applications from IBM mainframes to its own make of distributed, multiuser Unix-based microcomputers. According to Connor, the purchase of packaged application software suited to Unix and the use of computer-based development tools cuts software development times by two thirds. All his computing and telecommunications costs amount to 1.4 per cent of revenues, compared with more than 3 per cent for similar companies: 'We are running at less than half the average of these companies. That translates to a saving of more than Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. That is Dollars 40m of cost avoidance which can finance further reduction of selling prices, increased research and development and profitability to the corporation.' Motorola wants to eliminate all mainframe processing. With improved system administration and network management, Connor believes the cost of management information systems can be reduced to less than 1 per cent of sales by the end of 1993. Motorola seems to demonstrate convincing proof of the efficacy of downsizing. The logic in its favour is impressive. Mainframe computers are undoubtedly expensive. By one, albeit imperfect, measure of performance - millions of instructions per second (mips) - they are vastly more expensive than workstations or personal computers. A larger mainframe costs about Pounds 50,000 for a large mainframe compared with less than Pounds 500 per mips for a personal computer. Mainframes also have to be housed in a data centre and fed electricity and chilled water, not to mention expensive operating and applications software. On this page last month, however, Peter Slavid, corporate systems manager for ICL, expressed a somewhat iconoclastic view when he said that by 2000 there would be a strong trend towards upsizing - using a central mainframe to process data held on a central database. 'Any downsized organisation looking for cost-effective solutions will undoubtedly have to extract data from expensive personal computer and Unix systems and dump it onto a parallel database server where it can be managed efficiently and cheaply. I would challenge anyone to dispute this point,' he wrote. Slavid, whose job it is to sell mainframes, obviously has a commercial axe to grind. The fact remains, however, that the jury appears still to be out on the cost savings from downsizing. The Hoskyns study - involving more than 270 interviews with executives with responsibility for information technology - concluded: 'Despite the general perception that downsizing is the path to cost effective IT, more than one-third of respondents were unable to quantify the cost savings associated with migration and conversions. For those that could quantify costs, some saved millions of pounds while others had actually incurred additional costs.' Xephon, the UK-based IT consultancy takes an extreme position: 'Far from being obsolete, mainframes currently offer the most cost effective computing facilities for all but the smallest organisations - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.' Xephon supports its claim with a series of calculations on the cost of hardware, including terminals, printers and other peripherals; the cost of applications software; and the cost of operating the system. To illustrate this, it uses as examples a pair of IBM mainframe configurations supporting several thousand users, comparing the cost of these systems with a group of proprietary and Unix-based midrange systems from IBM, DEC and Hewlett Packard and a selection of personal computers, including the cost of printers and networking hardware and software. Xephon calculated basic hardware and software costs over five years for these systems (excluding finance costs and ignoring inflation) and decided the cost per end user was Pounds 1,545 to Pounds 2,236 for mainframes, Pounds 1,806 to Pounds 2,286 for proprietary midrange machines, Pounds 1,680 to Pounds 2,240 for Unix systems and Pounds 2,900 to Pounds 9,000 for PCs running on a local area network. But mainframes and midrange systems take up floor space and may have special environmental requirements. That takes the cost of mainframes per user up to Pounds 2,479 to Pounds 3,170, with smaller increases for the midrange machines. PC network costs were not affected. Finally, Xephon added the cost of applications software, the cost of specialist support to help out when users are unable to help themselves, and the cost of employees' time wasted because small systems respond more slowly than mainframes. The result was striking. Mainframes cost between Pounds 5,282 and Pounds 5,973 per user, proprietary midrange systems Pounds 7,306 and Pounds 7786, Unix systems Pounds 7,180 to Pounds 7,740 and networked personal computers, Pounds 9,400 to Pounds 15,500. It is possible to take issue with the assumptions Xephon has made in arriving at these figures. What is not in question is that downsizing involves costs that are neither obvious or negligible and are frequently ignored in making the case for downsizing. Input, the US-based consultancy, says the proper justification for downsizing must be directly related to the contribution that a new information architecture can make to business objectives. In other words, beware of fashion, a curse of the data processing business. Slavid may yet be proved right.</p>

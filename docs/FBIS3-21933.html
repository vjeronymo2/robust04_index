			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Luis Alberto Chavez and photographer </F> Cesar Aquije]    [Excerpt] General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros has replaced  General Eduardo Bellido Mora, currently assigned to Israel, as  commander of the Huallaga Front. He handles the last refuge of  subversion and the natural habitat of drug traffickers: the San  Martin and Huanuco Departments. This is an explosive zone but  he is not worried because in some ways he knows the situation:  "El Cholo," as he is known, was the political-military chief of  Cerro de Pasco before being assigned to Upper Huallaga.    Although he did not elaborate, when asked about accusations  that the Army is linked with trafficking, the general said he  was inflexible over detecting and sanctioning any cases of  immorality in his institution.    If there were any doubts about his intentions, a few days  after taking over the Huallaga Front command he sanctioned an  officer. It was a warning for everyone.    It is incredible but Rodriguez Riveros is ready to show --  papers in hand -- that not a single light plane has entered the  Upper Huallaga zone so far this year. Daily DEA reports confirm  it.    He said that although the Army was responsible for  coordinating the struggle against trafficking, he was not in  charge of direct interventions. The police have that  responsibility.    Today that situation has changed. In October 1993, a decree  was issued stating that in emergency zones the Army fights  subversion and drug trafficking.    All antinarcotics operations by any of the forces in Upper  Huallaga (National Police, Air Force, or DEA) must be previously  cleared with the Huallaga Front commander. No operation is  authorized without Army coordination.    "The control of drug trafficking is today an objective,"  said  Gen. Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros during this interview that was  arranged in principle as "a conversation," but which thanks to  his kindness was authorized for publication.    Chavez: Army members have been accused of  maintaining contacts with drug traffickers. What is your  opinion on these charges?    Rodriguez: The commander reacted positively. Last  year we had three inspections. This year we will have four.  Perhaps out of fear, mistakes used to occur internally, within  the units. Each commander had his policy and made his own  decisions on penalties against his troops and on how to correct  wrongdoings. This policy changed in 1992 and 1993. Officers  are no longer reported to their commanders within the larger  units, they are reported to the Army Inspector's Office and then  to the Military Justice Supreme Council.    Chavez: How many cases are being investigated in  the Huallaga Front?    Rodriguez: We have already investigated 15 cases.  These cases are duly documented and ready for sentencing. The  sentence will vary according to the degree of participation:  They may be removed from the Army, placed at the disposal of the  commander, retired, or referred to civilian courts.    Chavez: Have you reported any cases since you were  appointed as the Huallaga Front political and military chief?    Rodriguez: Yes. I reported a case 24 hours after I  discovered it. The problem was an old one, but we detected it.  Our commander is aware of the case and documents are being  prepared for his trial.    Chavez: Who is he?    Rodriguez: An officer. We caught him in the  simplest of ways. He was attending a meeting outside the base  and we looked for him because he left the base. During the  investigation we learned that the officer "met" with a group (of  drug traffickers). The rest followed this lead. I am unable to  give you his name because he is still on trial.    Let us just say this was a message for all officers assigned  to the Upper Huallaga front.    I think we have all come here with the same spirit: To work  for our fatherland and to work for our institution.    Chavez: In other words, a war with a loud warning  does not kill people.    Rodriguez: That is right.    Chavez: How do you detect an officer involved in  trafficking? Only through the inspectors?    Rodriguez: There are various ways. One is through  his lifestyle. With our salaries we cannot have certain  luxuries. These people are also known for the way they talk. We  are not isolated from society. We participate in all social  activities and social meetings. Another way to detect them is  by the way they brag about the money they have. This prompts us  to investigate.    Chavez: General, is this a certain "esprit de  corps," seeking to cover up the mistakes made by some officer?    Rodriguez: This command has never allowed that to  happen for ethical reasons. We will not cover up for anyone.  Our commanders understand that trafficking is a scourge we must  eliminate. That was the reason behind the law authorizing us to  directly intervene in the fight to eliminate trafficking.    Chavez: What can you do to prevent further  corruption?    Rodriguez: It is very difficult to be inside every  officer's head. We are implementing measures, for example, by  rotating duties. We think it is harmful for an officer to stay  too long at one particular base. The social interaction with  people in the zone could make him feel secure and might tempt  him to get involved in illegal activities.    Chavez: What can you tell us about the illegal  drug trade? Is it moving somewhere else?    Rodriguez: We have information that trafficking  activities are gradually moving toward Loreto and Madre de Dios,  that is, outside San Martin and Huanuco. We no longer see  opulence in shopping malls. We see abandoned towns. Tocache  and Uchiza used to be trafficking centers, today these towns  lack the economic resources to continue to develop.    Chavez: So trafficking is moving to Loreto and  Madre de Dios?    Rodriguez: Yes, at least according to the  information we have. We work day and night to detect light  planes.    Chavez: With what results?    Rodriguez: Results have been negative lately.  They no longer come to this area. If they do, it is not like  in the past, that is, three to four times a day. They come once  a month and run the risk of being caught.    Chavez: How can you be sure if the Army does not  have the adequate technological means to detect light planes  flying at night, which is when traffickers move?    Rodriguez: We work with the DEA. They can detect  planes with their radar in Yurimaguas. They transmit the  information to the Huallaga Front and we re-transmit it to the  base closest to where the plane might land.    Chavez: Does that mean the DEA tells you the exact  moment a small plane enters Upper Huallaga?    Rodriguez: Yes, it takes us an average of two  minutes to learn about it.    Chavez: Do you depend on information supplied by  the DEA?    Rodriguez: That's right.    Chavez: How often do you receive DEA reports?    Rodriguez: Daily.    Chavez: How many small planes enter the region  daily?    Rodriguez: Currently, none enters this region.  This is why we are seeking other possible routes (ground and  river routes) for drug trafficking.    Chavez: The people, however, say that they see  small planes entering the region.    Rodriguez: Well, they may say planes arrive here  all the time. It may have occurred previously.    Chavez: According to your reports, when did the  last plane enter the region?    Rodriguez: We do not have this data.    Chavez: Are you telling me that so far this year  no plane has entered the Upper Huallaga region?    Rodriguez: That's right.    Chavez: Are you sure?    Rodriguez: I repeat, according to our reports, no  plane has entered the region. They are probably seeking other  routes. Probably along rivers or roads. In the 90 days we have  been here, no flights or large shipments have been reported.    Chavez: Do you think the Intelligence Service is  mistaken, general?    Rodriguez: I don't think so.    Chavez: What do you believe is the main 1994  problem: The Shining Path or trafficking?    Rodriguez: They go together. In the field of  subversion two areas interest us: Sisa and Tingo Maria.  Although we have temporarily neutralized Sisa, we want to  clearly identify the group to be able to dismantle it. This,  however, does not apply to Tingo Maria in Leoncio Prado  Province, where there are permanent clashes. Both sides have  casualties. It will take some time to resolve. The problem  will not disappear in the near future, but we are sure we will  finally eliminate them.    Chavez: President Fujimori said in Colombia that  the millions of dollars invested by the United States in the  antinarcotics effort have yielded no results. What do you think  of that?    Rodriguez: Considering the actions so far, I could  not comment on the issue. I have been here for too short a  time. Talking with the people who live here, however, I have  learned that they believe funds should not be allocated to the  antinarcotics effort but to the coca replacement program. Rice,  yerbaluisa, corn and grapes are the most promising products in  the region. Grapes, for example, are harvested three times in a  year here while near the coast they are harvested only once.  This occurs at the Cumbaza Valley, where grapes are harvested  three times a year. That is why coca is not planted there.    Chavez: Do you believe that in addition to being  an economic, police, and moral problem, coca growing is also a  social problem?    Rodriguez: Yes, but this problem can be solved by  helping the most needy people and by bringing together all  institutions in an effort to find solutions to their problems.  Those who told us they were ignorant and that as a result grew  coca, can now improve by growing more profitable products.    Chavez: Do you believe peasants grow coca because  they are ignorant?    Rodriguez: Not because they are ignorant. I  believe that at a certain moment they were pressed to do it and  that for a while it was the most profitable crop.    Chavez: What about poppies?    Rodriguez: We have been patrolling the forest for  30 days looking for the sites where poppies were allegedly being  grown. We have found nothing but we will continue to look.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Records: A homage to Miles the muse - Jazz So Near So Far Joe Henderson, Verve 517674 What We Do Jon Scofield Quartet, Blue Note 0777 7 99586 2 7 Percussion Bitter Sweet Max Roach, GRP 11222 Dear Old Stockholm John Coltrane GRP 11202 CURIOUSLY, tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson does not consider the album which won him the Down Beat triple crown of best jazz artist, tenorist and album of the year, as well as a Grammy recently, to be better than anything he has done since his first of many Blue Note dates 30 years ago. So the fact that So Near, So Far, the follow-up to his Verve debut, took the number one slot on the Billboard charts within days of its release in the US must be a source of some dismay to him. Where the writing of Billy Strayhorn provided the inspiration for Henderson's succulent improvisation on Lush Life, here Miles Davis is the muse and more astringent tunes that span the late, lonely trumpet player's career, the raw material. Davis had the commitment and the 'tradition' which enabled him to reach a wider than usual jazz audience, according to Henderson. That febrile singlemindedness is lacking in a number of Henderson's younger peers, he feels, and even where the young pretenders stick to originals it seems to Henderson that they aim to get in the way of a good tune: 'There are so many beautiful melodies out there to be interpreted which so often are brutalised,' he says. It must be easy for Henderson to be disappointed by the inadequacies of his younger peers - he is one of the most inventive yet restrained tenorists around and the new disc shows him to be at the peak of his ever-mature powers. It helps that the line-up is a mutual appreciation society. Drummer Al Foster was Miles' spiritual intermediary during the great man's hiatus; Briton Dave Holland, a Miles accompanist in the late 1960s, provides densely woven bass lines; and John Scofield, whose alternately angular and blue electric guitar shares the solo work, adds glowing depth in accompaniment. The material, taken from 1947 to 1968, is not the most obvious of Miles memorabilia but rather an essence which the quartet distills into coolly phrased essential extracts. The choice of Scofield (borrowed from Blue Note) for this date was inspired, his metallic coloured chords giving cutting contrast to Henderson's deep lacquer. His own new album, What We Do, is typically a more arty and muted affair. Though the guitarist's regular rhythm section of Dennis Irwin (bass) and Bill Stewart (drums) are a hive of industry, Scofield steadies them with his knotty, understated solos. Tenorist Joe Lovano, light on his feet, buzzes in and out of leader's tunes, widening the narrow openings left for him. On the reissues front, GRP has just launched its 'Legendary Masters Of Jazz Series' with a cracking 1961 date from Max Roach and another of the same period from John Coltrane. Roach is perhaps less of a legend than Coltrane in that he is still with us and the truth about his dangerous and exciting leadership is not questioned. On Percussion Bitter Sweet he pushes soloists Booker Little (trumpet), Julian Priester (trombone) and Clifford Jordan (tenor sax) to the cliff's edge. From Eric Dolphy's gulping harmonics on bass clarinet to Mal Waldron's piano melodies, Roach thunders gloriously. The validity of Trane's intensity was never questioned and has been much romanticised since his untimely death in 1967. Dear Old Stockholm, which has the tenorist backed by his favourite pianist, McCoy Tyner, and bassist Jimmy Garrison but Roy Haynes deputising for Elvin Jones, provides some prime examples of late Trane work. Restless as ever, and with the insistent pulse of Jones replaced by the spreading rhthym of Haynes, 'One Up One Down' sees Coltrane painting his sheets of sound, 'After the Rain' suspending the rhythm to sombre and atmospheric effect.</p>

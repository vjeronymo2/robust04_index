			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG LOOKS AT HOME IN PARIS  </P> <P> The last time Michael Chang played in Paris, he surprised nearly everyone by  winning the French Open championship.  </P> <P> He isn't surprising anyone anymore, but Chang is still winning impressively. He  took just more than an hour to beat defending champion Amos Mansdorf of Israel,  6-3, 6-2, Monday in the Paris Open.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden also advanced easily, beating Andrei  Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 6-2, 6-3. It was the heavily favored Edberg who  lost to Chang in the French Open final in June. The crowds then belonged to  Chang, but not this time.  </P> <P> "I thought it was kind of a mixed crowd," Chang said. "Some were for Amos  because he won here last year, and some were for me because I won at Roland  Garros."  </P> <P> Chang next plays Henri Leconte of France. Leconte, a wild-card entry because  his ranking has dropped to 37th in the world, survived three set points in the  first set and coasted to a 7-6 (10-8), 6-0 victory over Richard Matuszewski.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be easy against Henri," Chang said. "He is a guy with so  much talent. I played him twice and lost to him twice. I just hope everything  turns out well."  </P> <P> Leconte had a back operation that sidelined him for almost six months.  </P> <P> In other matches, sixth-seeded Aaron Krickstein had no trouble with Mikael  Pernfors, winning, 6-1, 6-3, as the Swede made numerous unforced errors. Martin  Jaite of Argentina defeated West Germany's Carl-Uwe Steeb, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).  </P> <P> Third-seeded Zina Garrison needed only 46 minutes to beat Patty Murren, 6-2,  6-1, in the Virginia Slims of New England tournament at Worcester, Mass.  </P> <P> Murren was a last-minute entry replacing Gigi Fernandez, who had to withdraw  because of an injury.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain defeated Peanut Harper, 6-2, 6-0.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Katerina Maleeva defeated unseeded Tami Whitlinger, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2,  in the first round of the Virginia Slims of Indianapolis. Whitlinger is a  former standout at Stanford.  </P> <P> "I got tentative and nervous after the first set and I wasn't letting myself  play my game," said Whitlinger. "I was encouraged to know I could play that  well against a great player, but I still have a lot of room for improvement."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial] "Rao: Concessions Obtained For Developing </F> Nations Because Of India's Efforts"]    [Text] The efforts India took to review the GATT  negotiation terms based on the Dunkel draft have paid off  according to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao.    Addressing the gathering of Congress Parliamentary Party  members on Friday he said that India cannot avoid multilateral  trade anymore; we are having to import fertilizers, machinery,  and many other important commodities, and we have to sign the  GATT so that there can be control in these dealings.    Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji spoke in a manner  alleviating distrust and fear towards the negotiations. He  answered questions posed by members.    Many members felt if this briefing had been timely, they  could have handled the agitated opposition effectively in the  parliament.    At first, when GATT's chief author/director Arthur Dunkel  revealed his plans by means of drafted proposals, there was a  lot of apprehension of what its consequences to the developing  countries would be. Prime Minister Rao pointed out that the then  prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had sent a high level delegation  comprising of then finance minister V. P. Singh, K.C. Pant and  others to the first round of discussions following its  introduction.    Pranab Mukherji said it is not clear what the opposition  parties are trying to say. He said that even the Gujral  Committee recommends that it is best to stay in and negotiate  for the most concessions. Getting out in a huff or staying aloof  is not the right course of action. He reminded everyone that no  party had wanted India to get out of the consortium.</p>

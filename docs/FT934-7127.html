			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Take the biscuit - Off the Wall LORD PALUMBO, chairman of the Arts Council, was noble this week. He admitted that the Council had made a hash of trying to cut grants to the regional theatres, and he assumed responsibility. He also offered a chink of hope that the Council will not repeat that fiasco in its review of the London orchestras. On the surface Palumbo is still committed to withdrawing subsidy from two of the big three - either the LPO, the RPO, or the Philharmonia. But, as in the regional theatre scam, the Council's strategy has gone wrong from the start. Unwilling to take responsibility for its decision it invited Mr Justice Hoffmann to chair an outside jury and pronounce sentence. Apparently Leonard Hoffmann is unhappy with the situation, especially as the committee seems to have its hands tied - the LPO, resident orchestra on the South Bank, has an in-built advantage. It is now more than possible that the Hoffmann panel will duck the issue. Even if it does recommend a withdrawal of funding Palumbo made the point this week that it will be the Arts Council, at its December meeting, that will make the final choice. And it was the full Council that threw out the planned cuts by its drama panel on the regional theatres. So arts sponsorship is alive and kicking. True the 1992-93 expenditure figures released on Thursday show a 13 per cent fall, to Pounds 57.69m, but the 1991-92 total of Pounds 65.4m was inflated by the Pounds 11m that companies poured into the Japan Festival. Another reason for the decline is the near completion of the new Glyndebourne, which has absorbed much of the corporate support for arts rebuilding projects. Indeed the cut back in capital expenditure, from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 5.4m, accounts for most of the annual drop. We can see what is happening. In 1991-92 the first response of companies to the recession was to reduce corporate hospitality, and their contributions to corporate membership schemes slumped from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 7.9m. Now they have decided to turn down appeals for capital projects. But companies have maintained their sponsorship of arts events, particularly in the north, where arts sponsorship is registering a near 70 per cent rise. The biggest losers have been in London and the south. A most dramatic moment recently took place, appropriately enough, at the Arts Council. One morning in 1990 a secretary slit open a letter and out fell a cheque for Pounds 1m. Of course the Council thought it was the latest mind expanding ploy by some performance artist, but then a lawyer appeared to announce that the money came from the estate of an anonymous wartime refugee. Some sceptics saw the munificent hand of Palumbo behind the cheque, but whatever the source he suggested that the benefaction went towards an independent Arts Foundation with the task of encouraging the avant-garde. The original aim was to expand the funds of the Foundation to Pounds 10m, or more, but bad publicity resulted in additional support of just Pounds 3,500. Grand plans to open a mini Pompidou Centre in London were jettisoned and the Foundation faded into obscurity. So it was an agreeable surprise to find the Foundation actually giving out money to artists. The interest on its investments funded five cheques for Pounds 12,500 which were handed out on Wednesday to aspiring young artists - the ceramicists, Philip Eglin and Sara Radstone, the poet Linda France, the playwright Ed Thomas, and the photographer Ken Grant. The judges in the multi-discipliniary category were unable to award a prize because no one really knew what they were looking for. The Arts Foundation will shortly re-launch itself. It has been very careful with its money. As Lord Palumbo pointed out, the lunch to distribute the prizes was the gift of a generous sponsor. No prizes for guessing his name. On the subject of good housekeeping, the Arts Council announced this week that it had saved Pounds 1,000 of tax payers money this year by cutting the biscuit allowance of its HQ staff.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Letter: Role of the electricians' union at Wapping Sir, Michael Smith's review (March 12) of my book, Maverick, is a little lopsided with its concentration on Wapping. As for the headline, 'Hammond admits to talks with Murdoch', I have never denied meetings with News International. Indeed, in our evidence to the Trades Union Congress in February 1986, we said: 'Negotiations during 1985 between the TUC PIC (printing industries committee) unions and News International about its Wapping plant had been on the basis of the company's expressed intention that it proposed to use that plant to print a new paper, The London Post, and not any of its existing titles. This is confirmed by Sogat's evidence to the general council on January 30. As these negotiations related to a new newspaper to be produced at a new plant no union enjoyed any existing right of recognition or negotiation in respect of that plant.' But all our meetings were concerned with a new newspaper, The London Post, to be produced on a new site. We had been successful with Mr Eddie Shah in 1985 and hoped to do the same with News International. We were unsuccessful at Wapping because the print unions upped the stakes with their strike and gave News International the pretext to transfer existing titles to Wapping. We had nothing to do with that decision, nor could we change it. The responsibility rests squarely with the print unions.

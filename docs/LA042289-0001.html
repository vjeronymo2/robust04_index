			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO 'CAPITALIST' DISEASE;  </P> <P> SOVIETS, AT LAST, FACE UP TO AIDS  </P> <P> A crudely painted sign on a wall points the way. "SPID," it says, indicating  the direction past the rusting metal turnstile along a dirt path to a rundown  clinic in central Leningrad.  </P> <P> Three patients sit inside. Misha, who is his 30s and appears healthy, is  looking at a television set balanced precariously on a stool. In another room,  Valerie, a blonde prostitute, is bedridden, barely able to speak. On the next  cot sits Ira, a lively redhead who contracted "the disease" from a lover from  Sierra Leone six years ago.  </P> <P> All are suffering from AIDS.  </P> <P> "I read about SPID just last year," Ira says, using the Russian acronym for  AIDS. "I got frightened, so I decided to come have a test. It would have been  much better if we had known more about this earlier."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treatment Effort Started  </P> <P> After years of officially dismissing AIDS as a disease of the corrupted West,  the Soviet Union is now acknowledging its presence here and, with a palpable  sense of urgency, has begun a massive education and treatment effort to try to  make up for lost time.  </P> <P> The Soviet health minister has likened the AIDS threat to that posed by nuclear  weapons. Film makers are producing graphic and horrifying educational  documentaries that break previous taboos in showing how the disease can be  transmitted.  </P> <P> And, in a striking admission of the problem, health officials in Leningrad  opened a clinic just this month to conduct AIDS tests and provide physical and  psychological treatment for AIDS patients. Clinic doctors, in their first  interview with a Western journalist, said the hospital was needed because the  number of AIDS cases in the country is vastly underestimated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shift Stirs Apprehension  </P> <P> The decision to acknowledge the existence of AIDS, or acquired immune  deficiency syndrome, in the Soviet Union has awakened a deep apprehension and  even alarm among some in a population indoctrinated to believe the disease was  a horror of capitalism that would pass them by.  </P> <P> In Leningrad, hundreds wait in line each day for the anonymous blood tests  offered at the new clinic.  </P> <P> The clinic doctors are walking a narrow line, trying to encourage awareness  while at the same time seeking to control panic.  </P> <P> At times, panic seems to be winning.  </P> <P> One frightened woman who visited the clinic confessed that she no longer takes  the subway, where she believes the virus can travel like wildfire.  </P> <P> In another instance, a man rushed in one day, insisting on being tested because  he was convinced he had contracted the disease during a fistfight that drew  blood.  </P> <P> And then there is a hard-core group of about 50 people who return repeatedly  for blood tests to make sure they have not, somehow, caught this foreign and  fatal disease.  </P> <P> "We spend a long time speaking to them," said Dr. Alexander Kolmakov, director  of the clinic. "We explain the ways of transmission and tell them they don't  need to come every week. But they don't listen."  </P> <P> "There is an epidemic of fear about the disease," Soviet AIDS expert Vadim  Pokrovsky told the daily newspaper Country Life this week. "Hundreds and  thousands of terrified people come to us saying they have diagnosed themselves  as suffering from AIDS. Some stop visiting saunas and swimming pools and are  afraid of foreigners."  </P> <P> Assembling a team of doctors for the clinic was even a bit of a problem,  because information about AIDS had been so suppressed that even some educated  Soviets thought the disease could be transmitted through a sweaty handshake.  </P> <P> "Some doctors refused to work with us, and almost everyone had a natural fear.  But we have worked to overcome it," said Dr. Aza Rachmanov, who is responsible  for supervising the physical and psychological care of the three patients  currently in the clinic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Healthy Dose of Fear  </P> <P> The Leningrad doctors strongly believe a healthy dose of fear, if properly  channeled into an awareness of dangers of the disease, is preferable to the  alternative.  </P> <P> "We're not afraid of panic -- no, on the contrary, we are afraid of a lack of  concern, of sloppiness in trying to prevent spread of the disease," Rachmanov  said.  </P> <P> The extent of Soviet medical concern over the disease might at first appear  perplexing. Three Soviet citizens and three foreigners have died here from  AIDS, according to official reports. A total of 192 Soviet citizens and 378  foreigners have been officially diagnosed here as carriers of the human  immunodeficiency virus; the foreigners have all been deported.  </P> <P> This compares to about 142,000 people who have contracted the deadly disease  worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The global figures are  believed to be much lower than reality, however, because many countries  under-report or fail to report cases. In the United States, about 90,990 AIDS  cases have been reported since the virus, which breaks down the body's immune  system, was identified in June, 1981.  </P> <P> But for many years it took courage to report an AIDS case here because of the  belief that it was politically unwise. Consequently, many doctors who  discovered an AIDS case apparently kept the diagnosis locked in their files. In  addition, many AIDS patients, told they were suffering from other diseases,  unwittingly transferred the virus to others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 100 Times More Victims  </P> <P> As a result, 100 times as many Soviets may have the disease as is officially  acknowledged, doctors privately conceded in recent interviews at the Leningrad  clinic.  </P> <P> Most of the Soviet citizens carrying the virus are either homosexual men or  prostitutes, according to Soviet specialists. So far, none are drug users, the  specialists say, but a number of AIDS sufferers have contracted the virus from  medical use of unsterilized needles.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, according to a recent report in the Communist Party newspaper  Pravda, some medical experts believe the country could have an astonishing 15  million carriers of the disease -- a figure that, if accurate, would be 10  times the number estimated in the United States. About 200,000 people would  have full-blown AIDS or already have died of the disease, according to the  report, which has been seriously questioned by a number of authorities.  </P> <P> "A long time ago, some noted epidemiologists reported with certainty that this  new 20th Century plague would pass us by," the government daily Izvestia  commented recently. "But the rapidly increasing number of Soviet cases shows  AIDS is not somewhere 'over there, in their country.' It is here, among our  population."  </P> <P> As recently as 1987, Pokrovsky, who now refers to the "epidemic of fear," said  AIDS was not a serious problem for the Soviet Union because "the moral stands  in our society are higher than, for example, in the U.S.A."  </P> <P> That same year, official Soviet news media, in what the State Department called  a disinformation campaign, were claiming that the CIA had genetically  engineered AIDS while experimenting with biological weapons at a laboratory in  Maryland.  </P> <P> Soviet doctors now sharply repudiate those earlier official views.  </P> <P> "You write for a newspaper in Los Angeles? Then it is very important that you  tell your readers something," said Dr. Andrei P. Kozlov, director of the AIDS  clinic laboratory, leaning close to make his point.  </P> <P> "Soviet scientists never supported the idea that this virus was created in the  United States," Kozlov said. "It is necessary for the Americans to know we were  not responsible for this stupidity."  </P> <P> Kozlov was the first doctor to publicly identify an AIDS case in the Soviet  Union, two years ago, and the first to list AIDS as a cause of the death of a  Soviet citizen, just six months ago.  </P> <P> "I doubt Leningrad really had the first AIDS death. We were just brave enough  to declare it," Kozlov said.  </P> <P> Today, Kozlov's lab, part of the clinic located in Leningrad's Hospital No. 30,  performs up to 1,500 anonymous blood tests daily.  </P> <P> Besides the lab, the clinic consists of a wing in the hospital set aside for  AIDS patients. The facility appears sparse by American standards, with few  furnishings and no attempt at cheer. But compared to dirty hospitals ridden  with roaches and mice that have been described in the official Soviet media,  the clinic is a gigantic step forward for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The team of doctors includes a dentist to treat AIDS patients and a  pediatrician, because one of the city's AIDS patients is a child. The doctors  do their best to counsel the patients, but a psychiatrist is not included on  the staff.  </P> <P> Even with the best of intentions, however, the Soviet Union still has some  basic problems in trying to combat spread of the disease -- severe shortages of  both condoms and disposable needles.  </P> <P> Soviets growing ever more concerned about AIDS have written to newspapers  complaining about the lack of condoms. The Health Ministry newspaper Medical  Gazette recently reported that some desperate couples had turned to using  children's balloons.  </P> <P> As for syringes, Alexander I. Kondrusev, a deputy health minister, told  reporters at a recent briefing that the country produced just 30 million  disposable syringes last year, while health workers dispensed 3 billion  injections.  </P> <P> The need for disposable syringes was dramatically illustrated by a case earlier  this year in Elista, near the Caspian Sea.  </P> <P> At a city maternity hospital, 49 people, most of them children, contracted  AIDS, apparently because of ignorant reuse of an unsterilized needle. The case  horrified many and apparently gave fresh impetus to plans to open the Leningrad  clinic.  </P> <P> "We used to be taught here in the Soviet Union that since we were decent  people, we could not get AIDS," Kolmakov said. "Now we know the truth -- anyone  can get the disease, Communist or capitalist, Soviet or American."  </P></p>

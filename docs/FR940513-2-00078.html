			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the population ages, one of the primary challenges facing decision makers will be how to enhance the quality of life for older women, the vast majority of the older population. Without specific interventions and strategies designed to improve the status of current and future generations of older women, they will continue to face higher poverty rates, to bear a disproportionate share of caregiving burdens_frequently without access to caregiving when they need it_and to suffer from more chronic illnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Single elderly women are particularly at risk. A 1991 report of the Advisory Council on Social Security projects that single elderly women in the baby boom generation will have lower levels of income and wealth than single elderly men or elderly couples. In fact, the economic well-being of single elderly women will continue to decline relative to that of elderly couples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Younger and mid-life women must realize that their decisions and actions now will have a considerable impact on how they live as older women. Society in general needs to reinforce the capacity of older women to contribute and to be less dependent upon public benefits as they age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA believes that a National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women can play a significant role in fostering a nationwide dialogue about how to improve the status of older women. The goals of the National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women are to encourage greater national responsiveness to the concerns of older women through the identification of critical issues; to educate key actors such as older women themselves, policy makers, the Aging Network, and national aging and women's organizations; and to prepare relevant policy analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants under this priority area must discuss the overall agenda and activities of the Center over a three year period and provide a detailed first year plan for how the Center will address caregiving, income security, housing, and health issues as they relate to older women. The program design should clearly demonstrate how individual activities and projects are part of and contribute to the development of a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of life for America's older women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, applicants must show how they will carry out the following activities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Consumer Education and Dissemination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All consumer education and dissemination activities should focus on transmitting information on caregiving, health, income security, housing and other relevant issues to older women at the grassroots level. Many useful materials and products have been developed but have not reached the older women who would benefit from them. Applicants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches to consumer education and dissemination. Also, proposals should specify how they will work with the Aging Network as well as other networks to disseminate relevant information to women at the local level. In particular, education efforts should recognize the diversity of older women in terms of race, ethnicity, class, and other factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Education and Technical Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Education and technical assistance activities should target members of the Aging Network and national women's organizations as well as policy makers at all levels. Both aging and women's organizations need to become more responsive to the needs of older women and to recognize their areas of common interest. Policy makers at all levels must realize the necessity of planning not only for an aging society but also for a society that will be predominantly female and old.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Knowledge Building and Policy Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Research, development, and policy analysis should be oriented toward results and products which have practical application and immediate use to those working on older women issues, e.g., the development and/or modeling of a useful instrument or tool; preparation of educational, practice, and technical assistance materials; an analysis of key issues of concern relative to a particular subject. Applicants should have the capacity to meet the need for short-term policy analysis on topics relating to older women. Based on a high level of knowledge and information synthesis, applicants should propose possible subjects for policy analysis but also demonstrate that they possess the capacity to respond flexibly and quickly to such needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any public or nonprofit agency, organization, or institution is eligible to apply under this priority area. However, to merit serious consideration, an applicant must demonstrate that it has (1) extensive knowledge of and experience in older women issues, policies, and programs; (2) a record of relevant achievement in this area;, and (3) the requisite organizational capability to carry out the activities of a Resource Center on a nationwide scale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA expects to fund the National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women through a cooperative agreement award for a three year period, with a federal share of approximately $300,000 for the first year; $400,000 for the second year; and $400,000 for the third year. AoA and the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women will work cooperatively in the development of its scope of work and agenda of major events and activities. (However, applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years based on their assessment of salient issues). The National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women shall have a Director with an appropriate background and qualifications in aging and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of her/his time to this position. The deadline for submission of applications under this priority area is October 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2&blank;Protecting Older Women Against Domestic Violence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Physical and sexual violence against women is a serious problem. Millions of women are assaulted by their intimate partners each year. Nearly one quarter of women in the United States will be abused by a current or former partner some time during their lives. This violence causes serious physical, psychological, and social consequences for these women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

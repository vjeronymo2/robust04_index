Mr Uthai said after  meeting with the head of a delegation of the Commission of the  European Union, J Gwyn Morgan -- the second meeting of an EU  representative with the Commerce Ministry -- that he had  expressed his government's dissatisfaction over the French ban.  The import ban is based on confusion over Thailand's foremost,  competent export inspection authority.    He indicated that if Thailand does not receive a timely and  satisfactory response from the French Government, his agency may  take the case to the GATT council to seek redress from the  balance of a perceived selective practice against Thailand. Mr  Morgan has urged the Thai Government to delay any decision to  involve a GATT review and allow him his best effort to solve the  current dispute.    Mr Uthai will inform the Cabinet today of the French  authority's actions but declined to elaborate on what short-term  measures, if any, the Thai Government should take against France.    The Thai Food Processors Association and the Thai Frozen  Food  Association has called for trade retaliation. "We hope the  dispute will be resolved soon and will not jeopardise the  existing relationship between our two countries," said Mr Uthai.  Mr Morgan said yesterday: "On behalf of the European Union, we,  in Brussels, will discuss with our French colleagues a remedy  and resolution to this dispute as soon as possible". The French  Government banned Thai fishery imports on February 9.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> CHILEANS IN 2 CAMPS SHARE ABIDING TIES TO DISTANT LAND  </P> <P> For the past 14 years, traditional celebrations have been held in two different  parts of Los Angeles, with the participants paying homage to their red, white  and blue Chilean flag and singing their anthem.  </P> <P> The mood and feeling of the two mid-September celebrations not only demonstrate  the love Chileans have for their distant country, but also clearly reveal a  rift in the Los Angeles colony.  </P> <P> In Elysian Park, the country's anniversary is celebrated by people who are  close to the Chilean Consulate, while in the Ukrainian Center it is celebrated  by the most ardent opponents of the current military government.  </P> <P> "It is no secret to anyone that the Chileans in Los Angeles have been divided  by the politics of recent years," Ricardo Flores, a prominent member of the  community, acknowledges.  </P> <P> "But not all attitudes nor actions of the Chilean colony have been marked by  that division," noted Flores, an ex-professor who came to the United States in  1967 and has become the Chilean gastronomic ambassador in Los Angeles as the  owner of the Rincon Chileno restaurant.  </P> <P> To prove his point, Flores cites the reaction to the earthquake that struck  Santiago, the capital of Chile, on March 3, 1985: "The colony left aside its  differences and faced the tragedy as one."  </P> <P> More recently, Chilean residents of Los Angeles pulled together in a similar  display of solidarity when the U.S. goverment temporarily imposed an embargo on  the importation of fruit from Chile last March, after two grapes containing  cyanide were found in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "It hurt us all a lot. There were no differences because of . . . politics"  said Jose Altamirano, president of the Club Chile-America in Orange County.  "The reaction of U.S. authorities was a little exaggerated."  </P> <P> It is difficult to determine the precise number of Chileans in Southern  California, and estimates vary from 12,000 to 25,000.  </P> <P> The major residential concentration is in the San Fernando Valley. Another  pocket of Chileans is in Orange County, where "there are 3,000 of us," said  Fernando Velo, director of the Azteca weekly, which circulates in that area.  </P> <P> The Chilean community in Southern California has charted a long local history,  even though its population is relatively small. In fact, Chilean cuecas were  danced and sung in this part of the country long before other immigrants from  Central or South America or the Caribbean arrived here.  </P> <P> During the Gold Rush from 1848 to 1852, more than 15,000 Chilean gold diggers  arrived in Northern California. They had great success, founding towns and  introducing new methods for gold mining.  </P> <P> A small group of the immigrants remained in California and the majority  returned to Chile when they grew tired of confronting the Anglos.  </P> <P> The Chilean influence was greater in Northern California than in the southern  region. The census of 1850 counted only four Chileans in Los Angeles County,  five in 1852 and 35 in 1860, although, according to historian David Valjalo,  the first pharmacy in Los Angeles was founded by a Chilean named Gutierrez.  </P> <P> The first significant wave of Chileans in this century came in the 1950s and  '60s. Those who arrived in those years came in search of the American way of  life, as idealized by Hollywood movies.  </P> <P> "The flow was relatively light, there were few of us here in Los Angeles,"  recalls Hugo Fraga, an elder member of the colony and director of the Refugio  de Cristo charity organization, who reports that the majority settled in the  Hollywood area.  </P> <P> At the start of the 1970s, two events provoked Chilean emigration to other  countries.  </P> <P> In 1970, an election brought to the presidency Salvador Allende, the candidate  of Popular Unity, a leftist coalition that included the Socialist and Communist  parties. Allende's rise to power caused one wave of emigration.  </P> <P> On Sept. 11, 1973, the armed forces led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet toppled the  constitutional government of Allende in a bloody coup.  </P> <P> In response to the coup, a ship left Los Angeles for Chile in 1974, taking home  250 people. But the establishment of the dictatorship also created a Chilean  Diaspora that spread to all parts of the world. In the United States, political  refuge was offered to 400 families, some of whom settled here in California.  </P> <P> At the start of the 1980s, at university campuses of Southern California, a  variety of symposiums of Chilean poets in exile were held along with  political-cultural functions called penas de solidaridad.  </P> <P> "These activities, such as the instruction of Spanish and the history and  geography of Chile for the children of the refugees have been sponsored by the  political sectors that have maintained a position of struggle against the  dictatorship," said Roberto Naduris, a journalist for KPFK Radio and a member  of the exile organization called Chile Democratico.  </P> <P> On the opposite side to Chile Democratico there developed clubs where former  members of the armed forces gather. In Southern California there are two: One  Hundred Eagles, made up of former officers of the army and air force, and  Calehuche, which unites former officers of the navy.  </P> <P> But the split in the community may soon end.  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, 1988, a plebiscite took place that denied the continuation of the  rule of Pinochet and established that elections will be held in December of  this year.  </P> <P> For that reason, the 1990 independence celebrations, which are held each Sept.  18 in Chile, will take place at a single site in which the Chileans will  organize their traditional fonda, dress in their huasos, eat empanadas, drink  their wine and dance the cueca.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHILEAN COMMUNITY IN BRIEF  </P> <P> POPULATION: 12,000 to 25,000  </P> <P> CONSULATE: 510 W. 6th St., Suite 1204, Los Angeles, CA 90014, (213) 624-6357  </P> <P> CONSUL: Roberto Guillard  </P> <P> ORGANIZATIONS: Social: Cien Aguilas, El Calehuche; Charity: Refugio de Cristo;  Sports: Club Chileno de Tiro al Platillo, Club Chile-America of Orange County,  Club Deportivo de Futbol Chile; Business: Camara de Comercio Chile-California;  Political: Chile Democratico, Civic: Asociacion de Organizaciones Chilenas del  Sur de California, Folkloric: Chile Baila  </P></p>

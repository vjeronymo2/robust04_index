			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fininvest Chairman Fedele Confalonieri by </F> Antonio Calabro on 30 March; place not given: "We Will Sell  Something, But Give Us Time..."]    [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Calabro] Arguments  are one thing, but what can you tell me about conflicts of  interests?    [Confalonieri] Let us not exaggerate. Let us take an  example: You progressive forces have an idealized view of the  Kennedies, but as far as I know, the Kennedy family, which had  vast and widespread economic interests, was never deprived of  its property during John's presidency, nor did anyone suspect  that the U.S. Government favored his family's business affairs.    [Calabro] But Berlusconi is not Kennedy. In any case, let us  try to take our discussion beyond the level of smart rejoinders.  Already, on the eve of the elections, when you drew attention to  the dangers of a conflict of interests, Berlusconi replied that  he had taken measures to relinquish his Fininvest activities.  Two days ago he repeated: "I am prepared to sell off some  companies." Mr. Confalonieri, what will you be selling off?    [Confalonieri] We are working to meet the program we  established for ourselves prior to the elections, irrespective  of Mr. Berlusconi's political decisions: to merge Mondadori --  which has been quoted for some time -- with Silvio Berlusconi  Editore, so as to have a major company on the stock exchange.  Also, to make limited companies out of Big TV, the television  enterprise, the financial products, and Fininvest itself. Do  you consider that insufficient?    [Calabro] These plans have been announced but never carried  out. When will you be quoted on the stock exchange?    [Confalonieri] At the end of the process of restructuring  and  reorganization of our group, which is a very complex one.    [Calabro] Your critics say that hitherto you have not quoted  anything on the stock exchange because Fininvest's accounts are  not in order....    [Confalonieri] An end must be put to the suspicions about  our  accounts, the electoralist polemics. I hope we will see the  start of a period in which our accounts can be examined calmly,  and these accounts are in order. Our firms' performance  improved in 1993: Fininvest's operating surplus increased by 20  percent in 1993, and its turnover increased by 11 percent to  11.6 trillion lire.    [Calabro] Let us return to the sell-offs. Being quoted on  the stock exchange does not at all mean "relinquishing" firms in  order to avert conflicts of interest.    [Confalonieri] We proceed from the fact that none of the  Fininvest enterprises can be sold off overnight, as though it  were a packet of bread sticks. Do you expect Standa [department  store chain], the investment funds, or a television network to  be put on the market today and a purchaser will appear  miraculously tomorrow with a good offer? Apart from that, to be  quoted on the stock market is no minor decision: It means  undergoing a lengthy and strict series of inspections by  minority shareholders, by the market, and by CONSOB [National  Commission for the Supervision of Companies and the Stock  Exchange]. And these inspections will ensure that there are no  conflicts of interest.    [Calabro] But it was Berlusconi himself who said two days  ago  he is willing to sell off a television channel. Is the prime  ministership worth Rete 4 or Italia 1?    [Confalonieri] Let us talk about it without any smart  comments. You have to consider the assets, the integration  between the various activities, the overall context, the  publicity and new market, and what RAI [state broadcasting  service] does. Not to mention the very future of the entire  sector, what with possible cabling proposals, satellites, and  digital broadcasting. We shall see.    [Calabro] Pending stock exchange quotations and inspections,  let us try to consider some imminent conflicts of interest.  Prime Minister Berlusconi privatizes STET [Turin Telephone  Finance Company]. But Berlusconi the businessman has an  investment funds firm called Programma Italia, that STET would  very much like....    [Confalonieri] No, such insinuations are unacceptable.  Otherwise, what should we say about [Prime Minister] Ciampi and  the portable phones issued to Olivetti? It is impossible that  Berlusconi would do anything to benefit one of his firms. If  anything, paradoxically, the opposite is more likely. Be that  as it may, there has been a sharp separation between Berlusconi  and Fininvest since the start of the election campaign: He  resigned all his positions, he no longer manages anything, he  has no responsibilities.    [Calabro] Yes, but he remains the owner, the boss. And the  issue of conflicts of interest remains unresolved. The  Berlusconi government will have to appoint the heads of the  banks, but Berlusconi's Fininvest is negotiating with the banks  for new credit lines.... The Berlusconi government will have to  discuss antimonopoly measures, but Berlusconi's Fininvest owns  three television networks.... The Berlusconi government will  have to renew the top management at RAI, of which Berlusconi's  Fininvest is the leading competitor.... And so on.    [Confalonieri] Let us be clear about this: Fininvest is  Fininvest, not an offshoot of Berlusconi. It is a holding  company that has built up a role for itself in Italy and abroad  thanks to Berlusconi's business abilities but also thanks to the  intelligence, self-sacrifice, and initiatives of his staff and  his managers -- the Gallianis, Dell'Utris, Foscales,  Bernasconis, and Dorises. It is a group that deserves attention  and cannot be regarded as the plaything of a single person.  Just as RAI is a great enterprise, with excellent professional  standards, that must be respected. So what if Berlusconi does  become prime minister? Fininvest will continue its work. And  whoever manages it -- from me, its chairman, to its managing  director, Franco Tato -- will do so in total, responsible  autonomy.    [Calabro] These are mere words, and declarations of  principle. The anxieties about conflicts of interest still  remain....    [Confalonieri] The deeds, the specific conduct and political  decisions of Berlusconi as a man of government, and Fininvest's  autonomous initiatives will show that those anxieties are  groundless. To think otherwise would be rather like returning  to the Middle Ages when the monarch's wealth was the same as the  wealth of his kingdom. Does this group seem Medieval to you?

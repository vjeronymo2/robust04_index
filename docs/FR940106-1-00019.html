			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Agency, under this option, could also develop guidance for States regarding site management, off-site uses, and pollution prevention and waste minimization technologies. This guidance would assist States in reducing the potential risks posed by mismanagement of CKD and recommend implementation of technologies that would promote recycling of CKD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this option, CKD management would not be controlled by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. However, since the exemption for CKD remains in place, CKD generated in kilns that burn hazardous waste would still be subject to the two-part test for residuals under 40 CFR 266.112. If CKD does not pass the two-part test, it would be treated to standards for land disposal (40 CFR 268.43) and disposed in a subtitle C facility. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites would still be addressed by RCRA section 7003 and CERCLA sections 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger to human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 3: Remove the CKD Exemption but delay implementation for some period of time (e.g., two years), that would allow industry time to employ pollution prevention options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While CKD may not present risks when evaluating the various exposure pathways using average or best case conditions, CKD may pose a potential danger to human health and the environment if managed in certain ways under a limited set of exposure pathways assuming plausible worst case conditions. Also, damages to the environment resulting from poor CKD management practices have been recorded and are continuing to occur at some facilities. For these reasons, removing the Bevill exemption (codified at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)) may be appropriate. Accordingly, provisions of the Boiler and Industrial Furnace rule (40 CFR 266.112) would no longer apply to hazardous waste-derived CKD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this option, on-site CKD management practices at those facilities with dust that exhibited any of the RCRA hazardous waste characteristics, or CKD derived from the burning of listed hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) would be affected by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. CKD disposal piles which are inactive on or before the effective date of the Final Rule would be unaffected by the provisions of subtitle C, unless subsequently managed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By delaying lifting the exemption for some period of time (e.g., two years after the Regulatory Determination), industry would be provided an opportunity to implement pollution prevention alternatives and thus, manage the hazardous waste management costs they would incur. During this interim period between submittal of the Report to Congress and the effective date of the Final Rule, the CKD exemption would still be in effect. The Agency believes that many of the affected facilities would utilize the time to adopt pollution prevention technologies which would reduce, if not eliminate the amount of hazardous CKD they generate or stop burning hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the exemption is removed, CKD generated from cement manufacturing facilities that burn RCRA hazardous wastes would be RCRA hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The goal of avoiding subtitle C compliance costs would provide an incentive for each facility to look for pollution prevention alternatives to recycle their CKD and reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. The Agency is requesting additional information on the viability of the CKD recycling options discussed in the RTC and any other available pollution prevention or recycling option not considered in the Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those facilities that do not burn hazardous waste would not generally be affected by removing the exemption unless they generated characteristic RCRA hazardous waste. The Agency expects the number of non-hazardous waste burning facilities affected by this option would be small, since CKD rarely exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. These facilities would have an incentive to control their cement manufacturing process to avoid generating characteristic CKD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 4: Remove the CKD Exemption, and rely on existing hazardous waste rules to control cement kiln dust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This option is similar to Option 3, except the exemption would be removed in accordance with RCRA section 3010(b). (Under subtitle C of RCRA, wastes brought under regulatory control have up to six months from the Regulatory Determination before they become subject to hazardous waste control.) Thus, CKD that is hazardous waste-derived or exhibits a RCRA hazardous characteristic would be made subject to the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. Otherwise, this option is the same as Option 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

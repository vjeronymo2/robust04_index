			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] KOMPAS discusses the failure of the textile trade  talks between Indonesia and the United States in Bali last  weekend. The earlier talks, held in Washington, also failed to  reach an agreement. Therefore, it was the second time the talks  were not successful.    The United States continues to reject Indonesia's request to  increase the export quota of Indonesian textiles and textile  products by 14 percent for certain textile categories. The  United States is willing to increase the quota by 2 percent, and  Indonesia cannot accept that.    As for the U.S. demand to have access to Indonesian markets  for its commodity goods, a concrete agreement has not been  reached yet. Against this background, KOMPAS urges the  Indonesian Government to approach not only the USTR in  Washington, but also the U.S. Senate, the State Department, the  Agriculture Department, the U.S. Customs, and American business  circles. As such, the success of the talks will be determined  not only in formal negotiations but also through informal  relations and personal approach. Such a personal approach is  needed in future talks to produce results desired by Indonesia.</p>

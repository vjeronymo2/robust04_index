			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Emilio Alvarez Montalvan] </F>   [Text] The visit to Nicaragua by the U.S. undersecretary  for Latin American affairs cannot be explained away as a  ceremonial gesture for the American Chamber of Commerce. The  arrival of this important official should be viewed in a much  more important context.    It is clear that Mr. Watson came not only to give his  blessing to Mr. Maisto's mission, but also to explain directly  to the local protagonists how his country's foreign policy is to  be applied in Nicaragua, which is perceived to be going through  a transition that is difficult to understand and is also stalled.    But what are the parameters of the United States' overall  strategy, as far as this tiny country is concerned? In this  regard, Clinton's foreign policy has three objectives: 1)  maintaining the United States's current status as sole  superpower, 2) defending democracy and the free market, and 3)  preventing secondary conflicts in sensitive areas that would not  be of any benefit to the United States.    Nicaragua's case would fall into the latter two premises. It  is reasonable for Mr. Watson to think that the Nicaraguan  Government is in a precarious balance. From that point of view,  Mrs. Chamorro appears to be an isolated hostage who is sending  an ambiguous message, in contrast to the powerful  military-social apparatus of the Sandinists who are surrounding  her. Lacking her own political force, the president is sometimes  seen to be too timid to make reforms, fearful of losing power,  while at other times she appears to be a clever collaborator in  the government coalition recommended by her prime minister and  relative.    In this regard, Mr. Watson must have been tempted to resolve  this uncomfortable dilemma and, incidentally, to warn his  interlocutors that time is running short for Nicaragua. Her  other sisters are already organized, and foreign aid funding is  shrinking irretrievably.    But how could he give advice without appearing to intervene,  without contradicting the notion that we should solve our  problems internally? And how could he remain silent, allowing  the ungovernability and inefficiency to continue in Nicaragua  and to threaten to spread throughout the region?    What he did not do was combine two recipes: assuring Dona  Violeta that she will remain in place while pointing out to her  that there are three objectives of the United States' overall  strategy that have particularly critical ramifications in  Nicaragua: respect for private property, returning or purchasing  it as soon as possible; punishment for human rights violators;  and subjecting the military apparatus to civilian control.    Nonetheless, the visitor must have realized that as long as  there are radical and influential Sandinist leaders who refuse  to cooperate in stabilizing the country out of fear that they  will be seen as pawns of the regional power, the problem will  remain unsolved.... Nor will it be solved if officials continue  to delay passage of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces, which  would provide for the reform of a military hierarchy that is  excessively politicized.    To remove these obstacles, the democratic reforms of the  Sandinist movement, proposed by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, are  naturally viewed favorably. It is also logical to insist that  the Organic Law of the Armed Forces be put in place as soon as  possible so that the military can come under civilian control.    In light of the vested interests, however, there is not much  likelihood that the desire to blast Nicaragua out of its  stagnation will be realized. The vicious circle can be broken  only if the president implements a national political program  that includes the democratic forces that brought her to power.  That would allow her to effect the reforms the country is  demanding and to jump start the economy. Watson's visit, not  being subliminal, was meaningless.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> 100 POUNDS OF CLAY: Each year Bam Magazine offers a special "Bam 100" issue,  where the music mag rates the industry's heaviest 100 hitters (and not-so-heavy  hitters -- even Pop Eye made last year's list). In its March 24 issue, Bam pays  tribute to the class of 1989. All the expected top moguls are on hand, but we  were more intrigued by the mag's more obscure choices. They included:  </P> <P> * Pink Floyd tour lighting director and set designer Mark Brickman &amp; Paul  Staples.  </P> <P> * Los Angeles ticket broker tycoon Brian Harlig.  </P> <P> * Phoenix deejay J.J. Morgan (the first deejay to resurrect a five-year-old  UB40 flop -- "Red Red Wine" -- which went on to become a hit).  </P> <P> * Hot black producer Teddy Riley (who's produced everyone from Bobby Brown and  Al B. Sure! to Kool Moe Dee and Heavy D &amp; the Boyz).  </P> <P> * Reviled pop biographer Albert Goldman.  </P> <P> * Pop archivist Hal Willner (who compiled "Stay Awake," last year's critically  beloved Disney compilation).  </P> <P> * Adventuresome San Francisco club booker Harry Duncan.  </P> <P> * Grateful Dead business manager Jon McIntire.  </P> <P> * John Morey, whose Narda Records was the year's hottest New Age label.  </P></p>

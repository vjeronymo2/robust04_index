			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Management: Delegate and rule - In a new series on Euromanagers Viktor Korovin of Uralmash in Russia, talks to Leyla Boulton AS HEAD of the regional Communist Youth League nine years ago, Viktor Korovin incurred the wrath of Boris Yeltsin. His offence was to have sent his deputy to a meeting with the man who was then regional Communist Party boss. As chief executive of newly-privatised Uralmash, Russia's biggest heavy engineering company, the 40-year-old Korovin still believes it is 'to a leader's credit if he has a deputy who can replace him'. Delegating responsibility is a key component of his strategy for overhauling a flagship of Stalin's industrialisation which last week celebrated its 60th anniversary in President Yeltsin's home-town of Yekaterinburg. The managerial challenge of adjusting to the chaotic market reforms sweeping Russia are formidable. But if there is anyone capable of handling them, it is Korovin, who has already displayed shrewd and energetic leadership since taking on the top job at Uralmash (Urals Heavy Machine-Building Factory) 14 months ago. Korovin's self-deprecating manner and boyish - almost scrawny - appearance only thinly disguise a relentless workaholic. Sitting in a spartan office overlooking the railway that criss-crosses the Uralmash factory, he says human challenges outweigh by far the severe problems of worn-out plant and equipment, financial crisis and government interference. His workforce has been reduced from 38,000 to 29,000 since he took over, with 5,000 leaving of their own accord and 4,000 made redundant. The administrative staff have been put on a four-day week and the level of activity at the plant is a shadow of what it was under the old state planning system when, as he puts it, 'demand for our products was artificially high'. Further job cuts will 'depend on our success in the market'. Since he was elected to run Uralmash in a contest with four other candidates, he has appointed like-minded men of his generation as directors for marketing, personnel, production and finance. He has given them full responsibility and freedom, dumping the highly-centralised system that continues to exist within most enterprises in the former Soviet Union. 'Russians are in no way inferior to Germans or Italians,' says Korovin, who worked for an engineering company outside Frankfurt in 1990, and then headed Uralmash's joint venture with Austria's Voest-Alpine. 'The only difference was that the economic framework in which people have worked has been all wrong. My task is to change this, and then you can really expect miracles from people.' In an attempt to compensate managers for pay that is demoralisingly low by comparison with the fortunes being made by new entrepreneurs, options on 5 per cent of Uralmash stock have been set aside for them. Korovin's salary, set when he was appointed at 5.6 times the prevailing average wage at Uralmash, is equivalent to Dollars 200 (Pounds 134) a month. In a move to improve shop-floor incentives, he plans to give the different sections of the under-used plant enough autonomy to take on additional contracts and use the profits as they wish 'to re-equip, expand, or even increase wages'. Even though he claims not to enjoy it, he says the recipe for earning the respect of a workforce at large gatherings is to 'talk very sharply, crudely, even shouting at times'. Faced with constant strike threats over low pay, his reply has been 'go ahead and strike, your pay will be even smaller'. To cope with theft of factory materials he has set up a security force to patrol the 5sq km plant. There is little else he can do when his low-paid workers have even managed to smuggle out copper through the plant's sewage system. Notwithstanding his enthusiasm for delegation, Korovin is a man who is capable of leading from the front. In his fight for new markets to replace dwindling state procurement orders, he last winter led a consortium of Russian companies which fought for and won a contract to supply mining and transport equipment to Russia's Dollars 1bn Udokan copper development project. He is now looking to expand exports of mining equipment to China and is trying to latch on to a variety of mining and oil projects within Russia. Most factory managers in Russia jump at the chance to visit the US on a business trip. But Korovin has left Uralmash's finance director in charge of negotiations with the US groups Caterpillar and National Oil Well for a joint venture in the production and marketing of oil drilling equipment. Rather than run to the government for wage and other subsidies, as some privatised companies are continuing to do, Korovin is pushing for the state to take on the financing of the cheap housing, kindergartens and other services that Uralmash provides. Korovin is desperate to shed these non-productive assets which he says amount to an invisible 30 per cent tax on profits. He has stopped building housing for workers, even though it has long been the tradition that staff receive their own apartment after 10 years service. At the root of the efforts to keep down costs is a desperate desire to save jobs and avoid what he calls a 'social explosion'. As Kakha Bendukidze, a wealthy entrepreneur who bought 18.5 per cent of Uralmash shares says, there is a 'need to stop unemployed workers from smashing up the plant'. Korovin says the government's biggest mistake is failing to create jobs and he criticises politicians for interfering with his new freedom. One example is the finance ministry instructions telling him to launch a capital increase. Korovin insists it should be his responsibility to decide the terms and the timing, even if the government still has 20 per cent of the equity. Instead of trying to micro manage companies the government should get on with its job of removing market distortions. 'There is demand for our equipment but the crisis is structural. Our customers - steel companies and coal enterprises, for example - have capacity which must die. But they're trying to maintain everything and that's why we are not being paid.' Those customers that have money have insufficient incentives to re-equip. 'Stop piling up your money,' is his sales pitch to them. 'It's time to start buying equipment otherwise you're bad managers and any decent capitalist will wipe you out.' Motivated by the same ambition and energy which propelled him to the top of the old Communist system even though he now believes in a completely different ideology, he works 14 hours a day, six days a week. 'I know that's bad,' he says, as he chain-smokes his way through a packet of Marlboro cigarettes. 'It's much better to be fresh for the next day. But all I have time for is to sleep a little and spend Sunday with my family.'</p>

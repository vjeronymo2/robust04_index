			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angel Hernandez] </F>   [Text] Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino has begun  to totally restructure the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) and he  has ordered the "special groups" and the General Operations  Coordinating Office to be dismantled. In addition, Benitez  Trevino is reviewing the relationship of this corps with other  agencies in an effort to make it more efficient and to prevent  illegal actions.    Five commanders have been discharged and the files of the  PJF's approximately 2,000 agents, all of whom will undergo drug  testing, will be carefully reviewed. If evidence of irregular  or criminal conduct is established, they will be discharged and  legal action will be taken against them.    These actions are being viewed as a response to remarks by  former Attorney General Diego Valades Rios, who has claimed that  whenever PJF agents are discharged it is because they have drug  abuse problems or are connected with drug traffickers. The PGR  [Attorney General's Office], meanwhile, indicated that the  measures correspond to the need to have a single command in the  PJF.    Regarding the dismantling of the so-called "special groups,"  the PGR said this action was prompted by "special group"  investigations that fell outside the Judicial Police General  Directorate's jurisdiction and proved detrimental to citizens.    Commenting on the elimination of the General Operations  Coordinating Office, which violated PGR regulations, was  allegedly conducting investigations and had command over the PJF  agents. [sentence as published] In light of this, Commanders  Juventino Sanchez Gaytan, Agustin Montiel Lopez, Saul  Salvatierra Garcia, Carlos Venegas Contreras, and Luis Alberto  Zetina Suarez were discharged.    Meanwhile, Attorney General Benitez Trevino has also ordered  a rigorous review of the condition and status of the  approximately 2,000 PJF agents nationwide and evaluations of  their individual performances in an effort to detect "bad"  agents. If this review turns up evidence of any agent being  involved in irregularities or illegal actions, appropriate  administrative measures will be adopted and legal action will be  taken.    A review of personnel will also be conducted to detect  "reliable" or "commissoned" individuals, who are also known as  "godmothers" -- people who do not belong to the PJF but perform  actions in support of the police corps. Those who have usurped  powers, as well as the commanders and agents who have helped  them do so, will be prosecuted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in the Bundestag in </F> Bonn -- live]    [Text] Dear colleagues, the NATO summit was a success and  it is pleasing to know that this has been acknowledged by the  whole Bundestag, including the opposition.    As the defense minister, I wish to say I was very happy with  the debate and the fact that all speakers, colleagues from the  government, colleagues from the parliamentary groups of the  governing parties, and Klose as the chairman of the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] parliamentary group, have acknowledged  the importance of the Bundeswehr -- positive, strong and good  words about the Bundeswehr. This encourages me; not that we  will receive large amounts of funding -- I am not asking for  that -- but sufficient funds to implement those things that have  received general support here. There is still some work to be  done in this respect.    The NATO summit...[pauses] I really think this is good; it  is  good for the Bundeswehr and, incidentally, it is in line with  the international security policy situation. What has been said  here is correct, in that all of us together must find the  strength to implement this, because with words alone I cannot  finance a single soldier and I cannot train a single Bundeswehr  unit.    The summit was a success because it supplied answers to the  three decisive tasks we are facing.    First, NATO makes no concessions regarding its ability of  collective defense. This is also urgently necessary because the  security situation in Europe is far from stable. Besides  defense of the alliance, NATO also sees the ability to  participate in international crisis management as its new core  task, which it will resolutely develop further. It is good and  correct that the alliance has decided to adapt its armed forces  and command structures in order to enable them to fulfil the new  tasks. And, Hans-Ulrich Klose, Germany must fully participate  in NATO's old and the new tasks in case it jeopardizes NATO's  ability to act. This is decisive for the debate here in Germany.    Second, reform of NATO and European integration are brought  in line with each other. The United States has made its peace  with the equal partnership of a united Europe within the  alliance. For this, Europe must become strategically able to  act. This would ease the burden for America and create the  preconditions for a permanent American commitment in and to  Europe as affirmed impressively by the American President. This  is especially remarkable when one remembers the past controversy  over the Eurocorps. There was also a heated debate about this  in Germany.    There is a great degree of harmony within the alliance  concerning its significance as part of NATO and the Western  European Union [WEU]. The WEU is being strengthened as the  European pillar of the alliance. It will in future be able to  rely on the structures and strengths of NATO. However, the  alliance will remain the decisive consultative forum on security  issues in Europe. In the end, it is NATO that decides whether  it is the alliance or the WEU which acts. That is the political  price for the WEU being able to use NATO's capacity, that Europe  is able to act in terms of security and defense policy and that  we avoid the creation of dual structures.    Despite my gratification at the SPD support for the policy  of  eastward expansion, I have to say that when we discuss the WEU  and the creation of a European security and defense identity,  Mr. Klose, the SPD's position remains self-contradictory. You  say the WEU represents a militarization of Europe. There is no  question that the WEU will always act on the basis of the UN  Charter, but it is a fact that Europe will be able to act  militarily only if Germany is fully involved in these tasks, and  this is a question which addresses the responsibility of the  Social Democrats. No one can take responsibility for Germany by  continuing with its previous position, making the WEU, and thus  Europe itself, unable to act.    Third, NATO has made the stabilization of eastern Europe a  joint objective of the highest priority. To this end we need a  convincing overall plan of integration and deeper cooperation.  I think this enables us to meet the justified expectations of  our neighbors. At the same time, we have to develop a  partnership of a special quality with Ukraine, and above all  with Russia.    Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step toward  bringing new partners nearer to Western security institutions.  It is not a substitute for opening up the alliance, and what  was said in Brussels was only achieved after months of effort.  It was not planned that way at the outset; in fact, to begin  with it was seen as being more of a substitute for membership,  and I think we should be happy that this is now the alliance's  policy. Just as the chancellor said during his speech to the  NATO Council, we are offering all of these countries a  Partnership for Peace and at the same time are opening up the  prospect of joining NATO. This is a basis on which we can act.  [applause].    I supported this plan for months; I am glad that we  achieved this result, and German policy as a whole made a very  good contribution to this, as did what came from the  parliamentary groups, from almost all the parliamentary groups  in this House. I am firmly convinced that only in this way will  the alliance remain viable, and only in this way can we fulfill  the task of establishing security in and for Europe. Stability  for peace is no empty formula; that is a great mistake -- rather  it is a practical, urgent program, and before the end of this  year. There will be no discrimination; everyone can  participate, but of course we will differentiate -- we will  begin concrete cooperation, concrete measures. These include  joint training and exercises, joint planning for peace missions  and specific support in the planning of military structures that  make NATO membership possible in the first place.    I think that so far we have done a great deal. We have  concluded with all of our eastern neighbors some military  cooperation agreements that we have fleshed out and that we must  further fulfill, with the aim of bringing our eastern neighbors  closer to western security institutions. The opening of the  alliance to our immediate neighbors in the East is in our vital  interest. I have always taken the view that one doesn't have to  be a strategic genius to grasp that. I have occasionally been  surprised how little we worked from a clear analysis of German  interests. The frontier of stability and security: unstable to  the East of our border, stable on this side. Prosperity on this  side, poverty on the other -- that cannot turn out well in the  long run, and so Germany's eastern frontier should not remain  for long the furthest frontier of NATO and the European Union  [EU]. Either we export stability or we will import instability,  and nobody formulated it earlier or better than Hans-Dietrich  Genscher, who said things will not go well for us in the long  run if they go badly for our eastern neighbors in the long run.  [applause]    For this reason German interests at least are crystal clear,  and since we cannot achieve them alone, we must create something  like a European solidarity pact. That means that the funds  which hitherto have flowed from North to South must now go more  from West to East. And there is quite a lot of egoism, also  among the southern democracies, whom we helped immediately in  the stabilization of their democracries. The south of Europe is  also the West, and in comparison with the East they are rich.  For this reason German policy must push this process forward.  This is not a provocation aimed at anyone. There has been an  artificial division of Europe here, and if NATO opens, if the EU  opens, then the Europe which belonged together for centuries  will grow together again. That is no provocation at all.    I wish that some people would accept certain contributions  to  the debate less defensively and not try to give us a bad  conscience. The area of stability in Europe is spreading and  does not constitute a provocation toward anyone. In addition it  is clear that future EU members can be no less secure than the  present members, such as ourselves, who already belong to NATO.    It is therefore clear that German interests, vital German  interests, coincide with the expectations and legitimate  security interests of our neighbors, the Poles, Hungarians,  Czechs, Slovaks and others, who want nothing less than to belong  to the family of European democracies once again. If there is  one thing that has bothered me during the debate, which has  lasted over a year now, then it has been the contributions of  those who occasionally said with the coldness of iceskating  judges: Let's watch these new democracies for a few more years  to see if they really qualify for membership, to see whether  democracy is really stable enough, the odd election didn't go  too well. I don't know if they always go so well here -- and:  We don't know what economic developments will be in Poland. I  have to tell you that this is an unbelievable attitude, and we  ought to remember our own German postwar history.    I am firmly convinced that the stabilization of democracy in  postwar Germany, the stabilization of our economy, can be put  down to ourselves only by half at the most; the rest was based  on our early membership of the western alliances, the EU and  NATO. And for this reason we Germans should never  forget...[indistinct interruption] Yes, of course, the Marshall  Plan, that as well, of course, and for this reason Germany as  well as others have to contribute to a European solidarity pact,  and I repeat that those who comment with the coldness of  iceskating judges and observe how well democracy is developing  in Poland or Hungary and how painstakingly the market economy is  being implemented there -- without the adjective as far as  possible -- and then say: Let's see if they qualify for the  alliance and the EU -- these people are committing an historic  mistake and it is one we cannot afford to make. [applause]    There is wide-ranging support among the German public for  this policy. Germans feel and know that we cannot under any  circumstances pursue a policy which would have to make a choice  between Warsaw and Moscow. Some things that have been said in  the debate have occasionally bothered me. We would have made a  huge mistake if we had allowed such an alternative to be imposed  upon us; there is no need for this, it would do no good, neither  the need for close, friendly relations between Germany and  Russia, nor our desire to develop a relationship with our  eastern neighbors which is every bit as close as that with our  western neighbors.    Stability in Europe, as we all know, and this has clearly  emerged during the debate, can only be achieved with and not  against Russia, but the space between Germany and Russia should  not be forgotten. I think the key elements -- integration and  cooperation -- are now in the right balance. This is an  irreversible process which the NATO summit has set in train, and  NATO has therefore assumed a leading role in the stability of  the whole of Europe.    Germany must be in a position, as I have just said, to  participate in fulfilling all NATO's old and new tasks  appropriately. Our partners in the East and West have great  expectations for a responsible German policy, which acts  resolutely and prudently. The security situation -- and I think  we all agreed on this, government and opposition -- at the start  of the New Year is confused.    It was necessary and correct for NATO to affirm its  willingness to make sure that humanitarian aid reaches Sarajevo  and the other threatened areas, if necessary using military  force. Bosnia shows that we are far from having reached the  level of stability that the new Europe needs for its emergence.    Some only realized, because of someone like Zhirinovskiy,  that the political revolution in Europe is not yet complete. It  was at its peak in 1989, but it has not yet come to its end. If  one compares it to an earthquake there is no question at all,  the lava has neither cooled nor has it stopped flowing. There  are not only radical forces who are, for instance, questioning  the independence of Ukraine. Therefore it is important that we  handle this still difficult security situation in Europe, which  has not yet become a completed chapter of history, with extreme  care.    Germany, as the core country of the EU, bears special  responsibility in this respect. We must give the right signals,  we must contribute to enabling Europe to act militarily. I  think that some people underestimate this, those who see the  Bundeswehr, above all, with regard to Germany. We have to see  it at least as our contribution to European defense. Without an  appropriate German contribution we jeopardize European defense  as a whole.    It is conceivable that Europe will find itself in a  situation  where it has to manage crises and conflicts by itself. This is  no longer the postwar period when we could pass everything on to  be shouldered by the Americans. This became clear at the  summit. This is a chance to develop our own identity, and to  take on a much greater responsibility, and we must make  appropriate arrangements for this. Without a substantial German  contribution there will be no common European security and  defense policy.    Our responsibility regarding security policy decisions goes  far beyond the 80 million Germans. Therefore what we do is  being carefully watched. In this situation the quality and  quantity of Germany's security precautions must not be made  dependent on financial considerations alone. This has become  evident here too. I have put it as follows: No one would cancel  their fire insurance because there has not been a fire for a  long time. This prudence of the ordinary people who look after  their home should be applied by us also with regard to our home,  Germany, and the European home.    The Bundeswehr largely determines our ability to be part of  an alliance. It is an important factor of European stability,  and this must remain so.    Thank you very much.</p>

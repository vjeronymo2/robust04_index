			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : FACE BEHIND A MERMAID  </P> <P> "On Monday, I feel like I've been hit by a truck," says Jodi Benson, who's  putting in an eight-performance week playing a feisty fashion  illustrator-turned-Communist organizer in Kander and Ebb's period musical  "Flora, the Red Menace" at the Pasadena Playhouse. "I'm on stage the whole  time, running around, using up energy. So on Monday, I sleep in and try not to  talk to anybody."  </P> <P> That's not easy for someone who's gotten famous for her voice -- playing the  title role in last year's popular animated film, "The Little Mermaid." Recalls  the Illinois native, "I thought I would just go in and sing on it; no big deal.  It wasn't till I started talking at schools and mental facilities that I  realized the impact this film was having on people. All those 10-year-olds  think I'm her! That's a big responsibility to live up to."  </P> <P> It's also a possible career pigeonhole.  </P> <P> "I started out as an actress, then found I could make money as a singer -- so I  moved to New York," says Benson (whose Broadway credits include "Smile,"  "Marilyn: An American Fable" and "Welcome to the Club"). "Because of 'Mermaid,'  people see me as a vocalist. So we're working on that. I've been auditioning  for not-singing stuff, mostly pilots. It's a good time to be out here,  introduce the face behind the voice."  </P> <P> Although she's toured all over the country -- plus a trek to Italy in "West  Side Story" -- Benson is happy to settle down in Los Angeles ("I always wanted  to live here, but I wanted to come out with a job"), and will be even happier  when her actor-husband Ray arrives from New York. As for career, "Let's face  it," she says with a sigh. "To my family in Illinois, Broadway doesn't mean  anything. To them, I won't have made it till my face is on TV." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

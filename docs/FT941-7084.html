			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Visible trade deficit with non-EU countries widens The visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened to Pounds 758m in January, from Pounds 671m in December. Imports rose 2.4 per cent over the month to reach a record Pounds 5.88bn. Exports increased 1 per cent to Pounds 5.12bn. Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that the trend in the volume of British trade is deteriorating, but this is being disguised by an increase in export prices. The so-called 'terms of trade', the balance between export and import prices, reached a record of 114 in January (1990=100). In the three months to January export prices were 2.5 per cent higher than in the previous three months. Import prices were unchanged. The CSO estimates that, in value terms, the trend in non-EU trade has been for both exports and imports to rise by  1/2 per cent a month. In volume terms, however, exports are rising by  1/2 per cent a month and imports by 1 per cent. In the three months to January export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, have fallen  1/2 per cent from the previous three months. Import volumes have risen 3 1/2 per cent. This has been partly caused by an unusually high export total in October. Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS, said: 'Without the support of improving terms of trade the prospects for the trade deficit in 1994 are bleak.' The main falls in exports in recent months have been in semi-manufactures and in food. Basic materials and semi-manufactures have been the main categories where imports have risen sharply. If oil and erratic items - such as precious stones and ships - are excluded, the deficit in January was Pounds 572m, compared with Pounds 478m in December. Trade figures for non-EU countries are recorded separately from trade with countries in the union. Figures for the latter use the new Intrastat system based on value added tax returns and are reported later.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EU COUNTRIES        Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (poundsm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Ex oil and erratics*              Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance 1992          46,682    56,431    -9,749    40,624    48,097    -7,473 1993          57,407    66,919    -9,512    49,910    57,530    -7,620 1993 Q1       13,572    16,652    -3,080    11,697    13,958    -2,261      Q2       14,144    16,305    -2,161    12,048    14,024    -1,976      Q3       14,505    17,002    -2,497    12,635    14,497    -1,862      Q4       15,186    16,960    -1,774    13,530    15,051    -1,521 August         4,859     5,600      -741     4,236     4,739      -503 September      4,819     5,757      -938     4,215     4,884      -669 October        5,257     5,619      -362     4,667     5,033      -366 November       4,863     5,604      -741     4,328     5,005      -677 December       5,066     5,737      -671     4,535     5,013      -478 1994 Jan       5,117     5,875      -758     4,504     5,076      -572  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.

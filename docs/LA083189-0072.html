			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> EAST VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Grant  </P> <P> COACH: Bill Foster, 5th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-6; 3rd place in league, 2-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Grant has been tabbed by coaches as a team to watch. One good  reason is the return of senior tailback Shawn Booker (5-11, 165). Booker ran  for 662 yards and a 5.4-yard average last season and should carry much of the  offensive load. Booker has an experienced and talented line in front of him,  led by senior Nick Avila (6-3 1/2, 265), a three-year varsity player at tackle.  Tight end Anthony Melton (6-0, 235), a converted defensive tackle, should also  have a big year, according to Foster. Joining that pair on the line are  returners Seung Rho (6-2, 190), a guard, Miguel Gonzalez (6-1, 210), a junior  center, and tackle Mark Segal (6-1, 225). At quarterback, Foster has two  candidates: senior Andy Wells (5-9, 150) and senior Marlowe Lewis (5-10, 165).  Foster would prefer Wells to win the job to free up Lewis, one of the team's  best athletes, to play slotback and receiver. Foster also is overseeing a  battle for the fullback slot between senior Geerson Martinez (5-7, 185) and  Tony Johnson (5-10, 175). The defense reads like the offensive roster, with  standouts being Booker and Lewis at cornerback, Avila on defensive line and  Gonzalez at linebacker. Foster is looking for a big year out of senior safety  Josh Kesselman (5-10, 150).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "The team I'm really watching for is Grant," said the coach of the  league favorite, Sylmar's Jeff Engilman. "They could sneak up." Foster shares  the enthusiasm of his rival. "If we play as a team, and play fundamentally  sound," Foster said, "We have a good chance to be successful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P> <P> COACH: Fred Grimes, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-6; 2nd in league, 4-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The offensive-backfield situation is a bit jumbled for  Grimes, but one thing is certain: Senior Mike Lewis (5-11, 175) will be there  somewhere. Lewis, a first-team all-league selection at safety last year, will  be looked at as a tailback and a quarterback. "Without a doubt, he's our best  athlete," Grimes said. Senior Rob Wylie is also being considered for the  position but Grimes, for all practical purposes, is heading into practice  without a passer. So the Huskies will run the ball. Senior Gill Kalantirski, a  starting defensive back, likely will join Lewis in the backfield at fullback or  tailback. The rest of the Huskies are inexperienced. Seventeen players will  return for their junior season, one of whom is John Gawronski (6-3, 205), an  offensive tackle and outside linebacker. Grimes' most experienced lineman is  Kyu Lee (5-11, 225), who will play offensive guard and nose tackle. Two more  juniors will be lining up at wide receiver for the Huskies: speedy Leon Gable  (5-9, 155) and promising Louis Barragan (5-9, 155). But as Grimes says, the  Huskies will only throw "when we have to." On defense, Grimes speaks highly of  Gable and Lewis in the secondary and senior Keyin Hayes (6-2, 235) on the line.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Grimes is entering the season with his fingers crossed. "I don't know  if we can beat anybody," he joked. More seriously, "It depends on how these  11th-graders come through," he said. "If we stay healthy and keep our heads  screwed on, we could be OK. If we lose one or two key kids, we could hang it  up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poly  </P> <P> COACH: Fred Cuccia, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 2-8; 4th in league, 0-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Poly enters the season in a different state than most other  City teams: Coach Kevin Kennedy resigned in mid-August, leaving the program  without a coach. Fred Cuccia was hired Aug. 23 and met with the players for the  first time that night. It is likely that the first player he met was junior  Jonathon Campbell (5-10, 175), an all-league performer at safety last season  who has "blue-chip potential" at running back, according to Kennedy. Campbell  has a talented backfield mate in senior running back Daruth Thomas (6-2, 190),  who was ineligible last season. Campbell and Thomas should carry a load, too,  since Kennedy said he had no candidates for quarterback. When Cuccia does find  one, he can try to utilize wide receivers Eddie Guerrero, a second-team  all-league performer, and Carlos Guerra. A green offensive line will be  anchored by senior John Rosenthal (6-0, 210) who has trimmed down from 230  pounds with some work in the weight room. Also spending time in the weight room  was defensive lineman Charlie Lemos (5-11, 220), who likely will play both  ways. The linebacking corps will feature Brian Butterfield (5-8, 160), whom  Kennedy called "small, real quick and smart."  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: When Cuccia took over the floundering program he didn't even know the  team's schedule. But that doesn't alter his optimism, even though he has a team  that went winless in league play last year. "Hey, we're going to be there," he  said. "We're going to be aggressive and well-conditioned."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sylmar  </P> <P> COACH: Jeff Engilman, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 7-4; 1st in league, 5-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Listed as the ninth-best running back in the nation by Super  Prep magazine, tailback Jerome Casey is one strong reason why Sylmar should  waltz to another league title. And strong is the operative word. "He's my first  legit 400-pound bench presser," Engilman said. Add a 6-foot, 185-pound frame  and breakaway speed (10.7 in the 100) to that strength and you have one of the  City Section's best backs. Just who will hand Casey the ball is another matter.  Engilman is studying two candidates at quarterback: junior Danny Terry (5-10,  160) and sophomore Toby Brookens (6-0, 155). Both are good running  quarterbacks, but Engilman said that Terry may have the edge coming into  practice. Meanwhile, a stellar Sylmar receiving corps may be making some news  of its own. Tight end London Woodfin (6-3, 225) will team with wide receivers  Stacy Lyons, Joseph Vaughn, Giramar Johnson and Harold Augustus. Lyons (5-10,  160), a senior being recruited by Division I colleges, runs a 4.4 40, according  to Engilman, and Vaughn (6-1, 175) is a "great possession receiver." Johnson  and Augustus are both juniors. A good offensive line, anchored by senior James  Jackson (6-1, 270), and junior Ken Green (6-2, 225), is still a question mark  because of its inexperience. On defense, Sylmar's strength lies in its  secondary, featuring Casey, a standout safety, and Lyons and Vaughn as solid  cornerbacks. Woodfin, a Division I prospect, should be a force at linebacker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "I hate to put a thing on us," Engilman said, "but I'd say in the  league we're the favorites." Don't believe him? Fred Grimes, coach of league  rival North Hollywood, is a Spartan believer, too. "In our league, it's gotta  be Sylmar," he said.  </P></p>

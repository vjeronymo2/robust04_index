A senior government official from the Guangxi Autonomous  Region told this newspaper that the explosion took place at 8:35  yesterday morning in the rain shelter outside Nanning Railway  Station, and that the man involved was Liu Yong, a 44-year old  native of Jiangsu. He wanted to buy a ticket to return to  Jiangsu that day but failed to get one and thus became  depressed. With the very crowded conditions of Nanning Railway  Station, he became very annoyed, subsequently "lost control of  his faculties," and ignited a grenade which he had been carrying  with him, injuring 23 individuals and himself.    A witness on the scene, Wei Yanhua, a cleaning woman working  for the train station, was quoted as saying that, before the  explosion, she saw Liu Yong take a rusty grenade out of his  brown bag and begin to play with it, and she approached him to  ask him to stop. Liu Yong said that it was only a toy and would  not explode. As Wei Yanhua was on her way to report the case to  the police, the grenade exploded.    According to the Nanning police, they still have no idea as  to where Liu Yong got the grenade. Liu Yong himself was hurt  rather seriously but all the others suffered only minor or  slight injuries.    Nanning police said that Liu Yong was a "person who had  sneaked in from outside," who "might suffered from mental  illness."    The senior official from the Guangxi Autonomous Region  Government said that, after the incident took place, the Liuzhou  Railway Station Public Security Department and the relevant  departments of Guangxi Region and Nanning City have already  strengthened the measures to divert passengers in the big  railway stations such as Nanning and Liuzhou. At present,  Liuzhou and Nanning Railway Stations are very crowded. These  railways are the only travel option for the "Sichuan army,"  "Guizhou army," and "Yunnan army" as they flock to Guangdong and  Guangxi to "work."    More than 10,000 passengers currently depart from Nanning  Railway Station every day. In addition, the regional  transportation department organizes buses to help divert the  passengers.    The senior official said that, since the spring festival,  passenger trains coming in and out of Guangxi have been  seriously overloaded. A great number of workers have traveled a  great distance, and compartments which according to the  regulations can only accommodate 200 people have often squeezed  in 500-600. This has made the air inside the compartment very  dirty, to the extent that some passengers have became distraught  and some have even jumped out of the train in order to breathe.  (According to statistics, from 1 to 6 February, 19 passengers in  Guangxi became distraught, three passengers died, one passenger  was injured, and five passengers disappeared. It is believed  that the number of passengers who became distraught at other  times but failed to be counted would exceed this number.)    This leading official also said that they have heard nothing  about the tragedy in Hunan's Hengyang Railway Station, in which  people were trampled to death on the sixth day of the Lunar New  Year, and that they have not received any circulars from the  relevant quarter.</p>

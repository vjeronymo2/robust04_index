			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> WRIGHT CASE LAWYER MAY PROBE GINGRICH  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee said it plans to hire the Chicago law firm that  conducted the Jim Wright investigation to review a complaint against Republican  Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Gingrich's charges against Wright led to an  11-month investigation conducted by Richard J. Phelan, of the firm Phelan, Pope  &amp; John Ltd. Wright quit as Speaker and resigned from the House after the  committee charged him with 69 rules violations. Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.)  accused Gingrich, who arranged a controversial investment partnership to  promote a book he co-authored, in a complaint last April of violating campaign  finance laws, House limits on outside income and a House rule preventing  acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in legislation. Gingrich  has called Alexander's charges "baseless." A member of the law firm said Phelan  would be the lead attorney if the House Administration Committee approves a  contract.  </P></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Keys to an ecological crisis - Quick action is needed to halt the destruction of large areas of the Florida Bay James Humble, a farmer near Miami, Florida, is feeling put upon these days. In common with other farmers in the area, Humble is still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Andrew last year. Now, to make matters worse, the tomato grower is facing tentative plans by the US government to buy out his land at what he says are sure to be unfair prices. 'They say we're killing the fish in the Florida Bay,' says Humble. 'Maybe someone made the wrong decision to let us be here in the first place, but now it's too late. This is our land, and they shouldn't have the right to kick us out.' Michael Collins, a boat owner who charters sport fishing trips around the Florida Keys, a long strip of islands stretching south of Miami almost to Cuba, also has a crisis on his hands. He says that he is battling a salt-water algae bloom, 70 miles long and 30 miles deep, caused by the mismanagement of water resources upstream. The ecological destruction of large areas of the Florida Bay, located at the southern tip of the state, has triggered a bitter dispute between farmers and fishermen in the area. As farmers near Miami siphon canal water for flood control and irrigation, the flow of fresh water into the Florida Bay near the Keys is stemmed, upsetting the delicate balance of salt and fresh water in the area and killing marine life. Recently, scientists say, the environmental damage quickened as a handful of farmers around the Frog Pond, which provides water to the Taylor Slough riverway, a key source of water flow for the Everglades, began to siphon water for added flood control of their fields. 'This is an ecosystem on the verge of collapse,' says Collins. 'I've seen millions of dead fish here. In the Keys, every industry we have, from tourism to fishing, depends on clean water. Without it, none of us will have jobs.' The water that eventually reaches the Florida Bay starts around Orlando, and flows south through agricultural lands and the swamps of the Everglades National Park before reaching its final destination. Over the past few years, the shrinking volume of fresh water reaching the bay has caused significant amounts of sea grass to die, creating an algae bloom which in turn has caused fish to die in catastrophic numbers. 'We have known about this problem for at least 20 years, and I feel the crisis might have been prevented if action had been taken earlier,' says Glenn Kinser, a scientist with the National Fish &amp; Wildlife Foundation in Washington, DC. Both the federal and state governments say they are doing their best to address the problem. A joint task force has been formed to study options, which include the forced purchase of farmers' lands in the area. But farmers around the Frog Pond are angry because any government buy-out would probably treat the land as flood-prone, rather than flood-controlled, an assessment which would substantially lower its market value. Negotiations are moving slowly. 'With so many factors to consider, this is not a terribly fast process,' says John Ogden, a wildlife biologist with the Everglades National Park. 'It's not only a problem with the farmers but with the situation of the canals. We'll have to tear out some old ones and put in new ones, and that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars.' The longer it takes to address the situation, say fishermen, the slimmer the chances that the area will recover soon enough to prevent economic devastation in the region. According to the fishing industry, shrimp catches have already fallen by 90 per cent over the last few years, and crab and lobster hauls are down substantially. Even more frightening to environmentalists, hot saline water has been detected beyond the Florida Keys in the ecologically sensitive coral reefs, one of the largest in the world. 'The coral reef ecosystem is extremely sensitive and is already threatened by scuba divers and other problems,' says Thomas Bancroft, a scientist with the National Audubon Society. 'We must keep that system protected.' The problem, say scientists studying the area, began shortly after the second world war, when state and federal agencies began to install drainage canals in southern Florida. Today, there are 1,400 miles of drainage canals, diverting 970bn gallons of water a year. The canals made way for large-scale development, allowing suburban sprawl to spread further south from Miami and pushing farmers closer to the environmentally sensitive Everglades. 'This area is suffering from 40 years of water deprivation,' says Joseph Zieman, a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia and a specialist in the Florida Bay problem. To make matters worse, the Everglades are also under threat from pesticide pollution created by sugar farmers even further upstream. Sugar-growers and state and government officials have tentatively agreed to a plan to reduce fertiliser runoff. However, details of the proposal are still being worked out. The crisis in the Florida Bay is particularly shocking to many because it took place in an area that was thought to be protected as parkland. 'Many people assumed that by setting up national parks and protecting everything within their boundaries, our wilderness areas were safe,' says Ogden. 'But in a park like the Everglades - or almost any national park in the US for that matter - water flows and air flows coming from outside the park impact us directly. We need to reassess park management and go outside our boundaries to resolve environmental problems. This means more involvement with regional planning, for instance.' No one knows how long it will take to reverse the environmental devastation in the Florida Bay. Even if the source of the problems is eliminated immediately, many ecologists feel it will be many years before any visible recovery sets in. For those inhabitants of the Keys, who depend on fishing and tourism to make a living, that will be too late.</p>

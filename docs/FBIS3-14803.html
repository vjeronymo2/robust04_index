In its statement published Saturday evening the party  qualifies the resolution on granting amnesty to those who  "instigated and joined" the events of August 19-21, 1991, May 1  and September 21-October 4, 1993 as "another victory won by the  anti-reformist forces and disregard for the norms of morality  and law". According to the document, connivance at these forces  was what inspired them to stage their revolt in August of 1991,  which led to frustrating the plans to sign a union treaty,  breaking up the USSR and exposing the nation to severe  hardships. "Unfortunately, as a result of political  near-sightedness, the Russian leadership continued Gorbachev's  policy of conciliation with the reactionary forces," the  document states.    According to its authors, the State Duma resolution, "which  is allegedly aimed at reaching conciliation and national  concord, is in fact an attempt to legitimize lawlessness,  anarchy and the use of force in political strife".    The Russian People's Party expressed concern over the fact  that the encouragement of those who organized and perpetrated  "monstrous crimes" may lead to another coup "aimed at curbing  democratic reforms and unleashing a civil war".</p>

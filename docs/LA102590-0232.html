			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA OKS SCALED-DOWN OFFICE PROJECT;  </P> <P> GROWTH: DEVELOPERS SAID IT COULDN'T GET A FAIR HEARING SO CLOSE TO ELECTION  DAY. THE VOTE IS SEEN AS A TEST OF COUNCIL'S STANCE ON DEVELOPMENT.  </P> <P> In a highly contentious hearing that put the Santa Monica City Council's  development policies on the spot less than two weeks before the city election,  the council early Wednesday scaled down a controversial five-story office  project planned for the 2300 block of Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> The compromise decision reduced the size of the structure from a proposed  101,000 square feet to about 85,000 square feet. It gave neighbors opposed to  the project part of the substantial size reduction they sought, but it avoided  shooting down two years of work by the the developer, HSM Group/Kennedy-Wilson  Realty.  </P> <P> After six hours of public comment and debate that extended Tuesday night's  council meeting into the wee hours, the council voted 4 to 1 to scale down the  project, whose principal tenant is to be Kennedy-Wilson, a real estate auction  house. Councilman Ken Genser voted against the project because he said he  wanted it reduced even more.  </P> <P> The absence of Councilwoman Christine C. Reed during the hearing appeared to  underscore the view expressed by some council members that the battle was a  political one. Reed, the only incumbent seeking reelection Nov. 6, said earlier  this month that she would abstain from voting on the project because she lives  three blocks from it.  </P> <P> Reed said such proximity could affect the value of her home, but some of her  neighbors and several council members contended that Reed was abstaining in  order to avoid casting a pro-development vote shortly before the election.  </P> <P> Also abstaining was Councilman William H. Jennings, who lives a block away from  the project.  </P> <P> The approval of the project was disappointing to two community groups, Mid-City  Neighbors and Save Our Neighborhood, who appealed the city Planning  Commission's approval of the project in August on the grounds that the project  should be bound by new, stricter zoning laws.  </P> <P> "The council still does not listen to what residents want or need," Kelly  Olsen, a spokesman for Mid-City Neighbors and a candidate for the City Council,  said after the meeting.  </P> <P> HSM Group/Kennedy-Wilson Realty representatives were not pleased either. They  argued that the project could not get a fair shake in the shadow of the Nov. 6  election, in which three council seats are being contested and development is a  major issue.  </P> <P> The approval gives the developer the option to build up to four stories,  provided the top floor is a "step" that fronts Wilshire. The building site is  now occupied by a carwash.  </P> <P> Residents had sought a three-story structure, arguing that a larger project  would generate too much traffic. The developers said they needed a four-story  structure to accommodate their needs for office space.  </P> <P> Olsen presented documents suggesting that the city allowed the project to move  forward in 1988 under older, more liberal development standards, and indicating  it should have been examined under the stricter rules now in effect. He said  the project's plans were required to be "deemed complete" on April 29, 1988, in  order to take advantage of the old rules. Plans for the project came in to the  city that day, but because of some missing documents, residents argued that  they were not, in fact, complete.  </P> <P> City Atty. Robert M. Myers disagreed, saying that the plans submitted by  Kennedy-Wilson were substantially complete on the date in question and that the  developer had been allowed to invest in planning the project for two years  under that presumption.  </P> <P> Christopher M. Harding, attorney for the developer, argued unsuccessfully that  the council delay its decision until after the election because he feared his  client would not get fair consideration. He noted that some opponents were  calling for the vote on this project to be a test of the council's stance on  development.  </P> <P> Council members rejected his request, noting that none of the members voting on  the matter are running next month.  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tring flotation go-ahead Tring International, the budget price compact disc company which faces legal action from other music groups, is expected to announce today that it plans to go ahead with its postponed stock market flotation. A pathfinder prospectus is expected to be published this morning. Tring expects trading in its shares to begin before the end of February. The flotation, originally planned for last month, was postponed because of what the company saw as the weakness of the new issue market. Mr Alan Wheatley, the former chairman of venture capital group 3i, who had agreed to become Tring's chairman, has withdrawn. Instead, the chairman is expected to be Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram International, the music group. Tring faces legal action from other music groups, including MCA and PolyGram, alleging that the company has breached their copyright. Last week, Tring agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music to settle two copyright actions. The two actions concerned recordings by Olivia Newton-John and of Puccini's La Boheme. The Tring pathfinder prospectus is expected to say that the outstanding legal actions will have no material impact on its profits, which are expected to be Pounds 5.1m for the year to March 31 1994.</p>

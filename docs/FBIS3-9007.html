			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Aleksander </F> Geryn; place and date not given;from the "Balance --  Governmental Magazine" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pawlak] The agreement with  the London Club finalizes the main process of restructuring the  Polish foreign debt. On the one hand, it has a very practical  aspect pertaining to a reduction of the indebtedness level; on  the other hand, a very important aspect is the adoption of a  timeframe for repayments in a way that would take into account  the realistic capabilities of our state budget which is the  result of the economic and budget situations. It is worth  stressing here that a rescheduling of repayments to the London  Club is advantageous also from the standpoint of the timeframe  adopted by the Paris Club. Thanks to the agreement with the  Paris Club....[Pawlak pauses] One must stress that recently, the  London Club agreement was negotiated by Dresdner Bank, and the  role of the Germans in leading up to the successful finalization  of the talks is worth stressing here. On our part -- over the  last six months -- we undertook various initiatives, both on the  official level and in informal contacts, to lead to a successful  completion of the agreement in question. The agreement -- while  finalizing the process of restructuring the foreign debt --  sends a very clear message indeed, that Poland is a stable  country which meets its obligations, and that is one of the  determining factors when it comes to possibilities for  cooperation, including major capital investments. [passage  omitted]    [Geryn] In January, there was the Prague meeting, in  February -- the Brussels summit, and in March -- the Moscow  meeting. In Prague, you talked about Partnership for  Development. Is the Moscow visit a first step -- as it were --  on the way to implementing this proposal of yours?    [Pawlak] The visit to Prague was actually the first step,  since we want to see Partnership for Development as a process  that primarily makes our region dynamic -- I mean the countries  of Central Europe -- and during the Prague talks with the prime  ministers, we talked about several specific types of measures  that could possibly contribute to making cooperation among the  governments more dynamic. These talks pertained to a speeding  up of the implementation of measures regarding a free-trade zone  in Central Europe which encompasses Poland, the Czech and Slovak  Republic, and Hungary. That was the first step. During the  Brussels talks, we also made it clear that what we need is  partnership-like and balanced cooperation. The most recent  visit -- that is the one to Moscow -- constitutes a completion  of the process. The point is to stress the fact that Polish  foreign policy should be targeted in many directions, and it  should be open to those partners who want to cooperate with us  on a very practical basis. [passage omitted]    There is no easy way out of this, especially since right  now, after a few years have passed, it is very hard to find the  right conversion currency or to settle these transactions, and  it is really not that clear at all who would gain more out of it  given zero options. So what we wanted to do, was to concentrate  on setting routine cooperation in motion. If cooperation  develops dynamically and if we manage to sign agreements on  contracts for delivery of strategic raw materials for many years  to come, and if we adopt a trade protocol for 1994, then the  results of these measures will make it possible to solve the  problems of the past and of mutual debts more easily and more  efficiently. These factors can definitely contribute to making  cooperation more dynamic. Apart from that, we also talked about  an infrastructure for cooperation and development broadly  speaking -- beginning with cooperation among banks to make  settling accounts easier, to enable companies to get in touch  with one another faster, and to make economic exchange safer.  Another element is the construction of a pipeline to make use  of the potential resources of our economies, as well as  construction of a highway and a railway that would connect  Berlin with Warsaw, Minsk, and Moscow. Those are the factors  that the government can influence, and these possibilities will  later be implemented by specific companies and people. That is  also the general scheme of looking for measures that would  constitute the Partnership for Development.    [Geryn] Mr. Prime Minister, you talked to your counterpart,  that is Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and the conversation was  quite long, outside of the binding protocol. What is your  assessment of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin?    [Pawlak] I think what is very important is the practical  approach to various issues. A very interesting conclusion from  the conversations is that one can clearly see that the time we  have wasted cannot be made up now or redeemed with any kind of  money. And now, what is important is that when it comes to the  practical side, one must move very clearly ahead, even if these  are small steps. During the talks, we debated some principles  of cooperation, then during plenary talks we agreed on specific  measures and a timeframe for their implementation. During the  talks, we came to a mutual conclusion that a visit by Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin to Poland may take place in May, which may  constitute the next stage in the practical implementation of  various agreements and measures both by the government  administration, and by specific companies, which would expand  cooperation. I think that to go from a high level of grand  ideologies down to the level of practical action, will  significantly improve our mutual relations to our mutual  advantage.</p>

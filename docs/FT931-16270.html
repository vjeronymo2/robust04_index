			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: TV-am places 16% stake in Metro Radio for Pounds 4m Correction (published 8th January 1993) appended to this article. TV-AM, the loss-making commercial breakfast television company, has placed its 16 per cent stake in the Newcastle-based Metro Radio Group in a deal worth some Pounds 4m. The exact price of the deal, which involved 2,77m shares, was not disclosed. Metro shares yesterday rose 8p to 158p. The sale of the shares is the latest sign that TV-am, which went off the air on December 31 before giving way to Good Morning Television, is clearing the decks for a voluntary liquidation of assets. Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, is planning to move to Australia to be chairman of Channel 9 and it was announced yesterday that Mr Statis Zographos, finance director since 1984, is to be commercial director of the ITV Network Centre. Talks are believed to be under way with the Virgin Group about selling TV-am's stake in Virgin Radio, the joint venture which will launch a national commercial pop radio station this spring. At the moment Mr Gyngell is chairman of the station which is based at Woking in Surrey. TV-am is also in talks with two potential purchasers of its studios at London's Camden Lock. Last month the company announced it was distributing Pounds 26m in surplus cash to shareholders. CORRECTION TV-am, which has lost its breakfast television franchise, was incorrectly described as a loss-making company in yesterday's edition.</p>

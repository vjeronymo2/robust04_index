			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "Army Admits Shortcomings </F> Ascertained by Supreme Inspection Office"]    [Text] The Army does not intend to call in question the  results of an inquiry by the Supreme Inspection Office [NKU],  which uncovered serious systemic shortcomings in the management  of surplus and otherwise unusable Army material. The Ministry  of Defense Press Department confirmed this to our daily.    The inquiry, which focused on the 1990-93 period,  ascertained  numerous violations of laws, decrees, and legal regulations.  The final NKU report refers to systemic shortcomings appearing,  in particular, in the years 1990-92. For example, the Army  unlawfully sold the Struzna, Kanice, and Neznasov chateaux,  which are registered as historical monuments, although it was  under an obligation to offer them to the state before selling  them.    The Ministry of Defense confirmed that the data contained in  the NKU report conforms with reality. According to the  ministry's Press Department, "the NKU officials' specific  findings cannot be called in question." The Press Department  statement notes that, after assuming office, Defense Minister  Antonin Baudys arrived at the same results, which is why he  banned all property transfers until a new system of management  with surplus property is worked out. According to the ministry,  the new system is transparent, easily verifiable, and fully in  accordance with valid laws.    All officials responsible for violations of legal norms had  without exception been recalled from their posts, according to  Ministry of Defense data. Antonin Baudys also asked the Chief  Military Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether criminal  offenses had been committed when transferring the Army's real  estate to other persons. The Chief Military Prosecutor's Office  stated, however, that the facts that have been ascertained are  not sufficient to warrant criminal proceedings. The Military  Police has therefore been charged with investigating the matter  further. The results of its efforts thus far have been negative,  however, according to the Ministry of Defense Press Department.</p>

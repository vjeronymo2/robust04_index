			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Support for Clinton grows as Democratic convention opens THE Democratic party convention opened in New York last night with Governor Bill Clinton secure in the knowledge that he is no longer last in the polls. Opinion surveys released in the previous 24 hours put him at least level with President George Bush and generally ahead of Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent presidential candidate, whose support is beginning to show signs of erosion. This is important for Mr Clinton, as he awaits the Democrats' formal nomination on Wednesday night, because of the real fear a month ago that he would come to the convention in a poor third place, thus exciting the sort of internecine warfare for which his party is notorious. The New York Times/CBS poll yesterday had Mr Bush in a narrow lead at 33 per cent, to Mr Clinton's 30 per cent and Mr Perot's 25 per cent. More significant than the bald numbers, this and other surveys report a measurable increase in Mr Clinton's personal standing over the last month. A Newsweek survey found that 38 per cent said they were now more likely to vote for him than a month ago, with 44 per cent saying that the choice of Senator Al Gore as running mate also made them more likely to support him. The Times poll found Mr Gore with a much more positive image than vice-president Dan Quayle. The Clinton-Gore ticket, therefore, has a temporary, if not overwhelming, degree of momentum, which has in turn helped suppress internal dissent. Only Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California and Mr Clinton's erstwhile primary opponent, was withholding his endorsement yesterday. The convention opened two and a half minutes late to lots of patriotic flourishes, with Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, declaring that 'New York is the start, the White House is the finish'. The formal opening night was to include speeches from prominent Democrats, including Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who used to grace Madison Square Garden, the convention venue, as a basketball player. The day had begun for Mr Clinton with a morning jog, followed separately by Mr Gore, and Mr Clinton went on to an open air 'town meeting', in which he answered questions. It looks as if he will have most of the week's headlines to himself. Mr Bush was fishing in Maine yesterday and his appearance at an all-star baseball game in California tonight is hardly a distraction. Mr Perot, meanwhile, is struggling to combat the adverse reaction to what was widely considered his patronising remarks over the weekend to the meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured Peoples. His press secretary has been forced to apologise for 'his unfortunate choice of words', in addressing his black audience as 'you people'. Clinton sets out policy 'covenant', Page 4</p>

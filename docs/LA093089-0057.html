			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: HOPING FOR CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that there's controversy just in the sense of controversy, meaning  that people talk about it, not that they're upset by it," says Kay Lenz of her  upcoming "Midnight Caller" episode. Lenz will reprise her Emmy-winning role of  Tina Cassidy, a woman who contracts the AIDS virus from an unsympathetic man.  </P> <P> You may recall the brouhaha generated almost a year ago by gay rights  organizations who were offended by the segment's original ending. That  particular script, which Lenz called "well-written . . . wonderful," dictated  that the uncaring bisexual character be killed at the end. Gay groups assailed  this plot device as cruel and unusual punishment, so the producers relented and  let him live.  </P> <P> "I'm glad that they changed it," says Lenz, whose character will be enduring  the excruciating final four days of her life. "I don't think that it was a  non-courageous act by doing that. You have to consider your viewing audience,  and the impact that television -- from 'Pee-wee's Playhouse' to '60 Minutes' --  has on the people who watch that show." The script for the show, to air  sometime next month, has been approved by those groups who were upset last fall  by the "Midnight Caller" that might have been.  </P> <P> Lenz prepared for this particularly agonizing role by sitting in with various  women's support groups up in San Francisco. These were not easy sessions, says  the former Mrs. David Cassidy.  </P> <P> "I went up a few weeks ago and it scared the hell out of me," says Lenz of the  unpleasantries of this type of research. She has played hookers, cops posing as  strippers and other diverse fare, but "this is something I cannot relate to. I  cannot relate to this situation" of these innocent women with irreversible  death sentences. DAVID PECCHIA  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Clinton team gets to grips with tax CONGRESSIONAL staff are already getting down to work on new tax measures to head the agenda facing the new Congress, which will convene next year. Economic advisers to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic president-elect, have indicated they hope to have a job creation package ready to present to Congress soon after his inauguration on January 20. But on Wednesday President George Bush, in his final tussle with the outgoing Congress, vetoed a Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.4bn) tax bill passed in October. Aides said yesterday the veto would probably speed the process of introducing tax legislation in the new Congress. The vetoed tax bill grew out of an urban aid package proposed in the wake of riots that broke out in Los Angeles at the end of April and included many measures sought by Mr Bush - among them the creation of a number of enterprise zones and the repeal of a controversial luxury tax on boats. But the Democratic majority in Congress added other measures that the president disagreed with, and which would have broken his renewed pledge not to raise taxes. They delayed sending the bill to the president to give him the opportunity to sign it after the pressure of the election was over. He passed up this opportunity, signing a veto message on the flight back to Washington the day after the election. Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House ways and means committee holds the keys to all US tax legislation, says the initiative now lies with Mr Clinton. 'He's going to have to call the tune. I'll tell him to be bold,' the veteran Illinois congressman said. High on Mr Clinton's list of priorities is a targeted investment tax credit. Influential members of Congress are likely to want to revive several of the measures included in the vetoed tax bill. The repeal of the luxury boat tax, for example, is close to the heart of Senate majority leader George Mitchell, whose home state of Maine harbours a significant boat-building industry. Another measure, to expand the tax-sheltered Individual Retirement Accounts, has been championed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who chairs the Senate finance committee. Once a tax bill is on the road, congressional tax experts say, members will use it as a vehicle to which they can attach any number of additional measures, including legislation targeting taxes paid by foreign companies in the US. The issue is a contentious one, and the Internal Revenue Service is still waiting to see what the yield will be of new legislation passed in 1989 and 1990, which imposed stiffer record-keeping and reporting requirements on foreign companies. Multinational groups can shift the balance of their profits between countries by charging higher or lower transfer prices for goods and services exchanged within the group. International rules dictate that transfer prices should be established on the 'arm's length' principle, as if the goods or services were sold to an unrelated company. For intangibles, however, an arm's length price can be difficult to establish. A number of congressmen, led by Democrat Jake Pickle of Texas and Republican Duncan Hunter of California, claim widespread abuse of transfer pricing rules has allowed foreign companies to shift billions of dollars of profits abroad, so escaping US taxation. Much of the criticism is based on 1986, when foreign companies in aggregate reported a net loss of Dollars 1.5bn, although those companies that did report profits paid aggregate taxes of Dollars 3bn. In 1988, the latest year for which full statistics are available, foreign company profits amounted to only 1.4 per cent of sales, compared with an average 3.7 per cent of sales for US companies. But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded this discrepancy 'did not prove the existence of a widespread problem'. Already, the US's efforts to squeeze more taxes out of for- eign companies have run into international criticism. Earlier this year the Treasury had to withdraw a set of proposed regulations relating to Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code, which governs transfer pricing. The fiscal affairs committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Paris-based grouping of 24 industrial nations, said in a letter to Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, that the proposed regulations 'would seriously disrupt existing international taxation arrangements, with adverse effects on the economic relations between member countries'. However, Mr Clinton's economic programme assumes that it will be possible, just from tougher enforcement of existing rules, to raise an additional Dollars 9bn from foreign corporations in 1993, rising to Dollars 13.5bn in 1996 - a total of Dollars 45bn over four years. Realistic estimates of the available extra revenue range from Dollars 166m to Dollars 1bn a year. The more extreme estimates are, for the most part, more illustrative calculations based on the arbitrary assumption that foreign corporations' profits ought to match the return on Treasury bonds. A rigorous clampdown on transfer pricing is likely to raise more money from US-based multinationals' arrangements with their overseas subsidiaries than from foreign companies operating in the US. Only about 13 per cent of the money involved in pending Section 482 cases involves foreign companies. Political realities suggest some foreign taxation measure will be added to any new tax bill. Tax lawyers working with foreign companies in Washington appear confident that the more extreme proposals will not come to pass. These include an idea floated in a discussion bill issued by Mr Rostenkowski this summer, which would tax foreign companies on the assumption that their earnings equalled at least three quarters of the average profitability of US businesses in the same sector. 'I do believe in the end the ways and means committee will recognise that there is simply not Dollars 45bn out there,' one Washington lawyer concluded.  -------------------------------------------------------      AGGREGATE FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY AND INCOME OF                  FOREIGN-OWNED COMPANIES  ------------------------------------------------------- Year            Tax         Income         Profit              liability    (Dollars bn)    margin on             (Dollars bn)                  sales (%)  ------------------------------------------------------- 1983            1.8          1.8            0.5 1984            4.5          4.5            1.0 1985            3.6          3.0            0.6 1986            3.0         -1.5           -0.3 1987            4.6          5.6            0.8 1988            5.8         11.2            1.4  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: IRS Statistics of Income  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Letter: Restrictions on access to US market to blame for breakdown of BA-USAir deal Sir, British Airways' reluctant decision to terminate its agreement to invest Dollars 750m in USAir may indeed mean that a significant opportunity has been lost to liberalise transatlantic air services, but not for the reasons put forward by Stephen Wolf (Letters, December 22). The proposals tabled by the UK government in early October show very clearly that the UK has offered to remove the restrictions on services that may be operated from any airport, including Heathrow, by airlines of both sides. The talks broke down because the US demanded immediate and unlimited access to the UK market while maintaining high protective barriers to its own market, which is 40 per cent of air transport worldwide. Had they been prepared to agree to relax their outdated restrictions on inward investment, the two countries would now be on an assured path to a fully liberal agreement. Colin Marshall, deputy chairman and chief executive, British Airways, Heathrow Airport (London), Hounslow TW6 2JA</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWHALL SIGNAL FIRES EMBATTLED EDITOR;  </P> <P> 'PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES' CITED AFTER CONTROVERSIAL SERIES  </P> <P> Chuck Cook, the editor hired a year ago to run the Newhall Signal, was fired  Tuesday because of what both sides called "philosophical differences" with the  newspaper's management following a controversial series of articles on  industrial pollution.  </P> <P> Signal General Manager Sammee Zeile said Cook, 44, would leave the newspaper  today but remain with Morris Newspapers Corp., the Signal's owner, long enough  to complete a special project on education.  </P> <P> "There were some philosophical differences about what a community newspaper  should be and about his obligations to the community," said Zeile, who  announced Cook's departure at a staff meeting Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Cook also said his dismissal was the result of "philosophical differences."  </P> <P> Community sources, who asked not to be identified, said a committee of  community leaders had asked for Cook's dismissal because of his handling of a  series of articles about the cleanup of toxic chemicals at Space Ordinance  Systems facilities in Sand and Mint canyons.  </P> <P> Zeile denied that. She said, however, that the SOS series "kind of goes along  with the philosophical differences."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Link Alleged  </P> <P> In one of the SOS articles, members of a Sand Canyon family charged that there  was a link between the contamination by the defense contractor and five deaths  in that family. Cook later wrote in an editorial that a committee monitoring  cleanup of two SOS plants was weighted "heavily in favor of the polluters and  against the health concerns of residents."  </P> <P> He wrote that it was a shame that community leaders such as Santa Clarita Mayor  Pro Tem Jo Anne Darcy, who also is Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike  Antonovich's field deputy, and Planning Commissioner Rita Garasi "would be part  of such a sham."  </P> <P> Darcy and Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, said that they had complained to  the paper's management about Cook's running of the newspaper but denied asking  for his dismissal.  </P> <P> "I know I complained about him," McKeon said. "I had some real problems with  this SOS story. It was overly sensationalized. . . . It was definitely  overkill. This is not what you're looking for in a small-town newspaper."  </P> <P> He called Cook's allegations against Darcy, Garasi and Mayor Jan Heidt, who  also was named in one of the paper's SOS articles, "cheap shots." McKeon said  he arranged a meeting between Signal Publisher Darrel Phillips and members of  the committee who were upset by the allegations. Phillips was unavailable for  comment.  </P> <P> "The trend of the editorials and the staff reporting indicated that there was a  cover-up and that we, the committee that worked on these things, were either  too naive or too stupid or in the pocket of the polluters -- which was  blatantly false," Darcy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allegation Denied  </P> <P> Cook denied that he implied the committee had covered up the health problems  and defended the paper's coverage of the SOS situation.  </P> <P> "Our reporters have done an exceptional job," he said. "It was a very critical  issue where public health and safety are at stake. . . . There never was any  allegation of a cover-up. The committee has apparently done a very good job on  seeing that the toxic situation has been cleaned up, but our stories focused on  a lack of knowledge about the health effects."  </P> <P> Cook, who specializes in investigative reporting, was hired to lead the Signal  after the departure of Scott Newhall and his wife, Ruth, in July, 1988, in a  dispute over stock ownership.  </P> <P> Cook also has worked for the Orange County Register, Arizona Republic and Los  Angeles Herald Examiner. In 1988, he was a Pulitzer prize finalist for a series  of articles for the Arizona Republic on drugs and the elderly.  </P> <P> Zeile credited Cook with turning the Signal from a newspaper that published  three days a week into a daily with 44,000 circulation. "Certainly, Mr. Cook  has been an asset to this paper," she said.  </P> <P> Zeile said City Editor Joe Franco, 26, will serve as interim editor.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Philipp Gollner contributed to this article.  </P></p>

"Time has not come yet to speak about a full success, but  this agreement opens the way we would like to follow", Andrejevs  said in an interview with TASS. "As far as possible, we heeded  to pieces of advice from across the world, above all from the  United States. We know that this compromise version was worked  out at the Moscow summit between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and  Bill Clinton. Then came our visit to Washington. During this  visit, we received necessary explanations about why we should  not be scared with this version", the minister noted.    Speaking about the Skrunda radar installation, which is to  be  kept by Russia for four years under the agreement, Andrejevs  said: "Unfortunately, we have a bitter experience of 1993  related to military bases stationed in Latvia. It was not very  long ago, however we need to change Latvian people's mentality.  We should explain that times have changed, and Russia needs the  Skrunda radar only as a means of obtaining information and not  as a military installation. This was the issue that caused the  main difficulties. There is quite a strong opposition in Latvia  which demands a complete withdrawal of Russian troops in  accordance with the Helsinki agreement. Nevertheless, we should  display political realism in our onward advance", the Latvian  minister stressed.    In conclusion, Andrejevs expressed hope that a  Russian-Latvian summit would take place as soon as in early  April, and the drafted documents would be signed. "Relations  between Russia and Latvia should be much better than both sides  sometimes describe them. The truth is somewhere between, and we  are quite able to develop friendly relations", the minister  emphasised.</p>

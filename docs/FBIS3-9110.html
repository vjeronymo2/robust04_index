Here is our special  correspondent Dragoljub Stankic reporting from Knin:    [Begin recording] [Stankic] Differences were expressed  yesterday by the refusal of the opposition, the Serbian  Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radicals, to accept  that the government's ordinances have legal force, something  that immediately brought the Krajina judicial system to a  complete state of paralysis. The vote of no-confidence in  Information Minister Milena Tanjga -- without deviating from the  legal period of time from the no-confidence motion to the [word  indistinct] -- came to a head during the morning session when  deputes of the coalition opposed the government's report on the  recent term, presented by Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic. The  solution does not lie in reproaches; the point is to make the  [word indistinct] under these conditions, said Bjegovic,  attempting to somehow calm things down in the Assembly.  However, if one adds here that the joint coalition was from the  very beginning opposed to the new prime minister-designate,  Borisav Mikelic, as well to most other issues, it is then clear  that things could be solved only with the resignation of the  entire cabinet.    We asked Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic to briefly comment  on his resignation for Belgrade Radio.    [Bjegovic] Well, I think that in this situation it was  necessary to cut short the debate. I do not think that false  accusations are ever useful and particularly not to the republic  of Serbian Krajina and its people, who are suffering for the  fourth year already. It is good that we had parliamentary  elections and a multiparty system, but some rules of human  behavior must exist. I think that there has been smearing and  spitting on the government both in the case of the former  parliament and this one, although I think that it is the only  body in republic of Serbian Krajina that has functioned, more or  less.    It was my human duty to come before the parliament as a  deputy and I think I performed my duty to the extent that it was  possible to do so. My entire cabinet made an effort to do its  duty. Working under difficult conditions, I think that we  nevertheless maintained a certain minimum of system and  organization. I was particularly concerned with the question of  how to solve the organizational situation. I must say with  pleasure that (?this one step) was overcome and now we have all  [word indistinct], all state institutions. I expect the new  parliament to do the same, as these committees should take care  of the law, the legal procedure, and by no means encroach on  executive power. If this is understood, then a division of  duties will be accomplished. What should definitely be accepted  in the end is the communal system plan, that is to say, a law on  territorial organization in which [words indistinct]. In this  way, we will have a real infrastructure and I am certain we will  be successful. On the basis of everything I have heard today, I  can say that there are many clever people here, but it is  certain that this party [word indistinct] is above them and that  it is almost dictating to them. I would not like to dictate to  anybody to do what is smart, he should decide for himself. I  think that it is most important to also create a financial  model, that is, economic prosperity for the republic of Serbian  Krajina. I am sure that there is room for us in a joint Serbian  state and I am sure that we shall [words indistinct).    [Stankic] We should also say that after Milan Martic,  president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the new  Assembly were elected, the Krajina government became a regular  offender. The parliamentary majority treated the government as a  political opponent, and attacks abounded regardless of the  evidence. The attacks on government projects, against Milena  Tanjga, and Borislav Mikelic are in fact the coalition's attack  against President Milan Martic. The government's (?resignation)  is nothing but a ruse by the parliamentary majority, because  according to the Constitution, the government can now function  unhindered until a new cabinet is elected.

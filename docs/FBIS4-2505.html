			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Li Xiaoshi, former  vice-minister of the State Commission of Science and Technology  (SCST), was sentenced today to 20 years in prison with his  political rights deprived for four years for taking bribes and  for embezzlement.    This verdict was given in the final ruling by the Beijing  Higher People's Court.    Li, 53, successively held posts of division chief, bureau  director, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Commission of  Science and Technology, president and editor-in-chief of THE  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY and vice-minister.    When the Beijing-based Changcheng (Great Wall) Machinery and  Electronics Scientific and Technological Industry Company began  its illegal fund raising activities last year, Li made an  immediate positive written comment and instructed his staffers  to support the activities.    Li immediately went to the Changcheng Company himself, and  left with a note of encouragement.    Li's words were later made use of by Shen Taifu, then  president of the Changcheng Company, for his illegal fund  raising.    Li kept advertising for Shen Taifu in similar ways on many  public occasions. Shen was also eager to reward him for his  "service."    On March 4, 1993, a SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY reporter  signed a 40,000 yuan contract on technology development with the  Changcheng Company in the name of Li Xiaoshi's son and gave the  money to Li Xiaoshi.    Li kept the money and took the contract to his office,  locking it in an iron safe.    After Shen Taifu was arrested, Li realized the predicament  he  was in and asked the reporter to take away the contract.    When he was inquired about this matter by the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission of the Communist Party, Li  denied involvement.    Li reached an agreement with his wife that she shoulder all  the responsibilities in further inquiries.    More clues implicating Li in other criminal practices were  also discovered during the investigation.    Li became acquainted with a Hong Kong couple in Guangdong  three years ago and offered business opportunities to them. Li  received 5,000 Hong Kong dollars and 1,000 U.S. dollars in  bribes for his offer.    In 1991, Li used his position to help a Beijing  Refrigeration  Equipment Company. The next year, Li asked the company to  install an air conditioner worth 3,500 yuan for him without  paying a cent.    In 1990, a unit published a full page advertisement in the  newspaper at 20,000 yuan when Li was its president and  editor-in-chief. The money was pocketed by Li.    The Beijing Intermediate People's Court issued its first  ruling on March 4 this year after a long and careful trial. The  court ruled that Li was found guilty and should be sentenced to  15 years of imprisonment with his political rights deprived for  three years and part of his personal property confiscated for  taking bribes; and seven years in prison with his political  rights deprived for one year for embezzlement.    Li lodged an appeal afterwards to the Beijing Higher  People's  Court, which rejected his appeal and upheld the original  sentence.</p>

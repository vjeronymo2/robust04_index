			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Business protest on Bristol rejection BUSINESS groups representing more than 2,000 companies yesterday protested at the rejection by the Local Government Commission of a greater Bristol in its proposals for abolishing the county of Avon. In an open letter to Sir John Banham, commission chairman, the groups accuse the commission of ignoring strategic matters such as transport and planning, of failing to ensure that Bristol would have sufficient funds to deal with social issues such as homelessness and urban decay, and of overlooking the need for the city to develop as an important European city to attract inward investment. The groups backing the protest are the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, the Confederation of British Industry's south-west region, the Institute of Directors, the Federation for Small Businesses and the Bristol Property Agents' Association. The commission has proposed that Bristol becomes a unitary authority within its historic boundaries and rejected the case, supported by the Labour-controlled city council, for its boundaries to be extended to include much of the urban area to the north and west of the city. These urban areas are now part of the district councils of Northavon and Kingswood, which the commission has proposed should form a single unitary authority, although both are arguing that they should be individual authorities. Mr John Savage, chief executive of the Bristol chamber, said: 'The business community is outraged by the commission's recommendations, which would create a unitary authority for Bristol that lacks the critical mass to tackle key strategic issues.' The commission accepted that there were strong arguments in favour of a greater Bristol but said there was strong opposition from the communities in Northavon and Kingswood. Mr Alan Smith, chief executive of Kingswood council, yesterday accused the chamber of arrogance in promoting the Bristol interest at 'the expense of the traditions, loyalties and identities of established communities'.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Heywood sale lifts share price 53p SHARES OF Heywood Williams rose 53p to 239p yesterday on news that the company was selling the part of its glass distribution business which supplies the UK construction industry. According to Heywood 59 per cent of its sales will continue to be generated by the building industry despite the purchase of the largest part of its UK glass division by Pilkington. Heywood also announced that, including the business to be sold to Pilkington, it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.5m in 1992, a decline of 71 per cent from Pounds 19.2m in 1991. Despite a fall in earnings per share to 1.7p (17.4p) the company is maintaining its final dividend at 8p, making a same-again 12.5p total. Heywood will continue to sell glass to the automotive industry accounting for another 33 per cent of sales. About 70 per cent of group turnover will remain in the UK, according to Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, executive chairman. There will, however, be a distinct shift in the balance between sales of glass and those of plastic and aluminium - much of which is sold to the building industry for doors and window units. Plastic and aluminium in future will account for about 63 per cent of sales compared with 37 per cent previously. Glass sales will shrink from 63 per cent to less than 40 per cent, said Mr Hinchliffe. He said the group was getting out of underperforming businesses which would be better managed by an integrated glass manufacturer like Pilkington. This would allow the company to concentrate on more profitable operations. Sales of aluminium and plastic extrusions, mostly for housing repair and maintenance, had risen by about 10 per cent during January and February compared with the first two months of last year. Sales in the US, after a record year in 1992, also remained strong. European markets, however, remained under pressure due to the economic recession. According to the group, the book profit of Pounds 54m on the sale of the UK glass business would, under FRS 3, provide a windfall gain of about Pounds 16m to pre-tax profits in the current year. It would also leave the group with net cash of Pounds 65m which it planned to use to finance acquisitions to expand its remaining businesses.</p>

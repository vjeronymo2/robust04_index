			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / NBC admits rigging truck test: GM drops lawsuit after TV network apologises ONE OF America's best known television presenters, Ms Jane Pauley, took to the screen on Tuesday night to deliver a grovelling apology on behalf of the NBC network to General Motors, America's biggest carmaker. NBC's admission of wrongdoing came just a day after GM launched a suit for defamation against the network, which it said had rigged a broadcast test of a GM truck to make it burst into flames during a collision. In particular, GM said NBC had fitted small incendiary devices - boosters for toy rockets - underneath the vehicle. The devices were detonated by remote control, thus ensuring that any petrol spilt during the collision would catch fire. The current affairs programme Dateline NBC had aired pictures of the blaze without telling its 11m viewers about the rockets. Apologising to both GM and viewers, Ms Pauley said the crash demonstration was inappropriate, the use of 'incendiary devices' was a 'bad idea from start to finish', and that the public should have been told about the devices. GM followed through by calling off its legal action. GM's investigation began after a tip that the tests were rigged. The company wrote to NBC seeking its co-operation and access to the two vehicles involved, only one of which (a 1977 model) caught fire. NBC replied that the pick-ups had been destroyed. GM, however, scoured dumps in rural Indiana around the test site, found the vehicles, and signs that the rocket devices had been taped to them. It also uncovered photographic evidence of a remote-control device being used to set off the explosions and puffs of smoke coming from beneath the vehicles just before collision. An X-ray of the 1977 vehicle's fuel tank showed this had not been pierced - contrary to claims in the NBC programme. And by finding the previous owner of the vehicle, GM established that it was fitted with a faulty fuel cap. In other words, the fire set off by the explosive devices was fed by fuel escaping from the vehicle's filler tube, when the fuel cap flew off in the collision, and not from a ruptured tank. But the clash between two of America's best-known household names will not end here. It strikes a severe blow to the credibility of NBC, which is already struggling with a serious morale problem. Since its takeover by General Electric in 1986, NBC has dropped from first to last in the ratings of America's three networks. This latest blow comes on top of the recent loss of its late-night talk-show host, Mr David Letterman, to rival CBS. GE is believed to want to sell NBC and the GM debacle is likely to strengthen its resolve. The incident also underscores the dubious quality of some US investigative television reporting, which often seems shallow in its analysis and sensational in its treatment of facts. Media analysts suggest standards have slipped over the past two decades as networks have faced declining budgets and increased competition for viewers from cable channels. NBC said yesterday that from now on 'unscientific demonstrations' would have no place in hard news stories at the network. The apology also gives a boost to GM, which is struggling against a tide of bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks built between 1973 and 1987. The fuel tanks on these pick-ups are located at the side, and outside the main frame, which critics have alleged makes them particularly vulnerable to fire when hit from the side. Last week a jury in Atlanta, Georgia, found GM guilty of negligence in the design of the trucks and ordered it to pay over Dollars 105m (Pounds 69.5m) to the parents of a teenager killed during a accident involving a C/K. GM is appealing. Government regulators are investigating the safety of the vehicles, which GM insists are no more dangerous than those of its rivals. If the regulators disagree, they could order a recall of the estimated 4.7m trucks still on the road for modification, which would cost GM hundreds of millions of dollars and lay it open to more suits for crash damages. GM's legal action demonstrates that the company will fight to defend its pick-ups, and will not recall them unprompted.</p>

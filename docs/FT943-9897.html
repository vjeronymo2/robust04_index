			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Boeing in Dollars 600m Chinese venture - XAC to supply sections for 737 airliner Boeing yesterday signed its biggest manufacturing agreement yet with a Chinese company when its president initialled contracts worth about Dollars 600m for the supply of aft sections for its 737 twin-engine airliners. Mr Ron Woodard, president of Boeing, said the Xian Aircraft Company (XAC), was 'now elevating itself from a producer of major assemblies to manufacturer of an entire Boeing aeroplane section.' XAC has been manufacturing parts for Boeing aircraft since the 1980s, including vertical fins, horizontal stabilisers and forward access doors. But this will be the first time it will have manufactured the whole section of an aircraft. Boeing's decision to engage a Chinese company in a big production venture reflects the company's desire to further consolidate its position in its fastest growing market. 'Support of China's aerospace industry has been a top priority for Boeing for many years,' said Mr Woodard. 'Much technology has been exchanged . . . enabling China's aerospace industry to be on a par with other world-class manufacturers.' Boeing supplied 46 jetliners to China last year or 14 per cent of its entire production of 330 aircraft. China this year is scheduled to receive 36 Boeings, or 14 per cent of the company's output of 260 aircraft. China is also in the market for Boeing's newest jetliner, the 777, which is a medium-to-long-range wide-bodied jet with a capacity of up to 400 passengers. China Southern Airlines, based in Guangzhou, has ordered six of the aircraft with the first due in May 1995. Boeing also announced that it was upgrading its representation in China by basing a senior executive in Beijing. He will report directly to the president of the company in Seattle. Boeing plans to spend Dollars 100m in China over the next five years on upgrading its service and spare parts facilities and in assisting the Chinese to improve their maintenance and air safety standards. Mr Woodard said Boeing hoped to continue its dominance of the China market with 65-75 per cent of new sales. Boeing forecasts that the total market for commercial jet aircraft sales in China will be worth Dollars 40bn until 2010. This would make China the world's third largest aviation market after the US and Japan. Separately, Mr Woodard told reporters he expected that a feasibility study, involving Boeing, Chinese and Japanese organisations, into the co-production of a 100-seater jetliner for the Asia-Pacific would be completed within 18 months.</p>

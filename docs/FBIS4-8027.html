			<p>BFN     [Text] Official talks between Defense Minister Safet  Zhulali and General George Joulwan have taken place at the  Defense Ministry. Greeting the high-ranking NATO guest,  Minister Zhulali said that his visit to Albania is an historic  moment that will give new impetus to Albania's cooperation with  NATO and will have its own effects in the region, discouraging  all those who attempt to destabilize it.    Zhulali noted that since the beginning of the democratic  processes, Albania has requested membership in NATO. After the  establishment of the democratic government, such a demand was  presented officially, because Albania morally feels itself to be  a NATO member and is ready to undertake concrete steps in this  direction.    We are aware that our standards do not correspond to those  of  NATO, but we have the same democratic values. We are sure that  your assistance will not be absent. Thus, we will achieve what  we want, Minister Zhulali told his interlocutor.    Within this framework President Berisha has signed the  Partnership For Peace [PFP] plan, considering it to be an active  process that will lead toward Albania's integration into NATO.    One of the reasons I chose Albania for my first trip abroad,  General Joulwan pointed out, is precisely related to your speedy  commitment to the PFP plan. As a commander, I am interested in  the documents of the presentation into this partnership, which  will determine the course that you will follow, which will be an  Albanian program and for Albania, respecting its sovereignty.    He assessed the support that Albania has given to UN  Security  Council resolutions on former Yugoslavia and NATO operations and  expressed his support for the democratization process that  Albania is following.    The exchange of symbolic presents from both parties was  assessed as a sign of friendship between NATO and Albania.  [passage omitted]</p>

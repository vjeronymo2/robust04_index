			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS CHANGE FLAVOR OF THE WAY L.A. AREA PLAYS;  </P> <P> CULTURE: GROWING MORE SECURE IN A NEW LAND, CENTRAL AMERICANS STEP OUT TO A NEW  BEAT IN ENTERTAINMENT.  </P> <P> Late at night, young Salvadoran men and women, their hair slicked or teased,  their clothes primped and pressed, flow through the painted glass doors at the  corner of Temple Street and Rampart Boulevard just west of downtown, past the  security guards and into the darkened cavern that is the Pan American Club.  </P> <P> There, under the pink and purple neon stars, a Salvadoran band breaks into a  cumbia and other familiar tunes from the tropics. Instantly, the dance floor is  jammed with the furious movements of bouncing torsos, gyrating shoulders and  whirling feet. The dance -- at this club and dozens all over the city -- will  last the entire night.  </P> <P> Clubs such as the Pan American have sprung up throughout greater Los Angeles in  recent years, catering to a growing Central American community and competing  increasingly for a portion of the immigrant dollar. Their presence shows that  new waves of immigrants are changing not only the way Southern California  speaks and works, but also the way it plays.  </P> <P> With the influx of hundreds of thousands of Central Americans into the region  over the last decade, these nightspots are taking their place alongside the  traditional Mexican mariachi clubs and theaters that have existed in Los  Angeles for decades. Together, they offer a glimpse into the ways recent Latin  American immigrants are making recreation and entertainment a part of their  transplanted lives.  </P> <P> To outsiders, the clubs may appear as seedy bars with strange names on  unattractive street corners. But to those who cross their thresholds, they  represent something else altogether. Inside, scores of people who have escaped  civil wars and poverty seek nostalgic links to their homeland, camaraderie  among compatriots and relief from their daily drudgeries.  </P> <P> "This is one of the few places where we can enjoy lo nuestro, what is ours, a  bit of El Salvador," said customer Luis Parton, a Salvadoran who works for a  local Spanish-language television station, as he sipped a drink and watched the  dancers crowding the floor.  </P> <P> "Everybody knows each other here," Parton, 35, said. "The faces rarely change.  I can stay away three months and, when I return, I see the same faces."  </P> <P> It is the same story for many of the Guatemalans who frequent the 3-year-old  Guatelinda Night Club on Hollywood Boulevard. "There are people who come just  to hear the marimba," said Hector Cano, a bartender at Guatelinda. "Marimba  music is (Guatemala's) national music, the music of our elders."  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, with war menacing El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala,  refugees poured into Los Angeles by the thousands. As they tentatively formed  new lives here, mere survival was the primary, perhaps only, goal. Luxuries  such as entertainment were rarely part of the picture.  </P> <P> The Central American community became more established. As part of that  evolution, the number of recreational and entertainment outlets has grown to  include everything from restaurants, nightclubs and pool halls to soccer  leagues and civic associations.  </P> <P> Couples with children crowd Salvadoran and Guatemalan restaurants in the  Pico-Union area or in North Hollywood; parks as far flung as MacArthur Park  near downtown to the soccer fields of suburban San Gabriel Valley are scenes of  weekend picnics and gatherings.  </P> <P> "In the past, there was a hope things would change in Central America and  people would be able to go back," said Francisco Rivera, head of the newly  formed Central American Cultural Center, which promotes musical and artistic  performances. "But now you have this incredible situation of half a million  Central Americans settling definitely in Southern California."  </P> <P> For example, Rivera said, the number of Central American restaurants in Los  Angeles quadrupled during the past decade, to about 200.  </P> <P> Historically, the addition of entertainment and recreation to the immigrant's  activities has always been considered an important milestone in any  foreign-born group's integration into American life.  </P> <P> It marks a point where the immigrant has overcome an initial feeling of  isolation and has moved on to join social networks, which gradually give the  immigrant a sense of belonging. Such support networks allow the newcomer to  cling to something familiar while building a new life.  </P> <P> "One of the key things the immigrant tries to do is re-create a sense of  security (and) emotional support by re-creating his community," said Leo  Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Especially for undocumented aliens, in this country illegally and often living  an underground existence in a seemingly hostile world, the mainstream forms of  recreation are off limits. Chavez said they look to their own clubs, soccer  games and restaurants to provide a form of refuge, an "island of security."  </P> <P> Estimating how much money recent immigrants spend on recreation is difficult.  The amount depends on many factors, including the proportion of earnings that a  person sends back to his family in Mexico or Central America, the number of  family members in this country, and so forth.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, from interviews with experts and participants, it is clear that  entertainment tailored to Latin American tastes has become big business in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> For the savvy entrepreneur, it only makes sense to tap into a growing base of  potential customers -- people who may not have a lot of money to spend but who  will gladly dedicate a portion of their budget to entertainment.  </P> <P> One proprietor of a bar on the eastern edge of Hollywood said he began adding  Central American and Caribbean tunes to a previously all-Mexican jukebox when  he bought the place nine years ago. Gradually, the clientele shifted from a  mostly Mexican crowd to a mix that is about 40% Salvadoran, Guatemalan and  Honduran.  </P> <P> "You have to go where the (business) is," he said.  </P> <P> As a recent Friday wore on past midnight, dancers continued to arrive at the  Pan American. Young men paused just inside the deafening club to check their  hair in a wall-to-wall mirror. Smiling women came in groups or on dates and  took their place at cloth-covered, candlelight tables facing the boisterous  dance floor.  </P> <P> Police have reported complaints from residents who say some patrons who loiter  after emerging from the club are a nuisance. There have been a handful of  narcotics arrests of people outside the club, but no trouble involving the club  itself, police said. The owners said drugs are not tolerated at their  establishment.  </P> <P> Sitting at the bar, crowding the dance floor or waiting the tables, a  cross-section of the world of recent Central American immigrants can be found.  </P> <P> There are former students from violent countries who barely escaped, and  aspiring professionals whose readjustment has been relatively comfortable.  There are musicians who were famous in their homeland, only to have to start  over in this country. And there are ex-soldiers who reached U.S. soil only  after long detours through dank Central American jails.  </P> <P> Here they work as hotel clerks, fast-food cashiers, security guards, sales  representatives, delivery truck drivers, housekeepers and writers.  </P> <P> Many political backgrounds and viewpoints are represented on any given night at  the Pan American. The owners make one thing clear: Check your politics at the  door.  </P> <P> "We do not mention politics here for anything," said co-owner Consuelo Ayon.  "This is a place to dance, to have a good time. It is not a place for fixing  political things. It is for having fun. Period.  </P> <P> "We do not allow religion, either," she added.  </P> <P> While many of the clubs attract a mixed clientele who hail from all over Latin  America, sometimes one country is represented more than others, largely because  of the music that is played.  </P> <P> At the Pan American, mostly Salvadoran crowds want to hear the club's star  musical attraction, German Mangandi y Sus Amigos, billed as "the best  Salvadoran musical group in L.A."  </P> <P> Mangandi was a well-known figure on the entertainment scene of his native El  Salvador during the 1960s and '70s. As a young singer in San Salvador, Mangandi  formed several of Central America's most famous dance bands, among them the  Fiebre Amarilla (Yellow Fever).  </P> <P> Like tens of thousands of other Salvadorans, Mangandi began to see the civil  war touch his family, his life and his work.  </P> <P> There was the time he was playing a concert in Sesuntepeque when shooting broke  out. Retreating to the bathroom he had to step over dead bodies.  </P> <P> "Working became difficult," Mangandi, 43, said in a recent interview backstage  at the Pan American.  </P> <P> So he came to Los Angeles, where he has reinvented a career. In addition to  headlining the Pan American most weekends, Mangandi &amp; Friends have toured  the United States occasionally and even returned to perform in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Standing sentry over the entrance to the Pan American are two security guards  who inspect the customers' proof of age and search each male arriving at the  club. With emblems of the U.S. flag sewn on their uniform shirt sleeves, the  two guards can recite the date and time they entered the United States -- after  nearly a decade of what they described as pain and deprivation in a Nicaraguan  prison.  </P> <P> The two men, Elen Peterson Bermudez, 47, and Juan Jose Puerto, 50, were members  of the National Guard of right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was  overthrown in 1979 by the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front. Like  many guardsmen, Peterson and Puerto landed in jail.  </P> <P> They gained their freedom 10 years later in a general amnesty granted by the  government. They said they continued to feel pressured and watched, and left  Nicaragua. The two men ended up in Los Angeles, where they have sisters, and  started work for a private security firm.  </P> <P> Although the assignments rotate, Peterson and Puerto lately have been spending  most of their shifts at the Pan American.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine?" Puerto said, shaking his head at the blaring sounds around  him. "Ten years of not hearing music at all (in prison). And now, hearing it  until we go to bed! Such is fate."  </P> <P> Inside the Guatelinda, Judith Morales, her long black curly hair flowing over  her shoulders, and her sister-in-law, Evelyn Gomez, dressed in a tight black  skirt, white lacy top and large faux-pearl earrings, were sitting at a table  waiting for a punta y soka contest to begin.  </P> <P> The dance, a faster version of the merengue, is especially popular among people  from Central America's eastern coast, a region washed in a strong Caribbean  influence. First prize in the contest was $1,000.  </P> <P> Morales, a receptionist, and Gomez, who is studying word processing at a trade  school, were the first to arrive, about 9:30 p.m., and would be among the last  to leave.  </P> <P> Morales, who left the Guatemalan lakeside town of Amatitlan five years ago to  join four siblings in Los Angeles, said she goes to the club, often with her  husband, an average of three nights a week: Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. At  first, her social life in Los Angeles was limited to parties in friends' homes,  but over the years, her circle widened to take in the discos.  </P> <P> She said she loves to dance, to see the people, to enjoy the ambience. "With  the music and everything," she said, "it almost feels like we were back home."  </P></p>

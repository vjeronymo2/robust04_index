			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slovenia/Italy: Martino on </F> Relations"]    [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, June 13 -- Italy's Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino played down reported friction with  Slovenia, Monday [13 June], saying that the problems which have  arisen are "rather small scale."    Martino pointed out that a joint committee is already at  work  on resolving outstanding issues, after which "we will support,  with sincere enthusiasm, an association deal between Slovenia  and the European Union [EU]."    Martino was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU  diplomatic chiefs to lay the groundwork for the June 24-25 EU  summit in Corfu. Slovenia was one of the items on the agenda  for today's talks.    Geography has "condemned Italy and Slovenia to being  neighbours" and "history has condemned them to being friends"  said Martino in a press conference, "I am convinced that these  two countries will remain friends."    At the centre of the friction has been Italy's reluctance to  back a Slovenian EU membership bid until the former Yugoslav  state has fulfilled all the conditions of the Osimo Treaty which  fixed borders between Italy and Yugoslavia. Italy is demanding  that Italians be allowed to regain land in Istria confiscated by  Yugoslav authorities.</p>

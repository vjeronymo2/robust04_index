			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENDA FOR NEXT GENERATION  </P> <P> The United States is failing its children. The country has no cohesive policy  for their health, education and safety. It is time for the federal and state  government to draw up a children's agenda for the 1990s, especially to meet the  needs of the youngest children before they suffer irreparable harm. There are  already many programs that work. Today and tomorrow we shall discuss some of  these programs that should be expanded, and how to do it.  </P> <P> The President, Congress and state leaders should commit the resources to expand  these programs so that families will have healthy babies and children will get  a good start in school. These leaders must also provide direction to concerned  citizens' groups, businesses, the medical profession and educators on how they  can work together to help children.  </P> <P> These are the programs that should be expanded:  </P> <P> PRENATAL CARE: Every day in America 676 babies are born to women who have not  had proper prenatal care. Every day 107 babies die before reaching their first  birthday. Twelve of those babies die every day in California.  </P> <P> Doctors who see women early and often during pregnancy can check for diet or  health problems that may jeopardize their unborn children. They can reduce  premature births or births of babies who weigh too little to thrive and who  therefore die or are severely disabled for the rest of their lives. But many  women have little or no health insurance to pay for this care. The federal  government must commit more money to expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income  pregnant women.  </P> <P> California is not even spending all the federal money it does receive for this  care. The Legislature is considering a measure to correct that situation by  trying to get the state Administration to anticipate its surpluses better and  plan ahead on using them. That's a sound approach.  </P> <P> NUTRITION: When pregnant women have proper nutrition, the odds are higher that  they will have healthy babies. And those infants and children must eat right if  they are to do well in school and in life.  </P> <P> The biggest barrier to proper nutrition among poor families is the obvious one:  They don't have the money to buy healthy food, says Armida Castellanos. She  works for the federal Women, Infant and Children nutrition program at the  Roybal Health Center in East Los Angeles, where in an average month counselors  see 1,350 women and their children. These counselors distribute vouchers for  food purchases. They also discuss with the women what they should buy with  those vouchers and prepare for their families. But in California only 42% of  the people who are eligible are served by WIC.  </P> <P> IMMUNIZATION: Immunization of young children prevents deadly or debilitating  diseases. It also averts millions of dollars in health costs. More money needs  to be spent to make sure all children get these life-enhancing immunizations.  </P> <P> HEAD START: If children get the best possible start in school, there should not  be the enormous need for costly remedial programs that there is now. If  children succeed in school, they stay in school. The evidence is clear: Federal  Head Start programs work. They help young children develop the basic skills  they will need to succeed in school. Yet there are not enough programs to serve  even half the poor children who are eligible. Since 1978, Head Start in  California has been falling behind in serving poor children. In 1978, 25.45% of  poor children were enrolled; by 1987 that figure had fallen to 18.51% of the  2.5 million disadvantaged youngsters who are eligible.  </P> <P> DROPOUT PREVENTION: Every day in America, 1,375 teen-agers drop out of school.  Dropping out is expensive. Male high school dropouts will earn $187,000 less  during their lifetime than high school graduates; female dropouts earn $122,000  less.  </P> <P> Schools need shoring up across the board to excite children about learning.  High school is too late; the efforts must begin in the early years and for the  poorest children. But while the number of poor children has been increasing,  support for the basic federal program for disadvantaged children, called  Chapter One, has declined.  </P> <P> Local school districts must also give far more support to counseling programs  that help spot potential dropouts before they leave school. Each teacher can  help by giving at least one student the kind of attention that could make all  the difference in keeping a youngster in school.  </P> <P> COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: Government effort, of course, is not the only answer.  More business people need to get involved by adopting a school and paying  attention to students, as they can do through the Los Angeles Unified School  District, or in parent councils at their neighborhood schools.  </P> <P> TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY: Every day in America almost 1,300 teen-agers have babies.  Many of these young people, especially the youngest among them, lack the  emotional and economic resources to care for a child. They often drop out of  school. And their infants are at risk because these teen-age mothers-to-be  often lack proper care while they are pregnant.  </P> <P> One way to start helping these teen-agers is to assist them in delaying  pregnancy through access to family planning services. Yet in the last 10 years  federal money for the Title X Family Planning Program has been badly eroded.  </P> <P> California has the second highest rate of teen-age pregnancy in the country,  and yet it lags behind other states in dealing with the problem. It could soon  be further behind if Gov. George Deukmejian succeeds in eliminating the state  Office of Family Planning. For example, the Harbor Free Clinic in San Pedro  gives counseling to teen-agers that helps them stay in school, set goals and  develop a sense of themselves. That clinic's efforts to help teen-agers could  be shut off July 1 if the governor kills the state program.  </P> <P> It is important to remember how interrelated these programs are. If a youngster  feels comfortable going to school, he is more likely to learn. If a teen-ager  doesn't have a baby, she has a better chance of finishing school. If a young  man succeeds in school, if he has some hope for the future and a chance at a  good job, he has less incentive to deal drugs or run with a gang. That is why  it is critical that the government and the public act on the whole range of  problems facing children. Piecemeal solutions cannot do the job.  </P></p>

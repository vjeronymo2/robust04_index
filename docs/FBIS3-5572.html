Korea Telecom had  failed in the previous two attempts to auction off the shares,  about 21 percent of the cellular monopoly, retarding the  government's privatization effort.    In this new round of bidding, a Korea Telecom spokesman  said,  institutional investors will be invited to put in tenders. The  company also eliminated a regulation that banned buyers from  selling the shares within the first year of purchase. The  spokesman also said the company will lower the cutoff price for  successful bidders. In previous biddings, KMT shares were sold  for 335,000 won per share on average.    Sunkyong Business Group virtually took over the cellular  company by buying up a 23 percent holding in January when Korea  Telecom invited tenders to auction off some 44 percent of KMT.  Since then Korea Telecom has tried in vain to sell the  remaining 21 percent stake. In the second round of bidding Feb.  14 and 15, only 2,380 shares were sold. In the third trial Feb.  28, there were no successful bidders.    Once a popular stock on the Seoul Stock Exchange, KMT shares  dropped in price from a record high of 407,000 won per share  early last month to 300,000 won earlier this month. With the  rumors of new incentives, the price began picking up again and  KMT shares were selling 316,000 won per share Monday.</p>

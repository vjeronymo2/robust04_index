			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosa Costa] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 10 Jun (AE) -- Ten people have registered  at the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) as presidential  candidates. The deadline for coalitions and parties to file  their respective petitions expired at 1900 today. The TSE will  review the documents submitted by the presidential hopefuls  before officially approving their candidacies. The electoral  timetable provides that the TSE will have to rule on petitions  and appeals by 20 July.    The candidates are: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers  Party], Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party], Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party], Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party],  Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Popular Renewal Party], Flavio Rocha (PL)  [Liberal Party], Eneas Carneiro (PRONA) [Party for the  Redefinition of the National Order], Hernani Goulart Fortuna  (PSC) [Social Christian Party], Walter Queiroz (PRN) [National  Reconstruction Party], and Caetano Matano (PT do B) [Brazilian  Workers Party -- Partido Trabalhista do Brasil]. They represent  18 of the 21 parties -- most of which have formed coalitions --  that are qualified to nominate presidential candidates. The PP  [Popular Party], the PRP [Progressive Republican Party], and the  PMN [National Mobilization Party] are staying out of the race.    Only the PSDB and PDT candidates personally appeared before  the TSE to submit their documents. All other candidates were  represented by members of their parties.    Two petitions to register party names that are not legally  constituted were also processed even though they do not have a  provisional register. They are the PNSDC [National Social  Democratic Christian Party -- Partido Nacional Social  Democratico Cristao] and the PTRB [Brazilian Labor Renewal Party  -- Partido Trabalhista Renovador Brasileiro]. In principle  these petitions comply with legal provisions. They will be  reviewed by TSE members at the beginning of next week. They  must decide if the parties, the coalitions, and the candidates  for president and vice president fulfill the requirements  established by the party and electoral laws and the Constitution.</p>

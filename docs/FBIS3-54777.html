			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Belarusian Defense Ministry told a BELINFORM  correspondent that a distinctive feature of the Belarusian Armed  Forces this year would be completing the second stage of their  reorganization. The former Belarusian Military District will  continue to reduce its forces, which until recently numbered  about 250,000 servicemen, and was an unbearable burden to the  state budget. In addition, according to the new Belarusian  military doctrine based on the nonnuclear status, the size of  the Armed Forces should be reduced to the levels sufficient only  to defend the country's sovereignty and security. The size of  the Belarusian Army is expected to shrink to 100,000 servicemen  within the year.</p>

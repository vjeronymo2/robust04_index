			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCASTER GOING OUT OF DISTRICT FOR NEW CHIEF  </P> <P> The Lancaster School District broke with tradition Wednesday by launching a  search outside the school system for a new superintendent -- the district's  fourth in two years.  </P> <P> The Board of Trustees voted 4-0 to award a $10,000 contract to the  Sacramento-based California School Boards Assn. to conduct the search.  </P> <P> Officials of the fast-growing, 10,600-student district said they expect to hire  a superintendent by June.  </P> <P> For at least a decade, the board has promoted superintendents from within. But  board member William Taylor said the current board opted for the search to  bolster public confidence in the process and to "try to bring about some sense  of impartiality."  </P> <P> The district has gone through a series of administrative changes since  February, 1988, when Charles Gastineau was demoted from superintendent and  replaced by E. Jarold Wright. That controversial move -- leading to charges of  favoritism by board members who were friends of Wright -- led to a recall  election that ousted three of the five board members. The new board forced out  Wright last July, replacing him with interim Supt. Edward Goodwin.  </P> <P> Goodwin, who was the district's assistant superintendent for education  services, is expected to return to his old job, which has remained vacant. And  although candidates inside the district will be considered, board members have  said they expect to hire an outsider as the new superintendent.  </P> <P> Richard Montgomery, assistant executive director of the California School  Boards Assn. -- which represents school boards to the state government and  conducts personnel hunts -- said his group will notify more than 400 college  placement offices of the vacancy.  </P> <P> Board members have indicated the new superintendent will receive a salary  greater than the $73,000 paid to Goodwin.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER POLICE KILLING OF MAN MISTAKEN FOR SUSPECT  </P> <P> In response to the letter from Jon R. Love (June 17):  </P> <P> I hope Love is not a sheriff's deputy or police officer. Anyone who believes  that a 5' 9" 160-pound 30-year-old man fits the description of a 5' 5"  125-pound 18-year-old has a real problem.  </P> <P> I must say I am amazed at how many unarmed men who "went for their waistbands"  have been killed by LAPD and sheriff's deputies in the last 10 years. Many of  the excuses and "reports" made in these situations are an insult to any honest  person's intelligence.  </P> <P> RUTH B. HARRIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sub-postmasters seek sale pledge Sub-postmasters yesterday demanded assurances that the Counters subsidiary of the Post Office would not be 'asset-stripped' in order to benefit the Royal Mail and Parcelforce divisions of the organisation. The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters was commenting on government plans to sell 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce while keeping Counters in the public sector. Yesterday was the deadline for comments on the plans. Mr Colin Baker, federation general secretary, said the government's proposals for Counters could mean a more secure future for sub-postmasters with opportunities for business growth. 'However, the fact remains that not all sub-offices can offer all transactions - and that rural sub-offices in particular continue to close as their viability is in doubt,' he added. Strong support for the government plans came yesterday from the Confederation of British Industry, which said the commercial freedom generated by privatisation was critical to the future success of the postal service because it faced stiff international competition. Privatisation would 'bring further price and quality improvements benefiting customers', the CBI added. New competitive pressures on providers of postal services would benefit customers. 'Every business uses postal services, and for many companies the postal bill is a major overhead,' the CBI said. However, the unions and opposition parties are resolutely opposed to privatisation in any form, repeating the stance they have taken with virtually every privatisation over the last decade - most of which they no longer propose to reverse. Union and Labour leaders have highlighted the dramatic pay rises for senior managers which have followed earlier privatisations. They also claim the sell-off might endanger the letters service, and the 20,000 rural post offices. The 51 per cent sale of Royal Mail and Parcelforce is the government's favoured option. About 10 per cent of the privatised company would be sold to Post Office employees and to the staff managing sub post offices run on contract for the Post Office.</p>

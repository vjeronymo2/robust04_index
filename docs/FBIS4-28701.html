			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China have  agreed to increase two-way trade from 9 billion U.S. dollars  last year to 30 billion dollars in 1997.    At a Korea-China trade ministers' meeting held here  Thursday,  Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi  said China would lower both tariff and non-tariff barriers for  imports from South Korea.    Under the agreement, Daewoo Motor of Korea and a Chinese  company will shortly conclude a barter contract to exchange  5,000 Daewoo cars for Chinese corn and machine parts. The  contract will signal Korea's first car exports to China:  previously, used Korean cars have been sold illegally in China.    Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su requested  that China open its car market so that Korean automakers can  produce vehicles in joint ventures in China.    Kim also asked for Chinese cooperation in Yukong's oil  refinery construction project in Shenzhen, Daewoo's car parts  factory project in Shandong Province and the Korea business  center's construction project in Beijing, to which Wu responded  positively.    In addition, Kim and Wu agreed to promote bilateral  cooperation in automobiles, medium-sized aircraft, electronic  telephone switching systems and high-definition television.    On China's application for GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs  and Trade) membership, Wu asked for Korea's support and Kim said  Seoul would cooperate as Beijing carries out trade reform to  join GATT.</p>

The morning daily `TEHRAN TIMES' commented in its editorial  on the Geneva meeting between Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad  and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    "Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been  made available to the media, all evidences point to the  conclusion that the American President could not get the Syrian  leader to accept the American point of view as easily he could  prevail upon (PLO Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat or his predecessor had  been able to make (President) Anwar al-Sadat (of Egypt) yield to  the American pressure."    In a press conference held after the talks, President  al-Asad  held firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal  from all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or  comprehensive peace settlement with all Arab countries at once.    Turning to the strategem used by the Zionist regime during  the past two decades on separate bilateral talks and settlements  with individual Arab states, it said "the obvious objective and  natural consequence of that strategem is of course to create  discord among the Arab ranks."    Turning to President al-Asad's display of awareness of the  fact that the American President's promises could not be relied  on, the paper said "the gap between what is promised by the  American President and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders  is extremely wide."    "It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty  judgement  on the meeting between al-Asad and Clinton before details of  their negotiations are known."    The daily said with regards to the cordial ties between Iran  and Syria, "it is quite natural that Tehran should be expecting  President al-Asad's special envoy in the coming days with  details of the negotiations between the heads of America and  Syria."</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet ENGLISH National Ballet is showing its production of Ashton's Romeo and Juliet on the South Bank this week. The staging does not, I feel, do any service to the choreographer's memory. Created for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955, the year before the Bolshoy Ballet revealed the power of its monumental Romeo on a first visit to the West, Ashton's version is domestic in scale, oddly lacking in passion. As presented by the Royal Danes, it had a sweetness and modesty which might, generously, be described as lyrical. Piously revived in 1985 for ENB (20 years after it had dropped from the Copenhagen repertory) it looked something of a revenant - pale, and a bit tremulous. In this latest restoration to the Festival Hall's stage, it nowhere convinces us of the lovers' tragedy - or of Ashton's genius. Ashton treated of love's many guises in his ballets. He could fix physical passion - remember Marguerite and Armand - as he could explore tenderest romance (in Two Pigeons), show us ecstasy (in Daphnis), love unwise (in A Month in the Country) or sorrowful (in Ondine). In no work did he seem uncertain in portraying feeling - save in this Romeo, whose emotions appear constrained by the rules of an academic style. Conventional mime, conventional attitudes, even conventional steps, are like brakes upon the tragedy's momentum. And from a master of dramatic structure, the plotting of the story, the pacing of incident, lack Ashtonian subtlety. What might justify the ballet for our time - but has been absent from any ENB performance I have seen since the company acquired the version - is lambent interpretation of the lovers. There are moments when one thinks of what Fonteyn might have made of this Juliet (far better suited to her gifts than the MacMillan production), or how Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell might have shaped the duets. But given with ENB's un-stellar casting, the piece has an even more papery look to it. On Monday night Jose Manuel Carreno made a debut as Romeo, and dealt honourably enough with his task, albeit passion seemed in short supply. Rebecca Sewell was his Juliet, also a newcomer. Her reading was carefully prepared, innocent, in a role which can only come alive with a ballerina of more secure gifts. It was Tim Almaas as Mercutio who showed the panache, and assurance of style, to give character any theatrical resonance. It is one of the best things that Almaas has done with the company. For the rest, the guests and townspeople scampered and wore attractive Peter Rice costumes with a will. But it was none of it much like Romeo and Juliet. English National Ballet presents Ashton's Romeo and Juliet, Royal Festival Hall until August 15, (071) 928 8800.</p>

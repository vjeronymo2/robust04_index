			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Romanians seek haven abroad: Virginia Marsh writes on the rush to escape poverty at home ADRIAN, a 32-year-old engineer, has just lost his life savings of Dollars 1,400 - more than double the average Romanian's annual salary - in an unsuccessful effort to enter Germany smuggled in a Turkish lorry over the Czech border. Adrian's story is by no means unique. He is one of more than 1,500 Romanians who were expelled from Germany last month after trying to enter the country illegally. Others have been more successful. More than 500,000 Romanians are believed to have emigrated since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989. The reasons for emigration are now primarily economic, according to Mr Padraig Czajkowski, head of the Bucharest office of the Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration (IMO). 'Before 1992 many, typically the well educated, left for political as well as economic reasons. They had either been prevented from leaving in the communist period or else they became quickly disenchanted with the new regime,' he says. 'With unemployment and real incomes declining, disillusionment is moving down the social scale. The less skilled are trying to get out too.' He points to the flood of labourers and rural workers who came forward last month after Argentina invited applications from Romanian settlers. The Argentine embassy in Bucharest handed out 25,000 immigration forms over three weeks. Emigration has also been spurred by realisation that Romania's transition to a market economy will take longer and be more painful than originally anticipated. An IOM poll taken last year indicated nearly 30 per cent of Romanians did not intend to stay in the country. A further 46 per cent said they had considered moving abroad. 'Reforms in Romania have not progressed as quickly as in the central European countries,' says a Canadian embassy official. 'The young are generally the most unhappy about this. They tell us they want to experience the New World today and not in 20 years' time.' The under-30s, who form the bulk of those trying to leave, have also been hard hit by unemployment. Labour Ministry figures show that, in February, 55 per cent of the unemployed were under the age of 30. Fewer than 8 per cent were over 50. The US, Canada and Germany are the most popular destinations for would-be emigrants. 'In Berlin, I can earn DM2,000 per month. It's worth the risk of being caught,' says Nicolae, a 30-year-old computer programmer, who has been to work in Germany twice. He has used the money to set up his own company in Buch-arest. 'Many are still ignorant about the realities of life in the west, They hear that German social security is DM600 per month and think they can live on DM200 and save the rest,' says Mr Hubertus Thoma, head of consular affairs at the German embassy in Bucharest. Last year, 104,000 Romanians sought asylum in Germany, accounting for a quarter of all applications. A further 220,000 were granted visitor visas. Other western countries have found that many Romanians overstay their visas. Around 50 per cent of those given US visitor visas stay on illegally, according to the US embassy in Bucharest. Diplomats also report a growing trade in forged visas and passports. 'The going rate for a stolen EC or US passport is around Dollars 500,' says a US embassy official. More worrying is the increase in human traffic. Adrian may have lost his life savings but he admits things could have been worse. Others have been found dead on arrival after suffocating in sealed container trucks. Mr Czajkowski of the IOM believes many more will take similar risks as economic pressures build up. 'The situation in Romania is desperate enough. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, it is worse and likely to deteriorate further. 'With Romania we are dealing with a population of 23m, with the CIS 10 times more. The west will find it difficult to keep these people out.'</p>

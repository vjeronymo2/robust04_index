			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Pension funds BT will not be alone in making additional payments to its pension fund next year. Low dividend growth from investments and an ageing population have left an increasing number of funds in need of a top-up. On a rough calculation, around 10m people pay into pension schemes from an average wage of Pounds 12,000. Employers normally contribute about 10 per cent, suggesting a total bill of Pounds 12bn if no holidays are taken. Quoted companies account for around half of this, or Pounds 6bn in a normal year. Since something like 50 per cent of all pension schemes are receiving no contributions from employers, companies will have to find an extra Pounds 3bn a year once the holiday is over. The impact on reported profits will be much less. BT is likely to pay an additional Pounds 200m into its pension fund next year, but earnings will be unaffected. Accounting standards mean that, in most cases, changes in pension contributions are smoothed over the remaining working life of employees, an average 16 years in BT's case. If the sums are anything like correct, though, UK companies will have to find additional cash equivalent to 10 per cent of total dividend payments. For some companies at least, this will be another drag on dividend growth. The spread of damage will become clearer next year. Pension funds revalued this year benefited from strong dividend growth in 1989-90. Funds taking a three-yearly revaluation in March 1993 will not be so lucky. It is one more reason to take a close look at cash flow statements.</p>

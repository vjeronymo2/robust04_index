			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities sells 26% of Stylo as part of 'orderly disposal' plan CONTROL Securities, the brewing, hotels and property company which has been involved in prolonged refinancing talks, yesterday announced the sale of its 26 per cent stake in Stylo, the Bradford-based shoe retailer, for Pounds 4.5m. The company refused to identify the purchaser. However, traders said the shares had been purchased by institutions at 90p each. Control acquired 24.6 per cent of Stylo in 1988 for Pounds 16.2m, valuing the shares at 325p. The purchase ended the shoe company's three-year battle to fend off a hostile bid from property group British Land. Yesterday's sale marks the beginning of Control's 'orderly disposal programme' as cited by chairman Mr Sydney Robin in a letter to shareholders earlier this month. The programme forms part of the business plan required for a successful conclusion to refinancing talks begun in June. The group's shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p for 15 months. The company said yesterday it would use the proceeds to pay off some of its Pounds 259m debt. Since 1988, the investment had been written down to a value of Pounds 4.7m. Gross dividends received from the stake amounted to Pounds 591,198. Dividend payments of Pounds 166,166 received in October 1992 would be included in the year to March 31, the company said. Control Securities recently reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 196.2m, against a deficit of Pounds 3.3m last time. See Market Report</p>

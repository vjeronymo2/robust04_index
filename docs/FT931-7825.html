			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / French railways and ports disrupted Farmers block a railway line with burning tyres at St Sulpice, south-western France, during a national day of protest against the European Community's farm trade agreement with the US. Yesterday's demonstrations by farmers brought chaos to rail services, disrupting main lines in and out of Paris and routes around Tours, Chartres and Toulouse. Meanwhile, several small ports in Brittany were closed in sympathy with fishermen who have been protesting against a surge of cheap fish imports into France which have pushed down local prices by 30 per cent. The French government has urged Brussels to invoke a Gatt safeguard clause allowing it to block imports temporarily. Paris urges import curbs, Page 20 Rail chaos, Page 3</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes suspects  hardline Hutus, opposed to power sharing with Rwanda's Tutsi  minority, were responsible for the rocket attack that killed the  presidents of Rwanda and Burundi. Mr. Claes earlier announced  Belgium is withdrawing its blue helmets from Rwanda. I asked  him what he thought should now happen to the United Nations  forces in Rwanda.    [Begin Claes recording] It depends on the decision of the  Security Council, of course, but I think that the opinion of the  Belgian Government, on the base concrete and pragmatical  elements we have obtained in Rwanda, is very clear. There is no  longer any reason to maintain UN troops which were sent in order  to stimulate the peace process of Arusha on the moment that a  civil war is in the country. So we think that it would be wise  to follow the decision taken by the United Nations in Angola.  That means that, at the moment that a civil war started once  again in Angola, the mission was suspended, but that an  important unity was maintained in the country in order to  promote cease-fire and to try to create the conditions necessary  in order to restart the peace process.

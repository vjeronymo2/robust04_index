			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAKASONE ADMITS 3 AIDES PROFITED IN STOCK SCHEME  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said today that three of his aides had  bought bargain shares in the company at the center of a stock-profiteering  scandal, but he denied any personal involvement in the affair.  </P> <P> "I regret my aides' purchase of shares occurred because of my poor  supervision," Nakasone said in a nationally televised news conference. "But I  am innocent and played no role in the scandal."  </P> <P> The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expressed dissatisfaction with  Nakasone's remarks and repeated demands that the government summon him to  testify before Parliament concerning the scandal.  </P> <P> The scandal involves sales to 150 influential politicians and businessmen of  bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. before the stock was listed for  public sale. When public trading began, the share prices shot up and the  bargain buyers profited handsomely.  </P> <P> The scandal has shaken the government, and prosecutors have arrested eight  people on charges of bribery or violating securities laws.  </P> <P> Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982-87, denied his involvement in the  scandal for the first time in an interview last week with CBS News.  </P> <P> Today's news conference marked his first public comments to the Japanese on the  affair.  </P></p>

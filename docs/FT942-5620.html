			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise North Sea field reaches peak output Enterprise Oil, the UK's largest independent explorer, yesterday announced that its Nelson field in the North Sea had achieved peak production of 160,000 barrels a day only four months after the platform produced its first oil. Enterprise, which is locked in a hostile bid battle for Lasmo, the second largest company in the exploration sector, has been labouring under financial constraints. The Nelson field is its largest project to date. It is also the first time that it has operated a North Sea platform. Part of Enterprise's justification for the bid has been that it can use Nelson's strong cash flow to bring forward Lasmo projects that might otherwise be delayed by a lack of financing. Mr Mark Hope, general manager, said the rapid move to peak production had been achieved in large part by pre-drilling eight wells, which were ready to flow once the platform was operational. Additional wells were being drilled from the platform.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Novice makes mark - Surprises on the spending side Mr Clarke's budget is the work of a political heavyweight. Unlike his predecessor, Mr Clarke knows little about the minutiae of tax. He has spent his political life in the spending departments. It was thus wholly appropriate that the big surprise should have been on the spending side. Mr Clarke has done what the markets most wanted and least expected. He has cut the PSBR by cutting public spending. The control totals decided by the Cabinet in June were genuinely tough. Many doubted whether they would be achieved. Mr Clarke has proved to be an over-achiever. He not been too particular in his methods. Freezing public sector pay is a powerful way of keeping public spending under control, but it is also arbitrary and unfair. It sits ill with the rhetoric of a government which emphasises its commitment to quality public services. But it is to his credit that he has taken difficult decisions that will reduce public spending in the medium term. He has seized, at last, the opportunity provided by the need to equalise the pension ages of men and women and levelled the retirement age upwards. He has removed an absurd incentive to malinger by abolishing the untaxed Invalidity Benefit and replacing it with the new Incapcity Benefit. He has taken further steps along the road to replacing student grants with student loans. Each change sends a powerful signal. All will reduce public spending in the medium term by more than the immediate savings. They are sensible decisions by a no-nonsense Chancellor who has proved, time and again in his political career, that he is not afraid to take on vested interests and pressure groups if he thinks it is in the national interest to do so. The changes have been on the Treasury agenda for some time. They are precisely the sort of sensible, radical, but painful, reforms that Treasury officials devise in the course of the public spending round. The better chief secretaries - and Mr Portillo is certainly one of those - usually incorporate such suggestions into their negotiating stance with the spending department. But they all too frequently fail at the final hurdle. The clearest sign that we now have a political heavyweight in charge of economic policy is that Mr Clarke has been able to carry these changes through Cabinet. The Clarke-Portillo axis has proved a formidable force. The result is a dream budget for the financial markets. The government has slashed Pounds 6 1/2 bn off borrowing for next year. The only worry about that achievement is that most of the cut in public spending next year comes from the contingency reserve. It has reduced the projected borrowing for 1997-98 by no less than Pounds 18bn. As if that were not enough, the government has finally recognised the case for underfunding the PSBR. There will be Pounds 7 1/2 bn of borrowing not funded by gilts sales. The change in the balance of supply and demand for in the gilts market is dramatic. This budget should give a new lease of life to the long upswing in gilts prices. We should reap the benefits of further cuts in short rates before too long. It is for that reason that underfunding has been advocated for some time by those of us who remain concerned about the strength and durability of the recovery. Confidence is still lacking - evidence for that lies in the continued sluggish growth of bank lending and the broader measures of the money supply. An injection of liquidy could give the recovery a much-needed shot in the arm. Underfunding will also reduce the government's debt interest bill. As long as there is no sign of inflationary danger - and there isn't - it can be justified on these grounds alone. Until now, however, the arguments for underfunding have fallen on deaf ears. The change of heart is as welcome as it is remarkable. The City may, however, be less entranced with Mr Clarke's tax measures. We had got used to seeing Autumn Statements which promised deferred virtue on the public spending side - a sharp rate of increase over the next year or two followed by a grinding halt. We are spared that this year - we get the biggest cut in public spending in year one. Instead, we get virtue deferred on the tax side - a Pounds 6bn increase in 1996-97, compared with only Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95. However, it would be wrong to take a wholly cynical view of these future increases. It is worth noting that we now, as a matter of course, get presented with tax plans over the same three-year horizon as the spending plans. That is an inevitable, and welcome, consequence of bringing together tax and spending plans. It has enabled Mr Clarke to put in place some long-run plans for tax increases and score the benefit in the medium term PSBR projections. He has taken the opportunity to use tax increases to help the government hit a couple of important targets outside the economic sphere. Compared with earlier projections, the 5 per cent a year real increase in fuel duties will reduce fuel consumption in the medium term and help meet the Rio conference targets on the environment. And on the same basis, the 3 per cent a year real increase in tobacco duties will reduce consumption and help meet health targets. Both changes are politically shrewd moves which make economic sense. The same cannot be said of the chancellor's revenue raising measures on the income tax side. Mr Lamont found a clever way of raising revenue by reducing the value of various tax allowances - the married couples' allowance, mortgage interest relief - to 20 per cent. That could be justified as an early move towards a reduction in the value of these allowance which would be inevitable in due course as the 20 per cent rate became the standard rate of tax. Mr Clarke has plundered the same source, by reducing the value of these allowances to 15 per cent, for which there is no conceivable justification except expedience. The chancellor has left the income tax system in a horrible mess, but the man in the street, who doesn't understand the system anyway, neither knows nor cares. He will be pleased to be spared the tax increases that were so widely anticipated.

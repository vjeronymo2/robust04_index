[26 February] -- Malaysia  today condemned the massacre of Palestinians at the al-Haram  al-Ibrahim mosque in Hebron yesterday in which dozens were  killed after a Jewish gunman opened fire on worshippers  performing prayers. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi  said Malaysia was deeply saddened by the incident which occurred  in a holy place while Muslims were observing the fasting month.    He said Israel could not escape responsibility for the dawn  attack which was the biggest single killing of Arabs since  Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. The  massacre reflected the gravity of the situation in the occupied  territories and the urgent need for Israel to change its  policies and practices for the areas. Israeli authorities had to  adhere to international obligations by respecting the rights of  the Palestinians and its holy place, he said.    "Those responsible for the massacre must be made accountable  and the entire incident should not be dismissed as the action of  an alleged mad man," he said in a statement. He said Malaysia  wanted the international community, in particular the United  Nations to provide effective protection to the Palestinians in  the occupied territories. [passage omitted]</p>

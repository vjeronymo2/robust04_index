			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Perils clause is one-sided THE LEFTHERO Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Lloyd, Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice Russell): April 1 1992 A CHARTERPARTY clause exempting shipowners and charterers from liability for delay caused by specified perils including 'restraint of princes', does not exempt charterers from demurrage liability in the absence of clear wording to that effect, irrespective of whether the peril was operating before or after the demurrage period began. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal from Mr Justice Evans's decision that Voest Alpine Intertrading, charterers of the Lefthero, were not liable for demurrage to the shipowners, Ellis Shipping Corporation. LORD JUSTICE LLOYD said that on May 18 1983 Lefthero was chartered on Gencon form to load and carry a cargo of steel products to Bandar Khomeini at the head of the Persian Gulf. The Iran-Iraq war was at its height. The dangers of sailing in those waters were well known. Laytime was to count continuously from arrival at the pilot station at Bandar Abbas at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, until passing the pilot station on the return voyage, except for actual steaming time to and from Bandar Khomeini. The vessel arrived at Bandar Abbas on July 7 where she gave notice of readiness. From there vessels destined for Bushire and beyond proceeded in convoy. Lefthero missed the first convoy but caught the next which left on August 6. From Bushire she continued in another convoy bound for Bandar Khomeini. On August 10 the pilot turned back, on the ground that the vessel could not make sufficient speed. If she had been permitted to proceed, she would have arrived at Bandar Khomeini on August 12, with eight days laytime still in hand. On August 22, the vessel made a second attempt, starting four hours ahead of convoy. Again the pilot turned back, for the same reason. The parties agreed, without prejudice to liability, to discharge at Bushire. Discharge was not complete until February 3 1984. The charterers claimed damages for the owners' failure to discharge at Bandar Khomeini. Arbitrators rejected the owners' first defence, that Bushire was 'as near' to Bandar Khomeini 'as the vessel could safely get' and was therefore an alternative contractual destination. An addendum, which did not include those words, prevailed over the printed words, which did. The second defence was that Clause 28 of the charterparty provided that 'neither the vessel nor the owners or master nor the charterers/shippers/receivers' should be responsible for any delay resulting from 'Act of God, act of war, perils of the seas . . . restraint of princes . . .' The arbitrators held that the action of the authorities in requiring the vessel to return to Bushire fell within 'restraint of princes'. There was no appeal against that finding. But then came the owners' counterclaim for demurrage. The charterers argued that if the owners were protected by clause 28, so were they. What was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander. The arbitrators said that just as the charterers' claim could not succeed because of the 'restraint of princes' exception, the owners' demurrage claim could not succeed to the extent that demurrage accrued due to the same excepted cause. They said 'the owners can only recover demurrage to the extent that it would have been incurred if the ship had been permitted to discharge at Bandar Khomeini'. They calculated that the vessel would have been detained 18 days beyond laydays, which at Dollars 4,500 per day came to Dollars 81,000. The owners appealed. Mr Justice Evans upheld the award. There was now a further appeal. On the face of it, the words of clause 28 were wide enough to cover charterers' delay in discharging where it arose from restraint of princes. If the charterers were not so protected, the clause was very one-sided. But it had long been the law that to protect a charterer against liability for demurrage, the language of the exceptions clause must be clearly worded to that effect. In Kalliopi A (1988) 2 Lloyd's Rep 101 the Court of Appeal held that 'Act of God, restraint of princes . . . unavoidable hindrances which may prevent the loading and discharging . . . always mutually excepted' in clause 36 of the charter did not protect charterers once laytime had expired. Lord Justice Staughton referred to the maxim 'once on demurrage always on demurrage', which he held was but an example of the general principle that an ambiguous clause was no protection. Applying that general principle he held the clause was insufficiently clear to protect the charterers after expiry of laytime. He quoted from The Dias (1978) 1 LLoyd's Rep 325,329 where Lord Edmund-Davies said unless the meaning to be attached to the clause 'is clearly the one urged by the respondents', the appeal should succeed. The Kalliopi was followed in the Forum Craftsman (1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep 81. There Mr Justice Hobhouse said 'the clause has to demonstrate a clear intention that the exception should apply even when the vessel is on demurrage'. Mr Siberry for the charterers sought to distinguish Kalliopi. He pointed out that the language of the two clauses was different. But if anything clause 36 in Kalliopi was more favourable to the charterers, since it adverted specifically to loading and discharging. Also it included 'always mutually excepted'. That might suggest the clause was intended to protect the charterers after as well as before expiry of laytime; but that was not the view taken by the Court of Appeal. Mr Siberry's second submission depended on the different factual situation. In Kalliopi Lord Justice Staughton referred to a justification for the maxim 'once on demurrage always on demurrage'. If the vessel had discharged within her laydays, she would have been unaffected by any subsequent cause of delay. But if she was still discharging when the excepted peril supervened and laydays had already expired, it could be said the cause of delay was not the excepted peril, but the charterers' breach in failing to discharge within laydays. In the present case, the excepted peril, restraint of princes, operated before laytime expired. Mr Siberry contended that distinction was important. He said it meant that 'once on demurrage always on demurrage' did not apply - the cause of delay was not charterers' breach, but the excepted peril. That was, Mr Siberry contended, the true explanation of Kalliopi and Forum Craftsman. It was true that in Forum Craftsman the vessel was already on demurrage when she was ordered off the berth. But in Kalliopi the peril was in operation before the vessel came on demurrage, so the factual situation was the same as in the present case. There was no support for Mr Siberry's suggested distinction in Lord Justice Staughton's judgment. He said: 'The vessel was already affected by congestion during the laytime; the charterers' breach in failing to discharge her within the laydays did not of itself cause her to be exposed to any subsequent peril. However I do not regard that as a ground for holding the general rule to be inapplicable.' So it was clear that the court regarded the general rule as applicable even though the vessel was not already on demurrage when the peril operated. That disposed of Mr Siberry's second submission. This was a case where the maxim 'once on demurrage always on demurrage', and the various judicial explanations and justifications for the maxim, had tended to confuse rather than clarify the issue. If it was not already too late, it might be better if, within the general principle stated in the Dias, the maxim were confined to the operation of laytime exceptions, strictly so called, for example Sundays and holidays excepted, which did not apply once laytime had expired. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the charterers: Richard Siberry QC (Clyde &amp; Co). For the shipowners: Timothy Young (Ince &amp; Co).</p>

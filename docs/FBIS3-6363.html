The  national news agency BERNAMA said in Kota Kinabalu that it has  received a fax from the Information Department inviting newsmen  to cover the ceremony at 3.30 pm [0730 GMT] at the palace in the  state capital. The department's press (?advisory) confirmed the  widespread talks that Datuk Pairin would step down this  afternoon.    Sabah National Front chief Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai is set to  become chief minister.    Yesterday, the National Front, BN, staked its claim to form  the new Sabah Government by petitioning the governor, Tun  Mohamed Said Keruak, that it now commanded the majority in the  State Legislative Assembly. There are altogether 30 state  assemblymen, including those from the Sabah United Party, PBS,  who defected to the National Front, filed the petition to those  who respected the governor to ask Datuk Pairin to step down and  offer the post to Tan Sri Sakaran.

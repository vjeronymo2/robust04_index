			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Lines open for the global village: The price of phone calls is falling and will fall faster if the international telecoms cartel collapses Since the telegraph and radio, the globe has contracted, spatially, into a single large village. That was Marshall McLuhan back in 1962. So it is hardly new to claim that today's 'information superhighway' is creating a global village. Much the same was said during the printing revolution in the 15th century. If the essence of village life is immediate personal communication, however, that oft-evoked vision is at last becoming a reality. The international phone call, a rare and luxurious item only a few years ago, is now a commodity within reach of most inhabitants of the developed world. Prices of calls are falling as technology leaps ahead. They would be falling faster were it not for the cartel in which most of the world's national telephone companies collude to maintain their vast profit margins. Now, even the international phone cartel is coming under strain. Many observers expect it to break up within the next couple of years. As it does, cross-border call prices will collapse. At that point, at least the developed world will feel more and more like McLuhan's village. 'We are moving into a distance insensitive world in telecoms,' claims Mr Thomas Luciano, AT&amp;T's director of international settlements. 'Soon it may actually cost less for a Londoner to put a call through to New York than to Bristol.' Even in the developed world, the international phone call only recently ceased to be a luxury. When the first regular phone service opened from London to New York in 1927, it cost Pounds 458 for a three minute call (in today's money). The entire transatlantic service was provided by radio until 1956, with capacity for no more than 20 people to hold conversations at any one time. It was not until the late 1960s that undersea cables provided lines in the hundreds, and direct dialling to New York began only in 1970. 'Making a transatlantic call was a real challenge until the 1970s,' says Mr Neil Johannessen, director of the British Telecom museum in London. 'Only then did international calls become truly part of the national phone system.' Two decades on, capacity is abundant. The latest transatlantic fibre-optic submarine cable being installed will provide 30 times the capacity for the same price as its state-of-the-art counterpart of a decade ago. A cable little thicker than a finger, it can carry about 600,000 simultaneous telephone calls. STC Submarine Systems, the London-based supplier of telecoms cables, is working on a more sophisticated fibre-optic system able to carry 10m simultaneous telephone calls - enough for the entire populations of London and New York to speak to each other at the same time down one cable. STC estimates that the cost of providing a telephone circuit by fibre between London and New York has fallen by 90 per cent in just the past seven years. According to its projections, the cost is set to fall to about one tenth of its current level over the next five years. The problem is that these falling costs are not fully reflected in prices to the consumer. At first sight, the drop in prices looks impressive. BT's transatlantic rates have fallen by more than a third in the past three years. In today's money, the price of a three-minute daytime BT call from London to New York is down from nearly Pounds 14 20 years ago to less than Pounds 1.50 now. But with their cost base shrinking even faster, the main international carriers are making margins of more than 50 per cent on much of their international traffic. On the all-important transatlantic route, industry estimates suggest that it costs little more than 7p a minute in direct network charges to deliver a call, yet the daytime prices charged by BT and AT&amp;T average nearly 45p a minute. A large part of the reason for the disparity is that international phone prices are fixed by agreement between national operators. These are mainly monopolies, subject to few competitive pressures and heavily reliant on international calls to sustain their profits and subsidise their local networks. The cartel keeps prices artificially high, with serious consequences for the growth of new 'superhighway' services and for industrial competitiveness. This is particularly damaging in Europe, where prices for cross-border calls are many times higher than for equivalent distance domestic ones. For companies, one way of reducing the cost of calls is to lease telecoms lines and build their own private networks. However, Europeans are at a disadvantage here, too. According to a recent survey by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry, a leased telecoms line between France and Germany costs nearly twice as much as the same leased line within either country, and about 16 times as much as a 200km leased line in the US. Pressure to reduce prices has had to focus on the arcane regime which governs international telecoms, whereby operators agree prices among themselves for delivering calls between countries. The agreed prices - known as 'accounting rates' - have traditionally borne little relationship to costs. After years of criticism, the cartel is cracking, and may be in its last phase. Three trends are evident: a breakdown in co-operation between the telecoms operators that sustained the accounting rate system; the rise of competing, non-cartel carriers in leading markets, notably the US and UK; a growing emphasis on privatisation and liberalisation in Europe and much of the developing world. Multinationals have been lobbying against the cartel for years, and have been helped by divisions in the ranks of the telecoms operators. Because far more calls are made from rather than to the US, AT&amp;T pays out far more to other carriers than it receives in return. It claims this imbalance is running at Dollars 2.4bn a year, and is campaigning to reduce it. In response to such pressure accounting rates have fallen sharply in recent years; and the International Telecommunications Union, which oversees the cartel, has resolved that accounting rates should become 'cost-oriented'. A row this week between AT&amp;T and BT indicates the distance still to go: AT&amp;T is pressing to cut its rate with BT from 31 cents a minute to about 11 cents, but BT will agree to a cut of no more than 25 per cent, arguing that reductions have to be 'managed'. Pressure for further sharp cuts will none the less intensify following an important change to the regulatory regime due to be announced next week by the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator. It will permit a new form of transatlantic telecoms competition using leased lines, which will benefit companies that make their business from leasing lines from the top carriers and re-selling them at a discount to standard tariffs. After the change they will be able to connect the lines into the public network on both ends of the Atlantic, giving them wider access than previously. 'This is a big nail in the coffin of the international cartel,' says Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the brokers. Although this month's change concerns only the US and UK, the US is by far the most important foreign destination for UK calls, while the UK is the the third most popular for US calls. Canada, which is the most common destination for outgoing calls from the US, already permits the same form of competition with both the US and UK. New operators are bound to find ways of using the new regime to offer cut-price services to mainland Europe, whatever the formal rules laid down by the US and UK regulatory authorities. Not withstanding the current controversy about over-priced calls, demand continues to race ahead. International telephone traffic has been growing at a compound rate of about 17 per cent a year for the past decade. Such growth does not just reflect the globalisation of business. According to the ITU, residential calling is contributing as much, if not more. The residential market is burgeoning, thanks in part to the increased mobility of populations: the US alone gained nearly 9m new immigrants in the 1980s, while the influx into western Europe has been running at about 2.5m a year since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. In the UK, Worldcom, a competitor in international business services to BT, is about to enter the residential market by targeting immigrant communities through direct mail. 'We are confident that lower prices will stimulate a lot more international calls to friends and relations,' says Mr David Hardwick, managing director. For all this the global village will still be a somewhat exclusive community. Most of the world's population has no access to a telephone of any kind, let alone fibre-optic international telecommunications and multi-media wizardry. The average global citizen made about seven minutes worth of international calls in 1991, but that average conceals a huge range: from seven hours per citizen in Luxembourg to six seconds in Africa. Barely a fifth of 105 countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications Union boast more than 25 phone lines per 100 people, with most developing countries providing fewer than 5 per 100. The UK has four times as many phone lines as India. The priority in the developing world is to build more lines. Investment is accelerating and new technology - such as 'fixed cellular' systems - may slash the cost of infrastructure. China plans to quadruple its number of phone lines over the next decade. Yet on the most optimistic projections it will still be decades before the phone is a standard household item across the globe. Governments and phone companies are coming to realise that rapid expansion requires a radical recasting of the existing telecoms regime. In many Asian, eastern European and Latin American countries, governments are now wooing foreign telecoms investors instead of seeking to fund expansion of their monopolies largely by taxing international calls. As a senior Chinese official put it recently: 'We used to think it was the roads that mattered: now we realise that telecoms links are more important, and a crucial agent for growth.' Perhaps in the true global village the motor car will be a quaint relic of the 20th century.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Fun with Faustus - Theatre Because it is so seldom performed one forgets just how much of Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus is made up of knock-about comedy rather than grand verse. The appearance of Helen of Troy and Faustus's immortal lines in response stick in the memory more than the seven deadly sins or the antics of Faustus and the friars in the Vatican. Yet the production at Greenwich, where Philip Franks moves from an acting to a directing role for the first time, has a good shot at putting it all together. Some details are perverse. The good and bad angels are a pretty scruffy pair of women, made peripheral to the story. Lucifer makes his first appearance in what look to be his underpants. The scene is set in a bed-sit, admittedly a very large one, possibly close to the University of Newcastle. One guesses the place because Jonathan Cullen's Faustus has a distinct Geordie accent - or has it become the fashion after Alan Cumming's Scottish Hamlet that heroes now come from the north? As a student he must be on a grant since, for such a learned man, he has very few books around. Presumably he borrows the key texts from the library. It takes time to adjust to this cultural shift. Mephistopheles helps to put it in place. Played by Hugh Ross, he is a very tall, suited figure in a long overcoat. He might be the vice-chancellor, or a senior, defeatist civil servant who has seen it all before; a very fine performance. Some of the high jinks come off remarkably well, especially the seven deadly sins. Pride appears through the mirror. Covetousness climbs cleverly out of a suitcase lying on the floor. Gluttony falls out of the fridge. Sloth crawls up through the sofa. Lechery looks all that her name implies, and more: it is entirely fitting that the same actress, Allie Byrne, should also play Helen. The Vatican scenes, where an invisible Faustus plays havoc with priestly rituals, come out on the right side of amusing. The horse coursing scene just misses, and this is the trouble with playing Faustus in full. The more low comedy there is, the more it distracts from the tragedy and poetry of Faustus the man. Playing the complete text means that Faustus only comes into his own towards the end when he has a sudden rush of spectacular speeches disproportionate to the rest of the piece. It is only shortly before he has but one bare hour to live that Cullen's Faustus emerges as a tragic hero. He delivers the wonderful final soliloquy with great passion and intelligence. One cannot help wondering, however, why he has to live in quite such drab surroundings. There is some very striking accompanying music to the play composed by Jeremy Sams, yet again it has the effect of being slightly too elegant for the set. Greenwich Theatre until December 11.

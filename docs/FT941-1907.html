			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trinity rises 32% to Pounds 19.9m - UK newspapers contributed lion's share of turnover and profits Trinity International, the Chester-based regional newspaper publisher, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.85m last year, an increase of 32 per cent on 1992's Pounds 15.09m, which was restated in accordance with FRS 3. Operating profits jumped from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 20.85m, including Pounds 418,000 from acquisitions. Mr Philip Graf, chief executive, said: 'This is our best operational performance to date.' Trinity, which owns daily newspapers in Liverpool and weeklies in Merseyside, North Wales, Canada and the US, has changed tack since 1989 by divesting from paper making and concentrating on newspaper publishing. Last year it fully integrated Scottish and Universal Newspapers, bought in 1992, and spent Pounds 12.4m buying Huddersfield Newspapers and Pounds 23.2m acquiring the newspaper interests of Argus Press, based in southern and south-east England. Turnover advanced by 16.5 per cent from Pounds 115.4m to Pounds 134.4m with UK newspapers responsible for Pounds 79.4m - 59 per cent of sales compared with 54 per cent. UK newspapers also made the lion's share of profits with Pounds 15.7m, or 75 per cent of the whole. Canadian and US operations benefited from senior management changes, new titles and marketing initiatives, improving profit contributions to Pounds 2.99m (Pounds 1.77m) in Canada and Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 1.81m) in the US. Gearing rose from 14.5 per cent to 50 per cent, reflecting the latest acquisitions which pushed up net debt to Pounds 44.2m from Pounds 11.9m. Earnings per share show a 40 per cent rise to 20.2p (14.4p restated). A proposed final dividend of 6.7p (6p) lifts the total by 1p to 9.7p. Mr Graf said Trinity would be trying to expand further by innovation, product development and acquisition, but was not at present involved in serious discussions over buying more newspapers. This year 'has started encouragingly.' UK advertising sales volume was growing but the performance was mixed by category and geography. 'The strength of the economic recovery would depend on the impact of April's tax rises on consumer confidence. Overall, the company expected 'further progress' this year. Analysts suggested that Trinity's prospects will be tied closely to the UK economic upturn now that acquisitions are becoming harder to find. It will, however, be able to squeeze more costs out of the Argus titles. They are among the last in western Europe where journalists still use typewriters. Moving to computerised direct input and cutting out a stage in the production process should yield gains in productivity and profitability over the next two or three years.</p>

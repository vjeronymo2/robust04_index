			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRSICH WINS TWICE AT VENTURA RACEWAY  </P> <P> Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme won both the Street Stock and figure-eight main  events at Ventura Raceway on Friday night.  </P> <P> Eric Griffin of Oxnard led the tightly contested 15-lap Street Stock main event  until the final turn.  </P> <P> Griffin, Don Green of Ventura and Dave Hume of Ventura all tangled high in Turn  4 and Firsich cut underneath the careening cars to beat Griffin by a car  length. Hume was third.  </P> <P> Firsich moved within 10 points of the figure-eight season points leader, John  Csorba of Oxnard, with a much easier victory in the 12-lap figure-eight main  event.  </P> <P> Firsich led wire-to-wire as Csorba missed the race because of a broken rear  axle on his Monte Carlo.  </P> <P> The break was sustained in an earlier heat race.  </P> <P> Cory Kruseman of Ventura won his second consecutive 12-lap Mini-Stock  figure-eight main event.  </P></p>

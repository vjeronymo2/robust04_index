			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Kansai lifts deal goes to Swiss SCHINDLER, the Swiss lifts and escalators group, has seen the first pay-off from its decision three years ago to step up its presence in the Japanese market, Ian Rodger reports from Zurich. It has won a SFr6.6m (Pounds 2.59m) contract to supply escalators and elevators for the new Kansai international airport near Osaka. Schindler acquired a Japanese lifts company, Nippon Elevator, in 1988. 'It was important to get in to the Japanese market, because the Jap-anese companies Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi are our major competitors in Asia-Pacific markets,' the Swiss company said. Schindler, in a joint venture with Marubeni of Japan, was the only non-Japanese supplier to share in the lifts deal.</p>

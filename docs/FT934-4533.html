			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Mayhew gives clearer indication of differences with Dublin Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave the clearest public signal so far by a government minister about the nature of differences between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland. He also hinted that the government could be close to proposing the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. Such a move would be seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to the province's Unionist majority. In his second Commons appearance this week Sir Patrick was asked by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary: 'Do you acknowledge the value of the goal of a united Ireland?' The question was similar to one in a leaked draft Dublin position paper which is privately acknowledged to be among the principal sticking-points over an agreed framework for a settlement. Sir Patrick's reply - that the government could not 'join the ranks of the persuaders' - underlined London's unwillingness to back down on the issue. He said: 'We believe that it should be for the people of Northern Ireland to determine for themselves without persuasion from us whether they wish to remain in the UK or no.' Sir Patrick offered encouragement to supporters of a Northern Ireland select committee. In a carefully worded answer to Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Sir Patrick said: 'It might be said that there is some value in having a select committee looking at the affairs of Northern Ireland, rather than having six separate select committees taking part of Northern Ireland's affairs into their ambit. 'There has been much said here about the need to reduce the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland.' But Sir Patrick disagreed with an assertion by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, that restoring accountable democracy to Northern Ireland was 'a necessary first step' to restoring stability 'and subsequently peace'. He acknowledged that there was 'a good measure of agreement' on the need for new political institutions in the province. Mr Major later spoke of an 'overwhelming feeling' that the government should strive for peace in Northern Ireland, but added: 'There are parameters to those discussions - and that must be understood.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Japan-U.S. trade talks will  remain deadlocked due to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  announcement that he intends to resign, a high-ranking official  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Friday  [8 April].    "Though the bilateral trade framework talks are likely to  resume between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor next week, the development will be  unclear," said the official.    Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco, next  week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded  in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.    "I had believed Hosokawa may announce his intention to step  down around weekend but today's sudden announcement is a  betrayal against expectation of most Japanese," the official who  asked not to be identified.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Dollar driven to new lows as traders remain wary: Clinton fails to dispel fears of policy of benign neglect on currency Foreign exchange traders yesterday delivered their judgment upon the Group of Seven's unwillingness to intervene in currency markets by driving the US dollar to record lows. Markets ignored efforts by Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to dispel the impression that he favoured a policy of benign neglect towards the dollar. He told reporters after meeting German chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn that the US would not use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy. The US currency resumed its slide yesterday amid disappointment in the the markets that the G7 summit of leading industrial nations in Naples had not agreed a plan for concerted interest rate moves and co-ordinated intervention to support the dollar. In Tokyo early this morning it slipped to Y97.3 amid reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan after finishing in New York at Y97.725. In London, the US currency fell to a postwar low of Y97.365, down from Friday's close of Y98.575. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM1.54, down from DM1.5741 on Friday. In New York it fell below DM1.52, its lowest level since October 1992, before finishing the day at DM1.5280. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, speaking at a meeting of EU finance ministers yesterday, defended the approach adopted by the G7. He said: 'We did enough. Now we will see what the markets will do.' The dollar's weakness against the yen had been temporarily arrested by worries about repercussions from the death of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. However, the G7's widely predicted decision not to refer to currencies in its communique was taken by traders as a further reason to sell the US currency. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and his economic team have recently made efforts to combat the market's view that the US is prepared to allow the dollar to drift. However, this view gained renewed credence from Mr Clinton's comments at the weekend which gave the impression that he would rather sanction a weaker dollar than higher interest rates. Analysts stressed, however, that the fairly relaxed attitude of the authorities confirmed the dollar was in gradual decline rather than facing a crisis. Its trade weighted value also remains more than 10 per cent above the lows it reached in 1992. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at the Industrial Bank of Japan in London, said: 'The G7 partners at this stage do not agree that concerted intervention could contain the dollar's decline. They have admitted implicitly that there is very little that they can do.' He added that in the context of the G7's strong commitment to free markets 'it would be illogical to stand in the way of a move that is clearly a reflection of changing market fundamentals'. Apart from the disappointment of the G7 summit, analysts said concern that the US Federal Reserve has not moved sufficiently aggressively to combat inflationary pressures in the economy had also contributed to the dollar's current weakness.

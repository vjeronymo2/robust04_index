			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters were generally negative in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the facility's financial condition as a factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting the amount of penalty and offered the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arguments about this policy:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It is not equitable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It would result in inconsistent civil money penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the same deficiency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Poorly managed and/or not-for-profit facilities should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be excused or pay a lower civil money penalty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It discriminates against facilities that are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It is inappropriate if the facility can not appeal the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the penalty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Neither the Secretary nor the States have adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to evaluate a facility's financial condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It would be difficult to apply objectively and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an audit of the facility; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The regulation does not clarify how financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is obtained, who evaluates this information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if it will be available promptly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter requested that we remove a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial condition as a factor and consider instead the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location of the facility and the percent of Medicaid or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare patient days relative to the total patient days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters suggested including the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of culpability as a factor in determining the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the civil money penalty as mentioned in the preamble of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In determining the amount of the penalty,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1128A of the Act, which is incorporated by reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to consider specific matters and also provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to take into account any other items relevant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the penalty determination. We are requiring the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also consider these specific matters to make Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific matters the Secretary and the State must take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account, as stipulated in section 1128A of the Act, include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility's degree of culpability, history of prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offenses and financial condition. Therefore, we cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove financial condition as the commenters suggested, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are revising redesignated &sect;488.438(f) to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's degree of culpability, which was inadvertently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> omitted from the proposed regulatory text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We explain in &sect;488.438 what we mean by ``culpability'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the context of provider certification. Section 1128A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizes civil money penalties for criminal or quasi-criminal acts, such as, false claims or claims for charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in excess of those permitted by law. The intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who commits one of these acts plays a prominent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role in determining the amount of the civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if this individual submits a false claim while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the influence of drugs or the individual has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> psychiatric condition, that person's culpability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting false claims may be reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enforcement provisions for civil money penalties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) incorporate section 1128A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act and require a consideration of a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culpability in determining the amount of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty. However, this consideration is not limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations in which a provider ``intends'' for a situation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance to exist. In fact, a facility is culpable if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance causing harm or placing a resident at risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm is intentional or is a product of neglect, indifference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or disregard. While a facility's culpability for serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance is a factor in the determination of the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the civil money penalty, the absence of culpability is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a factor, as a facility is always fully responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the health and safety of its residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked that we specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define ``history'' as used at proposed &sect;488.230(g)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that the facility's history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior compliance only include the period of operation under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Information concerning a facility's history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance, as discussed with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.438(f)(1) of the final rule, is maintained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State survey agency, the HCFA regional office and the Online  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survey Certification and Reporting system (OSCAR). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSCAR system can provide facility specific reports from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four most recent surveys. We do not accept the comment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility's history of prior noncompliance only include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of the current owner because when a change of ownership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs, all Medicare penalties and sanctions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically assigned to the new owner or owners with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of the two year restriction on Nurse Aide Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Competency Evaluation Programs (which is explained later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this preamble).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

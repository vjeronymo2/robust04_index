			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (AFP)--France on Saturday called  for an "explanation" from China after the arrest of another  Chinese dissident as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  arrived in Shanghai on an official visit.    Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the  request had been decided after the arrest Friday evening of  dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based  Chinese Human Rights Association.    "This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to  appreciate it," Juppe said. "We have asked for an explanation,  and we are awaiting a reply."    Only hours after Wang's arrest, another leading dissident,  Bao Ge, was picked up by police in Shanghai, a dissident source  said. Bao was the fifth pro-democracy campaigner to be detained  in China in eight days.    Balladur told journalists that he may make a public  statement  on the wave of arrests later Saturday.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt ruling on vehicle taxes goes against EU A dispute settlement panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has ruled in favour of the US on most of the EU complaints brought against US laws regulating vehicle fuel economy and luxury taxes. The decision is also a setback for US opponents of the new Uruguay Round deal, who have argued that the 'faceless bureaucrats' in Geneva will force the US to change environmental and consumer laws. The panel ruled in the EU's favour on one issue - that accounting rules, established under the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy law (Cafe) were inconsistent with Gatt. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would not ask Congress to change the rules, as they 'do not have any actual economic impact on EU auto manufacturers and therefore no trade damage results'. In a written statement, US officials said Gatt had found for the first time that conservation measures 'could excuse a country's law that was otherwise inconsistent with the Gatt'. Gatt set up an independent disputes panel in May 1993 to examine the EU's allegation that US car taxes discriminate against European exports. The EU claimed European car makers were paying a disproportionate share of the three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption, while the third is a luxury tax on cars costing over Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,000). Brussels had said the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was Dollars 558m, of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars. European manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the Cafe law, 80 per cent of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and 80 per cent of the luxury tax. European cars had just 4 per cent of the US car market. The EU argued that Cafe payments in discriminated against European luxury car makers, as they were based on the sales-weighted average fuel consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars in a range of sizes, and Japanese makers of mostly small, fuel-efficient cars, do not incur penalties. The Cafe limits for company cars set an average fleet standard of 27.5 miles per gallon (8.8 litres per 100km) and vehicles with a worse mileage are taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve less than 22.5 mpg. Friends of the Earth in Washington, an environmental group, says the Cafe law has led to savings of over 2.5m barrels of oil a day.</p>

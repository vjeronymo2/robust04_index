			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS  </P> <P> How can the people of Israel, proud heritors of a tradition of literacy and  scholarship, tolerate a government which denies education to Palestinians on  the pretext of "military necessity" (Part I, May 17)? I am so reminded of the  antebellum Southern policy of forbidding education of slaves that I cannot help  wondering about the obvious parallelism between these two situations.  </P> <P> HORACE GAIMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

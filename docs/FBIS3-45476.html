Statistics from the provincial government show that last  year  the province's agricultural output totaled 68.3 billion yuan  (about 7.85 billion U.S. dollars), up by three percent over the  previous year.    Farmers' per capita income hit 1,600 yuan, up by ten percent  in real terms.    Last year, the province was hit by successive natural  adversities such as cold waves, hail, storms and typhoons, with  direct losses totaling 12.2 billion yuan.    Government officials attribute the increase to the  dissemination of improved grain varieties and cash crops, and a  better development of livestock and some poultry.    In addition, the province has been putting great emphasis on  fostering agricultural bases for the production of fine grains,  vegetables and fruits.</p>

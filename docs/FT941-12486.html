			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Forte spreads wings - New issues Forte is spinning off its airport services division, which will become known as Alpha Airports Group and have a market capitalisation of Pounds 211.1m, writes David Blackwell. Shares in the company, the turnover of which is roughly divided between in-flight catering and retail outlets at airports, have been priced at 140p. Pro forma earnings per share are 8.75p, giving a multiple of 16. Half of the 113.09m ordinary shares are being placed firmly by UBS with institutions. A quarter of the total (39.58m) will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Forte is retaining the remaining 25 per cent. The total value of the flotation to Forte, including Alpha's assumption of total debts of Pounds 30m, is Pounds 241m. The price looks seems to be pitched about right for both Forte and potential investors. The flight catering side should benefit from growth in international air travel, which should also provide the less profitable retail side with more customers. Alpha is expecting profits to rise 19 per cent to Pounds 20.6m on turnover of Pounds 423.1m for the year ending January 31. The City is looking for growth of around 13 per cent in the coming year, giving earnings of 10p. The many bio-technology companies coming to the market is about to be weighed down with another arrival - Chiroscience, the developer of single isomer drugs, writes Tim Burt. Single isomers differ from most organic drugs because they act faster and with fewer side-effects than existing twin isomer products. At first glance, such companies are not enticing. Profits are unlikely for some years and their research could prove fruitless if regulatory approval is withheld. But if the drugs fulfil their promise, the rewards are rich. Chiroscience claims it can reduce the risk while holding out the prospect of a major breakthrough by 1998. It has offset recent losses through sales of single isomer compounds, or synthons, which earned Pounds 1.34m in the six months to August 31. Nevertheless, development of its own single isomer products requires major investment - hence the float. The offer and placing by Robert Fleming is expected to raise Pounds 36m, primarily to develop the single isomer business. But analysts are not sure the potential breakthrough warrants a price of 150p. Applications close on Thursday.</p>

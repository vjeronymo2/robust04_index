			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Technology (Software At Work): Consultant's critique The contract to develop the systems for the Olympics is ideal for any ambitious software house. The client is keen to succeed on a worldwide stage. Once the event is over, however, the system never has to work again - no lengthy support or maintenance problems to contend with. This is significant since 70 per cent of project costs are incurred in maintenance and updates. The software house benefits in that it is free to sell its experience and skills, but not necessarily the original software, to another Olympic committee - for the Atlanta Games in 1996 - without the responsibilities of owning the system. Internationalisation is always an issue. In this case, four languages were supported and they all share similar letters and accents (unlike English/Japanese). However, it is still a complex operation to ensure that all the keyboards are handled correctly. French typists, for example, use an AZERTY layout (describing the keys along the first row of letters), rather than the QWERTY layout favoured by their English-speaking counterparts. These risks and complexities gave rise to the enormous fees that were charged for the software development. The Pounds 10m for the SIGO system should have bought around 100 man-years of development and testing. This might appear to be overkill for a one-off project. It all seems to have worked. Whether the cost and the event's consequent effect on the local economy is justified have yet to be seen. The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

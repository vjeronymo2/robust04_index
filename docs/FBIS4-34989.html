			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 27 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina said today that he would never approve an  invasion of an American nation, thereby ruling out unofficial  reports that the United States could invade Haiti in order to  return democracy to that nation. Reina stressed that even if  the United Nations made this request, he would not support an  initiative to invade another nation.    The Honduran president also confirmed that his country is a  favorite for the establishment of a regional center to combat  drug trafficking. This issue was discussed on Saturday during  the visit of William Perry, the U.S. secretary of defense. "We  are no longer in the context of the Cold War. We are no longer  in the stage of a war of polarized blocs. This is why we want  to take advantage of international cooperation to defend  ourselves from vices such as drug trafficking and other world  scourges," he said. According to Perry, the installation of a  regional center to combat drug trafficking means the possible  transfer to Honduras of the aircraft the United States has in  the Southern Command bases in Panama.    This does not mean that the U.S. military presence would  increase in Honduras where currently approximately 1,200  soldiers are stationed. These soldiers are replaced every three  to four months. Rather, Reina noted, this would mean "more  dialogue." Reina recalled that military relations between  Honduras and the United States are outlined in an agreement that  goes back to 1954. The Honduran Legislative Assembly did not  see the agreement when it was signed, he noted. In this regard,  he indicated that any agreement on new military relations with  the United States should be discussed by the Legislative  Assembly.    The president said that the presence of drug traffickers in  his country is on the rise, which he labeled as "very serious."  Therefore, he noted, all the nations need help and Honduras  should take advantage of its "prime" geographic position. The  regional center could operate in Palmerola, a local air base  constructed by the U.S. Army in the eighties when Washington  attempted -- without success -- to topple Nicaragua's Sandinist  regime through the "contras," who it armed and financed in  Honduras. Palmerola is located approximately 80 km north of  Tegucigalpa and its runway has the capacity to receive any type  of combat plane or the gigantic C-5 Galaxy.</p>

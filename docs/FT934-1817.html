			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Probe faults nine out of 10 pension transfers Only one in 10 cases where individuals transferred savings out of employers' pension schemes into private plans was handled in line with regulatory requirements, according to a pilot study published yesterday. The report was produced by the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. It covers 2 1/2 years from the start of 1991. The overall figure for unsatisfactory cases shows that guidance issued by the regulators improved standards to some extent. Before they acted, 95 per cent of cases were unsatisfactory, although even afterwards this figure had dropped only to 80 per cent. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said the report showed why the board announced last week it was taking steps to prevent such low standards and to ensure that people affected by bad advice could be fully compensated. Privately, however, some other regulators have expressed dissatisfaction at the way the SIB has handled the issue. They have doubts about drawing conclusions from a sample of 735 cases, when there were about 300,000 pension transfers in the period covered by the report. Within the industry, some leading pension providers intend to respond and make clear their view that they are not implicated in the report's findings. Life insurance company shares closed 2.5 per cent down yesterday although the FT-SE 100 index was 1 per cent up at a new high. The study came as MPs on the influential cross-party Treasury committee announced that its next inquiry, starting in late January, would be into the regulation of financial services, and would include the handling of these pension transactions. The MPs held preliminary sessions with Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, and Mr Large earlier in the year, and both will be recalled. Other regulators will also be asked for evidence early in the new year, together with leading figures in the industry, such as Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life insurance company. Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the committee, said the government's belief that there was still no case for statutory regulation of financial services would be one of the 'assumptions we will want to test quite rigorously'. The KPMG study referred only to pension transfer business handled by advisers and sales agents regulated by Fimbra, Lautro and Imro, three retail financial services regulators. It did not cover organisations regulated directly by the SIB, such as banks and building societies dealing in this area, since it was the SIB's concern about the widespread non-compliance within its own constituency that prompted it to question the pension transfer business being monitored by other regulators.

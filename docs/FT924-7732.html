			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: SE lifts suspension on GPG GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment vehicle, is due to return to the stock market on Monday after agreeing with the Stock Exchange that a suspension lasting nearly two years should be lifted. The Exchange suspended GPG in 1990 because it was regarded as a 'shell' company without any real underlying businesses. GPG has since been restructured. Although the company is still only a holding company, the Exchange has withdrawn its reservations. GPG's main asset is a 54.6 per cent stake in Tyndall Australia, a life insurance and fund management company. GPG also owns 86.3 per cent of MEM, a small Australian resources company, Eagle, a US investment manager, and various other listed and unlisted investments. GPG had proforma net assets per share of 16.2p at the end of October. Its shares, which also trade in New Zealand, closed at 15.1p yesterday. Mr Blake Nixon, director, said the company was looking to make small investments in UK 'special situations' to balance its portfolio better. The company generates no turnover in the UK at present. It does not plan to pay dividends, partly because of advance corporation tax liability and partly because it hopes for capital growth. GPG was last month criticised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which oversees corporate reporting, for adopting newly drafted accounting standards too hastily in order to flatter profits. The standards have now come into force, so the results were allowed to stand. The company is changing its year end and in the nine months to June 30 reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.15m. This compared with Pounds 10.9m in the year to September 30, since adjusted to a loss of Pounds 27.4m to reflect goodwill previously written off. Tyndall Australia reported a sharp decline in pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 of ADollars 3.59m (Pounds 1.63). This compared with profits of Dollars 12.9m in the year to December 31. Mr Nixon said the company witnessed a weak first quarter, but the second half is expected to be better. The company has retained losses of Dollars 19.3m. GPG will hold an extraordinary meeting next year and proposes to change its name back to Guinness Peat Group, as it was known until 1987.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jocelyn Ford] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's resignation announcement Friday may keep Japan-U.S.  relations in the deep freeze just as a thaw seemed to be in the  offing, political analysts said.    But some analysts said bilateral relations could take a new  twist in the not too distant future, depending on who replaces  Hosokawa.    Hosokawa's resignation announcement amid allegations of  financial misdeeds came a week before Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata was expected to call for early resumption of the stalled  trade talks in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor.    The two were scheduled to meet at a multilateral ministerial  meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in  Marrakesh, Morocco.    But Hata's name has emerged as a likely successor to  Hosokawa.    "Everything will have to wait until after the formation of a  new cabinet. We will have to make another fresh effort to  explore ways to resume trade talks," said an official involved  in Japan-U.S. trade relations.    While Japan is unlikely to change its support for a free  world trading system or rethink its rejection of U.S. demands to  introduce numerical indicators to guide trade, the next leader  could take a different approach, the official said.    If leadership reverts to a more experienced politician, the  old- style power structures could come back into play, namely  collusive deal-making among politicians, bureaucrats and  business that Hosokawa vowed to break, he said.    While this could make it easier for the United States to  pressure Japan into delivering on demands, it could also slow  down Hosokawa's efforts to free business from heavy-handed  government controls -- a move also applauded by Washington.    The U.S. has been fumbling in its relations with Japan in  part because it could not grasp the power structure of  Hosokawa's seven- party coalition government, the first  non-Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government to rule in 38  years, claimed Ikuo Kabashima, professor of Political Science at  Tsukuba University.    If Hata, a close associate of Ichiro Ozawa, the key  behind-the- scenes player in the coalition government, emerges  as next prime minister, "the U.S. can feel comfortable because  it knows it can deal with him," said Kabashima.    That has some bureaucrats worried.    Although Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed in  February to come up with an agreement on contentious trade  issues, some Japanese diplomats regard the breakdown in trade  talks as an opportunity to establish a new style of working  relationship.    "Ozawa likes the traditional type of management where he  resolves friction by pressuring interest groups, and he is not  the type of person who really pushes for market principles,"  said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.    "If we go back to the traditional way it would not be  instrumental in making a new partnership," he said.    But other sources here are confident that no new leader can  reverse the legacy Hosokawa established during his brief  eight-month stay in office.    Hosokawa, a former governor who rocketed to power last  summer  after the LDP lost its majority in the House of Representatives,  leaves office with support ratings hovering around 50 percent.    While this is down over 20 percentage points from his early  ratings, Hosokawa remains more popular than many of his LDP  predecessors who were at the height of their careers.    Merle Okawara, vice president of the American Chamber of  Commerce in Japan, lauded Hosokawa for ushering in many reforms  that more experienced LDP prime ministers had failed to achieve.    "At least he got the machinery going in the right direction,  which is good for U.S. businesses in Japan," she said, noting he  partially liberalized the rice market, achieved political reform  and was making headway on tax reforms.    Political reform had unseated Hosokawa's two immediate  predecessors -- Kiichi Miyazawa and Toshiki Kaifu, both of the  LDP.    Hosokawa said he was resigning because the budget was  blocked  in parliament by the opposition LDP, which demanded he respond  to allegations over questionable handling of stock and real  estate deals, not because the people wanted him to resign, said  Okawara.    "The machinery is in place and whoever follows him will have  to continue because otherwise he will be very unpopular," she  said.</p>

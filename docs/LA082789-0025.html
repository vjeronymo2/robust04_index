			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ARMY IS A JUGGERNAUT, NOT A LIGHT BRIGADE  </P> <P> Why an Army? What does the Army do better than anyone else? For Michael P. W.  Stone, the new secretary of the Army, those are fundamental questions, for they  will determine how the Army of the 1990s will be manned, organized, trained and  equipped.  </P> <P> The missions of the Navy and the Air Force are easily understood. The Navy  sails and the Air Force flies. While they have their own internal squabbles --  among the surface Navy, the "Airedales" and the submariners, for example; or  among the fighter pilots, the bomber pilots, the transport pilots and,  increasingly, the silo sitters of our missile forces -- the question of "Why a  Navy?" or "Why an Air Force?" seldoms arises. The answers are self-evident.  </P> <P> And that's generally true for the Marine Corps as well, now that the drift  toward "heavying-up" has been reversed and the Marines once again have  committed themselves to being the nation's expeditionary force, a role for  which they are particularly well suited.  </P> <P> At one time the Army was the nation's senior service (as the Royal Navy is  Great Britain's senior service), and everything else existed to bolster and  support its mission: control of land. As the Navy War College put it in 1942,  man does not live on the sea or in the air. He lives on land. Therefore control  of land is war's ultimate aim.  </P> <P> But with the beginning of the Atomic Age the need for armies seemingly  vanished. Wars would henceforth be fought with nuclear weapons and would be  over within minutes before armies could even be mobilized. The coup de grace  was administered by none other than Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Army's greatest  hero, when he announced his budget-driven strategy of "massive retaliation," in  which almost total reliance for America's defenses was placed on nuclear  weapons.  </P> <P> Subsequent world events proved this strategy (and the follow-on nuclear-based  flexible response strategy) nonsensical. The Arab-Israeli wars, the Vietnam  War, the Sino-Vietnamese war, the Falklands War, the war between Iran and Iraq  and all the others were fought with ground forces and with conventional, not  nuclear, weapons.  </P> <P> Given this record, you would think the Army would have regained its preeminent  position, but that has not been the case. The Army has yet to regain its soul  and still struggles to define its national defense role. The latest straw it  has grasped is the light division concept, where combat power and  sustainability have been sacrificed for rapid movement to world crisis areas.  </P> <P> But that's not what the Army does best. The Marines, with units already afloat  with the fleet, are much better trained, equipped and deployed for such  contingencies. And they have the not inconsiderable added advantage of being  seen by the American people and by potential adversaries as a temporary  expedient. "Send in the Marines" carries an entirely different  political-military message than does commitment of the Army.  </P> <P> A clue to what the Army does best was laid out in "Dispatches," Michael Herr's  outstanding book on the Vietnam War. Describing the Army's 1st Cavalry Division  relief of the besieged Marines at Khe Sanh, he tells how the division moved  forward. Slowly, ponderously, it advanced, emplacing its artillery and laying  out fields of fire at each step. As one step followed the other, it was like  the juggernaut: not very glamorous, not very exciting, but an absolutely  inexorable force that could not be stopped.  </P> <P> Instead of competing with the Marine Corps by forming light divisions, the Army  ought to have put its attention and its resources into its heavy forces -- the  mechanized and armored divisions that the Army alone possesses. The average  armored or mechanized division's 300 Abrams tanks, 300 Bradley infantry  fighting vehicles, and the self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzers and multiple  launch rocket systems of its division artillery provide an awesome array of  combat power capable of standing toe-to-toe and slugging it out with any enemy  force in the world.  </P> <P> "But they're not useful in low-intensity conflict," critics complain. That may  be, but do we really need more divisions for "low-intensity" conflict? When  what that requires cannot be met by the Marines' three-division expeditionary  force, or by the Army's Ranger Regiment, or its Special Forces units or  super-secret anti-terrorist forces, it should be obvious that the conflict is  no longer "low-intensity."  </P> <P> And when that happens, when it gets too tough for everyone else to handle,  that's the time to call on the juggernaut, otherwise known as the United States  Army. Defeating the enemy's land forces in order to break his will to resist  used to be what the U.S. Army was all about. It's time it once again  concentrated its resources and attention on that fundamental task.  </P></p>

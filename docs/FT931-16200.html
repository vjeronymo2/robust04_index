			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Oil disaster reopens US debate on safety: The lessons learnt after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez which could ultimately prove to be more than twice the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan coastal waters  - has triggered fresh discussion in the US about the kinds of counter-measures that are most effective in containing such accidents. The debate, once again pitting environmentalists against shippers and the oil industry, is focused on the tough new regulations on tanker safety being implemented as part of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, a law that some in the US say could serve as a model for UK or even Europe-wide legislation. The Valdez disaster spilled 11m gallons of oil, compared with a total of about 26m gallons aboard the Braer. Exxon, while harshly criticised in the US, eventually committed more than Dollars 1bn over 10 years to settle federal and state legal actions. Mr Daniel J. Weiss, an environmental expert at the Sierra Club in Washington, claims this amount is a pittance compared to the estimated Dollars 15bn of damage caused by the Valdez spill. But the heart of the US debate concerns the two most stringent provisions of the US oil pollution legislation - the requirement that all ships navigating in US waters and built after 1990 be double-hulled, and the fact that the liability of shipowners under federal law is unlimited in cases of gross negligence and may also be unlimited at the state level in a variety of circumstances. In its effort to weaken the double-hull requirement, the American Petroleum Institute (API) claimed that the cost of refitting double bottoms could be Dollars 4.6bn for the fleet of 153 US tankers, or Dollars 30m per vessel. Few in the US oil industry have liked the double-hull requirement. Mr Steve Hillyard, a spokesman for Chevron Shipping, believes 'double hulls are not the panacea for oil spill prevention' because they can only prevent the leakage of oil from a damaged tanker in certain circumstances, not in all cases. Mr Charles Di Bona, president of the API, the oil industry's main Washington lobbying association, notes the double-hull requirement 'is the law and we will comply with it'. But he too insists it is not at all clear that double hulling is the best technology: 'In the Shetland case, double hulling might have even hurt things. The space between the hulls could have taken in water and sunk the tanker." Mr Di Bona says there are alternative technologies such as a Swedish system for sealing the oil tanks that may prove equally effective. Environmental critics, such as Mr Weiss, say the lesson of the Valdez disaster for the UK is that 'the oil industry has no credibility when it comes to concern about oil spills.' He argues that after the Valdez affair the oil industry and the Bush administration weakened the OPA dramatically by extending the period before double hulling is required for all tankers to the year 2015, and by exempting barges. 'The reality,' says Mr Weiss, 'is that the cost of double hulling is far cheaper than the cost of oil spills." As far as liability is concerned, Mr Weiss claims unlimited liability 'is the only way we can ensure the companies have a stake in making sure they don't have accidents and behave more responsibly'. But Mr Di Bona complains that the OPA contains a set of conditions that in some cases are too harsh on liability and other issues. The heavy liability requirements, for example, have made insurance more expensive and forced some companies to self-insure. After the Braer disaster, the API issued a statement saying that while the Shetlands spill was regrettable, it should not overshadow the genuine progress being made in preventing and responding to oil spills in American waters. Chief among the developments in the US was the oil industry's agreement in 1990 to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), a non-profit company that will be the largest in the world when it becomes fully operational next summer. The MSRC - funded by 47 large US oil companies, shippers, utilities and pipeline operators - has a Dollars 400m budget for capital equipment and a Dollars 500m budget for operating expenses in its first five years. It has 400 full-time employees located at its Washington headquarters and at regional locations in New York, Miami, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Los Angeles and Seattle. The MSRC has 16 large offshore response vessels, each 210 ft long and with accommodation for 40 people, and with a recovery capacity of 10,000 barrels a day. The US debate also concerns whether detergent dispersants or mechanical removal devices such as skimmers are more effective. Mr John Costello, a retired Coast Guard Vice-Admiral, who is president of the MSRC, says he understands that chemical dispersants are used far more than skimmers in the UK. He believes more flexibility in UK response techniques would also be useful. Mr Costello says, however, that many states which oppose detergents on environmental grounds should reconsider. There is a broad consensus in the US that since the Valdez disaster there has been a steady improvement in developing oil spill responses be they the formation of the MSRC, the institution of broader sea lanes or improved training for tanker crew members. In 1991 there were only 1,000 barrels spilled in US waters, the lowest in 14 years. Observer, Page 13</p>

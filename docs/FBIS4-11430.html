			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 Apr (EFE) -- The 101 Haitians who  occupied UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) headquarters  in Santo Domingo on 22 April withdrew from those offices today.  Lamarre Germain, spokesman for the Haitian group, said they  voluntarily left after reaching a number of agreements, which he  did not describe, with UNHCR representative Juan Manuel Castro  Magluff.    The agreements, according to Germain, include the  acknowledgement that some of his fellow Haitians are political  refugees, but he did not disclose how many of them would receive  that status. Germain also said Castro Magluff arranged for all  of the Haitians to be lodged at a hotel in the high altitude  area of the Dominican capital and that, in addition, each of  them were given 500 pesos, the equivalent of $40. Germain said  the group will remain at the hotel under UN care until each  person's situation is individually examined.    Eleven of the 101 Haitians who occupied the UNHCR  headquarters were hospitalized and treated for tuberculosis and  diabetes, among other diseases. The Haitians, 40 men, 20 women,  and 32 children, occupied the UNHCR headquarters to gain  political refugee status in the Dominican Republic.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Push to save the Aral Sea The leaders of five nations have agreed on steps to prevent the Aral Sea in central Asia, one of the world's worst ecological disasters, from shrinking further, Reuter reports from Tashkent. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan set up a joint fund and permanent committee to try to save the sea and improve the health of people around it, officials said yesterday after meeting in the Uzbek city of Nukus. The Aral was once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake, but irrigation has sapped rivers and reduced it to a quarter of its size. As the sea shrivels, it leaves behind a sandy desert mixed with fertiliser toxins. Storms whip up toxic dust and deposit it as far as Pakistan, scientists say. The health of people living in the sea's basin has deteriorated sharply. Some scientists say 80 per cent of the women and children in the area suffer from anaemia. Infant mortality rates have soared and life expectancy has plunged. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, all former Soviet republics, pledged to pay 1 per cent of their 1994 budgets into the fund, said an official. Because of its financial crisis, Tajikistan was excused from contributing. Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said he would accept a limit on the water taken from the upper reaches of central Asia's two great rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which feed the Aral Sea. The US and the World Bank will give Kazakhstan Dollars 62m to help it protect its environment as it moves to drill oil in the Northern Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan's ecology minister said yesterday.</p>

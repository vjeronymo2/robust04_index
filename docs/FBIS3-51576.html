			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Venezuelan media monitored at Panama  Bureau have been observed to carry reportage and commentary on  reaction to the Venezuelan Government's implementation and  subsequent temporary suspension of the value-added tax (VAT).    Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish at 2350  GMT on 20 January, in its regularly scheduled "The News"  newscast, broadcasts a two-minute report that notes the people  of Venezuela had "serious doubts" about the VAT following its  implementation -- doubts that were never adequately addressed by  state agencies charged with regulating the tax. In turn, the  report adds, the VAT "shocked" consumers. After noting that the  VAT has been suspended, the report cuts a video recording of  Deputy Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ramirez Fernandez, who  says: "This is an executive branch decision that must be carried  out. Nevertheless, once the effects of the VAT have been  properly evaluated, it will be implemented once again."    The report then cuts to a video recording of private  economist Francisco Rodriguez, who says: "One of the VAT's main  benefits is that it will help cut the fiscal deficit, which in  turn will help reduce inflation and interest rates." The report  concludes with the announcer noting that economists agree that  the confusion Venezuela has experienced over the VAT's  implementation has occurred in other countries in which the tax  has been implemented.    A day earlier, Caracas Venezolana de Television broadcasts a  related report in its "The News" newscast at 1550 GMT on 19  January. This two-minute report cites other economists who say  the suspension of the tax was a "wise" move. Noting that the  VAT's future now depends on decisions to be made by the  administration of President-elect Rafael Caldera, the report  says most economists agree that the nation's fiscal deficit is  quite large, adding that sooner or later drastic measures will  have to be taken to control it. According to this report,  economists believe "the government should keep in mind that the  population is quite concerned and is in no way pleased with the  current conditions."    Meanwhile, Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish carries  two 350-word editorials on the VAT. On page 2 of its 19 January  edition, the newspaper says three things truly unite the  Venezuelan people: 1) opposition to the military draft, 2)  opposition to war in general, and 3) most recently, opposition  to the VAT. According to the editorial, "There is nothing more  unpleasant to Venezuelans than the VAT, and one is constantly  reminded of it whenever a purchase is made." The editorial adds  that with every purchase, the state reminds consumers that it is  dipping into their pockets. In turn, the editorial claims, if a  repeal of the VAT is indeed impossible, consumers should then  feel free to pressure the state into improving government  services.    Another editorial published on page 2 of its 18 January  edition notes that the Venezuelan Government has failed to act  swiftly and decidedly in terms of the VAT. The newspaper  criticizes the government for its hesitancy. The editorial  notes that, while the government has decided to suspend the tax  for retailers, importers and wholesalers still continue to  charge it. The editorial continues by saying that in October  1993, the government said the cost would not be transfered to  consumers, while, in reality, that is exactly what is taking  place.    According to the editorial, "Prices have increased three  times over the past four months, and all because of government  improvisations and contradictions in terms of this issue." The  editorial adds: "These contraditions have led to consumer  confusion, speculation, price controls, and lately to violent  disturbances in some areas. The perception is that in October  the government decided to suspend the VAT to consumers out of  fear that it would interfere with the elections. Now, it is  suspending it once again because violence has broken out." The  editorial concludes by saying it is time for the government to  take adequate measures to evaluate the true effects of  implementing the VAT.</p>

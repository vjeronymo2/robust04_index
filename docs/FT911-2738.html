			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Turn and turn again: The Gorbachev balancing act goes on 'We are making such a large turn that it is beyond anyone's dreams. No other people has experienced what has happened to us.' - Mikhail Gorbachev, speech in Khabarovsk, April 15 1991. The Soviet people have been told in the past week that their country is indeed making yet another 'large turn'. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, has signed a statement with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the leaders of eight other republics which commits them all to supporting order, ending strikes and the pursuit of an anti-crisis plan. The signing of this statement greatly helped Mr Gorbachev to defuse attacks from his hard-line critics at the party Central Committee plenum: his resignation offer completed their collapse. The world's greatest political acrobat, who has been on his knees in recent months, showed that he was merely crouching to take another gravity-defying bound. At the same plenum, Mr Valentin Pavlov, the squat, close-cropped bruiser who is his prime minister, said he was keen to form a 'more broadly-based' government composed of representatives from the republics and other non-communist political movements 'on the basis of compromise, law and order and democracy'. The party instantly professed itself overjoyed at the prospect of diluting its 73-year-old monopoly on power. Logically, this is momentous: it constitutes a series of events as important as any that have occurred in the six increasingly lean years of perestroika. In Moscow, however, rats are being smelled. Why has Mr Yeltsin signed a statement that promises repressive measures against the strikers he has backed? Why has Mr Gorbachev, who said at the beginning of the year that the preservation of the Union was his 'sacred task', apparently promised independence to those republics which want it? Why is Mr Pavlov now so accommodating after saying on Monday that coalition governments were 'not my business' - and what terms is he offering, and to whom? Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the clever young economist who was the Russian government's deputy premier, says that the Soviet Union faces, all at once, movements and transformations which in other countries had taken centuries or at least decades. These were, first, the creation of a civil society; second, a series of liberation movements, freeing themselves from empire; and third, the restructuring of the economy. Taken together, these added up not to a crisis but to a profound and unprecedentedly radical transformation. Can these vast, diverse movements be handled through political institutions: or is an explosion, sooner or later, inevitable? The main institutional medium adopted by the Gorbachev-Pavlov government for attempting the transformation is its anti-crisis plan. As presented, rather fragmentarily, by Mr Pavlov, it is a middle course between two 'extremes': doing nothing (certainly an extreme course in today's Soviet Union) and adopting a plan of the type adumbrated by Mr Yavlinsky and Professor Stanislav Shatalin last year, and known as the '500-day programme'. He claims the first would see a drop in production of 20 per cent and a total of 13m-18m unemployed; the second a drop in production of one third and more than 30m unemployed. Mr Pavlov's plan would mean production falling by about 13 per cent, and unemployment rising by less (he does not say how much). Its claim to effectiveness is thus that it is the best of a string of bad options. Its main provisions, shrouded in ambiguity, are to stop inflation by controlling the money supply and cutting subsidies; to recover the revenues stripped from the union budget by the refusal of the republics to hand over their agreed contributions. All decisions taken by republican governments which run counter to this will be suspended; to stimulate enterprises by reducing profit taxes and allowing the retention of hard currency where the profits are invested in the production of consumer goods; to encourage foreign investment through the granting of concessions, allowing the repatriation of profits in hard currency; to conclude an agreement between government, management and labour on wages which would tie wage rises to increased production and productivity; to 'destatise' medium and large enterprises by transforming them into shareholding companies (with shares held initially by the Union and republican governments) to 'privatise' small businesses and shops as soon as possible. For the influential critics on the liberal wing the programme is largely seen as a sham. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former presidential economic adviser, says it is 'a ruse to convince our western partners that we are going to abide by the ideas of a market economy'. The leadership, he said, had plans neither to control inflation nor the military industrial complex, a 'monster whose appetites need to be cut back'. Professor Anders Aslund, the knowledgeable director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and East European Economy, told an IMF/World Bank forum in Washington on Thursday that the plan did not address the root issues - a budget deficit of between 15 and 20 per cent and the explosion of wages and loss of monetary control. 'It is really difficult to imagine a worse policy than the Soviet government currently pursues,' he said, forecasting an 'authoritarian stabilisation' later this year. To these and similar critiques, Mr Pavlov and his followers increasingly stress the Russian-ness of the raw material with which they are working. In their view Russian-ness - seven decades of communism after centuries of a pre-capitalist, serf-owning militarised society - means everything must be taken slowly and carefully. This could be sensible - or a mere rationalisation for inertia or, worse, for a party bureaucracy and hierarchy which refuses to change. Yet the political underpinning for a still undefined stabilisation seems to be slotting into place. Mr Yeltsin, justifying his volte-face to his own supporters on Thursday, talked of new freedoms for the republics and a Gorbachev resigned to accepting that they would determine the shape of the union treaty (and the union constitution), not the centre. The statement also holds out the prospect of new union elections by the end of the year: the tantalising prospect is, does this include an election of the union president? It is fearsomely fragile. The economy continues to plunge. The government is unpopular, and will have to effect a really radical change in its membership. This could perhaps resemble that which followed the round table talks in Poland two years ago, after which (the lesson has been well learned here) the communists dropped from real power like a stone. The Baltic republics, with Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia do not want to join the new union. The hardliners may have missed taking Mr Gorbachev's head, but they live to growl, and perhaps strike, another day. For the moment, a 'large turn' is official policy once more. How far will it get this time round?</p>

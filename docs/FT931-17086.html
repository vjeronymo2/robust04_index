			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banque Indosuez sets up FFr600m HQ leaseback BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank which has been one of the most prominent casualties of the Paris property crisis, has concluded a FFr600m (Dollars 109m) sale and leaseback deal for its headquarters with an unnamed French bank. The leaseback deal, which should produce a profit of almost FFr600m, follows shortly after Suez, the French industrial and financial group that owns Indosuez, announced that it was pumping FFr900m into the bank in a recapitalisation package intended to compensate for the losses on its property portfolio. The precarious state of the Paris property sector emerged as a serious problem last year for a number of French financial institutions. Paris property has been in the doldrums for three years, during which average rentals have fallen by 20 per cent. As a result many of the banks and insurance companies, which are the main investors in the market, have taken significant losses on their property holdings. Indoseuz alone saw its net profits for the first half of 1992 fall to just FFr82m from FFr517m in the same part of 1991 after it was forced to treble its provisions to FFr1.39bn. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman of Indosuez, said at the time that he hoped to avoid making a loss for the full year. The proceeds of the leaseback of the bank's grandiose head office on Boulevard Haussmann should eradicate that risk. The transaction will also bolster Suez, which has been hit by the property problems of Banque La Henin, another subsidiary. The deal comes while Suez is under pressure from Union des Assurances de Paris, the largest French insurer which is one of its biggest shareholders, over the latter's unsuccessful attempts to acquire control of Colonia, one of Suez's German subsidiaries. A number of French companies have recently negotiated sale and leaseback deals as part of capital-raising exercises.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Market focus remains on dollar The dollar looks set to remain the focus of attention this week after widespread central bank intervention last Wednesday to support the US currency. The market is watching to see what action the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank take to shift interest rates in a way likely to support last week's intervention effort, and the dollar. The initial focus is on the US Federal Reserve. Many in the market believe there is a good chance the Fed will raise rates today. If not today, then by May 17 when the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets. If excuse for tightening were needed, it came last Friday in the form of buoyant April employment figures. Jobs rose by 267,000, compared with a market forecast of 170,000, providing confirmation that the US economy continues to grow strongly. The refunding on Tuesday and Wednesday of Dollars 29bn of US treasuries is also likely to play an important part in the Fed's thinking. If the risk of the dollar weakening is still substantial, then overseas investors are less likely to participate. April PPI and CPI data are also likely to influence monetary policy. A firm view has emerged in the market that a decisive move from the Fed is necessary to curb the dollar's decline, and arrest the related weakness in the US bond market. This would involve the discount and federal funds rates rising by 50 basis points. So far, in the three policy tightenings over the past three months, the Fed has moved rates in 25 basis point increments. However, analysts argue that this is destabilising for the dollar and US asset markets as it leaves investors perpetually waiting for the next tighten-ing. The argument for a decisive move is that it would calm market nerves if it was sufficient to show that interest rates have reached a medium-term plateau. The discount rate is currently 3 per cent, and the Fed funds rate 3.75 per cent. Another key factor in the fate of the dollar is the Bundesbank. Were the German central bank to cut its discount rate at its council meeting on Wednesday, this should lend support to the dollar by shifting the interest rate differential in the US's favour. Sterling will also be in focus following last week's drubbing in local elections for the Conservative Party. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has made it clear that he will resist pressure to resign, but the instability of his position is likely to put a dampener on the pound.</p>

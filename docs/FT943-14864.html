			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Groups link in multimedia ventures Two competing electronics industry partnerships, both aimed at the emerging market for equipment used to provide interactive multimedia services, were announced yesterday. Sun Microsystems, the US computer company, has paired with Thomson Consumer Electronics of France, while Digital Equipment, one of the largest US computer manufacturers, will collaborate with General Instrument, a leading US manufacturer of television set-top decoder boxes for the cable-TV industry. Sun and TCE said they would form a jointly-funded business unit that would develop and market 'end-to-end solutions' for interactive television, home shopping, distance learning and other on-line business and personal services. Products will range from video servers to digital set-top devices. Sun will contribute networking technologies and system management software. TCE will draw upon its consumer products, compression and decoder technologies. The Sun-TCE venture will compete directly with the marketing alliance announced by Digital Equipment and General Instrument, which is similarly aimed at providing 'end-to-end interactive video system solutions'. The jointly marketed systems will include Digital's video interactive information technology and GI's encryption and decoder technologies.</p>

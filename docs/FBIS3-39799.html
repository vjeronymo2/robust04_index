			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling report: "Kinkel Praises Russia for Its </F> Bosnian Initiative"]    [Text] Bonn -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) thinks that Serbia's yielding in  Sarajevo is due to the "seriousness of the NATO ultimatum," the  "initiative" of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and  Washington's "more intensive involvement."    In an interview with WELT AM SONNTAG, Kinkel stressed that  the Serbs' giving in is "a great success for NATO. I am sure  that the Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo would not have reacted in  this way without the massive NATO threat." NATO is "firmly  determined to maintain its ultimatum and to really get down to  business if the conditions are not fulfilled."    Kinkel praised the Russian initiative for Bosnia. For Bonn  it "has always been particularly important that Russia be  included in the political solution." With his initiative,  Yeltsin has "leaned far out of the window. If the Serbs do not  fulfill their promises made to Yeltsin, they would lose their  last advocate."    The more intensive involvement of the Americans, who are now  ready "to fully join in and make use of their influence on the  parties to the conflict, in particular on the Muslims," also  speaks for the possibility of a political solution.    Kinkel said that now it is very important to "make use of  the  momentum." If, as a goal for the near future, it becomes  possible to achieve UN administration for the area of Sarajevo,  this could be the beginning of a new stage to come to a  political solution in the end. The decisive thing will be  whether one can make it clear to the parties to the conflict,  the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims: "Only if they join in and are  ready for a peaceful solution will such a solution be possible."    However, the minister warned against precipitate euphoria:  "We have been disappointed and led by the nose too often." It  cannot be ruled out, either, that the Serbs will now try to  shift their heavy weapons from Sarajevo to another battlefield  in Bosnia. If this is done, one "must think again about how  they can be prevented from doing that."    Germany has "a not unimportant share" in the latest  development, Kinkel said. Chancellor Kohl was in permanent  contact with Russia's President Yeltsin; he himself was partly  in direct contact with his Soviet counterpart Kozyrev. There  were also permanent contacts with Washington and the European  partners. Kinkel stressed that in the overall context Bonn can  only play a mediating role, "because we cannot send German  soldiers directly to the area of crisis for constitutional and  historic reasons."</p>

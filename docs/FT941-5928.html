			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / US factory orders up 2% in January US factory goods orders rose 2.1 per cent in January - the sixth increase in a row - as last year's momentum in the manufacturing sector carried into the new year, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. The Commerce Department said the string of advances was the longest since one that ran from September 1987 to June 1988. January's rise followed a 1.4 per cent gain in December. Leading the surge were sales of transport equipment, particularly aircraft and parts. The volatile transport component rose 14 per cent, or Dollars 5bn, to Dollars 40.7bn (Pounds 27.8bn). The Commerce Department also reported unfilled orders increased for the first time in nearly a year, an indication that more hiring of workers may be on the way. The department said factory orders totalled a seasonally adjusted Dollars 272bn, up from Dollars 266.4bn in December. Manufacturing orders excluding transport increased just 0.3 per cent and excluding defence orders were up 1.6 per cent.</p>

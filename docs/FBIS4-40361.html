			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow's Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov described the  presidential anti-crime decree Boris Yeltsin signed on Tuesday  as "very strong". Luzhkov said he was certain that if  implemented, it would push down crime rates in Moscow and  elsewhere in Russia. Mayor Luzhkov was speaking at a banquet  with US businessmen in the Slavyanskaya hotel.    He said that "touring criminals" were responsible for 40  percent of crimes in Moscow and that the controversial  registration of foreigners in the capital and improved supply of  police with advanced hardware had had a certain effect already,  although there was still much room for improvement. Luzhkov  said that additional measures were necessary and he promised  they would be taken in the near future.    Asked about the dispute between the Mayor's office and the  State Property Committee over privatization in Moscow, Luzhkov  said that he saw President Yeltsin's instruction to Anatoly  Chubais "not to touch" Moscow as a victory of common sense, and  not of the mayor. Luzhkov said that from now on property in  Moscow would not be privatized indiscriminately, and not at next  to nothing, but for real prices and on a contest basis to ensure  that Moscow's real estate end up in the hands of real owners,  and not black-market brokers.    Mayor Luzhkov invited US businessmen to be more bold in  investing into joint projects, saying that in one year Moscow  was capable of accepting up to two billion dollars of  investments into all businesses. On guarantees for investors  Luzhkov said that the government of Moscow had set up a reserve  fund to compensate for losses that may be sustained by joint  ventures in case of force majeure.</p>

Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508); and the USIBWC's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083&hyph;44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared for the proposed project. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. M.R.

The sustained high flows carried a large sediment load, causing dangerous accumulations in the international boundary segment of the Colorado River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sediment removal is necessary to provide immediate flood control relief in the vicinity of Morelos Dam and to enable Mexico to receive full deliveries of their 1944 Treaty waters. All sediment removal activities will be conducted in Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Alternatives Considered <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Three alternatives, including the No Action Alternative and the Proposed Action Alternative, were considered:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The No Action Alternative would result in accumulated sediment not being removed from the lower Colorado River in the vicinity of Morelos Dam. Mexico would not be able to divert full domestic and irrigation allotments. Serious impacts to human health could result from an absence of an adequate domestic water supply. Sediment accumulation in the Morelos Dam system would increase flood stage elevations. The United States would not be acting in furtherance of the 1944 Water Treaty requirement to recommend and carry out flood control activities and the 1970 Boundary Treaty requirements for boundary preservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed Action Alternative is a joint United States/Mexico emergency project to remove sediment upstream of the Morelos Dam flood control gates for a distance yet to be determined, but no further upstream than the NIB, and downstream of the Morelos Dam intake gates. The IBWC, on behalf of the United States and Mexico, would coordinate the work utilizing, as authorized in the 1944 Water Treaty, the resources of the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Mexican National Water Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Sato said the IEA, a forum for oil consuming countries, will  continue to engage in dialogue with the oil producing countries.    "But there is also concern over environmental problems  caused  by high energy consumption accompanying high growth rates in  China and other Asian countries," Sato said in an interview.    "And there are a lot of other issues like the fall-off in  production in Russia which used to be the world's largest oil  producer."    The 59-year-old Sato, who is also Japan's ambassador to the  Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD), said guaranteed stability of energy is  decisively important to the economy.    "Especially for Japan, which doesn't have oil resources  domestically, energy security is a pillar of its economy and  diplomacy," Sato said.    The IEA this year celebrates its 20th anniversary since its  founding during the oil shock of the 1970's.    It attracted international attention when it was set up in  1974 as a body representing the interests of consumer countries  as opposed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  (OPEC). But recently it has assumed a lower profile as crude oil  prices have stabilized.    Sato has a wide network of personal contacts in high places.    At the time of his election as the IEA governing board  chairman, the U.S. representative nominated him and the German  representative seconded the nomination.    "Both were old acquaintances," Sato said. "It was good to  have those relationships."    The IEA will hold its first meeting since Sato assumed the  post in Kyoto in April at which it will hold seminars on  policies to carry it through to the end of the century.    Sato is a former head of the Foreign Ministry's Economic  Affairs Bureau. He served for three years from 1989 as chief  secretary to the foreign minister.    Since July 1992, he has served as Japan's ambassador to the  OECD.</p>

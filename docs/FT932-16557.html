			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Mubarak seeks talks with Rabin EGYPT'S President Hosni Mubarak is seeking a summit with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, after his discussions on reviving the Middle East peace process in Washington, Israeli officials said yesterday. Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates and in terms of location, nothing is set.' Mr Mubarak, who has emerged as the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace talks, meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he would report the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return to Cairo. The Egyptian leader has recently met President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks. The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from Washington. Mr Mubarak would particularly welcome a successful mediation effort at a time when his government is under strong pressure from Islamic fundamentalists at home. It would also underline Egypt's strategic value to Washington while the country is seeking a renewed US commitment to the Dollars 2.1bn it receives in annual civil and military aid. An Israeli-Egyptian summit would be unlikely without a solution being found to the peace talks impasse. In the event of a deal, Mr Mubarak could seek to extract the maximum symbolic publicity from his role by meeting Mr Rabin in Jerusalem. This would mark the first visit to Israel by President Mubarak since he took power more than a decade ago, and the first by any Egyptian leader since the historic trip of President Anwar Sadat in November 1977. A senior Egyptian foreign ministry official said Mr Mubarak had decided in principle to make such a visit, saying 'it is not a question of whether, but of when'. The official said Mr Mubarak would not have countenanced such a trip while Mr Yitzak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, was in power.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GKN increases pace in Westland bid The struggle for control of Westland moved up a gear yesterday when GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, sought to justify the terms of its hostile bid for the helicopter manufacturer. Announcing the distribution of its formal offer to shareholders, GKN claimed its 290p bid for ordinary and preferred shares - valuing Westland at Pounds 497m - was equivalent to more than 25 times its fully diluted 1993 earnings. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said: 'United Technologies Corporation which owns Sikorsky, one of the world's largest helicopter manufacturers, has agreed to accept the offers and believes that GKN's price is fair.' Sikorsky's US parent company has agreed to sell its 18.7 per cent stake to GKN, taking the group's fully diluted holding to 45 per cent. Sir David also said Westland's share price had been boosted by bid speculation and last year's Pounds 385m damages award against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation. Westland, meanwhile, disclosed at its AGM that it had received Pounds 25m following the ruling, which relates to an abandoned helicopter contract in the Middle East. Mr Alan Jones, who yesterday succeeded Sir Leslie Fletcher as chairman, said the company had also obtained orders in Europe and the US restraining banks from releasing deposits held by the AOI. He urged shareholders to resist GKN's overtures and said Westland would soon issue a detailed defence document.</p>

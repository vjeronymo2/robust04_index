			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, June 2 -- President Lennart Meri has  refused to accept the resignation of Aleksander Einseln, the  head of the Estonian Defence Forces, as leaving the position  vacant would harm Estonia's state and security, the president's  press office informed ETA on Thursday. Meri had received  Einseln's letter of resignation on May 31 and had immediately  responded that the interests of Estonian state prevented him  from accepting the resignation and that he was to continue his  service.    Einseln's press office released a statement earlier on  Thursday saying he wanted to resign in protest over being left  aside by Prime Minister Mart Laar over his defence deal with  Israel.    Einseln is a retired U.S. Army officer who accepted the  position in defiance of U.S. administration while risking his  army pension. Einseln is now in Visby attending a Baltic Sea  defence seminar.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Holders defeat Kmart's stock plan Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of its shareholders when dissident institutional investors succeeded in throwing out the company's reorganisation plan. Kmart said although the proposal won the support of 61 per cent of the shares voted at its annual meeting in Troy, Michigan, the number of non-voters left the company without the required approval of 50 per cent of the eligible votes. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive said he was 'disappointed' at the outcome. Management and the board would now assess the alternatives available. Kmart's plan had been to create new shares in its four specialty retailing subsidiaries - Builders Square, Borders-Walden, OfficeMax and Sports Authority - and raise money by selling stakes of up to 30 per cent in each of them. It intended to retain majority control. However, six of the company's most powerful institutional investors - including the College Retirement Equities Fund, Wall Street's biggest investor - publicly opposed the plan, saying Kmart should sell the subsidiaries altogether and concentrate on improving the performance of its ailing discount stores instead. Some of the dissident investors said they would also withhold support for the re-election of five board directors to mark their dissatisfaction with the company's performance, but the five were re-elected yesterday. The institutions are challenging Kmart's board and management because the company has been struggling unsuccessfully to compete with its more successful rival, WalMart. Last year it ended five years of stagnant earnings by plunging into net losses of Dollars 947bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rashid Hasan: "Saudi Financial Strategy, Area </F> Changes"]    [Text] The 1994 Saudi budget, by the nature of its goals  and areas of concentration, is considered an important aspect of  the Saudi Arabian financial strategy. This is because the most  comprehensive and profound concept of budget ramifications, such  as political spending, must not stop at the numbers only, but  rather must consider far-reaching ramifications of many  indicators, as well as local and international factors, on the  Kingdom's financial strategy. Some of these realities were  clearly raised in the new budget, and the influence of certain  others will not lag far behind in the circumstances of the  coming stage.    One of the most important facets of the 1994 budget is,  undoubtedly, the considerable cut in government spending (20  percent), which is down to 160 billion Saudi riyals [R] ($42  billion). In our view, this rate of reduction means a drop in  expectations for the Saudi masses, in general, in the next few  years while, at the same time, creating a basis for permitting  the Saudi Government once again to realize a surplus in the  budget, which it can use to eliminate part of the general debt,  currently estimated at 52 percent of the gross domestic product.    The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance, if it wishes, can now  maintain this rate of spending over the next few years, or  increase it moderately, profiting from any improvement in oil  prices and the Kingdom's oil revenues, in order to achieve a  surplus to be used to reduce the debt and the cost of financing  that debt. The Ministry of Finance has decided to use this  option, or to combine it with other means to increase state  revenues (such as privatization of certain public  organizations), or stretching out the expenditures on certain  "flexible" budget items, such as spending for defense systems,  etc. However, the important thing is that lowering the level of  spending will allow the Saudi Government to have an immediate  response to the problem of oil prices and, at the same time,  expand its ability to move in the future toward reviving the  financial situation in light of the possibility of improvement  in oil prices.    It could perhaps be useful to repeat here what we said in a  previous year, to the effect that the most important factor  concerning the Saudi budget is that--despite its importance--it  is no longer the singular event on which the future direction of  Saudi Arabia depends. In fact, the budget used to be the  decisive event in the first stages of the development process  and in providing the infrastructure. However, the Saudi state's  biggest accomplishments have been completed. In its efforts to  lessen the citizens' and businessmen's dependence on the  government, it has succeeded in making the budget just one among  many factors that affect the economy's movement. For two  decades, the state itself has overseen, under King Fahd's  personal direction, the composition and growth of a domestic  sector that increasingly expands and matures each year. Every  means has been used to encourage it to play a leading role in  stimulating the economy. Therefore, because of private sector  investments, we see the importance of the government's burden  regarding the stimulation of the economy, becoming slightly  smaller with each new budget. It is sufficient for us to look at  the considerable growth in the Saudi financial market and the  movement to capitalize organizations and companies, in order to  realize the extent of basic development that has suddenly  occurred in the country. In the past, the Saudi Industrial  Development Fund, and its generous loans, was an indispensable  factor in the establishment of projects. Now, the fund has begun  to finance its own projects and does not now cost the state any  additional resources. Moreover, the ratio of its participation  in providing subsidized and long-term financing is gradually  lessening. Despite that, it has provided excellent opportunities  for profit, creating corporations specializing in investment and  creating projects through the increased participation of private  capital without, at times, waiting to obtain any government  financing.    This great vitality in private sector financing, which has  been built on a foundation of confidence in political and  economic stability, is developing a capital market whose  liquidity adds tens of billions of riyals each year to the  Kingdom's fixed capital. The amount of the capital market has  recently reached nearly R200 billion. This figure significantly  surpasses the amount of the government budget.    We can also cite examples of significant growth in Saudi  industry, with an increased exporting capacity for a number of  industries in which the Kingdom has marked advantages (such as  those that strongly rely on oil and its derivatives).  Furthermore, the increased growth in exports offers an excellent  indicator of the growth of profit margins and marketing  expertise of an increasing number of Saudi organizations and of  the rise in competitive ability of the economy in general. This  improvement is unobserved year after year, with the Saudi  organizations benefitting from studies and mistakes in planning,  thanks to the balanced protection which, although it provides  additional strength to Saudi products, does not exceed, or  rather is generally less than, the advantages and protection  applied in many nations, including those nations to which those  products are exported.    The increased vitality and effectiveness of the economy in  general, and Saudi organizations in particular, is because of  the development that the Saudi Government has been creating on  their behalf. In time, this will allow the government to lessen  many transitional burdens, which it accepted under the  circumstances of applying development plans and giving the  organizations--small and large--suitable time to learn the  market game and become competitive under the aegis of  appropriate cover. Without going into detail, areas of  economizing in spending can be found either through  privatization of several government assets, through more  guidance being made available, represented in itself by a  "hidden force," or through unforeseen reserves in the Saudi  economy, i.e., the state out of its continued generosity in  subsidizing specific sectors has, for this reason alone, cards  that it can use if necessary. In fact, we believe that it has  begun to be possible to use these cards, because Saudi society  is over its initial stages of protection and the "stage of  solicitude," and has become ready to accept the facts as they  are, as well as being more confident about dealing with them.    If some of these domestic realities will help to redirect  Saudi fiscal policy, there are also international developments  flowing in this direction. The current and future budgets will  be prepared under completely different international  circumstances than those that existed before the end of the Cold  War and the collapse of regional alliances that it produced.    A completely new situation has emerged from the war to  liberate Kuwait, for example, which will require reconsideration  of policies and defensive strategies for Saudi Arabia and other  nations. Consequently, as has happened in all Western countries,  it might be reflected in a new look at defense and investment in  regional security. Naturally, on this level, much depends on the  path of the thorny negotiations aimed at reaching a joint  settlement of the historic conflict in the Middle East and the  opening of a new era of mutual coexistence, cooperation, and a  redirection of the region's wealth and priceless resources to  growth and prosperity.</p>

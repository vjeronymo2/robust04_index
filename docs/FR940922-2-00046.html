Box 376, Honeoye, New York 14471 filed in Docket No. CP80&hyph;277&hyph;005 a petition pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to amend the certificate issued February 7, 1975, to increase the operating pressure of its existing transmission pipeline during withdrawal operations, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honeoye requests authority to increase the operating pressure of its transmission line from 774 psia to 900 psia during withdrawal operations. Honeoye advises that it is not proposing to change the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) which has been 918 psia since construction. Additionally, Honeoye states that there will be no change in the service rendered to each of its customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honeoye explains that it receives gas from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGPC) at TGPC's main valve No. 236 in Ontario County, New York and transports the gas for injection into Honeoye's storage field. Honeoye states that during withdrawal operations, it redelivers gas to TGPC at TGPC's main valve No. 236. Honeoye asserts that because of an increase in TGPC's line pressure, Honeoye proposes to increase the operating pressure of its transmission line to ensure continuation of reliable storage service to its customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 6, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

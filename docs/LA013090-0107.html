			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CUTS: ASSESSING THE CASUALTIES;  </P> <P> BAY AREA: NAVY PULLOUTS COULD HIT HARD AT MANY ECONOMIC LEVELS. OFFICIALS WHO  HAD CALLED FOR MILITARY CUTBACKS ARE NOW IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.  </P> <P> Millie Aure, tending the counter of the pizza parlor she bought last June,  tried to envision what business would be like if the Alameda Naval Air Station,  located 100 yards away, closed.  </P> <P> "Oh, my goodness, it's going to be dead," she said Monday as a sailor and two  sons of sailors ate in her small restaurant.  </P> <P> Aure, who runs the establishment with relatives, said she never would have made  the investment if she had known the air station might close. "If they close  (the air station), I don't know what we would do," she said, her toddler  granddaughter at her feet.  </P> <P> News that U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's list of military facilities that  may be closed across the nation included six naval installations in the San  Francisco Bay Area raised fears of economic upheaval from Aure's lunch counter  to the offices of local politicians.  </P> <P> Union officials worried about the loss of blue collar jobs. And liberal Bay  Area officials, who in the past have called for defense cuts, found themselves  in the odd position of second-guessing the plan.  </P> <P> If all the bases targeted by Cheney's plan are closed, California would be  especially hard hit. The list includes Ft. Ord near Monterey, the Sacramento  Army Depot, El Centro Naval Air Facility in San Diego County, the Long Beach  Naval Shipyard and the Los Angeles Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Within California, the Bay Area stands to lose the most. Aside from the Alameda  Naval Air Station, other Bay Area facilities on Cheney's list are the Alameda  Naval Aviation Depot, Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Oakland Naval Supply Center,  Treasure Island Naval Station -- which sits in the bay between San Francisco  and Oakland -- and Moffett Field Naval Air Station in Santa Clara County.  </P> <P> The Navy employs roughly 56,000 civilians and military personnel in the Bay  Area. If all the Bay Area naval installations on Cheney's list were shut and  the personnel relocated, the region would lose about 34,113 jobs. If the cuts  come to pass, the Navy's only remaining presence in this major West Coast port  would be at the Concord Naval Weapons Depot and Mare Island Naval Shipyard,  where repairs are made to ships and submarines.  </P> <P> Nowhere would the effect of closures be more direct than in Alameda. Word that  the Navy might leave came as Alameda officials laid plans to celebrate the  50-year anniversary of the Navy's presence. Mayor Chuck Corica noted that  Alameda, a city in the shadow of Oakland, sold 2,800 acres to the Navy for a  dollar in 1937. Today, the city of 77,000 people revolves around the Alameda  Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> "It would have a terrible effect," Corica said.  </P> <P> For many officials in this bastion of liberalism, the potential of closures  presents a political problem. For example, Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) long  has been a strident critic of military spending. But he also represents a  district where many voters work for the Navy.  </P> <P> "We do not want to be forced to be parochial," said Dellums aide Robert Brauer,  raising the prospect that Dellums would oppose some of the reductions. "We  would hope that (defense officials) didn't construct, from their point of view,  a parochial plan."  </P> <P> On the street in the Bay Area, rumors have come and gone that the bases might  close. But with such talk now more than rumors, workers began considering their  options.  </P> <P> "You could find work, but the benefits and the working conditions wouldn't be  the same," said Mike French, 38, a civilian mechanic at the Alameda Naval Air  Station.  </P> <P> His current health and pension benefits are so good that he would leave the  area simply to keep a job with the government, he said.  </P> <P> Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson expressed concern that the possible closures would  have a "substantial negative impact" on his city, which is still struggling to  recover from the damage caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake. At the same time,  other Oakland officials said they hoped the closures, if they occur, would  spark a new era of prosperity.  </P> <P> "Unlike the earthquake, we can plan for the closures," said Oakland City  Councilman Wilson Riles Jr. He said the busy port of Oakland could use the land  now occupied by the naval supply depot for expansion.  </P> <P> "The defense budget is boom or bust. It goes up or down based on politics. . .  . We have to wean ourselves from such a dependence on defense budgets," Riles  said.  </P> <P> In Alameda County, the impact of the base closures "would be dissipated fairly  quickly" because of the Bay Area's generally strong economy, predicted John  Oliver Wilson, Bank of America's chief economist.  </P> <P> But the view that the Bay Area economy would hardly miss a beat is not shared  by many officials. While the local economy booms for professionals, jobs that  pay well and offer health benefits to laborers are disappearing. Alameda County  Supervisor Don Perata said the loss of military bases could result in "a new  class of underinsured" people.  </P> <P> "It is a double whammy. You have reduced their earning power and made them a  ward of the county," Perata said.  </P> <P> Times researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

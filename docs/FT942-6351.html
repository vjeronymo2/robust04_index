			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: A talent heavy on evasions - Concerts Rakhmaninov used to claim, no doubt simplistically, that every good piece had a uni-que high point. The performer had to locate that, and adjust the musico-dramatic structure around it. The pianist Ian Fountain (five years ago, at 19, the youngest winner of the Artur Rubinstein competition) seems to have a natural bent towards the other extreme. At the Wigmore last week, he displayed an almost Tantric knack for evading the climax. There were nicely controlled swells, and every sustained, high-tension, note-crammed passage rang out brilliantly and in due course subsided - without ever having marked a clear peak. In Schubert's last A major Sonata, celestially discursive, this curious penchant passed well enough for judicious even-handedness, refusing to impose any simple dramatic form upon the com-poser's teeming, interrelated ideas. Besides, the evasiveness cast unexpected lights in familiar places, and the pianist's grasp of the purely musical structure was confident and affectionate. In the three biggish Liszt pieces of the second half - the neglected but memorable B minor Ballade, the Harmonies du Soir from the Transcendental Etudes and the Vallee d'Obermann from the Annees - the shy quirk seemed odder. They all revel in the same decadent harmonic climate (which Fountain rendered quite luminous); they also share the same pattern, basically rondo-form with elaborations and pianistic titivations. What should make them pungently distinct is their individual dramatic trajectories: extra-musical, if you like, but crucial to their effect. Without honest climaxes, however, there are no clear trajectories. Under Fountain's cultivated hands, Liszt's dramatic studies melted into a muchness  -a series of artful panels, a sensitive survey of a fresco. To make their own stamps they wanted only a tougher forward sweep, such as gut-instinct might supply; but if Fountain has gut-instincts, he suppressed them with eerie success. This admirable young pianist will be more exciting when he lets himself go. A word of thanks to the excellent Ondine Ensemble, whom I heard last week in the Purcell Room. Besides Messiaen's evergreen Quatuor pour le fin du temps (their collective Danse de la fureur made electrifying compensation for heartfelt string-solos that missed the ultimate degree of security), they offered three earlier French pieces that devotees like me had despaired of hearing. A youthful Milhaud quartet from his Brazilian years proved bluntly original and muscular, with mere traces of the Latin rhythms that inform his better-known Saudades do Brasil from the same time. Dear old Charles Koechlin's late Sonate a sept (op. 221]), really an airy chamber-concerto for oboe, displayed his usual unpretentious originality. Best of all was Roussel's 'last work', his sprightly Elpenor suite for flute and strings.</p>

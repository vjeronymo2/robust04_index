			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Anglian Water up 9% ANGLIAN WATER, which supplies water and sewerage services to customers from the Humber to the Thames, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 9 per cent to Pounds 100.2m for the six months to September 30. The increase was mainly due to higher prices and cost cutting. Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said Anglian continued to perform well. Mr Chris Mellor, group finance director, said second-half profits would be slightly lower because of seasonal factors, such as pumping costs, and higher net borrowings. Turnover rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 286.3m, helped by average price increases of 9.4 per cent. Industrial volumes, which have been affected by recession, appeared to have stabilised and fell 1 per cent compared with 7 per cent in the corresponding period. Operating costs increased 7.7 per cent to Pounds 127.2m because of inflation and higher running costs owing to new quality standards. Anglian said increased efficiency, stemming from improved productivity and rationalisations, saved Pounds 2.5m. Operating profits increased 12 per cent to Pounds 114m. Depreciation jumped 18 per cent to Pounds 25.4m, reflecting the capital expenditure programme. Capital expenditure, which totalled Pounds 294.9m last year, is expected to reach Pounds 330m this time. Anglian's programme to improve sewage treatment works is nearly complete. An increasing amount of spending will now go towards improving water supply. Interest costs increased 39 per cent to Pounds 13.9m as net debt increased from Pounds 209.2m a year ago to Pounds 283.6m. This lifted gearing more than 4 percentage points to 20.6 per cent. Anglian was one of the slowest of the privatised water companies to buy non-core businesses, acquiring Rosewater Engineering in July. The company said it was now combining this company with two existing subsidiaries to create a broader based water process engineering company. Earnings increased 8.9 per cent to 31.7p and the interim dividend rises 7.9 per cent to 6.8p, broadly in line with Anglian's policy of real annual dividend growth of 4 per cent. The results were in line with forecasts but Anglian's shares gained 12p to 479p in line with a firm water sector. See Lex</p>

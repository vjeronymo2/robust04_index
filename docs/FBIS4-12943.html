			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut] </F>   [Text] Cairo -- AL-NAHAR has learned that a memorandum  drawn up by a number of leading West Bank and Gaza Strip  figures. These representatives of the residents of the occupied  territories declare their non-commitment to any agreements that  will be signed regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho. This memorandum will soon be presented to the United  Nations and the envoys of various countries in Jerusalem.  According to the Palestinian sources who provided this  information, the initiative for this memorandum came from Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and some West Bank and Gaza Strip mayors.    The memorandum is expected to include many names since it  enjoys the support of all Palestinian opposition organizations  in addition to the People's Party and some Fatah figures.    The memorandum was drawn up in the wake of the immense  pressure that Israel is exerting on the PLO in the negotiations  in a bid to obtain further concessions, not to mention the  Israeli practices on the ground against Palestinians, such as  the recent closure imposed on the occupied territories.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium pact probe shrugged off at LME London Metal Exchange traders yesterday shrugged off last Friday night's news that a US investigation was being mounted into the operation of the informal aluminium output-cutting pact agreed earlier this year. Reuters reported from Washington that the Justice Department had sent letters to US producers in response to an allegation of price fixing. Several producers had confirmed they had received a 'civil investigative demand' from the department but declined to comment on the specific allegations. However, industry officials said producers were accused of using the pact as a cover for price fixing. 'We recently received notice of an investigation and a civil investigative demand from the Department of Justice regarding primary aluminium production,' said Mr Tom Hagley, director of public and investor relations with Alumax. 'We intend to co-operate with the government's investigation. The company is confident that its activities and operations have conformed with applicable laws.' A memorandum of understanding was signed in March by major aluminium producers in an attempt to resolve oversupply problems that worsened when Russia began selling on world markets. In Brussels the European Aluminium Association told Reuters it was very surprised about the investigation. 'I don't understand it,' the EAA president Mr Dick Dermer said, noting that the Justice Department was 'well represented' at the pact negotiations. At the LME the three months delivery aluminium price rose Dollars 3.75 yesterday to close at Dollars 1,517.50 a tonne.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 May -- "The Crimean issue is too  important to be used as a card in the presidential election  campaign in Ukraine." This was said today by Russia's State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin at a meeting with Douglas Hurd, Britain's  minister for foreign and Commonwealth affairs [title as  received].    The speaker of Russia's lower house also said "that  everything happening in Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair,"  and that "the peoples of the peninsula have the right to  self-determination, but within the framework of Ukraine and on  the basis of the principles of the CSCE."    Cooperation between the two countries' parliaments was also  discussed during the meeting. On behalf of the House of  Commons, Douglas Hurd invited a Duma delegation headed by Ivan  Rybkin to visit Great Britain this December.</p>

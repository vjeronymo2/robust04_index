			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH ITS HOSTAGES OUT, U.S. REVISES LIST OF IRAQI TARGETS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE PRESENCE OF 'HUMAN SHIELDS' AT STRATEGIC SITES HAD AFFECTED PLANS  FOR POSSIBLE ATTACKS.  </P> <P> With all U.S. hostages now out of Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. commanders are revising  their lists of potential targets to include militarily significant sites that  had been kept off earlier lists because of the presence of Americans held as  "human shields."  </P> <P> Despite repeated Bush Administration assertions to the contrary, the placing of  American hostages at missile sites, ammunition plants, chemical complexes and  oil refineries in Iraq and Kuwait had caused military planners to either remove  those sites from target lists or alter planned attacks on them to minimize the  possibility of killing the hostages.  </P> <P> President Bush signaled the change last weekend when he said, "When you don't  have Americans there, and if force is required, that's just one less worry I've  got."  </P> <P> He added, "I think you can make the case that this facilitates the tough  decisions that might lie ahead."  </P> <P> Senior military officials said plans are being rewritten to include "secondary"  or marginal targets that had been declared off-limits because of the presence  of American hostages.  </P> <P> Also, plans for attacking critical military sites that previously were included  despite the presence of human shields are being changed to make the raids less  risky to American pilots, who had been under instructions to make visual  identification of the targets to avoid inadvertently killing American hostages  detained nearby.  </P> <P> "The point is that attack options are limited by having people there you don't  want to kill. Getting these people out gives you a freer hand," one senior  military officer said. "No American President or chief of staff wants to be in  a position of ordering military action that takes the lives of 50 or 200 or 500  innocent American civilians. It's just that simple."  </P> <P> Although the hostages have been evacuated, the State Department says about 500  Americans are choosing to stay in Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> Senior Pentagon officials emphasized that the removal of the hostages does not  make a military strike against Iraqi targets more or less likely; they would be  attacked only as part of full-scale war in any event. Secretary of State James  A. Baker III has pledged publicly that the United States will not attack Iraq  if President Saddam Hussein withdraws all his troops from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Government analysts are debriefing the returning hostages who were used as  human shields to learn as much as they can about the sites where they were  held, particularly the military capabilities and detailed layouts of the  facilities. Some of this information already has been gleaned from non-American  hostages held at the same facilities who were released earlier.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of the crisis in August, President Bush and other senior  Administration officials have said consistently that the taking of hostages and  their dispersal to strategic sites would have no impact on U.S. policy or  military planning.  </P> <P> But, with the hostages now out of danger, military officials say those  statements were partly a bluff and that in some cases potential targets were  scrapped because of the presence of hostages.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable officials said potential military targets in Iraq fall into two  categories: critical military installations that immediately threaten U.S. and  allied forces, and secondary or marginal targets.  </P> <P> The officials said the first group -- including missile launching sites,  airfields, munitions depots and railroad marshaling yards -- would be hit early  in any conflict regardless of the presence of foreign hostages. However, these  officials said, if it were known that Americans were held at a particular site,  extraordinary measures would have been taken to try to avoid killing them.  </P> <P> "One would weigh in the balance the need to hit a target because of its impact  on the troops. If taking out a target puts at risk five hostages versus 5,000  troops, what do you do?" asked a senior defense official, who clearly believed  the answer was evident. "You might approach a target in a different way if  someone were there, though."  </P> <P> Such alternative approaches might include a daylight strike rather than  nighttime raid, or the use of low-level aircraft and precision-guided bombs  rather than high-altitude bombardment to try to assure that the weapons hit  specific buildings or facilities. Such operations are far riskier for pilots  and create the possibility of losing planes and having aviators taken captive.  </P> <P> With the hostages removed, targeters can now rewrite the "mission profiles" and  fall back on the full range of U.S. weaponry -- long-range "stand-off" missiles  fired from aircraft or ships, naval bombardment and carpet bombing by heavy  B-52s.  </P> <P> Returning hostages have said they were held at a number of sites that might  fall into the category of "high-value" military targets: a munitions factory  south of Baghdad, the chemical weapons plant at Al Qaim on the Syrian border, a  military airfield near Basra in the south of Iraq and the missile assembly  complex at Mosul, north of Baghdad.  </P> <P> Many sites from the second group of non-essential targets had been scratched  from the planners' target lists when it was learned that Americans had been  sent there as shields, officials said.  </P> <P> Based on accounts from returned hostages, such potential targets may have  included a dam and industrial complex on the Tigris River in northern Iraq, a  steel plant north of Baghdad used to manufacture artillery, oil and natural gas  refineries and the Tamuz nuclear reactor complex south of Baghdad.  </P> <P> Such sites would be desirable targets "for long-term reasons or their impact on  Saddam Hussein or the Iraqi people" rather than because they are immediately  threatening to U.S. forces, one defense official said.  </P> <P> With the removal of the hostages, he added, "They might be ones you could go  ahead now and hit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HUMAN SHIELD SITES  </P> <P> Some of the strategic sites where returning hostages said they were held.  Descriptions and locations are as precise as the hostages gave in interviews:  </P> <P> * Alexandria 3 ammunition factory south of Baghdad.  </P> <P> * Chemical weapons plant at Al Qaim near Syrian border.  </P> <P> * Tamuz nuclear reactor complex south of Baghdad.  </P> <P> * Dam and industrial complex on Tigris River in far north.  </P> <P> * Missile assembly complex at Mosul.  </P> <P> * Chemical weapons plant 35 miles southwest of Baghdad.  </P> <P> * Oil refinery 25 miles from Baghdad.  </P> <P> * Plant north of Baghdad used to manufacture cannons.  </P> <P> * Munitions testing area one hour southwest of Baghdad.  </P> <P> * Natural gas plant near Kirkuk.  </P> <P> * Airport, military base, fertilizer factory near Basra.  </P> <P> * Kuwait University.  </P> <P> * Mina Achmedi oil refinery near Kuwait city.  </P></p>

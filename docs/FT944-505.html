			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A basis for Turkey's membership of EU Sir, Turkey has again been refused admittance to the European Union. You are right in your implication that it is in the long-term interest of western Europe (and the Turkish people) that Turkey becomes a stable state and remains pro-western ('Turkish tangle', December 21). However, even were issues such as Cyprus, Kurdistan's right to exist, and general violation of human rights within the Turkish Republic settled, Turkey would, probably, find western European statesmen would discover other obstacles to her integration within Europe. You are right, Greece has made itself the scapegoat for keeping Turkey out in the cold. Nevertheless, much as it is in Greece's long-term interests to reach a permanent friendly accord with Turkey, Athens cannot cease to support the integrity of the Republic of Cyprus which was violated in 1974. Indeed, Greece has a moral obligation to insist on the ending of Turkey's military occupation of the island as it was a Greek junta which provided the excuse for the invasion. It should not be forgotten that, under the Zurich agreement, the basis of Cypriot independence from British rule in 1960, Greece, Turkey and Great Britain were the guarantors of the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus and, as regards the Turkish military occupation since July 1974, several UN resolutions have not been satisfied. Morally, the EU (and FT editors) should support Greece's insistence on a Cyprus settlement as a precondition of Turkish entry, and not shrug the issue off as an example of (oh dearie me]) Greek intransigence.

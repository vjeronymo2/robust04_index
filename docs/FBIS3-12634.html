In a letter delivered to the UN Security Council president  by  the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations  circulated today, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf  detailed the aggressive and provocative acts carried out by U.S.  and other warplanes, which violate the Iraqi airspace, flying  from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. During their flights,  these planes dropped provocative and hostile leaflets promoting  instigation against Iraq.    The foreign minister added: While condemning these  aggressive and provocative acts, we hold the Saudi and Kuwaiti  rulers fully responsible for their participation in acts of  aggression against Iraq, for the extensive material losses these  acts cause, and also for the security, economic, political, and  moral threats they pose to Iraq and the Iraqi people.</p>

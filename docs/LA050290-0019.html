			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS AND JUSTICE ARE A POOR MIX;  </P> <P> LAW: JUDGES WHO BEMOAN THE INTRUSION OF POLITICS INTO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OFTEN  FAIL TO SEE THAT THEY INVITED THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> The relationship between the judiciary and the political process continues to  fester. The tension was highlighted last month when retiring California Supreme  Court Justice Marcus Kaufman in effect charged that the court, under the  leadership of former Chief Justice Rose Bird, set out deliberately to sabotage  the law that requires capital punishment for certain murderers. Such  premeditated undermining of a valid law would place the court squarely in the  political arena. Be it abortion rights under Roe vs. Wade, the death penalty,  or any one of a large number of politically sensitive issues, the judiciary is  increasingly viewed as making public policy rather than merely applying the  law.  </P> <P> Until this century, it was generally assumed that it was the sole function of  the judiciary to apply the law. Where a subject was covered by statute, the  courts would attempt to ascertain the intent of the framers of the statute;  where it was not, the courts would search for decisions in prior cases to  determine what the law was. Neither individual judges' social philosophy nor  their attitudes toward the particular law were supposed to be a consideration.  </P> <P> This system came under attack by legal philosophers early in the 20th Century.  Scholars led by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and Harvard's Roscoe Pound gave  respectability to the ideology that the function of the courts was to "do  justice" rather than to mechanically apply existing law. This trend toward use  of the legal process as a "creative" means of solving actual and perceived  social problems has dominated legal education since the 1940s. Judicial  decisions are routinely praised or deplored, by the general public, the media  and the legal profession, not on the basis of inherent correctness but rather  on the basis of the social policies that the decisions foster or hinder.  </P> <P> In the abstract, the concept that a judge should "do justice" rather than  "mechanically apply the law" has considerable appeal. In practice, however,  this means that cases are decided on an ad hoc basis, based on a particular  judge's subjective interpretation of the result demanded by his or her sense of  justice. This has resulted in intrusion by the judiciary into the legislative  function, uncertainty in the law, unreasonable demands on the judicial system  and attempts at political interference with the judicial system.  </P> <P> To decide what the law ought to be in the light of prevailing social policies  is to make a political decision. This type of decision-making has traditionally  rested with the legislature. The manner in which legislatures are elected is  intended to make them representative of the political mores of their electors.  If the electorate feels that the laws do not reflect prevailing social  policies, the election mechanism permits them to do something about it. Despite  its deficiencies, the process does permit an expression of social values and,  more important, it permits changes in social values to be reflected fairly  speedily.  </P> <P> Justice, however, demands that judges be impartial. This means that the law  should apply equally to all persons. It does not demand, and in fact it should  prohibit, that the judge consider the effect of the law on a particular  litigant. Nor does justice require that the judge consider whether the law is  good or bad; that is a political decision for the legislature.  </P> <P> It is because of the mixing of law with social policy that the independence of  the judiciary from political influence continues to be threatened. If judges  considered themselves administrators of the law, it would only be necessary to  consider the legal abilities of judicial candidates, not their political  biases. However, as long as judges continue to make political decisions, the  inquiry unfortunately becomes highly relevant. The demand that appointees to  judicial office pass a political litmus test prevented a candidate as  well-qualified as Robert Bork from assuming his place on the U.S. Supreme Court  and it continues to confront other judicial candidates. Members of the  judiciary are probably more conscious and concerned about this trend than any  other group. Yet many of them fail to recognize that the problem stems from  their own result-oriented judicial philosophies.  </P> <P> Judicial independence is a paramount value in our scheme of government. The  concept is part of the genius of our federal and state constitutions and has  served our society well. Judicial independence is also one of the most fragile  concepts in our constitutions. Since the judiciary neither controls its budget  nor its enforcement power, it must rely to a significant extent on the goodwill  of the other branches of government, and hence of the voting public, to  maintain its independence.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, largely as a result of 20th-Century judicial philosophies,  judicial independence is increasingly vulnerable. From inquiries into the  personal and political attitudes of candidates for the judiciary to personal  attacks on judges and justices, our society shows a growing dissatisfaction  with judicial decisions that are rightly perceived to be political rather than  legal. As a result, attempts to define the criteria for judicial appointment in  political terms gain greater acceptance. It is a situation created by at least  some judges, but which the judiciary refuses to recognize as its own problem.  </P></p>

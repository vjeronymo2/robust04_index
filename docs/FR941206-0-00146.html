			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some waste management activities used for remedial and removal actions of hazardous organic substances require the use of tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. For example, a TSDF may treat hazardous organic liquids and surface water contaminated with hazardous organic waste on site using destruction, detoxification, or organic removal processes that occur in tanks or surface impoundments. The facility may perform on-site solvent washing of soils contaminated with hazardous organic sludges in a tank or container. At a TSDF, hazardous waste in leaking drums may be repacked in new containers for treatment and disposal at another site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once today's deferral is lifted, the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards are likely to be ``applicable'' to on-site remedial and removal actions that use tanks, surface impoundments, and containers to manage substances exhibiting characteristics or listed under RCRA as hazardous waste and having an average volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. In other cases, the standards may be ``relevant and appropriate''; this determination must be made on a site specific basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, the subpart CC standards do not specify control requirements for wastepiles, landfills, and land treatment units that manage hazardous wastes at TSDF. Therefore, the standards are not likely to be ``applicable'' to excavation, capping of wastes, land treatment, land farming, in situ treatment activities, and other activities involving wastepiles and landfills at CERCLA sites. Although in most cases the EPA does not expect the subpart CC standards to be ``relevant and appropriate'' to these types of units at CERCLA sites, remedial and removal actions performed in wastepiles may in some cases be similar in nature and scale to the waste management activities performed in surface impoundments; and waste stabilization may involve the basic process and air emission mechanism regardless of whether the mixing of the waste and binder is conducted in a tank, surface impoundment, container, wastepile, landfill, or land treatment unit. Thus, in some cases the subpart CC standards may be ``relevant and appropriate'' for such actions; this determination must be made on a site specific basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Relationship to Clean Air Act Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). This section was comprehensively amended under Title III of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA. Under the amended CAA section 112(b), Congress listed 189 chemicals, compounds, or groups of chemicals as HAP. The EPA is directed by the CAA to regulate HAP emissions from stationary sources by establishing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

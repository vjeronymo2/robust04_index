			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: French insurance group to open Beijing office Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance groups which was privatised earlier this year, is planning to begin commercial operations in China over the next few months, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. Mr Jacques Friedman, chairman, said yesterday he hoped to open a representative office in Beijing by the end of the year and was interested in establishing a joint venture in the country. UAP has just completed the final part of its strategy of building a comprehensive network across Europe with the acquisition last month of Provincial, the privately-held UK general insurance company. The company had chosen Beijing over Shanghai and other larger business centres because decisions about insurance are still highly centralised in the capital. He said UAP was consolidating its many recent acquisitions in other countries, rather than looking to further international expansion. This, however, excluded Asia, where there was tremendous potential growth. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday opened a representative office in Beijing as part of a widening involvement in China, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. The Morgan Stanley Group also convened a meeting in the Chinese capital of its 'inside board' to discuss business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. This followed an announcement on Monday that Morgan Stanley and the People's Construction Bank of China had formed China's first investment bank to facilitate capital raising for Chinese infrastructure.</p>

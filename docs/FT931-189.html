			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / People: Welsh Water to split top roles Welsh Water, Wales' largest company, is to be run by two non-Welsh speakers. John Elfed Jones, chairman of the Welsh Language Board as well as chairman of the water company for the past 11 years, is to be replaced, but on a part-time basis, by Iain Evans, founder and chairman of London-based consultancy LEK, who steps up from the position of deputy chairman. Now that the roles of chairman and chief executive are to be split, Graham Hawker (right), group managing director, becomes chief executive. Evans (left), a Harvard MBA and ex-Bain partner, went on the board in 1989 at the request of the then secretary of state for Wales, Peter Walker, to help the company's relationship with the City during privatisation. Meanwhile, 41-year-old Evans is defensive about LEK's advisory role in connection with the controversial stake in South Wales Electricity. The stake, raised to 14.9 per cent, generated much animosity with South Wales treating it as a hostile move. But Evans points out LEK's advice that the shares were undervalued was apparently vindicated when the stake generated a profit of Pounds 17m when sold last December. 'We may have moved a bit before our time, but as regulators get steadily tougher on pricing, there will have to be rationalisation between such areas as water and electricity,' says Evans, who wants a 'sharper definition' of the utility's non-regulated activities. Hawker, 45, the son of a miner from the valleys who is now listening to Welsh tapes in his car, has been at Welsh Water since it was established in 1974. Starting off in internal audit, he rose to finance director before becoming group managing director last year. Evans says he is also making 'futile efforts' to learn Welsh, and stresses that the company's bilingual policies will not change.</p>

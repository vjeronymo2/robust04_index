			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mihaly Bak: "Statement by Arpad Goncz in Encore"] </F>   [Text] In his statement made to Hungarian Radio's "Encore,"  Arpad Goncz said yesterday that the responsibilities of the  president of the Republic begin after the elections, when the  new administration must be set up. The president said that he  must meet with every powerful political faction, assessing the  balance of power and determining which could be part of a  coalition that is capable of governing. Arpad Goncz said that  the results of Hungary's elections must be respected.    The president said that the parties have already said every  conceivable bad thing about each other and everything  conceivable good thing about themselves; a kind of flirtation  dance is going on to determine who could form alliances with  whom. These attempts must be accepted at face value, said Goncz,  who thinks that, contrary to 1990, today we are familiar with  the parties. The president's recommendation to the voters is  that everyone start from the present situation. Senseless  slander will come back to haunt those who engage in it, the  president stated.    What the president sees throughout the country is that  people  would like to live a life without fear and to see unblemished  public service. It is the citizens' responsibility not to vote  for those who are to be feared or those who fail to serve the  community well. The advancement of unblemished public service  will most likely be the responsibility of the next parliament.    There are two models in Europe. Despite its economic  accomplishments, the Italian model is dangerous; on the other  hand, the Austrian or Finnish model is a splendid example of  reconciliation of interests, Arpad Goncz said. The latter is  slower but leads to more stable results. No permanent party  system will develop before 1998 in Hungary, the president  continued, although people subscribe to three value systems:  They want national-Christian traditions, freedom, and equality.  There will only be a change of administrations, not a change of  regimes. Goncz said that opinions of Hungary abroad have  deteriorated during the past year; the West has become  frightened of the conditions in the region, and has also become  frightened of certain statements and anti-Semitic voices.    Everyone should vote and follow his or her conscience, Arpad  Goncz said. He hopes that none of the parties will try at the  last moment to forcibly influence voters--not even by merely  stirring emotions. But he could not promise that such  occurrences would not happen.</p>

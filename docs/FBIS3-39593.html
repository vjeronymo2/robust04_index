Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez report: "Government Will </F> Take Aznar Into Account To Make New `Turnabout in Autonomy'"]    [Text] Madrid -- The government intends to take the  People's Party and its leader, Jose Maria Aznar, into account in  order to carry through the turnabout in autonomy in the  fast-track autonomous communities -- the Basque Country,  Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia. The government believes that  although the People's Party is in power in only one of those  four communities -- Galicia -- an agreement with the leading  opposition party is absolutely necessary because the new impetus  to autonomy affects the state's territorial configuration.    Specifically, the government is contemplating transferring  exclusive state powers to the autonomous communities by the  delegation procedure envisaged in Article 150, paragraph 2 of  the Constitution. These would include the administration of  social security and the National Employment Institute (INEM).    In fact, the government has already taken the People's Party  into account in all the steps which it has taken to configure  Spain territorially since in February 1992 Felipe Gonzalez and  Jose Maria Aznar signed the autonomy pacts in order to raise the  slow-track autonomous communities' ceiling of powers. Recently,  the two parties have also agreed on the setting up of a  autonomous communities general committee in the Senate.  <H5>  Surprise </H5>   Generalitat [Catalan autonomous community] premier Jordi  Pujol's proposal of a pact with the throne is viewed with some  surprise by the central government, but excessive importance is  notattached to it. "It is one of so many drafts which Jordi  Pujol could put forward. At the moment of truth, he will  undertake a realistic negotiation of new powers, as has happened  on other occasions," government sources state.    To the same effect, the government's reaction is not to back  down from its pledge to carry through the turnabout in autonomy,  despite the proposal put forward by Pujol. "The government has  an election pledge to give the fast-track autonomous communities  new powers, and it will fulfill it," the sources consulted add.    However, the same sources deem the negotiating process with  the Basque government a good deal more complicated that that  with the Catalan Generalitat. In their opinion, the Basque  Nationalist Party is immersed in a preliminary election campaign  for the autonomous community elections in the fall, and this  will make it very difficult to conduct a rational negotiating  process. However, the situation in Catalonia is very different.  "Jordi Pujol wishes to wrap the turnabout in autonomy in a  spectacular format," according to the sources consulted.    Officially, the government maintains that it will give no  official opinion on the Generalitat's document until it receives  it, as Miguel Gil, the government spokesperson's secretary  general, stated yesterday, adding that for the present there is  no date for the next meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol.</p>

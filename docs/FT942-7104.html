			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Renewed drachma pressure expected The Greek drachma may come under heavy pressure today as speculation mounts that the government will be forced to trim interest rates next week. It declined against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Dr150.1, against Dr147.5 the previous day. It was also down against the US dollar, closing at Dr246.4 (Dr244.4). Dealers said the central bank spent about Dollars 300m to support the currency yesterday, its first large intervention this week. The bank is estimated to have lost around 15 per cent of its foreign exchange reserves during the two-week battle to defend the drachma. However, yesterday's decline indicated the government intends to abandon its 'hard drachma' policy and allow the currency to depreciate at a faster rate than the 7-8 per cent projected for this year. This would relieve pressure which has shown no sign of abating since the government lifted capital controls on May 16. At the same time, it would enable the governing Socialists to avoid the heavy political cost of a formal devaluation just before the European parliament elections. One dealer said: 'It's clear that short-term interest rates of over 100 per cent have been asphyxiating the banking system and faster depreciation is one way to bring them down.' Short-term rates have been fluctuating between 70 and 500 per cent. The overnight borrowing rate this week reached 300 per cent, creating serious liquidity problems for smaller banks. In an effort to inject some liquidity into the system, the central bank is to hold a swap auction today for the first time in more than two years. This will allow banks to borrow drachmas against foreign currency from the central bank at lower rates than those prevailing on the inter-bank market. The liquidity squeeze, which has forced banks to raise corporate lending rates above 40 per cent, is also threatening government revenues, as companies are preparing to postpone VAT payments due at the end of the month in order to maintain cash-flow.</p>

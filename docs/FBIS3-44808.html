Over the past  year, however, he had to spend a great deal of time dealing with  problems in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and the Middle East, and he  was bogged down in a terrible predicament. Shortly after 1994  began, he packed his bags and prepared for a European tour. The  purpose of his trip was to appease his West European allies,  persuade the East European countries, and adjust relations with  Russia. Even though his mother has just died, Clinton decided  to set off today according to the original schedule. He will  successively visit Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk, and Geneva.  In Brussels, he will attend the NATO summit meeting, and in  Moscow, he will meet Russian President Yeltsin. These will be  the two most important events on his itinerary.    NATO is a military group composed of 16 Western countries.  Its original target was the former Soviet Union and the East  European bloc. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union  and the drastic changes in Eastern Europe, however, NATO's  orientation became a subject of debate among its member  countries. At the same time, some East European countries  applied to join NATO. At the upcoming NATO summit meeting, a  major topic of discussion will be whether to admit East European  countries into NATO. Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union  and the governmental changes in the East European countries,  their military alliance--the Warsaw Pact--ceased to exist. This  brought about a so-called a "vacuum" in Eastern Europe. On the  other hand, the Russian domestic situation continued to be  unstable, and division and ethnic conflicts occurred in some  East European countries, such as Yugoslavia. Therefore, Poland,  Hungary, Czech, Slovakia, and Lithuania successively demanded  that they be admitted into NATO in order to seek protection  against possible crises. These demands brought the NATO  countries into a dilemma.    First, Russia had already explicitly expressed its  opposition  to NATO's expansion to the East and regarded this as a "threat"  against Russia. Because of Russia's status and its current  delicate domestic situation, NATO countries have no choice but  to give consideration to its feelings. On the other hand, if  these East European countries are admitted into NATO, it will  inevitably cause a division between them and the rest of the  East European countries. If all East European countries,  including Russia, are admitted into NATO, then we will have the  situation that Kissinger described when he said "an alliance  that includes everyone is in fact an alliance of nobody." This  is obviously unrealistic.    What to do? The United States has proposed establishing the  "Partnership for Peace" as a compromise. According to this  proposal, NATO may conclude bilateral agreements with Russia and  other East European countries on increasing military  cooperation, including carrying out joint military maneuvers and  training. For those countries that have explicitly expressed  their hope to join NATO, the "partnership for peace" may be a  transitional stage before they officially become NATO members.  It has been said that the option proposed by the United States  would not offend Russia and would also satisfy the demands of  some East European countries. The proposal has been supported  by all other NATO members.    Clinton's visit to Moscow and his meeting with Russian  President Yeltsin will test U.S. policies and tactics.  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United  States actively supported Yeltsin and his radical reform  policies and made great efforts to persuade other Western  countries to give Yeltsin substantial assistance. The United  States consistently sided with Yeltsin throughout the prolonged  confrontation between Yeltsin and the former Russian parliament.  In the recent Russian legislative elections, however, the  political party Russia's Choice, which represents the  pro-Yeltsin bloc, encountered a setback, and the rising star was  the "Liberal Democratic Party," which represents extreme  nationalist forces. This fact shows that the radical reform  policies that have been pursued by Yeltsin have been unpopular.  Zhirinovsky, the leader of the newly rising "Liberal Democratic  Party," was encouraged by the election results and began to more  fanatically advocate great-nation chauvinism. He even called  for expanding Russia's territory and launching a war. In facing  this situation, Yeltsin had no choice but to keep the United  States at a distance. It is now difficult to predict Russia's  future, and the United States has been rather anxious about  this. Therefore, the United States found it necessary to adjust  its policy and tactics toward Russia. The United States will  continue to give Yeltsin positive support, but it will also try  to prevent this practice from giving an excuse to the opposition  forces in Russia and from stimulating the development of  nationalism in Russia. The United States will continue to  support Russia's reform, but it will also require the reformist  to adopt a more moderate and gradual method and to prevent  excessively radical measures from going beyond the Russian  people's endurance. Russia obviously holds an important  position in the foreign policy consideration of the United  States. Clinton will certain bargain with Yeltsin. However, how  successful will he be? People will have to wait and see.</p>

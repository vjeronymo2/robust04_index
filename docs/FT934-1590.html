			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The first half of the wool selling season in major international markets is coming to an end with prices just holding steady. South Africa closed last week with prices tending dearer. The Australian market indicator edged slightly lower at this week's sales, and yesterday at 471 cents a kg. was 6 cents down compared with a week before. The Christmas recess lasts nearly untill mid January and an uncertain market at closing sales will not help to bring out business at satisfactory prices further down the manufacturing line.</p>

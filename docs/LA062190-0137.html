Coast Highway on June 13.  </P> <P> "She said he was running across Coast Highway, carrying a black bag and looking  over his shoulder," Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> According to police, the thief, posing as a customer, snatched 10 rings off a  display counter at the jewlery store and ran off before the sales clerks had  time to react.  </P> <P> The woman followed the theft suspect up Riverside Drive and then drove up to  next to him while he stepped into a car parked near Cliff Drive Park. She told  police she pretended to admire a house nearby while her daughter wrote down the  car's license plate.  </P> <P> Two days later, Boyes, who is also wanted by authorities in Florida, was  charged with commercial burglary, grand theft and possession of stolen  property. He was being held at the Orange County Jail on Wednesday in lieu of  $150,000 bail, Gonis said.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemical giants bullish on prospects - Bayer/Hoechst After BASF set the tone last week with news of a three-fold increase in third-quarter profits, offset by a warning that the squeeze on costs will continue, much the same is expected from Bayer and Hoechst's nine-month results, due this week. Bayer, expected to publish today, has been bullish on prospects for most of the year, and although improvements on the BASF scale are not to be expected, analysts point out that the Leverkusen group avoided crashing quite so dramatically in the recession as its compatriot competitors. Pre-tax earnings for the third quarter may increase by a third or more, according to most estimates, thanks mainly to health care and strong foreign operations, Bayer's trusty buffers against cyclical crunches. Like BASF, Hoechst is expected to report continued pressure on margins from severe price competition. Although no details are expected, volume growth in traditional chemicals operations in Germany has far exceeded reported increases in sales. At the same time, pre-tax profits will certainly rebound vigorously in comparison with the dismal DM143m (Pounds 58.30m) reported in the third quarter of last year. According to Mr Jurgen Dormann, chairman, the net result will be a doubling of the Hoechst share price by the end of the decade.</p>

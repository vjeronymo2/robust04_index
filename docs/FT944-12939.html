			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: The mystery and the magician - Simon Callow finds that Alec Guinness continues to be an elusive subject ALEC GUINNESS, MASTER OF DISGUISE by Garry O'Connor Hodder Pounds 17.99, 316 pages Alec Guinness is a maddening challenge for a biographer: private life impeccable and without incident; career one of absolutely solid achievement, the one or two failures subsumed in a steady march to glory; work exceptionally fine and universally admired. The renowned mystery and secrecy of the man prove simply to be a refusal of the usual pact by which successful actors, in exchange for perpetual publicity, allow themselves to be reinvented by the media. In fact, Guinness, as countless people - as opposed to journalists? - have testified, is a delightful and amusing companion, deeply interested in the outside world while being inordinately fond of his home, lover of food and wine, relisher of literature and art and prone to intense enthusiasm for both things and people. A paragon, in fact. What's the catch, the biographer wants to know. What, he asks impatiently, makes the guy tick? 'I was not aware,' Guinness replied magisterially to an interviewer who asked the same question, 'that I was ticking.' He is, of course; very loudly indeed. There is a great deal going on inside, emotionally and intellectually. What exactly this might be is the question which Garry O'Connor addresses. Mr O'Connor has a distinguished record as a biographer; his account of Ralph Richardson is nothing short of a masterpiece, the life itself interleaved with his extraordinary encounters with his subject. In the case of Guinness, for better or for worse, he has not had the same advantages. He has accordingly made as much as he can of the existing record, above all, of course, Guinness's own masterly Blessings in Disguise (another curse to the biographer: the carpet pulled from underneath his feet). The revelation that Guinness chose to make in that book of his illegitimacy and terrifying upbringing is the core of Mr O'Connor's meditation on his life and art. The quest for the father; the distrust of the mother. Mr O'Connor detects these everywhere and it is no surprise that he sees Hamlet as the correlative of Guinness's inner journey. There is obvious truth in this; but it cannot explain Guinness either as man or as actor. The essential fact about Guinness is that he transmuted his inner drama into acting, not in an autobiographical sense but by becoming a sort of ontological magician. He was able to release himself into character, or rather, perhaps, he was able to allow himself to be seduced by, to be taken over by, another self; and he did this above all by the power of thought. It was no emotional abandonment, rather a consciously acquired ability to discharge the rage and feelings of impotence that Blessing in Disguise clearly tells us were the primary experiences of his young life. The need to control and release these emotions produced the powerful mental instrument that is central to Guinness's work. There is a mystery here and it turns out to be the mystery of acting itself. Mr O'Connor is not good at analysing this because he is less interested in the physical performance than in what the performance portends. The alchemy is merely alluded to. As for what goes on in Guinness's mind, O'Connor seems to view him as an intellectual; this, I submit, is not the case. He is a man of prodigious, almost frightening, mental force, but ideas, the medium of the intellectual, are not what he uses his mind on. He observes, he penetrates, sometimes he eviscerates. He is a remarkable writer. I would suggest that he is that rare actor, one who has the temperament of a writer - and not necessarily a dramatist. His performances could almost be said to have the depth and complexity of fiction. Perhaps this might explain a certain lack of linearity in his stage career, a quest for characters rather than roles. His has been a unique journey; Mr O'Connor charts it thoroughly and intelligently, in a series of short chapters and in elegant prose which cannot, however, conceal the fact that he raises questions which he is unable to answer. So the Master of Disguise of the title has eluded the detective yet again.</p>

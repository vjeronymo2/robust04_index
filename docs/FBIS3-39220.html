According to a spokesman for the Belgian Foreign Ministry,  Mr. Claes believes "the debate is closed," and that the NATO  decision constitutes a response to a request made by the United  Nations. "Moscow duly went along with the relevant Security  Council resolutions (Resolutions 824 and 836 -- BELGA database  editor's note) which provide for the possibility of military  actions in Bosnia," was the message brought across by Mr. Claes,  as quoted by the spokesman.    Furthermore, in an interview given to the television channel  RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and Television], the Belgian foreign  minister pointed out that a partial withdrawal of Serbian  artillery less than 20 km from Sarajevo would not alter NATO's  willingness to launch attacks against Serbian positions.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata today contacted Chinese and South Korean leaders to  apologize for former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks  shrugging off Japan's wartime atrocities before and during World  War II.    Hata said in a written message to Chinese Premier Li Peng  and  a telephone call to S. Korean President Kim Yong-sam that  Nagano's statement caused pain and anger to the peoples of  Japan's Asian neighboring countries, Japanese Foreign Ministry  officials said.    The government instructed Japanese embassies in member  states  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which  includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore  and Thailand, to explain that Tokyo's policy is to build  future-oriented ties, while squarely facing history, said the  officials.    In his messages, Hata referred to his policy speech  delivered  in the Diet (parliament) earlier in the day in which he renewed  the government recognition that Japan's past actions, including  aggression and colonial rule, inflicted unbearable suffering and  sorrow on many people.    "Communicating this to future generations, the path which  Japan must take, based on its deep remorse, is to do its utmost  toward the creation of peace and toward the construction of a  bright future for the Asia-Pacific region," he said.    Nagano, 71, resigned Saturday [7 May] to take responsibility  for his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication  and that Japan was not a nation of aggression during World War  II.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fyffes tops expectations with advance to IPounds 28.5m FYFFES, the Dublin-based fruit wholesaler, reported a 5.26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 27.1m to IPounds 28.5m (Pounds 29.3m) for the year to October 31, on turnover down 13.8 per cent to IPounds 524m. The company said it believed the results represented 'a significant achievement in the light of more difficult trading conditions this year', a view endorsed by analysts in Dublin who said the results were slightly ahead of expectations. Sales volume had actually increased, the reduced turnover reflecting low fresh produce prices in the UK market, and stiff competition in the European banana market. Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, said that the withdrawal of sterling from the ERM last September and its subsequent devaluation had also deflated the profit and turnover figures, 'as most of our business is done in sterling'. He said that the translation difference was 16 per cent, the results in 1991 being calculated at an exchange rate of 92p to the pound, while the 1992 results were calculated at 109p to the pound. The company said it expects sales in the mainland European market to grow in 1993 as a result of its deal with Saba Trading in Sweden to supply 'a substantial part of their banana requirements under the Fyffes label' and which also allows Fyffes to take a stake in Saba's Dutch and Spanish distribution subsidiaries. The company also drew attention to the fact that it has now obtained the right to use the Fyffes trademark worldwide 'which is essential to the development of our international business in the new single market in Europe'. Mr McCann said that the new EC banana regime, which will come into force in July, 'may make it more difficult to get direct volume growth, and will mean we will have to focus more on acquisition'. The company has a IPounds 100m cash hoard, most of it currently on deposit in the Dublin market where it has been able to attract high interest rates during the currency crisis. Brokers in Dublin said this should improve profit figures for 1993, as should the punt's devaluation this week and improved trading conditions throughout the EC. Earnings per share were 5.9p (6.73p) and a 10 per cent increase in the final dividend to 0.8978p is recommended, making a total of 1.2527p.</p>

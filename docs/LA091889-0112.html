			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EDITOR QUITS AFTER JOKE SEES PRINT  </P> <P> The city editor of the Philadelphia Daily News has resigned after a joke he  inserted into a news release was mistakenly printed, the newspaper announced  today.  </P> <P> Tom Opdyke had slipped the joke into an announcement of scholarships being  established in memory of the late NBC newswoman Jessica Savitch, who drowned in  1983 when the car in which she was riding plunged into the Delaware Canal.  </P> <P> Opdyke, 36, had electronically inserted a phrase stating that the scholarships  in broadcast journalism would also be available to students seeking "college  instruction in automobile-escape techniques."  </P> <P> In an article in today's Daily News, Editor Zachary Stalberg quoted Opdyke as  saying he never intended for the phrase to appear in the newspaper. Opdyke said  he had planned to add a notation saying the phrase was not part of the news  release, but forgot.  </P></p>

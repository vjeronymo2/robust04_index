			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks/Vag Mersey Docks and Harbour Company has won the contract to become the southern port of entry for Volkswagen and Audi cars, through its recently acquired port of Sheerness. The Vag contract will last 10 years and should move 65,000 cars a year from a 50 acre holding terminal. This will more than make up for the recent loss of the Toyota contract, which switched to Bristol. Toyota moved about 45,000 cars a year.</p>

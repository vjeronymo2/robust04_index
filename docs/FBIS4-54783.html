			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- The Cabinet on Wednesday examined  the government guidelines of the tasks of the Polish Foreign  policy in 1994, which will be presented to the Sejm at its 20th  meeting.    One of the priorities of Poland's foreign policy is to  ensure  lasting security. To serve this end, Poland will maintain good  relations with all her neighbours and create conditions for  unrestrained economic and capital exchange. At the same time  Poland supports the process of linking the East and West through  an expansion of the existing security structures, that is the  European Union, the Western European Union and NATO.    In Poland's opinion integration with the European  communities  may ensure this country conditions for lasting development.  Poland will also aim at close cooperation with the U.S. and the  Far East countries. The priorities also cover conditions to be  created for free contacts of individuals.    The Council of Ministers adopted a resolution on the Polish  military contingent in the U.N. Disengagement Observance Forces  (UNDOF) in Syria and amendments to the resolution on the Polish  military contingent in the U.N. special missions.    The ministers resolved to earmark 44 billion zlotys (over 2  million dollars) for the Ministry of National Defence to  transform the Polish Medical Company into a logistic battalion  operating within the U.N. interim force in Lebanon.    The Cabinet appointed the minister for foreign economic  relations chairman of the Polish side in the intergovernmental  commission and coordinating councils for transborder and  interegional cooperation. The establishment of bilateral  commissions and coordinating councils for transborder  cooperation is envisaged in Poland's agreements with Belarus,  Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine.    Also on Wednesday, Transport Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki  briefed the Cabinet about details of the tragic bus accident  that had occurred near Gdansk on Monday. The minister announced  a radical acceleration of work on the bill concerning licences  for professional transport and forwarding agents.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak stressed the urgent need to  change related regulations to eliminate similar accidents in the  future, and to modernise the coach and bus stock.</p>

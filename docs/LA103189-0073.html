			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. THEATER;  </P> <P> 'CODE' STAR LOVES ROLE,DISLIKES CHARACTER;  </P> <P> STAGE: PLAYING A BRILLIANT BUT ECCENTRIC BRITISH CRYPTOGRAPHER IN THE SCR  BIOGRAPHICAL DRAMA HAS GIVEN THE STAR A CHALLENGE AND INSIGHT ON A THOROUGHLY  DISAGREEABLE PERSON.  </P> <P> Jonathan McMurtry believes that if he and Alan Turing -- the British  mathematician he plays in "Breaking the Code" at South Coast Repertory -- had  ever met at a cocktail party, the encounter would have been unpleasant for both  of them.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't have liked him personally," McMurtry says. "I would have found him  too self-centered. He was rather opinionated. And he could be very biting,  especially with people who didn't understand his work. I probably would have  said, . . . what's wrong with him?' "  </P> <P> Willful, stubborn, unkempt -- Turing was that, too. Though brilliant, he  stammered like a schoolboy and bit his nails obsessively. Yet when you ask what  pleasure McMurtry gets from playing such a character, he notes that Turing's  disagreeable traits presented the sort of challenge that has always drawn him  to difficult roles.  </P> <P> This paradox amuses him. "I like doing unattractive people," says the star of  Hugh Whitemore's biographical drama, which opened Friday on the SCR Mainstage.  "I don't like to play heroes."  </P> <P> Among his more than 100 roles at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, for instance,  the slightly built, sandy-haired actor particularly relishes Iago in "Othello,"  whom he interpreted as a compulsive liar and sociopath in the guise of a  seemingly honest hail-fellow-well-met.  </P> <P> This time, far from portraying a consummate dissembler, McMurtry gives us  someone who is constitutionally unable to keep up any pretense whatsoever. Even  the exchange of mere social pleasantries is a hurdle for Turing, who feels  friendlier toward his computer prototypes -- "thinking machines" he called them  -- than toward people.  </P> <P> There was considerably more to Turing than his defects, of course. A genius at  cryptography, he cracked the secret German military code during World War II.  Turing's work, championed by Winston Churchill, enabled the Allies to counter  German U-boat attacks, thereby gaining a naval advantage in the North Atlantic  without which the war could have been lost.  </P> <P> Ironically, the absence of sham in Turing's iconoclastic personality -- which  ordinarily might have been a virtue -- proved disastrous. In what turned out to  be his worst mistake, he told the police investigating a petty burglary at his  home that he was having a homosexual affair. The voluntary admission brought  about his arrest for moral turpitude, eventually led to his expulsion from  academia and ultimately precipitated his suicide.  </P> <P> "This is the hardest role I've tackled," McMurtry maintains, sipping coffee  from a Styrofoam cup during a recent interview at SCR. "I've never played this  kind of man. He is a genuine eccentric. It's exciting to be in his body, to see  what makes him tick. I almost live the character. I've never bitten my nails,  and now I find myself doing it all of a sudden."  </P> <P> In fact, the actor's nails look manicured, and he seems entirely composed.  Casually dressed in a plaid shirt, blue pullover and corduroy pants, he gives  not the slightest hint of Turing's excitability or of his overweening  self-absorption.  </P> <P> At 50, McMurtry lives in San Diego with his wife, Terri, and has played leading  roles at most of California's major theaters, including the Mark Taper Forum in  Los Angeles, the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco and the Los  Angeles Theatre Center. He last appeared at SCR in 1986 as the melancholy  Jacques in "As You Like It."  </P> <P> Born in Detroit, McMurtry says he grew up "in the trunk" because both of his  parents were show-biz dancers. They toured so often that he eventually went to  live with his grandparents in Southern California. Not surprisingly, he shunned  the idea of making a theatrical career at first and preferred the idea of  becoming a painter.  </P> <P> But he changed his mind around 1960 at Los Angeles City College, where he won a  nationwide audition for a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in  London. After training there for two years, "I came back ready to lick the  world," he recalls. "I thought I could do anything. And of course I couldn't."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, McMurtry is a great believer in British stage technique. Too many  "American actors are lazy," he contends. They have the impression that "if you  think right and feel right, it will come out right," he says. "Well, it doesn't  work that way."  </P> <P> To prepare for his role in "Breaking the Code," McMurtry says he consulted a  speech therapist to explore the cause of Turing's stammer. He also sought the  advice of a university professor to understand the mathematical meaning of  various terms that figure in Turing's theories, one of which is given at length  in a monologue running to more than three pages.  </P> <P> But for all the surface dryness of Turing's favorite topics -- such as the  interface between electronics and higher logic -- McMurtry brings the man to  life with a strikingly visceral performance. His portrayal of a lonely,  abstract thinker resonates with a subterranean force remarkable for its  repressed energy.  </P> <P> "I usually try to find what the body does first," the actor explains, "because  the rhythms and speech patterns depend on that. A stammer comes from an  emotional place. It has a lot of explosive stuff behind it.  </P> <P> "In Turing's case his mind just works faster than his mouth. He can't catch up  with himself. So he gets mad and irritated that his words are not coming out.  And he is most passionate when he is talking about his ideas. That's when he  gets really emotional."  </P> <P> As for Turing's homosexuality, McMurtry purposely avoids the use of effeminate  gestures. Although the character candidly asserts his sexual orientation -- and  several scenes show Turing's predilection for rough young men -- McMurtry gives  scant physical indication of the obvious.  </P> <P> "He was not limp-wristed or anything like that," McMurtry says. "If he were,  I'd play that. It's not a problem. I've played raging queens, salad boys, total  faggots. But Turing is not an old poof, even though that is how he describes  himself."  </P> <P> Indeed, the most intriguing aspect of the character resides elsewhere. For  Turing seems, above all, a tragic figure in the classic sense, driven by pride  and overtaken by events beyond his control.  </P> <P> "I see him almost as a Creon image," McMurtry says, "an exile in a land that  doesn't work the way he works."  </P> <P> "Breaking the Code" by Hugh Whitemore continues on the Mainstage at South Coast  Repertory through Nov. 30. The theater is at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.  Curtain Tuesday to Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; matinees Saturday  and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $18 to 27. Box office: (714) s957-4033.  </P> <P> </P></p>

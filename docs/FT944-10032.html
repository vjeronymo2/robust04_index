			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Markets wait Foreign exchanges spent a quiet day yesterday as traders fixed their gaze on next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US, writes Philip Gawith. With no statistics of note, and markets shut for holidays in the US, France and Belgium, trade was very subdued. The dollar shed some of its recent gains to finish in London at DM1.528, from DM1.5348. Against the yen it closed at Y97.5, from Y98.04. In Europe, the D-Mark was firmer against the French franc, which closed at FFr3.439 from FFr3.437. A poll showing Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European commission, and possible socialist candidate next year for the presidency, ahead of conservative rivals for the first time, bothered markets. The Swedish krona gained ground against the D-Mark ahead of Sunday's referendum on EU membership, closing at SKr4.750 from SKr4.769. Analysts said the result was too close to call. Sterling had a steady day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.3, from 80.4. In a day otherwise bereft of news and statistics, the most interesting contribution came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank. Speaking to bankers in Munich, he said that any move in official German interest rate depended 'primarily' on the money supply. Other factors such as exchange rates and commodity prices were also carefully considered. He stressed the theme, much repeated recently, that there was scope for German rates to both rise or fall. 'Unlike other central banks we do not operate an anti-cyclical policy. That is why the subject of an interest rate rise by no means stands unilaterally in the foreground,' said Mr Tietmeyer. 'Rather, we will carefully check on all sides.' The Bundesbank council left interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Thursday. Mr Tietmeyer said there were chances that German inflation, just below three per cent now, would fall further. Much attention was focused on what the Fed is likely to do on Tuesday. Most observers are now settling for a likely 50 basis point rise in the Federal funds rate, the market having retreated from its recent stance that nothing short of a 75-100 basis point rise in rates would be sufficient. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has never presided over a move of more than 50 basis points in the federal funds rate. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at Abn-Amro in London, said that although there was more talk of the dollar having bottomed, 'there is not a great deal of confidence that the turn is here.' Indeed, the lack of confidence is reflected in the view of many analysts that a 50 basis point rise will be poorly received by the foreign exchange market. An important caveat is that the Fed may be able to carry off such a move if it makes clear that it has not ruled out a further, similar monetary tightening in December. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 500m shortage, at established rates, in its daily money market operations. Overnight money was very easy, trading between 3 1/2 per cent and 4 3/4 per cent. This set the pattern for other short-dated rates, with money up to one month offered below the base rate of 5 3/4 per cent. Short sterling futures lost ground across the board, but volumes were very thin. The December short sterling contract closed at 93.59, from 93.61 on Thursday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in  Manila -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ramos] As agreed at the  Cabinet meeting yesterday, I am sending Vice President Joseph  Estrada as my special representative to the inauguration of the  new South African state, whose president will be proclaimed or  inaugurated in Pretoria on 10 May 1994. This was upon the  invitation of the Government of South Africa.    As most of you already know, especially the old timers, the  Philippines has had a long and distinguished record in being at  the forefront of the anti-apartheid crusade. As one of the  founding fathers of the UN special committee against apartheid,  the Philippines prominently and consistently took the lead in  the cause for equality for all South Africans.    Among the members of the vice president's delegation are  Ambassador Taday, who is our ambassador and envoy extra ordinary  and plenipotentiary to South Africa; Mrs. Estrada; the chief of  staff of the vice president, Buddy Abentajado; Mrs. Abentajado;  and a senior officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr.  Miguel Bautista.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Of the three priority sectors, Japan and the United  States are expected to reach an agreement on the government  procurement sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  prior to Japan-U.S. summit to be held during the industrialized  nations' summit talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July.    During negotiations on the government procurement sector,  the  Japanese side has promised that the Japanese Government offices  will "significantly increase" their purchase of foreign-made  communications apparatuses and medical equipment, and the United  States has virtually accepted the promise as "Japan's future  commitment." The United States is likely to definitely promise  Japan that the it will not impose any sanctions against Japan on  the grounds that Japan has failed to live up to its future  commitment. The two countries will work out an agreement  document after vice ministerial negotiations, which are  scheduled for Tokyo beginning 22 June, discuss the details of  the words "significant increase."    Both Japan and the United States are in a hurry to  coordinate  their views on the insurance sector, one of the three priority  sectors, in an effort to find areas of agreement prior to the  Naples summit. The two countries, however, have still failed to  bridge their wide differences on the automobile and auto parts  sector, and it would be difficult for the two countries to reach  an agreement on the sector prior to the Naples summit. The two  countries are expected to put off settling negotiations on the  automobile and auto parts sector until later by compiling an  "interim report" assessing progress in the negotiations. As a  result, the two countries will have to seek a phased-settlement  for the three priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks.    In the negotiations on the government procurement sector,  both Japan and the United States are expected to concede to each  other on the question of how to handle an "objective criteria"  aimed at measuring the openness of the Japanese market. During  the negotiations on government procurement, the Japan has given  the United States it's commitment to a "significant increase"  while rejecting any "numerical targets" which commit it to  specific market shares for American corporations in the  government procurement sector. The idea is surfacing of making  the phrase "Japan's maintenance of the past growth trend in the  medium and long term" Japan's commitment, and the vice  ministerial negotiations will discuss details of Japan's  commitment. The purchase of foreign-made telecommunications  apparatuses and medical equipment by government offices in 1992  amounted to approximately $32 million and $85 million,  respectively.    Japan has so far maintained that the objective criteria  should be used as a yardstick to measure the actual purchase of  telecommunications apparatus and medical equipment by government  offices from the past to the present. The United States,  however, has argued that the objective criteria should be used  as some targets for future purchases. Thus, the two countries  dispute how to apply the objective criteria. The United States  has asserted that "government procurement is different from the  private sector's procurement and the government can intervene in  the its own procurement to some extent." The Japanese Government  has decided to give the United States it's moderate commitment  after accepting this assertion. The United States is likely to  praise highly Japan's policy shift to accept the U.S. demand for  setting future targets.    Japan and the United States are in a hurry to settle the  negotiations on the government procurement sector, because the  deadline for deciding whether to slap sanctions against Japan in  accordance with a provision concerning the government  procurement in the Omnibus Trade Act falls at the end of June.  If the two countries fail to reach an agreement on the  government procurement sector, prompting the U.S. Congress to  begin debating sanctions against Japan, the yen would further  appreciate against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets  and a steep rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar  would have an adverse impact on the economies of the two  countries. Both countries fear the consequences of this.</p>

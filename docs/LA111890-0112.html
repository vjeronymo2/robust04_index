			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: FICTION  </P> <P> NEW STORIES FROM THE SOUTH: The Year's Best, 1990, edited by Shannon Ravenel  (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill: $9.95, paper; 229 pp.).  </P> <P> The odd thing about short fiction anthologies that label themselves as being  "from the South" (never the Midwest, or the Northeast) is that, despite what  seems like an affectation, the stories, sure enough, do sound Southern. Why?  Editor Shannon Ravenel admits to confusion, herself: "a strong narrative voice  . . . deep involvement in place . . . in family bonds and in local tradition."  Whatever. Happily, all but one or two of the 16 stories making up this  collection succeed resoundingly in not only sounding Southern, but in casting  light -- much of it harsh light -- on characters, or circumstances, of great  intricacy. All in all, editor Ravenel has picked wisely and sensitively in this  well-rounded study of people in crisis or at crossroads. Don G. Campbell  </P></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Credit Suisse wins mandate for Dollars 500m offering from IADB THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched its expected Dollars 500m issue of 10-year Eurobonds, after a fierce round of competitive bidding among banks for the mandate to arrange the issue. Credit Suisse First Boston was awarded the mandate to arrange the deal, which was priced to yield just 18 basis points more than the 6 3/8 per cent Treasury due 2002. Dealers were not surprised by the aggressive pricing of the offering, given the level of competition among potential underwriters. The bonds looked expensive compared with 10-year paper for the Asian Development Bank, trading at a yield spread of 21 basis points. However, there is a lack of paper trading below par, following the recent rally in the US Treasury market. Dealers reported some demand from Asia, but said the deal would take some time to place. Meanwhile, Italy is reported to be considering launching a large dollar transaction, totalling Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn, following its recent DM5bn Eurobond. However, dealers said such an issue would have to be carefully priced, as investors remain nervous about the credit. The Portuguese escudo bond market was tapped for the first time since last April by the European Investment Bank, which launched an Esc10bn five-year bond. An official at Espirito Santo-Sociedade de Investimentos, the lead manager, said the convergence of interest rates between the Euro-escudo and the domestic escudo since the liberalisation of capital movement in Portugal last December made the issue attractive to domestic investors. The EIB bond was priced at 100.75 to yield 12.53 per cent, which compared with a yield of 12.47 per cent in the recent auction of Portuguese government bonds of a comparable maturity. The bonds were trading at 99.90, well inside total fees of 1 5/8 per cent. Two further Canadian dollar issues, totalling CDollars 470m, for a Japanese government-backed agency, and the Austrian government-guaranteed Asfinag added to the supply in an already over-crowded market. Syndicate managers said distribution was slow since there was little to choose between the issuers. More than CDollars 1bn has been issued since Friday. Dealers said the 10-year paper from Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises went well, as its yield spread of 43 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds was more generous than other recent issues. By contrast, the syndicate on Asfinag's 10-year offer, which yielded 40 basis points over, had still not broken by last night. Columbia plans to launch a sovereign Eurobond this year to open the way for public and private entities to tap international capital markets, according to finance minister Mr Rudolf Hommes, Reuter reports. 'We are preparing it for this year, I don't know whether in the first or the second half,' he said. Mr Hommes added that the final amount was still under discussion but added the funds raised would be used to repay expensive public borrowing.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET THREAT EASING: CIA;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC DEFECTION A SEVERE BLOW  </P> <P> The director of the CIA told Congress today that Eastern Europe's tumultuous  push for democracy has cut the Soviet threat to the West and that "we can  probably expect a continued diminution."  </P> <P> William H. Webster, in an unusual public appearance before the Senate Armed  Services Committee, said that as unchallenged Communist control comes to an end  in the Eastern Bloc, those nations' links to Moscow have been radically  changed.  </P> <P> The result, he said, is a severe blow to the Soviet Union's certainty that  Eastern Europe will respond to Moscow's military directives.  </P> <P> The armed services committee is beginning work on writing a defense budget for  fiscal 1991 with an assessment of the Soviet threat to the West.  </P> <P> "Overall, the conventional threat to the United States and our alliance  partners in Europe has decreased as a result of changes in Eastern Europe and  Soviet force reductions," Webster told the panel.  </P> <P> The CIA director cautioned, however, that the Soviet Union is vigorously  upgrading its strategic forces.  </P> <P> Webster cited the Soviets' deployment last year of two new silo-based nuclear  missiles, the continued deployment of SS-25 and SS-24 rail-mobile missiles and  the launching of new Typhoon and Delta-IV ballistic missile submarines.  </P> <P> The Soviets also have made considerable gains in the anti-submarine effort, but  they still "will be unable at least in this decade to threaten U.S. subs in the  open ocean," Webster said.  </P> <P> In what appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for the CIA and other  intelligence agencies, Webster said the United States must maintain its  intelligence capability. He pointed to the continued Soviet strategic  modernization and to terrorism, illegal drugs, uncertainty in Latin America,  Asia and the Middle East and weapons proliferation.  </P> <P> Intelligence operations are hidden in the Defense Department budget, which  faces significant cuts on Capitol Hill this year. Although the exact figures  are secret, U.S. intelligence reportedly spends $25 billion to $30 billion a  year, just under 10% of the defense budget.  </P> <P> In his public statement, Webster emphasized that the situation in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union is in constant flux, with widespread economic  problems, turmoil in regional areas and the Communist Party's reduced power.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is committed to reforms, but they have  been slow in coming, the CIA director said. The chance of Gorbachev's removal  as Kremlin leader is unlikely, and a major reversal of his policies would come  only if he is removed from power, Webster said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, "we can probably expect a continued diminution -- but not  elimination -- of Soviet threats to U.S. interests," the CIA director said.  </P> <P> A question-and-answer period was held in closed session.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Harry Soyster, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agreed  with Webster, telling the committee that the threat of "deliberate aggression  directed against Europe and its extension to global conflict is much reduced."  </P></p>

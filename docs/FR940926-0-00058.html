Such disturbance could promote erosion and greater ingression of alien plant taxa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . No evidence of disease has been reported for the four endangered fern taxa. Predation by feral goats and/or sheep has been reported for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at Pohakuloa Training Area (Shaw 1992, R. Shaw,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1993). Because no colonies have been completely decimated by the animals, they apparently do not seek out this fern. However, further predation may occur if their preferred forage is not available. Predation by feral goats is a potential threat to the other two sizable known populations of this fern at Keauhou and Kulani (Linda Cuddihy, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Three of the endangered fern taxa have populations located on privately owned land. All four also occur on State and Federal lands. The known populations of these species located on Federal lands are inadequate to ensure their long-term survival. There are no State laws or existing regulatory mechanisms at the present time to protect or prevent further decline of these plants on State or private land. However, Federal listing automatically invokes listing under Hawaii State law. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act [of 1973] shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter.'' This State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant on State or private land, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. However, the regulations are difficult to enforce because of limited personnel. Further, the State law encourages conservation by State government agencies. The State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, Sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Listing of these four plant taxa therefore triggers, reinforces and supplements the protection available under State law. The Act also provides additional protection to these four species because it is a violation of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued existence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The small number of populations and of individual plants of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. For example, only 4 populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diplazium molokaiense  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are known, totaling 23 individuals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is known from 3 populations totaling 26 individuals,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ctenitis squamigera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from 7 populations, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from 8 populations. Three of the endangered taxa are estimated to number no more than 100 known individuals and the fourth ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) numbers fewer than 300 known individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All four endangered fern taxa are threatened by competition with one or more alien plant taxa. Koster's curse, a noxious shrub first reported on Oahu in 1941, had spread through much of the Koolau Mountains by the early 1960s, and spread to the Waianae Mountains by 1970 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This shrub replaces native plants of the forest understory and poses a serious threat to the population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> located in Kaluanui Valley on the windward side of the Koolau Mountains (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). It also poses a threat to populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ctenitis squamigera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diplazium molokaiense  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

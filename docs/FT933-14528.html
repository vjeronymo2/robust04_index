			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: The price of Maastricht BRITAIN will ratify Maastricht. The only question remaining is whether the treaty has the potential still to destroy Mr John Major's premiership. That - as has most of the tortuous process during which Mr Major has struggled to salvage a single point from what he once claimed as game, set and match - needs some explanation. After a year of ruinous conflict in the Tory party the bill to give legal force to the treaty is within sight of Royal Assent. If Mr Major is fortunate it will be signed and sealed before MPs depart for their Umbrian villas at the end of July. But two minefields remain. The first lies in the House of Lords, where Lady Thatcher is promising today to blemish her parliamentary career by voting against her party for the first time in 34 years. In spite of the pledge of Lord Rees-Mogg and his fellow backwoodsmen to follow their heroine into the division lobbies in support of a referendum, Mr Major is quietly confident she will not derail the treaty. The odds are that a majority will recognise the inherent illogicality of an unelected, un-accountable chamber demanding the people should decide. If for some obscure reason they do not, the prime minister's battered reputation will take another severe knock. Ratification would be further delayed. But eventually the House of Commons, which has already voted overwhelmingly against a referendum, would overturn the peers. The second, more serious, threat lies in the subsequent vote by MPs on the social chapter. Here we hit the legal technicalities. But it is important they are understood because this vote might - and the conditional tense is important - fatally wound Mr Major. During the spring an unholy alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics forced through an amendment related to Britain's opt-out from the treaty's social provisions. The amendment states that final ratification - the physical transfer of the legal instruments to Rome - can take place only after MPs and peers have voted on the wisdom or otherwise of the opt-out. It does not specify that MPs must support the deal negotiated by Mr Major, merely that a vote must take place on a motion tabled by the government after the bill has become law. The trap lies in another amendment being framed by the Labour party. In essence the new amendment, on which MPs will vote alongside the government motion, will say this: even though Maastricht has been enacted, the treaty itself should not be ratified unless the opt-out is scrapped. Labour is drafting the change in close consultation with the Tory sceptics. If the opposition can persuade a dozen or so of the rebels to join them then Mr Major could be defeated. The sceptics, of course, do not want the social chapter. But some of the diehards see in it a last chance to wreck the whole process. After all, Mr Major has declared he could never abandon the opt-out. So in the event of a government defeat Mr John Smith would demand the prime minister embrace the social chapter while the sceptics - including perhaps one or two in the cabinet - would insist he abandon the entire treaty. Of course it is not that simple. Mr Major might simply ignore the vote and complete the ratification process regardless. It would be messy - and probably subject to later judicial challenge - but better than leaving Britain isolated in Europe. Politics though would count for much more than legal sophistry. It is far from clear Mr Major could survive such a blow to his authority. Whatever the advice of the lawyers, however perverse the motivation of some Tory MPs, it might be impossible also to ignore the expressed will of parliament. All these issues were discussed in detail by the prime minister and his most senior colleagues yesterday. They concluded not to disclose their intentions in advance of the social chapter debate. Perhaps they have a masterplan, overlooked so far by their opponents. More likely they believe that uncertainty offers the best chance of unnerving the Tory sceptics. Some in the government disagree. They want Mr Major to give an unequivocal commitment to ratify come what may - a public warning to the rebels that if Britain were to end up with the treaty plus the social chapter they not the government would bear the blame. Perhaps life is not that simple. And the same message presumably can be conveyed to the sceptics as effectively in private as in public. But the reality there is no other option but to ratify Maastricht. A majority in the cabinet - foreign secretary and chancellor among them - could not accept a different outcome. The sceptics eventually may understand this and vote for once with their own party. The strengthening economic recovery might then refloat Mr Major's government. But what price his premiership if he does lose in the Commons on the social chapter and then suffers a crushing defeat in the Christchurch by-election?</p>

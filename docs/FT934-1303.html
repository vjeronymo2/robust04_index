			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / People: Younger faces in China China is giving the Bank of China, the country's foreign currency arm, a facelift with the appointment of a new chairman of the board and governor, writes Tony Walker. State Council, China's cabinet, recently approved the appointments which are expected to be announced formally today. Wang Qiren, 52, will become chairman, and 41-year-old Wang Xuebing will assume the role of governor or president. The appointment of the two Wangs is part of a trend throughout China's bureaucracy to promote younger officials to senior office. They will replace another Wang (Wang Deyan), 63, who has served as both chairman and governor for the past eight years. The new Wangs at the Bank of China are seen as proteges of Zhu Rongji, China's economic tsar and governor of the People's Bank, China's central bank. Zhu has also been making youthful appointments to the People's Bank board. Wang Qiren is currently vice-chairman of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, a politically sensitive post concerned with the colony's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Before his move to that job he worked in China's state-controlled banking sector for 20 years. Wang Xuebing is currently vice-chairman of the Everbright Industrial Corporation, one of China's state-owned conglomerates. He is a former head of the Bank of China's New York branch. The new appointments coincide with sweeping reforms of the banking sector. Among changes are attempts to transform the Bank of China and the country's three large commercial banks into commercial entities in the Western sense. They have tended to act to this point as cash dispensers to faltering state industries.</p>

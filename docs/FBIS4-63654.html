			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has paid a  working visit to the town of Pervomaysk in Nikolayev Oblast.  Our correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko, reports. [passage omitted]    [Naumenko] Considering the large number of complex problems  facing the Ukrainian people today that demand urgent solutions,  the president of Ukraine had to answer many questions.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid  Makarovych, a question from Ukrainian Radio. I would not like  to talk about serious issues on this festive day, but obviously  everyone's thoughts today go to Crimea. How will you comment on  the further course of developments?    [Kravchuk] We made this decision: As soon as the Crimean  Parliament revokes the law it passed, the Supreme Council will  also suspend its' resolution. Thus, it is all up to the Supreme  Council of Crimea. Once it revokes the law, the Supreme Council  of Ukraine will revoke its respective resolution.    I hope that the delegation formed by the Supreme Council of  Crimea will arrive in Kiev and, I hope, we will find a solution,  but the solution must go one way: No change in the status, no  change in Ukraine's territorial integrity. Within the framework  of this process, the process of finding mutual understanding,  there should be no change in status and territorial integrity.  If this is taken as a point of reference, we will find any, I  stress, any solution. But integrity and statehood is the bottom  line, which nobody is allowed to cross. [words indistinct]    [Correspondent] Do you think the Crimean Parliament has gone  too far in its claims against Ukraine's territorial integrity?    [Kravchuk] I think, wherever it has gone it will return.  Because such will be the necessary legal action taken by  Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. I am informed that our foreign  minister has addressed the world, explaining our stance, and  that our stance has been met with full support for Ukraine's  territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. The world  has recognized Ukraine, recognized our right and our stance.  Incidentally, this is confirmed by the foreign minister [words  indistinct]. Russia is not disputing the issue of our  territorial integrity. This is understandable -- that it cannot  dispute what has been recognized by the entire world and  endorsed in the treaty between Russia and Ukraine of 1990, and  in the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow by the presidents  of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia.    [Correspondent] Do you think that, unfortunately, our  colleagues, journalists from Ostankino television company, are  being somewhat aggressive in their constant...I don't even know  what to call it....    [Kravchuk] I hope we don't have to pay attention to  Ostankino, and this would be our best step; but despite its  being so, I don't know what to call it [word indistinct] is  being worked up. Also, by the way, if one is to blame someone  for something, I don't want to generalize, then one must recall  the coverage of the Transdniester events, the coverage of the  (Karabakh) events, the coverage of the events in Georgia,  Abkhazia, and now even in Ukraine and Crimea, all this coverage  can be described as one thing: Conscious instigation of  confrontation between the people. If this is the goal of  Ostankino or of those behind it, this goal may be reached in  Ostankino's view, but not in the view of the people who do not  believe it, who, I am sure, have stopped believing these  untruths.

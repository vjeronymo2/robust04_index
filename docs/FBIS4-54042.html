			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO--Japan and the United  States on Tuesday [24 May] announced a breakthrough in a  three-month deadlock over framework trade talks that will "boost  confidence" in the tattered trade ties between the two countries.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bill Clinton hailed the  trade  accord in a telephone call after negotiators clinched the deal  after four days of intense talks which wound up shortly after 1  A.M. Tuesday.    "Where there is a will there is a way," Hata was quoted as  telling Clinton during the 40-minute phone chat.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who announced the  accord at a White House news conference, said he also talked  with foreign minister Koji Kakizawa over the phone Tuesday  morning and the two agreed to meet in Paris early next month.    Both Kantor and Kakizawa are scheduled to attend the  ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development scheduled to be held in Paris on June 7-8.    Clinton and Hata agreed that the accord "shows they can  resolve issues and strengthen relations between the two  countries, and it will boost confidence between the two  countries," Kantor said.    The heart of the controversy over the framework agreement  concluded between the two countries in July last year centers on  the so-called "objective criteria" for measuring imports into  Japan.    The framework talks collapsed in February when Tokyo  rejected  U.S. demands which Japanese officials criticized as "numerical  targets" for market shares of U.S. products in the Japanese  market.    "The two sides agreed that the objective criteria do not  mean  numerical targets," said Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister  Sadayuki Hayashi.    Kantor, while confirming that the U.S. is not seeking  "numerical targets," emphasized that any agreement with Japan  must result in "increased access and sales" to the Japanese  market.    The U.S. will not accept "merely changing regulations and  procedures" in Japan, Kantor said.    The agreement announced Tuesday [24 May] calls for  negotiations to work out the specific language on the objective  criteria for three "priority" industry areas -- Japanese  Government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business.    Hayashi, speaking at a separate news conference in  Washington, said the two countries have agreed to use both  "quantitative and qualitative" yardsticks to measure progress of  imports into Japan.    Negotiations on the three priority areas are expected to  begin "as soon as possible," Hayashi said.    Kantor said the two sides also plan to begin negotiations on  financial services, another industry covered by the framework  accord.    Kantor said the U.S. also expects Japan to take aggressive  fiscal measures to boost both domestic demand and imports.    The deal came two weeks after Clinton agreed to work out a  common "basis" for restarting the framework talks before the  Group of Seven summit meeting scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples.    The rupture of the framework negotiations at the summit  meeting between Clinton and Hata's predecessor, Morihiro  Hosokawa, badly soured bilateral trade relations and rocked  global financial markets.    The agreement to restart the framework talks "will help  improve our mutual understanding and mutual trust," Hayashi said.    Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo  Okamatsu, a key Japanese negotiator in the framework talks, said  the new accord should "wipe out" the concern of countries in  Asia and Europe over the trade frictions between the world's two  largest economies.    The agreement announced Tuesday, however, marks only the  first step toward anything like an equilibrium in trade between  Japan and the U.S.    Japan's vast trade surplus with the U.S. -- the primary  cause  behind last year's initiative for the framework talks -- remains  huge and growing.    Japan posted a record 59 billion dollar trade surplus with  the U.S. last year.    Trade figures released by the U.S. Commerce Department last  week showed Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. jumped 25  percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars.</p>

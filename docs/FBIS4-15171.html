			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Press Center report: </F> "Sitting of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Presidium"]    [Text] A sitting of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Presidium  was held yesterday.    In his introductory remarks at the opening of the sitting F.  Mukhametshin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, dwelt on a number  of the priority problems confronting Tatarstan.    He emphasized that the treaty concluded between Tatarstan  and  Russia legally enshrined the path trodden by the Republic  following the proclamation of state sovereignty. The results of  the ballot on 13 March were a kind of vote of confidence by  Tatarstanis in the policy chosen by the Republic.    Now, F. Mukhametshin said, it is necessary to immediately  begin formulation of the strategy of the political and economic  development of Tatarstan under the new historical conditions. It  is necessary to get right down to filling sovereignty with real  content, assimilate to the maximum the possibilities that have  been acquired, and engage as quickly as possible the mechanisms  of realization of the central provisions of the treaty. It is  necessary to formulate an official program specially for this.  It is a question of painstaking work geared to confirmation of  the durability of sovereignty.    This means an intensification of the work [line illegible].  It is necessary to critically review the state of affairs in all  sectors of the economy, analyze the financial, tax, and credit  policy pursued by the government, and closely examine the  priorities of economic support proposed by the president of the  Republic of Tatarstan in his budget message for 1994. It is  essential to revitalize the government's manifestly inadequate  work on the search for internal reserves and possibilities of  Tatarstan for imparting new impetus to the economic reforms, for  a way out of the crisis, and for support for small and medium  business.    His speech noted particularly that an appreciable adjustment  of the law-making activity of the Supreme Soviet and its  Presidium was required under the new conditions. The Supreme  Soviet should by political and legal means support the  realization of the treaty and the state sovereignty of the  Republic. New laws actively influencing the progress of the  economic reform and laws ensuring the social protection of the  populace are needed. It is necessary to accelerate the  preparation of bills on a reform of the representative and  executive organs of state power of Tatarstan. The obsolete forms  are clearly holding back development here, F. Mukhametshin said.    The chairman of the Supreme Soviet called attention to the  need for an all-around analysis of the progress of privatization  in the Republic and to the activity of the enterprises that have  been converted into joint-stock companies and their relations  with the treasury. Preparation for the spring field operations  was cited as being among the priority areas of work today. The  problem of the fight against crime must not disappear from the  field of vision.    With the participation of members of the government and  deputy chairmen of city and rayon soviets of people's deputies  of the Republic, the sitting then examined the question of the  progress of realization of the basic provisions of the Law "On  Languages of the Peoples of Tatarstan" in Zelenodolsk and  Zelenodolskiy Rayon. The decree on this matter was assumed as a  basis.    The Presidium adopted the decision to continue the business  of the Supreme Soviet 19th session on 16 April and to submit for  its consideration the budget message of the president of the  Republic of Tatarstan for 1994 and also a number of other  supplementary questions.    The sitting also examined other questions of the Republic's  state life. M. Sabirov, prime minister of the Republic of  Tatarstan, his deputy F. Khamidullin, and Finance Minister D.  Nagumanov took part in the business of the Presidium and spoke.  The sitting was chaired by F. Mukhametshin.</p>

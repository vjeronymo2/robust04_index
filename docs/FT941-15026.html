			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Liberals take axe to Canadian MPs' perks Canada's newly-elected Liberal government has sent a symbolic message on the eve of its first parliamentary session by abolishing some of the lavish perks traditionally enjoyed by MPs. In line with the goals of fiscal and social reform which are expected to form the centrepiece of today's Throne Speech, the government has, among other things, chopped MPs' CDollars 400 (Pounds 203)-a-year picture-framing subsidy, imposed a charge for use of the parliamentary gym, and severely curtailed free air-travel privileges. Though minor in themselves, these cuts are a pointer to the Liberals' strategy for outflanking the two regional parties - the separatist Bloc Quebecois and the prairie-based Reform party - which dominate the opposition benches. The BQ won 54 seats, all from Quebec, in last October's general election, putting it in the incongruous position of being the official opposition. The Reform Party won 52 seats on a platform which included fiscal restraint, and a promise of greater accountability by MPs to their constituents. The Liberals have 177 seats in the new parliament. Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, has indicated that he hopes to take the wind out of the separatists' sails by emphasising economic and social issues. 'If they (the BQ) want to talk about the constitution they will have a clean and clear answer: we're here to solve the problems of unemployment and economic growth,' Mr Chretien said at the weekend. 'The debate on separation is not the reason why this Parliament will sit.' The government will present its first budget next month. Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, indicated that the tax base may be broadened to help bring down the budget deficit from an estimated CDollars 45bn this year to around CDollars 37bn in the year to March 31 1995. But he said that some of the government's most far-reaching initiatives, including an overhaul of the social-security system, will only be unveiled in the 1995 budget.</p>

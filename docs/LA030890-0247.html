			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 1994 WINTER OLYMPICS IN DOUBT  </P> <P> President Gerhard Heiberg of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said  the 1994 Winter Games may have to be dropped unless the Norwegian Parliament  makes firm decisions about investments and arenas by early April, a newspaper  reported today.  </P> <P> Lillehammer was awarded the Games by the International Olympic Committee more  than two years ago.  </P> <P> Parliament has not yet provided the financial guarantees the organizing  committee needs to start construction work and other preparations.  </P> <P> The Lillehammer Tilskuer quoted Heiberg as telling local businessmen and  investors, "By April 5 the location of arenas, the cost and investment  guidelines and the whole organization model must be decided by Parliament. If  not, or if major Olympic decisions are delayed until next fall, the entire  arrangement is at risk and we should consider dropping the Games."  </P></p>

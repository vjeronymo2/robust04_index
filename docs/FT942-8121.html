			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Inheritance goes public - Antony Thorncroft explains why tax free treasures must be accessible It was one of the easiest scams going. If you inherited a valuable antique you could avoid paying inheritance tax by putting it on the Inland Revenue's register of 'conditionally exempt' works of art. In theory there was a downside: the work must then be available for public view so that the curious could pop into your home for a look. But since virtually no one was aware of the existence of the register this was not much of an obstacle. In the average year about four people turned up at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to wade through the files in the hope of finding an object they wanted to examine. So it must have been unsettling for the owners of exempt works to be suddenly flooded with requests to view. There were about 500 enquiries seeking access to untaxed treasures in the last few months. But the calls were, in fact, from students, hired by the Inland Revenue to test the system. Stung by criticism, the Inland Revenue has been attempting to rectify what was basically a scandal in the making. It has computerised the works of art on the list, making copies available in Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast; and it has publicised its existence by giving regular up-dates on new additions. Recruiting the students was the start of regular checks. The threat is that any owner making undue difficulties about access will get a tax bill pretty sharpish. The register is, however, not without its problems. You have to to know what to look for. Requesting a list of paintings by Turner turns up nine held in private hands, but also includes works by Turner of Oxford, FC Turner and Francis Turner. Ironically it is owners rather than the public that have taken most advantage of the increased awareness of the system. The number of works of art given exemption has rocketed. In the last quarter alone a further 843 signed on, for a total of 12,340. Flicking through the register the same names, or rather the family solicitors who shield owners from possible burglars, occur again and again. There are quite a number of museums credited as contacts, too, which suggests that the works of art are already on view: anything in a museum or in a house open to the public automatically qualifies for tax exemption, and does not need to appear on the list. This ensures that great houses, like Chatsworth and Blenheim, are not devastated by death duties, while holding a tantalising question mark over the wonderful Old Masters belonging to the Duke of Sutherland on permanent loan to the National Museum of Scotland. It is probable that the rising number of works going public to avoid tax reflects the recession in the art market. Anyone inheriting a Henry Moore or a Gainsborough is best advised to wait for prices to rise before disposing of it. Whatever the reason, exemption is a tax break which needs constant examination. The Treasury certainly thinks so and is dubious of the argument that exemption bolsters the heritage and prevents national treasures being sold abroad. The parallel scheme whereby you can pay off tax by giving antiques to the nation was created in the face of Treasury opposition and has never really got off the ground. The annual allowance of Pounds 12m is rarely taken up, thanks to a lack of publicity. Making sure that owners of works of art give something back to the nation in return for their tax free inheritance is part of a new concern on the part of the Exchequer. Changes may be needed to ensure that the scheme really does benefit scholars, and the public generally, rather than just owners.</p>

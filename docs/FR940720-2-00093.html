			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The margin of safety will not be decreased as a result of these changes because they merely clarify existing TS requirements and are consistent with the UFSAR accident analysis. The addition of the footnote clarifying LPCI OPERABILITY during RHR system operation in the Shutdown Cooling mode is consistent with the requirements in the NRC Standard TS (NUREG&hyph;1433). No changes in either system design or operating strategies will be made as a result of these changes, thus no possibility exists to reduce a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cedar Rapids Public Library, 500 First Street, S.E., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jack Newman, Esquire, Kathleen H.

These revisions would support a revised design basis radiological analysis which would support an increase in secondary containment drawdown time from 6 to 60 minutes by taking credit for fission product scrubbing and retention in the suppression pool. The current design basis radiological analysis does not take credit for the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup system as permitted in NUREG&hyph;0800, Section 6.5.5, ``Pressure Suppression Pool as a Fission Product Cleanup System.'' The proposed amendment would also take credit for additional mixing of primary containment and engineered safety feature systems leakage with 50 percent of the secondary containment free air volume prior to the release of radioactivity to the environment. In the revised analysis, mixing is assumed to occur at the onset of a Design Basis Loss-of-Coolant Accident as the primary containment and the engineered safety feature systems leak into secondary containment. The current analysis takes credit for mixing within secondary containment only after achieving a ^0.25 inch water gauge (WG) pressure in secondary containment with respect to the outside surrounding atmosphere. The licensee's radiological evaluation for this accident, which reflects these proposed changes and an assumed drawdown time of 60 minutes, has determined that the radiological doses remain below 10 CFR Part 100 guidelines values and General Design Criterion 19 criteria. The revised radiological doses, as calculated by the licensee, are lower than the doses currently presented in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of the Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secondary containment and the SGTS [Standby Gas Treatment System] are not initiators or precursors to an accident. Secondary containment provides a pressure boundary, with limited inleakage, for the purpose of establishing a negative pressure to prevent a ground level unfiltered release of radioactivity. SGTS responds to accidents involving a release of radioactivity to the secondary containment by establishing and maintaining a negative pressure inside secondary containment and by providing an elevated filtered release. Therefore, changes to SECONDARY CONTAINMENT INTEGRITY surveillances cannot affect the probability of a previously evaluated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suppression pool and secondary containment are largely passive in nature, and the active components are suitably redundant. Therefore, their fission product attenuation functions can be accomplished assuming a single failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, using an assumed drawdown time of 6 minutes, the radiological doses for a DBA&hyph;LOCA [Design Bases Accident_Loss-of-Coolant Accident] are below the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 and GDC [General Design Criterion] 19 criteria. The calculated doses, considering the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup system, additional mixing within secondary containment and an assumed secondary containment drawdown time of 60 minutes, are lower than the previously calculated doses. The new doses are below 10 CFR Part 100 guideline values and GDC 19 criteria. The revised radiological analysis follows the source term assumptions of RG [Regulatory Guide] 1.3, with the exception of regulatory position C.1.f as permitted by SRP [Standard Review Plan] Section 6.5.5, and continues to provide a conservative representation of the timing and the composition of the release of radioactivity from secondary containment during a DBA&hyph;LOCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Specification SRs [Surveillance Requirements] will ensure a continued state of readiness for the SGTS, the secondary containment, the suppression pool and the suppression chamber/drywell vacuum breakers. Therefore, the assumptions used in the dose assessment will continue to bound the actual bypass of the suppression pool and the mixing in secondary containment during a DBA&hyph;LOCA. The proposed changes to the surveillances provide assurance that the performance of the SGTS and secondary containment supports the radiological analysis. Accordingly, as shown in Table 1, page 14 of 20, [of the July 1, 1994, amendment request] operation with the SGTS and the proposed change to the surveillances for secondary containment will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the surveillances ensures that the SGTS and secondary containment will be available to respond to an accident such that the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 and the limits of GDC 19 are not exceeded. The proposed change to the surveillances reflect consideration of the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup system and credit for additional mixing in secondary containment. The suppression pool will continue to perform its safety functions as a pressure suppression pool and as a source of water to support emergency core cooling system operation during a DBA&hyph;LOCA. In addition, secondary containment will continue to perform its safety function of controlling and minimizing radioactive leakage to the outside atmosphere during a DBA&hyph;LOCA. Safety related equipment will continue to be OPERABLE in the radioactive environment of secondary containment to mitigate the consequences of a DBA&hyph;LOCA. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SGTS exhausts the secondary containment atmosphere to the environment through the filtration system. To verify the SGTS has not degraded, SR 4.6.5.1.c.1 verifies that each SGTS subsystem will establish and maintain a pressure in the secondary containment that is equal to or more negative than ^0.25 inch WG within the required time limit. To verify secondary containment is intact, SR 4.6.5.1.c.2 demonstrates that one SGTS subsystem can maintain a pressure which is equal to or more negative than ^0.25 inch WG for 1 hour at a flow rate less than or equal to the maximum allowed inleakage. The 1 hour test period allows secondary containment to be in thermal equilibrium at steady state conditions. Furthermore, as an interim measure, NMPC [Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation] implemented certain compensatory measures through administrative controls to ensure that the radiological consequences of a DBA&hyph;LOCA would remain within regulatory criteria. Together, these tests and the compensatory measures assure SGTS performance and secondary containment boundary integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to these surveillances incorporate changes to the design basis, i.e., credit for fission product scrubbing and retention by the suppression pool and credit for additional mixing within secondary containment. The new inleakage is 2670 cfm which is loss [less] than one change of the secondary containment free air volume per day. The new drawdown time limit reflects consideration of the proposed change in the secondary containment inleakage limit. Due to the effects of service water temperature, inside and outside temperature, flow measurement inaccuracies and actual test pressures, meeting the current SRs does not by itself assure adequate SGTS performance. Therefore, the surveillances' results are adjusted to account for actual test conditions. Compliance with the proposed surveillances assures that the SGTS can achieve and maintain ^0.25 inch WG in less than 60 minutes following a postulated DBA&hyph;LOCA. Achieving ^0.25 inch WG within 60 minutes assures that radiological doses will remain below regulatory limits (see Table 1 [of the July 1, 1994, amendment request]). Therefore, the proposed surveillances, together with the proposed adjustments, provide adequate assurance of SGTS performance and secondary containment boundary integrity. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as determined by the analysis above, this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

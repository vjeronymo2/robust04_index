			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Down to the wire in Geneva WITH LESS than two months to go to the date almost everyone agrees must be the ultimate deadline, the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations still look like shadow-boxing. As the talks on proposals to cut tariffs and improve market access rumble on in Geneva, the heavyweight pugilists - the US in one corner, Europe in the other - hover at the edge of the ring, withholding their serious punches until just before the final bell on December 15, when President Bill Clinton's 'fast-track' negotiating mandate from Congress expires. Given the rising political heat on both sides, the risk remains that the last bout will come too late to save the round from collapse, with grave consequences not only for global free trade but also for the future of the EC and of transatlantic relations. It is hardly surprising in the circumstances that both the US and France - the Community's main recalcitrant - are expending as much time and effort in positioning themselves to blame the other for failure as they are putting into substantive negotiations. France even suggested last week that some form of interim agreement could be struck by December 15, leaving controversial issues such as agriculture to be dealt with later. This is even less likely to succeed than France's forlorn campaign to reopen the Blair House farm trade accord with the US, and is so patently absurd that it makes one wonder whether the government of Mr Edouard Balladur has a serious strategy for escaping from the hole into which it has unnecessarily dug itself over the Gatt. The whole point of the round is to achieve a balanced package of agreements; any partial deal that excluded farm trade even temporarily would have no attraction for many of the most important potential signatories. Regrettable posturing Such posturing is all the more regrettable since the differences between the US and the EC are now rather small, and the type of trade-off that will have to be made is already evident: for example, between Europe maintaining some restrictions on imported films and the US being permitted to preserve some protection for its shipping industry. What is needed is the political leadership to patch such compromises together, and the salesmanship to trumpet them as a breakthrough. Last summer, Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, set out a clear timetable for resolving the remaining differences. Unfortunately, it is already showing signs of slippage. By last Friday, for example, bilateral negotiations on tariff levels for manufactured goods were supposed to have been completed. Yet the US, Japan, Canada and the EC are still haggling over the fine print of a tariff deal they supposedly struck in Tokyo last July, and while the EC has promised to table a more generous tariff offer today, there still seems some way to go before that will be acceptable to the US or other trading partners. Force the pace On financial services, the deadline for agreement is the end of this month, but there too success is far from assured, with east Asian countries continuing to resist US pressure to open their markets. Formal negotiations on market access in agriculture - a separate issue from those covered by Blair House and a potential key to overcoming French recalcitrance - have yet to begin. All this matters deeply. It is essential for a successful conclusion to the Round that rapid progress be achieved on these issues, both for its own sake and to force the pace on farm trade. Only when the US, EC and other parties have reached sufficient agreement in a sufficient range of other areas will they be in a position to grapple plausibly with this problem. At that point, Mr Balladur will need a ladder to climb down, and it will be for his European partners to provide it - by warning France of the consequences for the Community and in particular for Franco-German relations if he fails to sign, and probably by furnishing further assistance for French farmers from the EC budget. Faced with such sticks and carrots, it is hard to believe that France would fail to grasp the wider benefits of a Uruguay Round accord. It is in all the parties' interests to ensure that this moment of truth is not much longer delayed.</p>

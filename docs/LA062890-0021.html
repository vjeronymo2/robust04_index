			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP IRAN TURN BACK TOWARD THE WORLD  </P> <P> While Iran digs itself out of the rubble of the Persian Gulf War, it has been  hit again. The fury of Mother Nature has caused even more devastation than that  wrought by bombs and rockets. In terms of destruction and loss of life, Iran's  earthquake also surpasses the similar tragedy that befell Armenia three years  ago.  </P> <P> Despite Iran's political isolation, the international community has responded  to its plea for aid. Yet the response so far is far short of the enormous needs  of the nearly 2 million people left homeless. Indeed, it has fallen far short  of aid given to Armenia in the same amount of time. This may be explained by  politics: Iran's continued role as pariah state.  </P> <P> That very fact offers an opportunity, however. Iran's current plight and the  outside world's response could become a political turning point in Iran's  domestic politics and relations with the outside world, especially the West and  the Arab states of the region. Aiding Iran now also would be a wise business  move, building goodwill, for Western firms.  </P> <P> Iran's moderates, including President Hashemi Rafsanjani, have taken a serious  political gamble by asking for and accepting all aid. Indeed, the argument that  they have made for the past two years -- that Iran cannot rebuild itself  without outside help -- has been vehemently rejected by the radicals. The  moderates' efforts have also been hampered by the West's cool response, which  is based on the proposition that all outstanding political problems with Iran  must first be resolved. This attitude actually weakens the very forces in  Iranian politics that are necessary for resolving these problems.  </P> <P> For the West to respond inadequately to Iranian needs at this critical juncture  would have even worse consequences for the balance of political power in Iran.  The radicals, who fear that this disaster may provide an excuse for Iran to  open up to the outside world, have already been vociferously attacking the idea  of Western aid in hopes of discouraging it. If the West plays into their hands,  it will convince most Iranians that an effort to open up Iranian society to  outside influences and an accommodating attitude will bring few benefits. The  upshot would be to make them even more withdrawn, xenophobic and radical.  </P> <P> This is a crucial moment for the West to show that it does not bear ill will  toward Iran. Such a positive attitude and generous response to Iran's tragedy  could pay significant political and economic dividends. It would go a long way  toward blunting Iranian memories of Western help to Iraq. It would also prove  that there are benefits to be gained for Iran from good relations with the  West. This opportunity to close the book on the past should not be missed.  </P></p>

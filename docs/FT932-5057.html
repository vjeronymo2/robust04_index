			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Plan ahead for holiday cash - Bethan Hutton suggests some ways to make the traveller's life more tolerable TRAVELLERS' tales of nights under the stars and eating for a pittance from authentic street stalls may make wonderfully escapist reading, but most people's idea of a holiday involves comfortable accommodation, good restaurants and, perhaps, a spot of shopping. If you are unlucky, though, you could return to tell picturesque tales of living on a shoestring. Cash can be stolen, credit cards rejected, and travellers' cheques take time to replace if they go missing. The combination of cash, plastic and cheques you choose depends on your destination. If you are going somewhere for the first time, ask your travel agent what is likely to be acceptable - you could be surprised. Sterling travellers' cheques can be cashed in some of the most exotic locations, but only with extreme difficulty in the US. Travellers' cheques in dollars are the easiest to change internationally. Most people find it useful to buy at least some of the local currency in advance for airport and other on-the-spot expenses. Check, though, on currency restrictions: some countries do not allow their money out of the country, or only in very small amounts. Some currency suppliers charge a flat rate commission and others a percentage, usually with a specified minimum (see table). But good deals available widely include American Express offices for any single currency; National Westminster for more than Pounds 175 worth of two or more currencies; and Midland for less than Pounds 175 worth of two or more currencies. The replacement service for lost or stolen travellers' cheques makes them about the safest holiday money option, but keep a separate note of the numbers of those that remain unspent. Remember, too, that such cheques can be expensive to buy (shop around first) and cash abroad. They can also incur a charge when you return those you have not used. If you are not careful, you could end up paying commission three times over. You can buy cheques in at least 14 different currencies in the UK. If the one you want is not available, ask which other is likely to be easiest to change. When getting cheques, ask if the seller will buy back unused ones free of charge. Thomas Cook, American Express and most banks buy back their own without commission, but some banks charge for non-sterling cheques and building societies may not buy them back at all. American Express, the inventor of travellers' cheques, still offers one of the better deals in the UK with a 1 per cent commission charge (and no minimum) on cheques in sterling and seven other currencies. They can be cashed commission-free at Amex offices abroad. Anyone planning to take advantage of last-minute holiday bargains should check how far in advance currency and cheques need to be ordered. The main clearing banks recommend allowing at least three to five working days for currency or non-sterling cheques. Some branches keep stocks of the currencies requested most often. But Amex and Thomas Cook stock cash in several dozen currencies, and cheques in eight or 12 respectively. Other currencies normally can be obtained within 24 hours. Plastic has obvious attractions for holiday spending but it does have drawbacks. Visa and MasterCard are accepted in around 10m outlets worldwide and American Express in around 3.5m. In many parts of the world, though, cash is still the norm and you might find paying by card limits where you can eat and shop. At the other extreme, there are countries like France where electronic payments are standard and British travellers could be caught out by advanced technology. In the UK, most retailers can process a transaction by hand if a card's magnetic strip is faulty, but this alternative might not be available over the Channel. Check your card for wear before you go and get a replacement if necessary. Because many British credit card-holders never use them to withdraw cash, they never bother to find out their pin numbers. If you are holidaying in Europe, however, a pin number could be crucial - they can be required at such places as fully-automated petrol stations. You might even need a pin number when using a card across the counter in banks and shops. Fraud is also a serious problem, particularly in the Far East where counterfeiters use details from credit card slips or carbons to make new cards. Elizabeth Phillips, of Credit Card Research, suggests: 'Rather than giving the card to the waiter at the table, you should go with him and stay with it.' Insist on credit card carbons being torn up in front of you. Using a credit card to withdraw cash can be a useful fallback option, but beware of hidden costs. As well as the commission charge - commonly 1.5 per cent with a minimum of Pounds 1.50 - remember that interest will be charged from the date of the transaction rather than that of the statement. Most credit card-issuers also add 1-3 per cent to standard exchange rates when converting foreign transactions to sterling. Frequent travellers to Europe may find a Eurocheque book and card worthwhile. These allow you to write cheques in the local currencies of 40 European countries, and use a network of 50,000 cash machines. But, for once-a-year tourists, the annual fee of around Pounds 8 charged by most banks, plus minimum fees of Pounds 1.10-Pounds 2 for each one, may make Eurocheques unattractive compared with traditional travellers' cheques.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         TRAVELLERS CHEQUES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Commission  Minimum     Other fees     Wait   Buy Back  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National       1.5%                 pounds2     24 hours    No                                           handling  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Amex pounds/other      1%     none                      none     free  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays pounds      1.5%    pounds3                   3 days    free other                1.5%    pounds3      pounds2.50             free                                           handling  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First Direct pounds    1%    pounds9                   4 days    free other                  2%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyds pounds          1%    pounds3                      -      free other                  1%    pounds3                  4-5 days  1% min                                                                 pounds3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Midland pounds         1%    pounds3                             free other                  2%    pounds3                  3-5 days   free  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Natwest pounds         1%    pounds4.50                          free other                  2%    pounds4                  2-4 days   free  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal B. of Scotland pounds                 1%    pounds3                      -      free* other                  1%    pounds3                  2-3 days  0.5%???  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Thomas Cook pounds     1%    pounds3                    none     free other                  2%    pounds3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * non-customers, 1%, min pounds3 ???

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Credit demand growth below expectations WEAK DEMAND for credit across the personal and corporate sectors was reflected in Bank of England figures yesterday. Lending to the private sector by banks and building societies was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.8bn last month, slightly below economists' expectations. The year-on-year growth rate dropped to 3 per cent from 3.3 per cent in September. It stood only marginally higher than the 30-year low of 2.9 per cent reached in July. Although bank and building society lending - M4 lending - is expanding, the growth rate has slowed considerably since the beginning of the year when it was about 4 per cent. 'In the medium term these figures are encouraging because they do show credit demand expanding,' said Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities. 'But they are starting from a very weak base, a clear sign of the fragility of the recovery.' In the three months to October, M4 lending grew a seasonally adjusted 3.9 per cent while in the latest six months it was 3.5 per cent higher. M4 itself - the broad measure of money supply - also rose in October. It was up 1 per cent on the month, the largest monthly rise since November 1990. The year-on-year rate picked up from 3.9 per cent in September to 4.3 per cent, to remain close to the floor of the government's monitoring range of 3 per cent to 9 per cent. The Bank said the rise in M4 appeared to reflect a big inflow of overseas capital into the UK. Other figures yesterday - from the British Bankers' Association - showed that total sterling lending to the private sector by the main banking groups rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.949bn in October following September's fall of Pounds 183m. The bulk of the lending was to the financial sector. Borrowing by the rest of the company sector fell, even though October was a corporation tax-paying month. Mortgage lending continued to grow steadily but demand for consumer credit was weak, the association said. The figures suggested that lending to securities dealers continues to inflate credit growth. Last month loans to securities dealers and money brokers by the major banking groups jumped by Pounds 1.3bn, the biggest rise since figures began in 1986.</p>

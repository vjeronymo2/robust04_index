			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Warning for London banking COMPETITION to London's investment banking industry is coming increasingly from continental Europe rather than from North America and Japan, and London's role as an international banking centre may be challenged, according to a study from Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. 'Since 1988 there has been a major shift away from fear of the North American and Japanese banks to viewing the continental European banks as a major threat. 'Undoubtedly these banks have improved their understanding of and expertise in the investment banking markets, and in particular those with a large capital base are well-placed to increase their market share in all markets,' the study concluded. London's prestige as an international centre has been undermined by recent self-regulation problems, most notably the difficulties at the Lloyd's insurance market. Meanwhile, the study found there has been almost no progress in product innovation in the past three years. 'Following a period of rapid innovation during the 1980s, the industry appears to have lost the will, the ability or the opportunity to innovate,' the study said. Since 1988, only three significant products have emerged in Europe; asset-backed securities, commodity derivatives and over-the-counter equity options. 'Even these are not expected to show improved profitability over the next two to three years,' the study said. Aside from these products, investment banking products are largely mature and profitability is unlikely to improve from them. Against this background, service quality rather than product innovation will be the main avenue through which competitors seek to differentiate themselves.

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> CITY WON'T OPPOSE MERGER OF 2 UTILITIES  </P> <P> The Fillmore City Council will not join four other Ventura County cities that  oppose a proposed merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas  &amp; Electric.  </P> <P> The council decided Tuesday that the issues were best handled by officials at  the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District board.  </P> <P> Under an agreement with the board, Edison has until 1996 to reduce pollution  caused by the proposed merger. Consolidation of the two utilities would shift  the load of electrical generation from San Diego plants to facilities in  Ventura County, which burn less fuel to produce electricity.  </P> <P> While fostering efficiency, the move would also increase pollution in Ventura  County as local plants expand production.  </P> <P> Edison has promised to comply with pollution reduction measures outlined by the  control board. Edison representatives said at Tuesday's meeting that Ventura  County will eventually enjoy improved air quality as a result of the merger.  </P> <P> New pollution controls will be applied to generating facilities at Mandalay and  Ormond beaches. Edison has also agreed to reduce emissions from other  industries to offset increased pollution produced by the electrical plants.  </P> <P> The cities of Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ojai and Ventura have opposed even a  temporary increase in pollution and labeled the agreement premature.  </P> <P> Fillmore residents and environmental groups urged the council to oppose the  merger. Ventura County ranks sixth in the nation for air pollution.  </P> <P> Fillmore's council turned down a staff recommendation to demand that pollution  control measures be in place before the merger. However, the city will  officially protest the failure of the pollution control board to consult cities  before making the agreement. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

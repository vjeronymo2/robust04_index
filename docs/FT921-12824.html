			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Brokers prescribe pharmaceuticals for Scandinavia's malaise CONFLICTING priorities between US and German monetary policy makers, and downward revisions of economic and earnings-growth forecasts for 1992, took their toll on European stock markets in the final quarter of 1991. According to the FT-A World indices, Europe, excluding the UK, fell 4 per cent in local currency terms in the quarter, limiting its rise for the year to 10.6 per cent. Scandinavia was especially weak, as a result of the banking crisis in Norway and disappointing third-quarter results in Sweden, in particular Ericsson's swing into a loss. The FT-A Nordic index dropped 9.6 per cent Norway was the poorest performer in Europe in the October-December period, falling 18.6 per cent, for a drop of 11.2 per cent for the whole year. The liquidity shortage, as a result of the problems in the financial sector, left the market with little support, and share prices continued to adjust to weak economic signals from abroad. Low prices for Norwegian export metals weighed heavily on Elkem and Norsk Hydro, the latter accounting for around 18 per cent of the index. Brokers are taking a selective approach to Norway, since the overall outlook is still uncertain. Several brokers are recommending the purchase of the pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed, whose third-quarter results exceeded market expectations. Sweden continued to eat into its rise of around 40 per cent clocked up in the first seven months of the year. In the final quarter it fell 12.9 per cent, for a rise of just 11.9 per cent for the whole year. The large number of profit downgrades and a six-point rise in the central bank's lending rate to 17.5 per cent to stem capital outflows were to blame. Most brokers have an underweight position in the Swedish market, because they say it is still expensive despite its fall since the early autumn. 'In our view the biggest drawback to the Swedish market is the valuations,' says Merrill Lynch, in its European equity strategy report for 1992. The broker adds that it would require a 29 per cent fall in the equity index in 1992 to return the price/earnings ratio to its historic average of 12.1. However, the lifting of restrictions on foreigners owning shares could provide some support to the market, once the distinction between free and restricted shares becomes redundant. Some demand for Swedish equities is expected from indexed funds, because internationally available shares will rise from 2 per cent to 6 per cent of European market capitalisation. As in Norway, brokers are keen on the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra, and also Procordia, increasingly viewed as a healthcare products company. Europe's other serious casualty was Austria, which fell 17.1 per cent in local currency terms in the final quarter, because of the civil unrest in neighbouring Yugoslavia. A steady stream of rights issues and a slowing economy are likely to limit a Viennese recovery in the near term. The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates dashed brokers' hopes of a fourth-quarter rally in France. In the event, France fell by 4.8 per cent in local currency terms. The French central bank did not impress investors with a quarter-point cut in interest rates in mid-October. They were even less impressed when the constraints of the ERM forced the central bank to put rates back up a month later. But they were resigned to the next rate rise, just before Christmas. The effect of high real interest rates and vulnerable economic growth forecasts on European bourses in 1992 has divided strategists. SG Warburg believes it is still too early to overweight continental Europe, because earnings downgrades have not been fully discounted. However, Hoare Govett and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew recommend an overweight position in Germany.</p>

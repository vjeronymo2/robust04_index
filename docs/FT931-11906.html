			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: France shrugs off threat FRENCH government officials yesterday said they did not expect the devaluation of the Irish punt to have a knock-on effect on the franc. 'This is a purely Irish move, linked to the close connections between the Irish and the UK economies. It does not suggest that speculative attacks will recommence on other European currencies,' a Finance Ministry official said. 'The markets can be irrational, but this is not a decision which concerns the franc.' Some economic analysts suggested over the weekend that the punt's devaluation now left the franc alone in the front-line against speculators. The French currency came under attack last week, but ended well above its ERM floor on Friday evening. France's internal debate on monetary policy was given a fresh twist over the weekend when Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, was reported in the French press as telling the world economic forum in Davos that the franc could appreciate against the D-Mark if it was allowed to float, as the French economy was stronger than the German one. The French government opposed floating the franc for political, not economic, reasons, he said. A break in the link between the franc and D-Mark would be the end of the EMS, he added. Mr Pohl's remarks are likely both to cheer and worry the French government. While a compliment to France's economic performance, it also offers ammunition to critics of the government's monetary policy, such as Mr Alain Madelin, the conservative former industry minister. He has suggested that the franc should be allowed to float upwards against the D-Mark, to pave the way for a fall in interest rates to stimulate the sluggish economy.</p>

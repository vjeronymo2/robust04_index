			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter (1): Retail standards: while cheerful experts exist, others are missing a competitive trick Sir, Not for the first time Samuel Brittan's lack of contact with the real economy has led him to miss something ('Nightmare on Oxford Street', December 30). London's Tottenham Court Road is quite different from Oxford Street, although superficially similar. In all the shops (particularly the scruffy ones) in the former he will find product expertise and an anxiety to do business of a kind which is really quite remarkable, served up by people of a cheerful ethnic mix who would not recognise supply side economics if they tripped over it.

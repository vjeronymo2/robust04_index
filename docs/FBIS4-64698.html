			<p>BFN     [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  declared that the German Bundestag decision to find a political  solution for the terrorism in southeast Anatolia is unbecoming  of the good relations between the two countries.    Yilmaz received Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag  Foreign Affairs Committee, at parliament today. In a statement  during the meeting, Yilmaz said that this decision by the German  parliament offends Turkey. It is regrettable that Turkey's  friends in the Bundestag did not exert efforts to block this  decision, Yilmaz remarked. He added: Such a decision does not  conform with the friendly relations between the two countries.  The fact that this decision will not result in any action does  not erase its poisoning effect on bilateral relations.    The ANAP leader said that he expects Turkey's friends in the  German parliament to undertake initiatives to rectify this wrong  decision. He also expressed the hope that Turkish-German  relations will be raised to their previous level and be purged  of such errors in the coming period.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dominion Textile sees solid rise Dominion Textile, the Canadian-based international integrated textile group, saw fourth-quarter net profit rise sharply, boosted by strong demand for denim and yarn from apparel makers. Domtex, one of the world's biggest denim cloth producers, said fiscal 1995 had begun with a strong order book, and demand for commodity yarns was good. Net profit for the three months ended June 30 was CDollars 22.4m (USDollars 16.4m), or 52 cents a share, up from CDollars 11.3m, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 394m, up 9 per cent. For the full year, net profit was CDollars 33.5m, or 70 cents a share, up 11 per cent, on sales which were little changed at CDollars 1.3bn. Mr John Boland, head of the US subsidiary Swift Textiles, has been appointed president of Domtex. He succeeds Mr Charles Hantho, who remains chairman and chief executive.</p>

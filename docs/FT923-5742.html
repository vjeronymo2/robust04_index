			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Arts: Iolanta - Edinburgh International Festival AT Christmas 1892, Tchaikovsky's present to the world was a unique double-bill: one half opera, the other half ballet. The idea met with public success at the time, but since then the two parts have followed separate and very different paths: The Nutcracker has risen to become one of the favourite ballets of the world, while the opera Iolanta (or Yolande) has sunk into obscurity, at least outside Russia. What better idea than to re-unite these long-lost siblings? The Edinburgh festival has taken Tchaikovsky as its central theme this year and the programming of both opera and ballet on the same evening promised certainly novelty, probably education, and hopefully enjoyment. Opera North, with its fine track-record of reviving neglected operas, was entrusted with Iolanta. That started the evening, as Tchaikovsky intended. The story was one with which the composer had long been enchanted. In Iolanta, the blind princess kept from the truth about her lack of sight, he had found an ideal person on whom to lavish his artistic affection. Like Tatyana in Eugene Onegin, his most vital operatic creation, she is again a blameless young woman, who has yet to discover the realities of the adult world. Whenever Iolanta is on stage, the music pulses with inspiration, welling up to those insistently-repetitive Tchaikovsky climaxes that set the heart racing. Though not in her best voice right through the evening, Joan Rodgers easily made her portrayal the shining virtue of the performance. Clad in virginal white, she played Iolanta not as a fey creature of myth, but as a human being in embryo, facing the beginnings of real emotion. Unfortunately, her appearances are interspersed with substantial sections in which the pace falters. Each of the subsidiary characters is allowed his or her aria. The opera moves disjointedly from one to the next and, despite the advocacy of David Lloyd-Jones in the pit, there was no disguising Tchaikovsky's inability to breathe life into the other shadowy fairy-tale figures. The most strongly-felt is the king and father, played by Norman Bailey, whose voice no longer takes kindly to the stretching, angst-ridden vocal lines that the role is allotted. The hero Vaudemont was fearlessly sung by Kim Begley, but he was so stiff physically that he greeted ecstasy and tragedy alike with the same lack of interest. Robert Hayward turned his travelling companion into the archetypal Victorian cad, full of his own bravado singing. The smaller roles were not generally well taken. The production by Martin Duncan dipped its toe into stylisation, but wisely withdrew it to present the main characters with a semblance of realism. The visual setting, comprising an all-white tree dropping multi-coloured leaves over the stage, courtesy of the designer Anthony Ward, was already self-consciously arty enough. Altogether, a lesser achievement on the part of all concerned than one might have hoped. It was after the interval that the eyes really were to be opened.</p>

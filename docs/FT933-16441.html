			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: RTZ offshoot acquires Alpine Double Glazing from the receivers A SUBSIDIARY of RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, has bought Alpine Double Glazing, the UK windows company which went into receivership last month. Duraflex, part of RTZ's Pillar division and one of Alpine's main creditors with unpaid debts of Pounds 235,000, is believed to have agreed to a cash payment of at least Pounds 500,000, plus a deferred element, for Alpine's brand name and certain plant and machinery. The sale of the name and assets means that none of the 200 jobs which were lost when Alpine went under will be saved. Duraflex refused to confirm the purchase yesterday. However, it is believed that the company beat Alpine's main rival, Everest, as well as a second private buyer, in a close race late on Thursday night. Duraflex was a main supplier to Alpine, manufacturing PVC, which forms part of the frame for double glazing windows. The company already has a small windows manufacturing facility which sells to the double glazing trade. Duraflex is expected to license the Alpine name to larger manufacturers and double glazing retailers. The deal appears to have put paid to questions over the ownership of Alpine's assets, which were transferred to a newly formed company called Neonbeam just days before Alpine ceased trading. Finchfleet, a Guernsey-based but Bahamas-registered company part-owned by family interests of Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith, is the parent of Alpine and is believed to have agreed to the sale.</p>

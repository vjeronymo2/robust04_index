			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED TRUCK DRIVER FOR COCAINE RING GETS A LOW-PROFILE HEARING  </P> <P> A man who allegedly drove a semi-trailer truck delivering cocaine to the Sylmar  warehouse that was the scene of the world's biggest narcotics seizure was  arraigned in low-profile proceedings Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Gilberto Mendoza, 28, of New Mexico pleaded not guilty to charges of  transportation of cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale. He was then taken  to an undisclosed location, where he is being held on $9-million bail.  </P> <P> At the same time, three other defendants in the case were ordered held without  bail in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. A fourth has a bail hearing  scheduled for today.  </P> <P> Authorities revealed that Mendoza was arrested Oct. 3 in an undisclosed area of  Van Nuys after he left a residence under surveillance by members of the  multi-agency task force that made the Sept. 28 seizure of more than 21 tons of  cocaine.  </P> <P> "He is believed to have been a courier, a truck driver, for this organization,"  Huntington Park Police Detective William Huffman said. "The trailer that was at  the warehouse was his."  </P> <P> Mendoza's arrest -- the seventh in the high-profile case -- was kept secret by  authorities for eight days. Both Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt  Hazell and Mendoza's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Rita Smith, declined to  explain why the arrest was not announced as the other arrests were. The  attorneys would not say whether Mendoza has cooperated with officials, as some  other defendants in the case reportedly have done.  </P> <P> "That's privileged information," Smith said.  </P> <P> In federal court, Magistrate Volney V. Brown Jr. declared three other suspects  in the case a flight risk and a danger to the community. Brown ordered the men  held without bail pending their trial on a charge of conspiracy to distribute  cocaine.  </P> <P> Brown's ruling came after defense attorneys for the three men said their  clients had strong family ties and no record of previous arrests. The three  suspects are Hugo Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks; Mauricio Monroy, 36,  of Mexico City, and James Romero McTague, 41, of El Paso.  </P> <P> In addition, McTague's attorney, Michael Pancer, said his client was being  unfairly detained in a "lock-down" facility at Metropolitan Detention Center  because of statements he made to narcotics investigators under "threats and  coercion."  </P> <P> In fact, both McTague and Monroy have been separated from the general prison  population at the Metropolitan Detention Center because of statements they made  to investigators concerning the case, Pancer said.  </P> <P> However, in an interview outside the courtroom, Pancer vehemently denied that  McTague was "a snitch."  </P> <P> Brown denied bail after Assistant U.S. Attorneys Susan Bryant-Deason and James  Walsh argued that the potential risk of flight among the three federal  defendants was heightened by the fact that each has been charged with  conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life  in prison without parole.  </P> <P> Brown also denied a defense attorney's motion to dismiss the complaint against  the defendants on grounds that prosecutors waited too long before arraigning  them in federal court.  </P></p>

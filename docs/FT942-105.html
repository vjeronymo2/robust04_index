			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Northern Electric rises 16% and promises cut in price Northern Electric, which supplies electricity to the north-east of England, promised its customers a price reduction later this year after announcing a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. The exact size of the cut would depend on the outcome of the regulatory price review, Mr David Morris, chairman, said yesterday. But part of the money will be due to customers anyway because the official price formula overestimated the rate of inflation last year. For the year to March 31 profits rose from Pounds 111.4m to Pounds 128.7m. The after-tax result was Pounds 98.3m (Pounds 85.3m), equivalent to earnings per share of 79.8p (69.3p). A recommended final dividend of 17.45p brings the total for the year to 24.85p (21.45p), a rise of 16 per cent, with earnings cover unchanged at 3.2. Turnover rose from Pounds 882.7m to Pounds 1.03bn, with most of the increase coming from Northern's aggressive move into supplying large customers outside its area. It now has 9 per cent of this market, including large contracts with Marks and Spencer, C&amp;A and British Rail. Supply profit was Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.7m) and the company sees this rising to Pounds 11m next year because of the effects of the price review and further market gains. The improved profits were helped by cost-cutting. Staff numbers were down by 200 over the year, and reductions of that order are foreseen in the years ahead. Profits from non-regulated businesses also improved, including retailing and North Sea gas which Northern recently entered in partnership with Neste, the Finnish oil company. Mr Morris described diversification ventures as 'important pegs in the ground to secure future growth'. COMMENT Northern has never been a City darling, and this was, by its own admission, an average result. But it bears closer scrutiny. The company has made the strongest pitch among the recs for the supply market, and is viewed by its competitors as a ferocious price cutter. So the fact that it is forecasting a near doubling of supply profits this year suggests that market share is not being bought at the expense of earnings. It has also gone furthest into gas exploration and production, and is building an integrated gas supply business which will be worth watching. However, the recent strength of the share price owes as much to speculation about a Scots bid as it does to profit expectations. The prospective yield on a 28p dividend after yesterday's 23p gain in the share price to 670p is 4.2 per cent, which is about the average for the sector.</p>

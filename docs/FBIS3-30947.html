According to Mr. Traian Chebeleu, the statement by President  Mircea Snegur shows in fact how strong is the pressure put on  the Republic of Moldova by the nostalgic-imperial forces;  another important factor is the electoral campaign, which is  marked by the offensive of the pro-Russian forces that wish to  achieve the closest possible bondage of the Republic of Moldova  with the CIS, also through treaties.    In his interview, Mr. Chebeleu also mentioned that the  actions in our county that call on Romania to take firm steps to  recuperate those territories that were severed in June 1940 and  the unrealistic slogans regarding the unification of the  Romanian territories have, in fact, assisted the forces that are  seeking to pull the Republic of Moldova away from Romania.    Thus, I believe that one should not dramatize the emphasis  placed on the idea of the Moldovan nation or on non-unification  with Romania, obviously due to the circumstance of the electoral  campaign, because these are theories that remind us of  well-known Bolshevik concepts, said Mr. Traian Chebeleu.    He also mentioned that Romania is the strongest supporter of  the Republic of Moldova in the international community and that  the policy that our country has promoted and continues to  promote is to consolidate the independence of the Republic of  Moldova and to constantly take concrete actions to gradually  bring the two states closer to each other.    Asked whether the future opinion poll that will take place  in  the Republic of Moldova on the issue of its independence will  not sanction the concept of complete separation from Romania,  Mr. Traian Chebeleu said that this might also play a positive  role if the independence of the Republic of Moldova is more and  more frequently questioned by political forces in the Russian  Federation, whose representative is the nationalist extremist  Zhirinovskiy. One can also expect that the poll will confirm  people's option to consolidate their independence in a way  similar to that practiced in the Baltic republics.</p>

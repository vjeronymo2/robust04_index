			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies It will take the currency markets a little while to absorb the US election result. In the run-up to yesterday's poll there were conflicting opinions about the likely course of the dollar. One school argued that a Clinton victory would produce a combination of tighter money and looser fiscal policy similar to that which pushed the dollar sharply higher in the early Reagan years. The dollar would still rise, though less spectacularly, with a Bush victory, because election uncertainty would be out of the way in the US, while the German economy looks weaker by the day. The other school is less certain. It argues that the US recovery remains elusive, while the Bundesbank may be tantalisingly slow in cutting official rates. Indeed, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, implied as much in Leipzig yesterday by reiterating concern about wage increases and the budget deficit. Whichever version is correct, at some stage the market focus will shift away from interest differentials to relative growth prospects. The D-Mark would suffer all the more in that process if, by then, the Bundesbank had compounded Germany's downturn by excess of monetary zeal. How much more of that the market is now prepared to discount is another matter. The election will hardly produce much short-run change in the US fundamentals. But by last night's European close the dollar had already risen 13 per cent from its low against the D-Mark on September 2.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Tory MPs attack ministers over bill The government yesterday came under fire from its own backbenchers for using delaying tactics in the Commons to kill a private member's bill that would end discrimination against disabled people in the workplace. Tory and Labour MPs accused ministers of orchestrating a series of amendments which ensured that legislation proposed by Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood, was abandoned before concluding its report stage. Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, assured MPs that the government would launch a consultation process which would seek to combat discrimination against disabled people at work. But his announcement failed to appease Tory backbenchers such as Mr Alan Howarth, a former Conservative education minister. 'There are 6m disabled people in this country and they and their families will deeply resent attempts to scupper this bill,' he said. Mr Scott told MPs that the government's principal concern was that the legislation would impose significant costs on businesses, forcing them to provide goods, services and access to public places. He claimed that the measures would cost industry up to Pounds 17bn, with annual running costs of about Pounds 1bn a year.</p>

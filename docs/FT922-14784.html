			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Heron International The good news is confirmation that Heron International's problems stem mostly from the foolhardy adventures of its Pima Savings subsidiary in the US rather than anything in the UK. The bad news is that Heron and its bankers must be taking a gloomy view of Pima's real estate investments. No one would want to reschedule Swiss Franc bonds without good reason, least of all if there is still enough cash in the kitty to last the next 18 months. It is taking virtue rather far to attempt it just because asset write-downs have put the company in technical breach of its banking covenants.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Property: Strategy for success - The property market can play a part in reviving UK plc After a UK Budget which has largely pleased the City and industry, the R-word is now for 'recovery' rather than recession. Yet in spite of chancellor Kenneth Clarke's cautiously optimistic prognosis for an improving British economy over the long-term, some commentators continue to focus on short-term indicators and appear incapable of looking beyond the next few months. So keen is the search for economic confidence boosters after the deepest recession in 60 years, that policymakers are overlooking the need to build on the Budget with a strategy for increasing the UK's earning capacity abroad. To create long-term confidence in the economy, we need to create a clearer vision of Britain's potential role in world markets. In short to identify the UK's competitive advantages and then to plug them hard. Leading property companies need to be clear too on the role which the sector can and should play in this strategy. Much of the UK's industrial structure is still based around the country's strengths built up at the time of the industrial revolution more than a century ago. The emergence in the past decade of competitors in the previously undeveloped south-east Asia region is now threatening both UK and other developed economies. Yet the UK appears content to carry on undeterred. The business community expects and requires much more than this. It is time for a fundamental analysis of the UK's economic future. Over the next generation the pattern of world trade will change with the emergence of trading blocs in Europe, the Americas and south-east Asia. Yet there seems to be no sign that UK plc is approaching this challenge in a systematic way. As Britain's industrial infrastructure ages, the case for a revamped industrial strategy is fast becoming overwhelming. For instance, in terms of infrastructure, few people today express any pride in the UK's record on transport planning or land use. Billions of pounds have been spent on regenerating cities, but always in a fragmented way. Success in attracting funds for urban renewal is as much a function of the negotiating muscle of one urban development corporation versus another, rather than the result of a coherent market-related strategy. The UK lacks an overall plan for the efficient use of its infrastructure. Compared with France, it has been made to look second-rate in the way it has approached the Channel tunnel rail link. Who could have even countenanced encouraging by way of tax relief the development of London Docklands without first ensuring that public transport would be installed to serve the area? Why does there seem to be a resistance to our integrating land use and transport planning at the highest level? Britain is now spending Pounds 50bn more than it earns each year. In the circumstances, it needs a clearer set of priorities for public expenditure. The only way to achieve this is to formulate a firm set of economic and social objectives, which must encompass the efficient use of the country's vast real estate assets. Is it not time, for instance, to challenge the policy of always trying to rejuvenate old city centres, when the economic demand for the land and local labour has moved on? When Britain led the industrial revolution, new industries were sited close to factors of production. To take an extreme example, the country did not require the new industries of, say, Tyneside in north-east England to relocate to the Lincolnshire fens just because of falling demand for the agricultural skills of the people in the fens. Today, industry must be allowed to locate where it can prosper. Otherwise the UK will lose industry to European countries which better understand its needs. Much of the UK's present policy on urban regeneration is not about regeneration at all. It is more about redevelopment. This policy is based on the presumption that if you build on derelict land, you will attract tenants, create employment and regenerate an urban area. But this approach is flawed. The demand for land over time is dictated by the willingness of people to work or to live on it. Britain's most magnificent cities prospered because they were able to attract companies on the basis of a compelling economic argument. The buildings constructed during the industrial revolution which conservationists are today trying to preserve, were built only because they were judged to be an asset in contributing to the local economy. Today, the government's grants regime can certainly help persuade companies to relocate to particular cities. But if there is no long-term, unsubsidised demand the initial and subsequent grants will amount to throwing public money down the drain. The distribution of population and buildings in Britain reflects the pattern of industrial development of the 19th century. It was a time when labour was cheap and Britain's empire gave it access to plentiful and cheap raw materials. Today, competition in world markets is different. The UK's imperial heritage does not earn it kudos in the eyes of its competitors other than when they visit the country as tourists. The UK cannot expect industry to expand in the absence of the right infrastructure. Failure to provide this would force industry to flee abroad. It is not surprising, given the UK's head start in the industrial age, that it has allowed itself to drift. Britain has been enjoying the fruits of past investments, without ploughing more back to provide for future generations. And while the country has slumbered in its complacency, much more aggressive competitors have emerged to pinch its traditional markets. No business would survive its shareholders' wrath if it failed in its duty to compete effectively. Similarly, no management would be allowed to muddle along in world markets without a clear strategy on how best to capitalise on its competitive advantages. We must devise a forum and a format in which those interested can create just such a plan for UK plc. Those of us in the property market must be at the first meeting and play our full part in its future.

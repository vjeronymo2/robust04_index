			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORN REIGNS AS KING OF MIDWEST;  </P> <P> FESTIVALS: EVERY YEAR, THOUSANDS FLOCK TO THE NATIONAL SWEET CORN FESTIVAL IN  HOOPESTON, ILLINOIS.  </P> <P> Along with baseball games and swimming holes, sweet corn is synonymous with  summer in the Midwest. As tasseling stalks stretch straight and tall, we  anxiously check for drying silks. Then, with mouthwatering smiles, we greet  golden platters of corn-on-the-cob.  </P> <P> Hands down, the Heartland grows more sweet corn than any other region.  Wisconsin and Minnesota lead the way in production (more than 1.1 million tons  annually combined). But Illinois ranks No. 1 in corn festivals. Every year,  thousands flock to the town of Hoopeston, 100 miles south of Chicago, to feast  on buttery ears.  </P> <P> "Hot corn! Hot corn!" echoes the cry as crowds push toward mounds of  sunshine-colored ears slathered in butter. Ready with every kind of container  -- from cardboard boxes and backpacks to oven roasters and picnic coolers --  thousands of munchers gather for the National Sweet Corn Festival in this  farming and canning community.  </P> <P> During last year's celebration, corn-crazy throngs devoured or carried home 42  1/2 tons of lip-smacking ears, cooked to perfection with the help of an  old-fashioned steam engine. As one butter-drenched bystander punned, "It's  complete cornage."  </P> <P> Twelve thousand acres of sweet corn surround Hoopeston (population 6,400).  That's enough to keep two shifts at the Stokely USA corn-canning plant humming  all summer.  </P> <P> The approaching end of the sweet-corn season signals the start of Hoopeston's  festival (Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 this year). Launched in 1938, the festival  attracted an estimated 60,000 last year. ("A conservative guess," insists Dave  Barker, last year's festival chairman.)  </P> <P> Free corn-on-the-cob highlights the last three days of the celebration.  Naturally, there's a big corn-eating competition.  </P> <P> "The winner in the adult division usually chomps more than five ears in the  alloted three minutes," says contest organizer John Sales Jr.  </P> <P> But free corn isn't the only festival attraction. McFerren Park teems with  carnival rides, kids' games, concerts, demolition derbies, a national beauty  pageant, a classic-car exhibit, a flea market, a fishing derby, and a talent  and art show.  </P> <P> The competition is formidable. Over at the horseshoe pits, for example,  contestants come from 100 miles away every year.  </P> <P> Competitors at the top rung of the six-class ladder throw ringers 65% to 75% of  the time. (Pitch a ringer with at least one of every five throws and you can  qualify for the lowest level of competition.)  </P> <P> Hoopeston Jaycees, who organize the event, donate all proceeds to local  charities. Everyone in town contributes something.  </P> <P> The festival hits its stride on Saturday, when a big parade winds through town  to McFerren Park. Parade enthusiasts line the curbs. As the procession sweeps  past the town's two canneries and a can-making plant, Stokely employees and  others unfortunate enough to have to work their regular jobs during the busy  sweet-corn harvest season lean from open windows to cheer.  </P> <P> The crowning glory of the festival is the National Sweetheart Pageant, spawned  by a local Miss Sweet Corn competition. Four past National Sweethearts have  been named Miss America, proving that Hoopeston judges know how to pick more  than sweet corn.  </P> <P> Twenty-two Miss America hopefuls from states as far away as Alaska and Maine  entered the competition last year.  </P> <P> During all the goings-on, the ears keep bubbling. How do you cook 42 1/2 tons  of sweet corn? "First," says Steve Eyrich, who works for a Hoopeston firm that  manufactures canning equipment, "you get an old-fashioned steam engine and  replumb it."  </P> <P> The massive iron monster, belching black coal smoke amid rising clouds of  shimmering steam, circulates boiling water through a series of shiny cattle  troughs. Jaycee volunteers dunk basketfuls of fresh sweet corn -- which an  antique shucking machine husks -- into the steamy bath. After that, the  volunteers dump the corn into huge pans and hand-butter the ears using giant  brushes.  </P> <P> Corn-loving throngs that gather watch each step, as if the ears were crisp $20  bills. Finally comes the shout everyone is waiting to hear: "Hot corn! Hot  corn!" And after that, it's everyone for himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  When summer gets steamy, team up these two abundant Midwest vegetables in a  cool salad.  </P> <P> SPICY CORN-STUFFED TOMATO SALAD  </P> <P> 6 small, ripe tomatoes  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup creamy buttermilk dressing  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons snipped parsley  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> Dash ground red pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups cooked fresh corn kernels  </P> <P> 1/2 cup shredded Jack cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped cucumber  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> Lettuce leaves  </P> <P> Place tomatoes, stem end down, on cutting surface. Cut each into 4 to 6 wedges,  cutting to, but not through, stem end. Spread wedges apart slightly and  sprinkle with salt. Cover and chill.  </P> <P> Combine buttermilk dressing, parsley, black pepper and red pepper in small  mixing bowl and mix well.  </P> <P> Combine corn, cheese, greenpepper, cucumber and onion in separate bowl. Add  dressing mixture, tossing gently to coat. Cover and chill.  </P> <P> Fill each tomato with corn mixture and serve over lettuce leaves on individual  plate. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P>  Corn flavors this double-duty side dish. It's a vegetable and a bread.  </P> <P> PUFFY SKILLET CORN FRITTERS  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 2 cups fresh corn kernels  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 1/4 cup flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 2 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons milk  </P> <P> 2 dashes hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> 2 to 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat.

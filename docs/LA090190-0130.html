			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMOTE POLYNESIAN TROUPE SHARES RITES;  </P> <P> DANCE: PERFORMERS FROM ISOLATED ISLANDS MAKE U.S. DEBUT TODAY. AUDIENCES WILL  WATCH WARRIOR MOVEMENTS AND SAMPLE AN INTOXICATING, RITUALISTIC ROOT.  </P> <P> Imagine lush, green islands surrounded by coral reefs, aquamarine lagoons and  coconut tree-lined beaches being home to people so isolated that their nearest  neighbor, American Samoa, lies 300 miles east.  </P> <P> Each week, only one airline arrives from the outside world (Fiji) and  telephones are only available for two-hour periods, twice a day. Local  newspapers don't exist and only three hotels are in business.  </P> <P> Isolation has allowed much of the beauty and grace of Wallis and Futuna islands  to remain out in the middle of Polynesia for decades.  </P> <P> A French Overseas Territory since 1961, three islands make up the three  kingdoms ruled by three tribal chiefs who speak different languages --  Wallisian/East Uvean, East Futunan and French. Separated by 150 miles, Wallis  and Futuna are geographically Polynesian, but culturally and linguistically  related to Samoa and Tonga. The island of Alofi is uninhabited.  </P> <P> During World War II, 30,000 Americans were stationed on Wallis, then known as  Uvea. With no written language in their culture, the islanders regard  storytelling and oratory as important parts of life and when tales are set to  music and accompanied by dance, they play a significant role in social,  political and religious interaction.  </P> <P> Some 28 singers and dancers from Wallis and Futuna make their U.S. debut today  at the free opening festival ceremonies at Angel's Gate.  </P> <P> As they would in previous festivals, whether a celebration of South Pacific  arts or a village celebration, the group will greet their hosts with a to'o  kava, a religious ritual in which gifts are traditionally offered first to the  gods, then respectfully to their hosts, then to other L.A. Festival performers.  </P> <P> Later in the day, the troupe will share its culture in a kava ceremony that is  traditionally a part of all gatherings and ceremonies of importance in  Polynesia. Kava is a root which, when prepared and drunk, has a mildly  intoxicating effect. The origins of this ceremony come either from Samoa or  Tonga, symbolizing a link to their ancestral past. Audiences will be invited to  sample the kava, thus becoming a part of the performance.  </P> <P> Songs composed for the festival will accompany the preparation of the drink.  The laulausiva is a song of greeting to the audience from the performers as  well as those left behind in Wallis and Futuna. The lyrics express their joy of  participating in the festival and acknowledging the audience and its importance  to the festival.  </P> <P> Throughout the week, performances will focus on warrior and action dances,  which are performed only by the men. Wearing skirts, shoulder coverings and  headbands of red and white pandanus fiber, they are accompanied by drums as  they hold paddles and clubs to embody strength and energy. The kailao  originated in the village of Vailala on the island of Wallis and was executed  before going into combat as a kind of pep talk before battle. The tu'upaki  focuses on the warrior's club and the eke demonstrates various movements and  postures seen in warfare.  </P> <P> But the women also dance. In the soamako, their bodies, heads and eyes move  with grace to a softer, lilting drum beat. Men and women dance together in the  sasa, which mimics combat, fishing, canoeing, gardening and household chores.  </P></p>

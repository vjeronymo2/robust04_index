			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Commission's 'worrying step' on oligopolies Sir, Ms Rachel Brandenburger's article ('EC merger regime defies expectations of critics', September 3) states that Nestle's bid for Perrier is likely to be remembered as the recognition that the European Merger Control Regulation applies to oligopolistic (or collective) dominance as well as to single firm dominance. This is not so clear to me. I do not contest the possible need for the Commission to have the power to control the creation or alteration in the structure of certain oligopolistic markets. Rather, I question whether the Commission's mere wishes should be permitted to expand, without further ado, the powers which the member states have given it to review concentrations with a Community dimension. After all, the regulation enables the Commission to prohibit only the creation or strengthening of a dominant position which could significantly impede effective competition in the Community. The use of the term 'dominant position' is not a coincidence. The European Court of Justice has for many years defined it as a position of economic strength enjoyed by one undertaking which enables it to hinder the maintenance of effective competition on the relevant market by allowing it to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors and customers and ultimately of consumers. The Court held in 1979 that a dominant position must be distinguished from parallel courses of conduct which are peculiar to oligopolies in that in an oligopoly the courses of conduct interact, while in the case of an undertaking occupying a dominant position the conduct of the undertaking which derives profits from that position is to a great extent determined unilaterally. The limits of the Commission's powers under the regulation therefore seemed clear. It has now decided to go beyond. No one seems to be questioning this. Yet this would appear to be a worrying step in the building of a Europe based on the respect for the rule of law. Romano Subiotto, Rue des Confederes, 131, 1040 Brussels</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: NEW DEALS  </P> <P> TV personality Cristina Ferrare and MCA TV have a new deal that calls for her  to headline a new syndicated daily talk show that will be "different from any  other on the market." "MCA TV has been pursuing Ms. Ferrare to do a national  talk show for the past two years, so naturally we are elated by this  arrangement," said Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV. Ferrare's Uptown  Productions is included in the pact, which also calls for her involvement in  other areas of television syndication. Ferrare was host of KABC-TV's "A.M. Los  Angeles" for five years and this week is guest hosting ABC's "Good Morning  America." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

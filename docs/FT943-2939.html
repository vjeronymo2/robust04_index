			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Personal View: A German message Europe must heed Last week at Leyden university, Britain's prime minister, John Major, did Europe a service by rejecting the proposals for a two-tier European Union in the recent discussion paper from Germany's Christian Democrats. The idea of formalising a supposed 'hard core' of EU member states, placing the UK and others in the second division of the European league, was ill-judged. However, Mr Major should not lose sight of one essential fact. The CDU paper outlined the German need to build on and deepen 40 years of success at integrating Europe with Germany at its heart. In view of this, Mr Major was perhaps ill-advised in saying Europe is 'outgrowing the concept of the original founders of the European Union'. Germany itself is stressing the necessity of reforming, and above all reinforcing, the institutional framework of European co-operation as a precondition for enlarging Europe to the east. As the CDU paper points out, tragic past experience has demonstrated the dangers that can ensue from Germany's position in the centre of Europe. The rest of the continent needs to respond positively to Germany's request to be bound irreversibly to a politically and economically integrated continent. This was the main message in the CDU paper - even though the 'two-tier' proposals gained the most publicity. Fortunately, an immediate rebuff came from the German foreign minister and his EU colleagues, as well as from French President Francois Mitterrand. It was objectionable enough for a large number of member states to be relegated, albeit temporarily, to the status of second-class Europeans. But it was no less absurd for the Benelux countries, founder members of the European Community, to be told that 'they must be more involved in Franco-German co-operation'. Was this a bad joke - or just clumsiness? As for the French, Le Monde published its commentary on the CDU paper under the heading 'Rudesse allemande'. Although the document upholds the theory of the privileged Franco-German partnership, it shows Germany's irritation with some French attitudes can match its well-known disappointment about Britain's European policies. It is historically inaccurate to say that European integration depends on the success of the Franco-German axis. In fact, the European Community was formed in 1957 partly to stabilise the Franco-German relationship. This is not to say that bilateral relationships do not have any importance for economic and monetary union. If Emu is to succeed, it will have to take place at different speeds, according to the Maastricht criteria. This is not, however, the same as postulating a 'two-tier' approach for integration in general. Another condition for Emu, as rightly stated in the CDU paper, is that it must be embedded in a political union. This requires not only joint policies in foreign affairs and defence, but also more democratic structures for European decision-making. The CDU paper underlines the necessity of strengthening the EU's capacity to act. Among other things, it proposes an effective federal division of powers between different levels of decision-making. It also suggests defining the EU's fundamental values in a quasi-constitutional document. These ideas are hard to stomach for British Euro-sceptics, or even for the average 'Euro-convert'. And yet the desire of the Germans and other Europeans to drive on with this agenda must not be underestimated. When a year ago a 'German National Foundation' was founded by eminent personalities such as President Richard von Weizsacker and ex-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, they stated that a new German identity had to be based on the will to advance European unification. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said exactly the same when unification took place in October 1990. Such remarks might seem odd for citizens of long-established nation states such as the UK and the Netherlands. However, Germany, as a 'belated nation' in the middle of Europe, feels it has specific internal and external sources of vulnerability that need to be taken into account. The week in which we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Arnhem is a fitting time to remind ourselves not to repeat the mistakes Europe made in dealing with the German question earlier this century. Even if we are confident that the federal republic will never again follow a 'special path' outside the European mainstream, we would ignore at our peril Germany's call for European solidarity and integration.

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer: Belting round As we all know, God - or god, depending on your faith - moves in mysterious ways. But there is little mystery in the Church of England's latest appointment, that of the Right Reverend John Hind, 48, as the new bishop of Europe. For Hind appears to have several useful qualifications for the job, including an interest in languages and physical fitness. Currently bishop of Horsham, Hind will need plenty of stamina to rove across one of the largest dioceses around. Canon David Palmer, who runs the European diocese gazette, says Hind's beat will cover 'Scandinavia to Casablanca and from Madeira to Ankara', 110 chaplaincies altogether. Clerics throughout Europe must be hoping Hind does not find much need of his other hobby - he is a Black Belt in judo.</p>

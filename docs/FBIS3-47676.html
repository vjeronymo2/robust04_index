The decrease rate was steeper than the 26 percent fall in  the  national rice harvest, which totaled 7,834,000 tons, the agency  said.    This shows a large portion of the harvest is being marketed  freely outside government channels, with rice prices surging due  to the poorest rice crop last year since World War II, officials  said.    Of the total of unpolished nonglutinous and glutinous rice  inspected, paddy-grown nonglutinous rice decreased 37 percent to  3,778,000 tons.</p>

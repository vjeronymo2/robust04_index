			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Dobrivoje "Bidza" </F> Budimirovic by Marijana Milosavljevic; place and date not given:  "God, That's Me"]    [Text] Serious politicians might envy him his image built  carefully/carelessly. He has been able to turn himself into a  media star without any effort. The formula is clear: Remain what  you are. Bidza has no need to make himself better and more  intelligent. He is perfectly recognizable, and in the meantime  he has become generally accepted whether in a favorable or  unfavorable context. Dobrivoje Budimirovic, like it or not, has  grown to be the standard-bearer of rural philosophy and  psychology.    In Serbia, such a person is respected and esteemed, hated  and  supported. He received 87 percent of the vote, and in the  election to opstina president there were only three votes  against. This nevertheless did not prevent the local people from  trying to set fire to his house last year.    He says of Slobodan Milosevic that he is the first Yugoslav  opposition to come to power without killing those who did not  agree with him. He has proved that they are all politically  alive and well, but he does not want to talk about their mental  condition, because that is a personal matter.    Budimirovic's mental condition is perhaps best portrayed by  this story: "When we were university students in Belgrade, my  future wife and I, we loved to visit furniture showrooms just to  look. Once, we were in a showroom with furniture in the style of  Louis XIII. We sat down, and I told my future wife: `If I just  had this, I could die a happy man.' Not long ago, I bought  furniture like that, my wife reminded me of my promise, but I  still do not want to go until I finish this job with the  opposition."    When Bidza is involved, there is no room for tolerance. His  arrogance is astounding. In the meantime, "bidzizam" has become  our reality.    [Milosavljevic] Whatever else it might be, the opposition  here is resilient. Vuk and Seselj will in future defend their  interests together.    [Budimirovic] Well, you know, that is typical of us Serbs:  You kill your best friend's wife, and then you and your best  friend make up.    [Milosavljevic] Do not tell me that you were not surprised.    [Budimirovic] I was not surprised. They are Serbs. They come  from the karst in Herzegovina. They are interested in this  region here only because of power, so it is not hard for them to  constantly disgrace themselves with the public. And, on this  occasion, by making up.    [Milosavljevic] It is not just a question of them. The  entire  parliamentary opposition has been showing a similar tendency.    [Budimirovic] If you consider Vuk, Seselj, and those few  souls a coalition that threatens us, you are mistaken. With an  opposition like that, we will stay in power 100 years.    [Milosavljevic] What does the opposition need to have for  you  to take it seriously?    [Budimirovic] Name for me just one of their leaders who has  the good of this people at heart, who has done something for it  even if not anything permanent. Just one who at least has tried  to help. I personally do not know of a single one. They have  been spitting on their people all over the world and informing  on us at every step for a handful of dollars. They have been  selling out Serbia at third-rate suppers. Which one of them has  made a contribution for this people to have a better life?    [Milosavljevic] Is there at least one man in the ranks of  the  opposition whom you hold in estimation?    [Budimirovic] I just told you about the leaders. However,  there are quite a few good and proper people in the membership.  Even creative people.    [Milosavljevic] You, then, are not upset at all, you think  that there is no reason for the opposition to be taken seriously  this time?    [Budimirovic] If you are afraid of sparrows, you should not  plant wheat. I am enough of an agronomist to know that. The  opposition is smaller than even those sparrows.    [Milosavljevic] What exactly do you hold against Vuk  Draskovic and Vojislav Seselj?    [Budimirovic] Nothing. I feel sorry for them.    [Milosavljevic] Why?    [Budimirovic] Because they do not want to be with their  people. We all know that their people is not here. They should  go across the Drina and stretch out their hand to their real  people. I would never leave my native Svilajnac and go to Bosnia  and Herzegovina to sell my intelligence, because I figure that  my place is not with them. The Serbian people has a good feeling  who it is and with whom it is dealing. The saddest thing is that  the people who like them are in error. I guarantee that those  two are not happy even with their wives. They do not love even  them. Those two hate the entire world by noontime, and in the  afternoon they hate even themselves.    [Milosavljevic] What do you see as the difference between  Serbs from Serbia and Serbs from elsewhere?    [Budimirovic] Until three years, it never occurred to any of  them to declare themselves to be Serbs. I drove the refugees out  of Svilajnac.    [Milosavljevic] How did you manage to do that, and are you  referring here to all refugees?    [Budimirovic] Refugees are women, children, and those unable  to work. I did not touch them. I concluded that the place for  the rest of them was with their people. I am against our people  from Serbia going to defend Bosnia while they are here engaging  in smuggling, prostitution, drugs, and other occupations from  which they get a fine living.    [Milosavljevic] This is odd for the heroic fighting people  such as the Serbs like to represent themselves. Even we by and  large are reluctant to respond to the mobilization.    [Budimirovic] Not a single man from my native Svilajnac has  gone off to wage war, nor is there a single black flag flying in  my town. The people from the Resava region would go if they  really needed help, but now that they have crawled here to make  money, mainly in illegal ways, I think that there is nothing we  can expect from them. Only if all of us together were fighting  for the common interest of all Serbs, only then should all Serbs  come together.    [Milosavljevic] Is this also our war?    [Budimirovic] Serbia is not at war. Nevertheless, many  volunteers have gone from here to help their brothers in  trouble. Among them, there are honorable people, but also  fortune hunters.    [Milosavljevic] Are we on the threshold of new federal  elections? To some people it seems that Milosevic has already  begun the election campaign.    [Budimirovic] There is no need for it. That is not why  Milosevic has been talking to the farmers, if that is what you  are referring to. He knows what life is and what the provinces  are. The opposition has no chance of winning an election. They  will not win even if they organize a new election every year.    [Milosavljevic] What do you think about the incident in the  Federal Assembly, and has Bozovic been doing his job as he  should?    [Budimirovic] I do not see why this topic is brought up. The  deputies have voted confidence in Bozovic three times. That says  enough about how he is doing his job. As far as the incident is  concerned, sick people display that kind of primitivism. I would  respect Seselj's demands if he fought for them with words. He  did not invest the work and sweat to get the Assembly in  operating condition. I know why the microphones bother him. If a  doctor of science and the leader of a party comes to the  parliament to pull out the wires, then it would have been better  for him not to go to school and not to begin to engage in  politics. He might better have become an electrician. Then  presumably he would have a higher opinion of technology. I am  sorry for him, because his party was at one time the one I held  most dear after my own. I know his people quite well, and I know  that 80 percent of its members would renounce such acts in  themselves. Serbia has had enough wreckers, those who have not  invested anything in it. This country needs creators and  investors. Workers and creators whose fruits the people can  enjoy.    [Milosavljevic] Nevertheless, none of that bothered you  while  Seselj was supporting Milosevic's policy and working against the  opposition?    [Budimirovic] No. We agreed while he was in favor of the  interests of Serbia. While he wanted to help the Serbian people.  Now we would be happier if he no longer defended us that way. It  is clear that he is thinking only about how to take power.  Before that, even I liked him.    [Milosavljevic] Many charges are being laid against Bozovic.  From malfeasance to embezzlement. Seselj said there is evidence  of that?    [Budimirovic] Lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, but it  does  not rain. The human thing would be to publish that evidence. For  three years, we have been listening to hearsay without any kind  of arguments or documentation. If I had the evidence, I would  publish it even though Bozovic is a member of my party. Unless  that happens, it is all nonsense.    [Milosavljevic] You are saying, then, that Bozovic is a  honorable man?    [Budimirovic] I do not know. For the present, it seems so to  me. I will change my opinion if it is proven to me otherwise.    [Milosavljevic] Many people have said that the former  closeness between the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] and SRS  [Serbian Radical Party] had the substance of a coalition.    [Budimirovic] Seselj drew us in in order to derive  advantage,  and we supported him, but we were never in a coalition. I say  this with full responsibility. I was sitting next to him at that  time, because at that time I also liked him. When we figured him  out and found that our interests were not the same, then we  turned our back on him. In his ranks, he has good and honest  people, I emphasize once again.    [Milosavljevic] Does that also apply to Tomislav Nikolic?    [Budimirovic] The two of us come from the same place, and we  have known each other for a long time. I would say that even of  him, but it is a pity that he is no longer thinking with his own  head.    [Milosavljevic] As a successful businessman, do you believe  in the survival of the Avramovic program?    [Budimirovic] I do and I do not. My opstina is in good  shape,  and there are few others in Serbia that can compete with it from  the economic standpoint. The program will not succeed unless  everyone goes back to work. Everyone has to live from his work.  Nothing comes from empty applause while everyone on the other  side is going on in the same old way. We all need to be  Avramovic. Everyone must help him in carrying out the economic  program. In my native Svilajnac, no one is on mandatory leave. I  found a job for everyone.    [Milosavljevic] How did you manage that?    [Budimirovic] I do not sell democracy. I know how to manage  and command.    [Milosavljevic] What do you think about the Dafiment affair  and publication of the lists of savings depositors who withdrew  their money?    [Budimirovic] I like Dafina Milanovic, because I like big  heavy women. But that is all I know about it. Only fools give  their wife and money to someone else for safekeeping.    [Milosavljevic] What if the depositors get angry now?    [Budimirovic] I am joking, of course. I am sorry for the  poor  person who was deceived. However, I do not stay awake with other  people's worries, I prefer to get along on my own. The important  thing is that I am not on her list, as you have seen for  yourself. And if it is nevertheless true that people in my party  took out their money, I am ashamed for them.    [Milosavljevic] Aside from Bozovic's removal, the opposition  also wants equal treatment on Radio-Television Serbia [RTS].    [Budimirovic] What do they need with RTS, when they have  Studio B?    [Milosavljevic] That television station, however, has a  limited range.    [Budimirovic] But why should they have more when they do not  deserve anything more? By what right would the opposition get  that, when it is just a peck of trouble? They have not donated  anything, nor contributed anything for Serbia to be a better and  happier country. Why, then, should the people look in their  direction? I would never talk to such people. We need a  creative, industrious, and able opposition. The present  opposition is not like that. To help us when we make a mistake,  and not just to spit on us like this one.    [Milosavljevic] Many of them are above all calling attention  to the fact that it has never been worse for us than under this  government and this kind of government, and they are offering  their solution to get out of the crisis.    [Budimirovic] You just give them my greetings and tell them  that the Serbian people has never lived better than today. Here,  look (he points to his plate full of roast suckling pig and  smiles with satisfaction), who has it bad today? If all those  who fled from the country to the large cities went back there,  it would be better for us at once. This way, they are putting  pressure on your dumpsters and social welfare institutions. They  left their farms in search of the promised land. Until  yesterday, their wives were tending sheep and wearing sandals  from Pirot, and now they want to wear spiked heels and be  Belgrade ladies. That does not cost us in the provinces as much  as it does you in Belgrade.    [Milosavljevic] I have heard that in delivering a speech in  Svilajnac you publicly referred to yourself as God.    [Budimirovic] What I said was: "God, that's me." Because I  effectively have everything under my control. You know, for me  God is man. I have a right to say that, because everything I do,  I do in the interest of my people.    [Milosavljevic] Did you like Tito? It is said that you  personally changed the name of the main street in Svilajnac from  Marshal Tito Street to Saint Sava Street. Malicious tongues have  it that you did that because of your father, whose name was Sava.    [Budimirovic] Well, for me my father was a saint, and as for  Tito, there is a place in all of us that would like to have him  back. I trusted him. Not as a Croat, but as a man who organized  that entire community spirit. If only Tito were alive instead of  Mesic.    [Milosavljevic] You say that you did not trust him as a  Croat, but do not tell me that you did not believe in  brotherhood and unity.    [Budimirovic] I did. At one time, I could have slept in the  park near Tivoli, in Zagreb, in Dugo Selo, in Split, in  Benkovac.... That is why I trusted him. Before the war, my  people were day laborers, and I owe everything I have achieved  in life to that period of time. I obtained everything under that  communism, and I am grateful that I have been successful and got  a degree as a son of a peasant from Lukovica. Now those who  profited the most thanks only to that time and that political  climate are spitting on him.    [Milosavljevic] But you also became a Socialist.    [Budimirovic] That is because all the Communists from  Svilajnac who in 1984 wanted to expel me from the League of  Communists became the opposition. I did not want to be with  them. I remained faithful to Serbia, to work, to order, and to  peace. All those things that the SPS now represents.    [Milosavljevic] If the opposition, because of a boycott of  parliament by the Socialists, nevertheless leaves parliament, as  Vuk has threatened?    [Budimirovic] Pay no attention to him! In our parts, they  say: "When a wolf [Vuk] barks, it is just like a dog barking!"</p>

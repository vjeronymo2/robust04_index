			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Time Warner improves revenues in all divisions TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, reported yesterday that first-quarter revenues rose across all five of its divisions, helping turn last year's Dollars 50m quarterly loss into a net profit of Dollars 3m. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), or operating earnings, were Dollars 561m over the three months, achieved on total revenues of Dollars 3bn. Operating earnings in the same quarter last year were Dollars 530m on revenues of Dollars 2.8bn. The best performing division of Time Warner was its cable television group. This saw operating earnings climb 11 per cent to a record Dollars 228m, thanks to an increase in cable subscribers and advertising. The group's publishing unit, Time Inc, reported operating earnings of Dollars 44m, up 5 per cent from last year. Gains were reported in advertising and circulation at the company's magazines, in spite of the sluggish economy, and they helped offset lower results at the book publishing division. The Warner Music Group posted first-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 141m, up slightly on a year ago, after increases in domestic music sales and music publishing. Among its most successful artists were Metallica, Genesis and Simply Red. On Monday, Time Warner's music division announced a multi-year Dollars 60m deal with the pop-star Madonna. At the group's movie-making unit, operating earnings were virtually flat at Dollars 96m. The feature of the quarter was the success of the controversial movie JFK, which since its release last year has grossed Dollars 160m worldwide. Operating earnings at the television programming division were little changed at Dollars 52m, with the bulk of the small increase in income recorded at the pay-for-TV services, HBO and Cinemax. On Wall Street, the group's share price slipped Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 102 5/8 . Knight-Ridder, the US media group, which recorded an increase in first-quarter earnings, is cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 1992, Reuter reports. The company posted first-quarter net income of Dollars 25m or 46 cents a share on revenues of Dollars 555.4m, compared with Dollars 15.8m or 32 cents on revenues of Dollars 545.4 a year ago. It said that while net income in the final three quarters would not match those of the first quarter, it expected earnings growth in each quarter. Barring a setback in the economy, Knight-Ridder expected 1992 to improve on last year's Dollars 132.1m or Dollars 2.55 a share on revenues of Dollars 2.24bn.</p>

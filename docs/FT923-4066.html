			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Arts: Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival IN 1930 Ted Shawn, husband and partner of the modern dance pioneer Ruth St Denis, bought an 18th century farm called Jacob's Pillow near Lee, Massachusetts, as a summer home for his company of male dancers. After the group disbanded in the early Forties, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival was inaugurated there. A barn on the property served both as studio and theatre. Antony Tudor choreographed much of his great ballet Pillar of Fire in another barn. In 1952, a new theatre was built. Under Shawn's direction, programmes typically used to consist of one ballet number, one modern, and one 'ethnic', but whole evenings were often devoted to important visiting companies, such as the group of soloists from the Royal Danish Ballet and Ballet Rambert. Under the direction of Liz Thompson from 1979 to 1990, and since then of Samuel Miller, the festival and summer school have continued to expand. Special courses and conferences are held; new dances have been commissioned from leading choreographers; companies are invited to be in residence to develop new works. Performances now take place in three different spaces and the main theatre has been enlarged over the last two seasons. Earlier this summer, I saw the Mark Morris Dance Group, regular visitors, in substantially the same mixed bill as they presented at the Edinburgh Festival. On a more recent weekend, I saw a new ballet company, Ballet de Ville, directed by Peter Anastos. At that stage it was an ad hoc group led by dancers from other companies, with a corps de ballet that included advanced students in the Pillow's Ballet Repertory Project, several of them from Russia. The novelty in the programme was a recreation of The Awakening of Flora, first choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov in the summer of 1893. The ballet was a favourite of Anna Pavlova, who appeared as Aurora in the first performance, succeeded Kshessinskaya in the title role in 1900, and revived the piece several times with her own company. Anastos's pastiche fell between the stools of the kind of parody he used to choreograph for the Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo and a serious attempt at reconstruction. His statements beforehand suggested the latter, but the performance tended toward the former, though with less sense of style than the Trocks had. The uncertainty of tone may be the fault of the principals, who clearly did not believe in the material, unlike Nina Avramenko, one of the Russian coryphees, whose sweet soulfulness struck exactly the right note. The following week, Garth Fagan Dance presented Fagan's Griot New York, which opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's 'Next Wave' Festival in December last year and has since been seen at the Vienna Festival, among other places. On the smaller stage of the Ted Shawn Theatre, the work loses none of its power, though one misses the live music of Wynton Marsalis and his Septet, heard here in a recording. The third collaborator is the distinguished American sculptor Martin Puryear, whose sets, consisting of oversized objects and implements and architectural forms in forced perspective, add their own metaphorical weight to the piece. 'Griot' is a West African word meaning 'storyteller,' but this is not a narrative piece. Rather, it is a series of pictures of life in the city today, focusing now on individuals, now on the group. It begins with a dance of courtship by Natalie Rogers and Norwood Pennewell, matching each other's virtuosity step for step. A later duet by Pennewell and Valentina Alexander translates a lovers' duet into interlocking arcs and angles. There is a mysterious nocturne peopled by black-clad figures; the second half begins with a Goyaesque scene of despair set in some modern bedlam. The message is not all pessimistic; the piece ends with a joyous celebration of irrepressible urban energy. In a recurrent movement motif, the dancers balance with one foot drawn up to the other knee, the torso arched back. Griot New York is thrillingly danced by Fagan's superb company, whose commitment to the work is palpable and deeply moving.</p>

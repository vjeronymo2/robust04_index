			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, candidate for </F> Ukrainian president, by Anatoliy Yeremenko; place and date not  given: "Ivan Plyushch: The Donbass Is the Promising Area of  Ukraine"]    [Text] Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch started his  preelection trip with the Donbass. The position of the powerful  industrial kray certainly will prove decisive in the campaign  for the high post of president. It is clear that it is not  particularly necessary to introduce the former Supreme Council  chairman to the Donbass residents. Plyushch here, as however in  all of Ukraine, is well-known and respected--for the wisdom and  talent of the leader of a state, breadth of state thinking, and  consistency in the defense of the interests of the people.    Ivan Stepanovych visited the hospitable Donetsk land  for two days--he met with miners of the mine imeni Abakumov,  machine builders of the Buran plant, and the plant imeni  Petrovskiy. He discussed problems of the coal industry with  specialists of the Donetskugol association. We met late in the  evening after his intensive visit to miners and an hour-long  discourse with a television audience on live TV.    [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, as you correctly noted on the  program, the programs of the aspirants to the post of president  of Ukraine are similar in many ways. Concern about the  individual worker stands out in each. The difference is only in  the order of setting forth basic points. But there is also a  principal difference. How do you see our state in the future:  unitary or federative? It was two years ago that you said here  in Donetsk that federalization is useful. At the same time, you  emphasized that if everything is done rapidly, this could lead  only to damage. What do you think today?    [Plyushch] I also think this now. First of all, it is  necessary to clarify just what we want from federalization.  What, are we attracted by a fashionable word? Is the main thing  not to call an oblast an oblast, but precisely a land? But if we  mean to delegate a significant part of power to the regions and  local organs of authority, then I am for such a federation. I am  for it with both hands. But if we want each region to consider  itself independent from Kiev, then such a federation will give  no benefit either to Kiev, or to our state. So let us decide the  essence and not the form.    My opponents claim that I, they say, am for full economic  independence, but against political independence. But permit me  to ask: What is economic and what is political independence.  According to what methodology are they divided? It seems to me  that economics is a continuation of politics, and that politics  is a continuation of economics. Everything is closely  interrelated. And it is not necessary to absolutize and to  politicize the problem. Really, by federation, I understand  maximum independence in the resolution of the overwhelming  majority of questions on a regional level. But the region's  connection with the state is implemented through a system of  taxation and the structure of general state organs, and  specifically: customs, force ministries, procuracies, courts,  banks, and the credit-financial system. And there is no need to  be afraid. Here is an appropriate case. For example, Donetskugol  has established a departmental bank. It already has 16 branches  and correspondent accounts in eight CIS countries and in a dozen  countries of the far abroad. In turn, Prominvestbank and the  National Bank are trying in various ways to keep it on a leash.  The phenomena are understandable--authority is not given up that  easily. But, nevertheless, however difficult it may be,  Donuglekombank is operating. And this, you will agree, is good.  Owing to the bank, the association is resolving many production  questions, and it is becoming like a state within a state. So  then, is this separatism? I see here an economic independence  that is an obligatory element of federalization.    [Yeremenko] How do you assess the conference of leaders of  the border oblasts of Ukraine and Russia that is being held in  Donetsk?    [Plyushch] The meeting, and this is the third of its kind,  is  very necessary. It promotes the development of communications  and turning out suitable legislative acts concerning border  oblasts, and the establishment of clear borders, as in the whole  civilized world. It is time to move from words to action. A  world, Asiatic, and various markets exist. Why should a mutually  profitable market of CIS countries not work? Who is prohibiting  it? I was at the Buran plant yesterday--in two and a half  months--it is simply fantastic! It created a new mining machine  that is on the level of the best world models. I asked--where  did you get the parts? It turns out that 13 percent are from the  far abroad, 18 percent are Russian, and the rest are ours. And  how are you cooperating with Russia, I inquired of the director?  Normally, he answered. You, in the newspaper, must  especially emphasize something that has been pretty well  forgotten: He who wants to do, finds the means, but he who does  not, finds excuses.    Of course, it is necessary to help the coal industry, but  the  main thing is to at least not interfere. The development of  Donetskugol under the difficult conditions of a general crisis  demonstrates this well. The Donbass is our extremely promising  region. And strengthening its economic equal rights relations  with Russia will undoubtedly only accrue to the benefit of all  of Ukraine.    [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, what are your political  sympathies, and who are you counting on during the elections?    [Plyushch] I am counting on our people, on their common  sense.    ...The time of the meeting passed imperceptibly. Ivan  Stepanovych's extended journey led to Zaporozhye. It seems that  he departed Donetsk, having received fairly good support. The  miners of the Donetskugol association alone submitted almost  25,000 signatures in his behalf.</p>

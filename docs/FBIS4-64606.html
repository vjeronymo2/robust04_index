			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by </F> Elisabeth Holte in Stockholm; no date given]    [Text] Stockholm -- "Today Sweden has its natural place in  Europe and has close ties with more or less all countries. This  was not always the case in the past!"    Prime Minister Carl Bildt did not hesitate with his answer  and did not fail to include a little dig at his predecessors  when AFTENPOSTEN asked him what is the difference between  Swedish foreign and security policy today and five or 10 years  ago.    To be honest, he made more digs at the Social Democrats'  foreign policy priorities and their greater interest in radical  regimes in the developing countries than at the new situation in  Europe. For in practice the election campaign is already under  way.    Bildt has always been interested in foreign policy. And so  closely does the prime minister involve himself in foreign  policy that you can hear people in Stockholm say that poor  Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas has a boss who would  ideally like to be doing her job!    As Bildt sees it, Sweden will retain its military  nonalignment for the foreseeable future, at the same time as  Swedish EU [European Union] membership will increase Sweden's  security. However, he reiterated as recently as last week in a  debate in the Riksdag that it is not as easy for Sweden to  become a member of the WEU [Western European Union].    "But Sweden is very interested in being able to follow the  work of the WEU as an observer -- something which represents no  military commitments, but which offers an opportunity to  participate in peacemaking activities, for example," he said.    According to Bildt, Sweden will not try to slow down a trend  toward common European defenses. But the prime minister's  answer is always a resounding "no" when he is asked at EU debate  meetings whether a private from Norrland runs the risk of being  sent against his will to fight in the Balkans for example, if  Sweden joins the EU. And he is keen to remind his audiences  that Germany and France, which have been cooperating longest,  have so far not reached agreement on a common tank, let alone a  common army.    The Baltic region and Russia is another topic in which Bildt  takes a personal interest.    In the three years he has been prime minister -- and the  three Baltic countries have been independent -- he has played an  unusually active role as a go-between and sometimes even  mediator in Baltic-Russian affairs.    This week he has again been in the firing line because of  the  Baltic region -- this time in the Riksdag's Constitutional  Committee -- because of his remark a while ago to the effect  that Sweden will not sit and look on passively if the Baltic  countries' independence were to be threatened. Sweden will lend  its support -- particularly political support.    Such talk was too much for some -- particularly opposition  parties which had not been consulted and which took the view  that the prime minister was promising more support than a  neutral Sweden could in practice give. The Riksdag committee  wanted to follow the matter up and find out whether, in the  event of a crisis in the Baltic, Sweden should remain neutral  militarily, or make soldiers and aircraft available, as it did  in Finland during the Winter War.    "We will give political support, and sanctions could become  an option. We will not allow ourselves to be forced, as we were  in 1940, to betray our neighbors," Bildt said.    Why do you give such a high priority to marking support for  the Baltic countries?    "Because what is happening on the other side of the Baltic  Sea has such great significance for Sweden's security and  economic policy. There are few things which are more important  for peace in Europe as a whole, and for us here in the Nordic  area in particular, than the development of the democratic  reform process in Russia. We have seen what it was like to be  the neighbor of the Soviet Union which was a dictatorship and an  overmilitarized superpower. Now we have the chance to get a  democratic Russia with a market economy which fully respects  three independent nations along the eastern coast of the  Baltic," said Bildt, eager to send a signal to the red-brown  revanchists in Russia that the Balts have friends who follow  events.</p>

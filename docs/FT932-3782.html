			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Sugar's QC denies that Venables had deal MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur football club, denied reaching any agreement with Mr Terry Venables, the club's chief executive, that he would never use his larger shareholding to vote against him, the High Court was told yesterday. On the second day of the hearing over whether the injunction preventing Mr Venables' sacking should be lifted, Mr Philip Heslop, QC for Mr Sugar, said the attempted dismissal had been properly handled. Even if there had been such an agreement between the two men, as Mr Venables had claimed, there was nothing to stop the board getting rid of him if it wished, Mr Heslop said. 'It is not right or arguable that this company has the burden of having to employ Mr Venables as chief executive indefinitely,' he said. Earlier Mr Martin Mann QC repeated Mr Venables' claim that when the two men took control of the club in June 1991 they had agreed not to vote against each other. However, after the club's re-financing rights issue in November 1991, in which Mr Sugar increased his holding, the chairman refused to sign a written agreement that this arrangement would continue. Mr Venables said in an affidavit that he had been 'naive' to agree to the rights issue going ahead - and any trust he had in Mr Sugar - evaporated afterwards. Mr Heslop said the evidence of the majority of the board was that they no longer had any confidence in Mr Venables' ability to discharge his function. The decision to remove Mr Venables was not just Mr Sugar's but that of the Spurs board. 'The company appointed him and the company dismissed him,' he said. Mr Venables himself had no right, except in very special circumstances, to reverse the board's decision. There had been no attempt to exclude him from being involved in the affairs of the company as a director, Mr Heslop said.</p>

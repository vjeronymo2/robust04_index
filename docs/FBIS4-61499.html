			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov article: "Expulsion: Facts Cited by Russian </F> Diplomats in Nearby Foreign Countries Demonstrate that  Oppression of Russian-Speaking Population Is Becoming  Systematic"]    [Text] From 26 to 28 April the Russian Federation  president's Citizenship Commission, the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Federation Presidential Staff  held a conference-cum-seminar for personnel of diplomatic  missions and consular establishments. The seminar's theme was  expressed rather dryly: "Questions of Citizenship and the  Position of Fellow-Countrymen in Nearby Foreign Countries."  However, the report by Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the  president's Citizenship Commission, the speech by Deputy Foreign  Minister Boris Pastukhov, and -- most of all -- the reports from  Russian diplomats were imbued with genuine alarm at the plight  of the Russian-speaking population in nearby foreign countries,  first and foremost Estonia and Latvia.    The situation in the Republic of Latvia provides the most  glaring example of the overt "expulsion" of Russians,  Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Poles. Here are a few facts.  According to the 1989 census 64.5 percent of the population of  Riga were non-Latvians (mainly Russian), in Liepaja the figure  was 61.2 percent, and in Daugavpils 87 percent. The figures  have changed now, but at any rate 45-60 percent of the  population in those cities is Russian. The vast mass of them  were already deprived of citizenship (apart from those who were  citizens of Latvia before 1940 and those of special service to  the republic) and in 1993 they were deprived even of the  possibility of participating in the formation of local  self-government. The majority of them have the status of  "permanent resident" and have only the hope of obtaining  citizenship -- as a rule an impossible hope.    A lot has been said about the language barrier. Let us add  just a small comment here: Enterprise directors who hire  Russians with no knowledge of the local language are liable to  be fined. "Occupation forces -- get out of the good apartments!"  is a slogan you can often see in Latvia. At the moment,  however, it is no more than a slogan.    In conversation with your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent,  Georgiy Isakovskiy, head of the Russian Federation Embassy  Consular Department in the Republic of Latvia, talked about the  activity of the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs Department  of Citizenship and Migration. Despite the fact that this  structure's work is regulated by secret documents, which  therefore have no force, it ventures to do things which violate  the constitution and laws of Latvia. A circular stamp placed in  a passport by the department denotes a Russian serviceman, a  square stamp denotes a reservist. These marks are grounds for  overt discrimination when it comes to hiring people and the  registration of ownership rights. The Latvian press publishes  lists of the Russian military complete addresses and telephone  numbers -- so everyone can display "civic activeness." Recently  a highly sophisticated process began in which residents who  travel to neighboring countries (Russia, Estonia, and  Belorussia) [Belarus] to visit relatives are exiled  [vysylayutsya]. They are forced to obtain Russian general civil  foreign passports, and when they return to Latvia (people travel  without a visa, of course) the Latvian residence permits in the  former USSR passports are canceled and the Russian general civil  foreign passports are stamped to prohibit them from entering the  country for five years and order them to leave Latvia within  seven days.    Tyranny? Yes, without doubt. And this is acknowledged by  the Latvian courts when they restore the rights of permanent  residents of the country. But by no means everyone goes to  court -- a large proportion of them sell their property within  seven days and leave for Russia. If these people do not leave  or appeal to the court action is taken against them...no, not by  the law enforcement agencies but by detachments of the  "zemessargi" [home defense guard].    It is staggering but true that a state structure -- the  Department for Citizenship and Migration -- bases its activity  on the "zemessargi." Organized on the pattern of the  Volksdeutsche and Hitler Youth, these youth structures have the  job of intimidating the Russian-speaking population.    But why are the permanent residents of the Republic of  Latvia  not expressing dissatisfaction, why are they not uniting? They  have been banned from doing that. The charters of organizations  whose purpose is to defend human rights in Latvia are not  registered. If their charter contains no line to that effect  but the organizations engage in this activity anyway, they are  banned on the grounds that they are not abiding by their  charter. All associations of Russians in Latvia except cultural  societies are essentially underground.    How can human rights violations in the nearby foreign  countries be combated?    Boris Pastukhov described as urgent the signing of a  "package" of agreements with Latvia (that is, together with the  settlement of the situation concerning military pensioners).  The Russian Federation deputy foreign minister noted that the  Latvian side is dragging out the talks and in this situation a  Russian action program is being prepared to protect the rights  of specific inhabitants. Abdulakh Mikitayev declared that  Russia must grant dual citizenship to residents after the  conclusion of the corresponding accords with nearby foreign  states, and cited the experience of France and Canada, where  there are more than 2 million people with dual citizenship.</p>

Diez report: "Gonzalez Buries </F> Bicephalous Model in PSOE"]    [Excerpts] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez trusts that he will  have sufficient support at the 19-20 March Socialist congress to  have a free hand in drawing up the party leadership list.  Gonzalez acknowledged that with this congress the bicephalous  leadership model (the Gonzalez-Guerra tandem) is drawing to a  close, and a model of shared responsibility will prevail. The  PSOE leader met with the news media on Wednesday evening [19  January] in order to offer some clues to a congress at which he  will play a decisive role and at which he is trying to continue  to arbitrate.    The PSOE secretary general believes that the new leadership,  in addition to being collective, must be effective,  representative, and consistent with the party's blueprint for  renewal. That is, he wishes to have competent people with  sufficient authority in the PSOE to surmount the current  internal discord.    Gonzalez does not wish to identify the people enjoying his  confidence, and to whom he will delegate the day-to-day running  of the PSOE, because he will give priority to his role as prime  minister. In this connection, he emphasizes his traditional idea  that the party is an instrument serving society -- not an end in  itself. He will wait until the holding of the congress before  revealing the list, out of respect for the wishes which party  members may express at the congress.    Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he is already thinking  about those people and is conducting numerous contacts among  regional party secretaries and other individuals with influence  in the party.    What about Alfonso Guerra? Gonzalez confirmed that he has  proposed Guerra as deputy secretary general in the collective  leadership plan. This is the only name which he has revealed,  and he will reveal no more. He has not spoken with him -- they  both attend PSOE Federal Executive Committee meetings -- and is  in no hurry to do so, although he does not rule out the  possibility that they may meet privately before the congress.    Nor has he decided yet on the precise model for the  Executive  Committee. He is considering one out of three options: a very  small Executive Committee, a large Executive Committee with a  permanent secretariat, and a small Executive Committee with an  intermediate body -- with very strong territorial representation  -- with respect to the Federal Committee.    Whatever the model he decides on, Gonzalez guaranteed the  existence of a small and effective Executive Committee, as well  as some kind of territorial representation.  <H5>  First, Renewal </H5>   He believes the renewal of the PSOE can take place with  Guerra with the collective leadership, but, in turn, he made it  clear he is not prepared to sacrifice his aim of renewal to the  integration of all the tendencies which he seeks symbolically in  Guerra's presence.    In this connection, Gonzalez repeated the message he made  public at the Las Ventas rally in October 1992. He sets it as a  condition for his leadership of the PSOE that his renewal plan  not be questioned, and in this respect he will accept conditions  from neither side. Otherwise, he recalled his resignation at the  1979 congress, where he did not accept the majority theses.    Gonzalez asserted that he will not yield to pressure from  some PSOE regional secretaries to intervene in the precongress  process, because he wants the party grassroots to express their  opinions freely, and he is aware that his personal intervention  could influence the congress. He still reserves for himself the  role of arbitrator in the party, a task he has performed since  the Suresnes congress in 1974.    He acknowledged that his nonintervention policy and  conflicts  over the selection of lists could weaken the party.  Nevertheless, he did not exaggerate. He believes the internal  conflicts are due to a power struggle -- at the local level in  most cases -- but an alternative to the PSOE's national  blueprint is in no event being proposed within the party.    He does not believe the renewalist and Guerraist sectors can  be defined in terms of their greater or lesser support for the  Socialist government's activity. In this connection, he  believes this classification is superficial. To the same  effect, he stated he is not counting the results produced by the  votes in the various local associations.    The PSOE secretary general also guaranteed the use of  individual voting at the congress, better to reflect the  Socialist grassroots' wishes. Although he did not expatiate on  the matter, he intimated that the traditional procedure of  voting by delegation is inappropriate for the congress to  express the grassroots' wishes.  <H5>  Better Relations With Aznar </H5>   Gonzalez admitted he has had two meetings with [Italian  Popular Party Chairman] Aznar at the Moncloa Palace -- the  second at the end of December. They discussed the NATO summit,  which was to be held in the next few days, the reform of the  labor market, and the crisis at the Credit Bank of Spain.    The atmosphere of trust was greater at the second meeting  than at the first. Contacts will continue because Aznar  represents the votes of 8 million Spanish people and is a real  government alternative. Gonzalez stated that a regular  relationship is logical from the democratic viewpoint.    The autonomy model -- It is not identical for all  communities. There are distinctive features to be respected.    Convergence and Union's turnabout in autonomy --  He asserted that he will accept no territorial constraint when  negotiating with the Catalan nationalists, but emphasized that  he is determined to carry forward the impetus for autonomy  contained in the PSOE program.    Terrorism -- He will not change the strategic line  in the struggle against terrorism.    International cooperation, police pursuit, and the  Ajuria Enea pact -- He regards the proposal of Ramon  Jauregui and Mario Onaindia as a future possibility which does  not breach the Basque pact. In any event, an offer of dialogue  depends on a prior end to violence. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Government Will Stand by Labor Reform Despite Strike </H5>   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez asserted he will stand by the  plan for labor market reform regardless of the extent of the  general strike called by the trade unions for 27 January.    Gonzalez added that there will not be any cabinet reshuffle  as a result of the trade union mobilizations, and completely  ruled out considering an early election in the event of a  Socialist failure in the European elections and the Andalusian  autonomous community elections in June.    The head of government showed himself prepared to resume  dialogue on the reform of the labor market, provided that  employers and trade unions previously reach agreement and  contribute improvements to a plan which he deems essential for  creating jobs. He acknowledged that there could be some abuses  with the new forms of labor contract, but he immediately added  that it is much worse to offer no solutions to the economic  crisis.    In any event, he believes that Spain passed the worst point  in the economic crisis during the election, although the public  perception came later. He reaffirmed the expectations he  expressed during the election campaign, when he stated that by  May "we will no longer be talking about the crisis as we are  doing now." He emphasized that, despite its continued fall, the  unemployment rate is less than in October and November, but he  saw real emergence from an economic crisis, which he did not  hesitate to describe as simultaneously brief and intense, as  conditional upon Germany's pulling power.  <H5>  Crisis, Priority </H5>   Gonzalez emphasized that the government's priority is the  battle against the economic crisis, and other tasks are  subordinate to this aim.    In this connection, he stated that reforms such as the  reform  of the labor market fit into the social democratic blueprint,  because either it provides a permanently reformist response or  it cannot survive, as has happened with communism. By way of a  paradox, he emphasized that the trade unions held a strike in  1985 against the Pensions Law, and now they are calling another  strike in defense of that law's contents.    Gonzalez assessed favorably his relations with the Catalan  nationalists of CiU [Convergence and Union], and stated that  their entry into the government will not be raised again,  although, in his opinion, it would be the most stringent and  desirable thing.    He deemed the formula of a parliamentary pact of support for  the government sufficient to give the government stability, and  he made it clear that he will not support another round of  negotiations with the nationalists unless it is comprehensive  and serves the interests of all of Spain.</p>

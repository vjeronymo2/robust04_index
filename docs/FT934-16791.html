			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Government cuts school reports TEACHERS were yesterday offered deep cuts in the number of reports they must make to parents under the national curriculum as the government tried to persuade unions to abandon their boycott of school tests. Reactions from the three teachers' unions that boycotted the tests earlier this year were lukewarm. None were prepared to call off their action. There were, however, signs of disagreement. For 14-year-olds, teachers must now only report on six items of national curriculum assessment for each pupil, rather than 41, while for seven-year-olds, the number of items has been cut from 22 to 13. Schools would have to give each child's parents at least one written report a year, but its time of publication would be flexible. Pupils' results would be compared with the average for their year-group. Baroness Blatch, the education minister, called on teachers to end their boycott. The National Union of Teachers said Baroness Blatch 'appeared to have misunderstood the union's concerns'. It said: 'The tests continue to be educationally unsound. They may not match teacher assessments, which will result in misleading information being given to parents.' But the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, whose boycott is based on its complaint against excessive workload, welcomed the proposals. The union's executive meets at the end of this week and will consider the government's proposals 'very seriously'. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said the government had made a 'move in the right direction'. It would re-ballot members once it had evidence on the changes the government would make to workload.</p>

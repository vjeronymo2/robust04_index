			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Tan Fayu (6223 4099 3842) and Zhang Keqian </F> (1728 0344 0578)]    [Text] Marrakech (Morocco), 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Addressing  a ministerial conference of the Uruguay round of trade talks  held in Marrakech today, Chinese delegation Head Gu Yongjiang  pointed out: "The Uruguay round constitutes multilateral trade  talks on an unprecedented scale. It not only made promises on  wide-ranging market accession, but amplified and improved a  series of multilateral norms guiding world trade." A top  priority task now facing us is to conscientiously implement the  agreements reached during the Uruguay round. China is willing  to make its own contributions.    Reviewing the Uruguay round of talks, he emphatically  pointed  out: The vast number of developing countries "took a  comprehensive part in the talks, played a positive role, made  important contributions, and adopted extensive measures for  trade liberalization to expand international trade." The  Chinese Government hopes that, under the new world trade system,  the developing countries "will have more adequate and equal  opportunities for participation, and their interests will be  practically reflected on the basis of special and preferential  treatment."    Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into GATT," Gu  Yongjiang pointed out: China has conducted talks on its  "reentry into GATT" for eight years. Meanwhile, to meet GATT's  requirements and effectively fulfill its obligations, "China has  continuously reformed its economic and trade systems, achieved  success acknowledged worldwide, and provided rapidly increasing  opportunities for foreign products and services to enter into  its market."    Concerning the World Trade Organization [WTO] to be  established soon, Gu Yongjiang pointed out: "The establishment  of the WTO signals the progress of multilateral world trade to a  new phase of development." He further pointed out: "The body  should be a world trade organization worthy of its name; it  should have more representatives from all over the world than  GATT has." He continued: "Only by attracting countries and  regions with different economic characteristics and different  levels of economic development to participate in the body" can  the WTO guarantee the "effective operation" of its established  multilateral trade system and "maintain its long-term growth and  vitality."    Finally, the head of the Chinese delegation emphatically  pointed out: China has clearly and definitely requested  becoming a founding member of the WTO. China's "reentry into  GATT" and its becoming a member of the WTO "will be conducive to  the establishment of a more open foreign trade system in China."  He said: "With an economy that is enjoying vigorous  development, an open market boasting a population of 1.2  billion, and being ranked 11th in world trade, China as a  founding member of the WTO will undoubtedly enhance the  universality and importance of the organization; and undoubtedly  make important contributions to the prosperity of the world  economy and growth of world trade."    More than 40 delegation leaders took the floor at the  conference yesterday afternoon and this morning. They all  affirmed the results of the Uruguay round of talks, and hoped to  further solve the problems existing in world trade and to  improve the international trade system.</p>

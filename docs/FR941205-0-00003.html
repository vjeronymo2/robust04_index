			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This course of action is necessary so that OPM may utilize its resources in the most effective way and in a manner most beneficial to enrollees. It is in the best interest of enrollees that OPM ensure that FEHB Program contracts are administered so that benefits to enrollees are optimum and the costs to enrollees and the FEHB Program are minimized. OPM shares the concern of the Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) about contract administration under the FEHB Program. In order to improve standards and oversight of insurance carriers and enhance our overall program operations to improve service to OPM's customers, additional emphasis needs to be placed on functions that, of necessity, are given lower priority when staff are occupied with applications, negotiations, and open season materials review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1995, OPM will redirect resources to projects designed to address weaknesses in the oversight of contractor performance as well as improve communication with FEHB enrollees to ensure that we and our participating carriers are meeting their needs. In future years, we will prioritize functions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While OPM is not required to issue regulations that clarify existing policy, we understand that there is interest in this issue, and we wish to give all parties an opportunity to comment. We are publishing the regulation at this time before interested HMOs begin the time-consuming application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. The interim regulations simply clarify OPM's policy under which it invites applications from HMO's interested in participating in the FEHB Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed by OMB in accordance with E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affect OPM's administrative procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Health facilities, Health insurance, Health professions, Hostages, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Retirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Personnel Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James B.

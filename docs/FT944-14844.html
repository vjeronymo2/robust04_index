			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK and US warn Iraqi regime The US and Britain formally warned Iraq last night that any further threat to Kuwait through troop movements beyond the 32nd parallel would be met by force. The two powers acted, in demarches by their UN ambassadors, in a follow-up to last weekend's Security Council resolution demanding complete withdrawal of troops Iraq deployed in setting off the recent crisis. Diplomats said France was expected to issue a parallel warning but probably not threaten a specific military res-ponse, since it had not interpreted the resolution as auth-orising a further use of force. The US and Britain told Iraq's UN delegate they were ready to 'respond appropriately and decisively' to any new threat.</p>

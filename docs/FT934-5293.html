			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses find few incentives in thin day's trading Senior bourses in continental Europe showed little impetus yesterday, with thin trading seen in most centres, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT moved in a narrow range throughout the session, before closing just 3.81 points lower in the DAX index at 2,043.43. Opinion suggests that the Bundesbank will make no move to cut interest rates at this Thursday's regular meeting, therefore giving little incentive to the market. Thyssen, the steel group, which is expected to release figures this week lost DM1.50 to DM232.50 in anticipation. Varta shed more than 6 per cent on news that the battery manufacturer was to cut its dividend. The shares lost DM20.70 to DM315.00. PARIS weakened very slightly with the CAC-40 index losing 1.32 to 2,119.30, having moved in a range between 2,125 and 2,105. Oil stocks came under pressure after it was reported that one US broker was placing the European oil sector under review: Elf Aquitaine lost FFr8.10 to FFr416.70 and Total FFr11.00 to FFr303.20. LVMH went against the trend, rising FFr21 top FFr3,751 on news that it was extending its interests in the publishing sector. MILAN edged higher in thin volume, the Comit index adding 2.37 to 543.89. Ferruzzi Finanziaria, however put in a strong showing, gaining L1,374 or 4.6 per cent to L31,253 after a weekend report that foreign creditor banks were coming round to approval of a rescue plan for the group. Its agro-industrial and chemicals subsidiary Montedison was up L13.30 to L761.60 . Montedison savings shares gained L15.30 to L556.50 and Ferruzzi savings shares added L29.60 to L476.40. Shareholders meetings scheduled for later this week have the rescue plan on their agendas. Among heavily traded blue chips Fiat was down L19 to L3,842, while Sip overcame an early deficit to finish L21 higher at L3,096 and Stet rose L22 to L3,578. ZURICH continued its consolidation although the strength of the Swiss franc, on the back of last week's good inflation figures, continued to support expectations of lower interest rates. The SMI index eased 3.7 to 2,738.2. Ciba, topping the actives list, saw the registered share rise SFr15 to SFr784 on buying by a small bank. Foreign selling left Nestle SFr13 lower at SFr1,169. CS Holding bearers added SFr10 to SFr3,550 and Elektrowatt rose SFr10 to SFr3,600 , still benefiting from last week's rumours that CS Holding may sell its 47 per cent Elektrowatt stake. Ems-Chemie bearers shed SFr20 to SFr3,980: Pharma Vision, SFr50 higher at SFr3,980, said on Friday it had sold its entire holding. AMSTERDAM found little excitement and the CBS Tendency index slipped just 0.7 to 136.1. Royal Dutch remained in investors' minds, falling back Fl 2.50 to Fl 191.20, while KLM went in the opposite direction, up Fl 1.70 to Fl 41.60 helped by the prospect of lower costs for fuel. STOCKHOLM saw further weakness in Volvo B shares, down SKr16 at SKr391, as investors began to accept that the merger with Renault of France would go ahead. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 20.80 to 1,291.80. Ericsson B's fell a further SKr5 to SKr338. OSLO was unsettled by weakness in the oil price as the All share index lost 11.25 or 1.9 per cent to 567.6. Turnover was NKr296m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr2.50 to NKr210 and Saga Petroleum NKr3.5 to NKr72.5. BRUSSELS edged lower in quiet trade which was disrupted for the last half-hour due to technical problems with electronic trading system. The Bel-20 index fell 4.88 to 1,387.29 although sentiment was said to be still fairly positive because of optimism there would be interest rate cuts soon. MADRID was weighed down by losses in the banking sector, weakness in futures and profit taking among electrical stocks. The General index shed 2.37 to 295.54. Bank Santander shed Pta190 or 2.9 per cent to Pta6,220 and Banco Central Hispano shed Pta85 to Pta3,220. ISTANBUL broke another record following the government's reaffirmation of its privatisation programme. The composite index added 1,000.00 or nearly 6 per cent to 18,426.1. ATHENS gained ground on optimistic expectations over today's budget. The general index rose 2.4 per cent to 862.13 in turnover estimated at DKr3.7bn.

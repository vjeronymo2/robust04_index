			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: On a proud Scots note Sir, The final burning of banknotes at The Royal Bank of Scotland was a cheerful acknowledgement of a colourful tradition. Yes, Scottish bankers are proud of the innovations they have passed on to their southern counterparts. You modestly reduced these, perhaps in the interests of space, to three. We could have added overdrafts, branches, coloured banknotes, two-sided printing of banknotes and mobile banks - while we wait to see which bank will join us in cross-border European payments, photos on plastic cards and, come December, commemorative banknotes. Don't begrudge us that true passion of the Scots banker - looking backward with pride and looking forward with imagination. Alwyn James, chief press officer, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Marketing Group, St Andrew Square, Edinburgh EH2 2YE.</p>

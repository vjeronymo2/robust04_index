Mr Howard Davies, the Confederation of British Industry's director-general, has written to Mr Clarke calling for a review of the way new taxes are drafted and enacted. He is joined by the British Chambers of Commerce. Mr Davies says 'the massive length and the drafting complexity' of this year's bill highlights the inadequacies of existing procedures. 'We are not complaining about the government's need to close tax loopholes which permit abuses of the system,' Mr Davies says. 'But the regulatory burden imposed by a bill of this magnitude hits the innocent as well as the guilty and its complexity imposes additional costs on hard-pressed firms whose managers' time would be better spent on more productive work.' The Treasury rejected the CBI's criticisms. 'The bill introduced legislation which was believed to be necessary to help business and bring about a sustainable recovery,' it said. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'We understand the need for a unified Budget but things have got out of hand when no businessman has a chance of understanding the tax system. Ironically, we have a 244-clause finance bill published within days of the de-regulation bill.'</p>

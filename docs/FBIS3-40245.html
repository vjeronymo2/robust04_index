			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] All three governments in Yugoslavia -- the federal  and the two republican ones -- and the governments of the Srpska  republic [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina have embraced  the program of economic recovery and opted for a unified concept  in Banja Luka. All conditions have been met to put the new  dinar into circulation in these countries. This is what FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Deputy Prime Minister Jovan  Zebic stated to our Banja Luka correspondent Branislav Bozic:    [Begin recording] [Zebic] The fundamental task stemming from  the joint agreement in Banja Luka -- where representatives of  the governments of the Srpska republic, the republic of Serbian  Krajina, and Yugoslavia were present -- was to agree upon the  manner in which the 1994 economic policy would be conducted, as  well as the implementation of a new program that would involve  the reconstruction of the monetary system and the maintenance of  a healthy fiscal policy on an entirely new basis. The  introduction of an economic policy to curb hyperinflation, or  rather halt it, and, similarly to a stable dinar, facilitate  normal conditions for work and an increase in production were  also to be discussed.    [Bozovic] Can you tell us anything more concrete -- for  example, will the new dinar be recognized in these territories?    [Zebic] Since all three governments in the FRY and, as I was  informed last night, the two governments in the Serbian  republics have accepted the program and opted for this unified  concept, all conditions have been created to put the new dinar  into circulation throughout the entire territory and, therefore,  in the Serbian republics as well.    [Bozovic] What about payment methods?    [Zebic] For the time being, the payment methods are  synchronized and maximally coordinated, and we intend to proceed  as we have so far. There is a novelty thought here -- namely  that payment operations will be done in old and new dinars.    [Bozic] Therefore, all in all, you can say that the economy  in all the Serbian lands will function on equal conditions?    [Zebic] We are trying, and we believe that with this reform,  we are safeguarding this goal -- that is, that the entire  production in all Serbian lands functions under equal  circumstances and that the new convertible dinar be equally  significant for the Serbian republics and be present here as  well. Naturally, this carries certain conditions with it -- for  instance, it must be fully backed either in convertible currency  or in gold. [end recording]</p>

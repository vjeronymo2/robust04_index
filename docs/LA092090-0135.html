			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOE ASSAILS REP. ANDERSON ON BANK ACTION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SANFORD KAHN SAYS A TELEPHONE CALL TO REGULATORS ON BEHALF OF A BANK  WHOSE ORGANIZERS INCLUDE ANDERSON'S WIFE WAS 'MORALLY WRONG.' THE CONGRESSMAN  DENIES ANY IMPROPRIETY.  </P> <P> Rep. Glenn M. Anderson's opponent in the Nov. 6 election is charging that the  11-term congressman improperly intervened in the chartering of a national bank  whose organizers included Lee Anderson, the lawmaker's wife.  </P> <P> Anderson (D-San Pedro) denies that he acted improperly.  </P> <P> At issue is a telephone call the congressman or an aide placed to the federal  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency shortly after the agency, in early  1986, rejected an application by organizers of the Rancho Dominguez Bank of  Carson for a federal charter.  </P> <P> The organizers submitted a revised application in October, 1986, and won  approval from the comptroller's office in January, 1987, agency records show.  The bank opened for business on March 31, 1989, with Lee Anderson as chairman  of the board.  </P> <P> "Anderson was intervening on his wife's behalf, and, hey, that's not right,"  Republican Sanford Kahn said. "I do not know whether this violates the law . .  . but it's morally wrong."  </P> <P> Kahn is making his second bid to unseat Anderson in the 32nd Congressional  District, which includes Lakewood, parts of Long Beach, Hawaiian Gardens,  Bellflower, Downey, San Pedro and Lomita.  </P> <P> Rep. Anderson acknowledged that a telephone call from his office was made to  the comptroller's office but he denied any impropriety.  </P> <P> "We get lots of calls from people who have problems with government agencies .  . and we often call the federal agencies and see what the situation is,"  Anderson said. "I wouldn't have done it if I had thought it was improper."  </P> <P> Anderson said he does not remember whether he or an aide made the call, when it  occurred or the name of the official contacted.  </P> <P> An official with the comptroller's office said last week that his agency  received a telephone call from Anderson's office about the bank charter  application, but he could not determine the exact date or content of the call,  or whether it was made directly by the congressman. Another official said  Anderson's call had no influence on the agency's handling of the application.  </P> <P> Lee Anderson said last week that her husband, at her urging, contacted the  comptroller's office -- but only, she said, to ask when the agency would  respond to an inquiry by her group about its efforts to secure a charter.  </P> <P> "He gets these kinds of responses constantly for constituents," she said. "It  just so happens that he's married to this one. If (Kahn) is making a case of  this, then he could make a case of every time a congressman picks up the  phone."  </P> <P> Two current Rancho Dominguez directors interviewed last week supported Lee  Anderson's account. But two other participants in the bank's formation said  they were led by Lee Anderson to believe that the congressman's efforts on  behalf of the bank went beyond a mere inquiry.  </P> <P> The Andersons own more than $250,000 worth of stock in Rancho Dominguez,  according to a joint 1989 financial disclosure statement Rep. Anderson filed  with the federal government. Bank records show that when the institution  opened, Lee Anderson was one of the bank's largest shareholders, with 9.61% of  its stock. She receives no salary as chairman, said Melinda Briggs, the bank's  acting president.  </P> <P> Rancho Dominguez organizers first applied to form a national bank on Aug. 6,  1985, according to the comptroller's office. The application was turned down  April 1, 1986.  </P> <P> The rejection cited "weaknesses in the market analysis and operating plan" as  the primary reasons for denial.  </P> <P> Among deficiencies listed by the agency were outdated information on economic  activity in the Carson area, overly optimistic income and expense projections,  and a lack of details on how the bank would attract customers.  </P> <P> Bank organizers then wrote the comptroller's office on April 25, 1986,  addressing the deficiencies, but they did not get what they considered a timely  reply, correspondence shows.  </P> <P> The step taken next -- Anderson's call to the comptroller's office -- is what  has prompted Kahn's charge.  </P> <P> Frank De Santis, then the official spokesman for the Rancho Dominguez group and  now a director of the bank, made specific mention of Anderson's call in a July  24, 1986, letter to the comptroller's office.  </P> <P> Addressed to Ballard Gilmore, director of the bank organization and structure  division in Washington, the letter refers to Anderson's attempt to find out  when the group's April 25 letter would be answered.  </P> <P> "Congressman Glenn Anderson spoke with you regarding the timing of a response  to our transmittal dated April 25, 1986," De Santis' letter says. "He indicated  that your office would have a response by June 27, 1986."  </P> <P> Ultimately, Rancho Dominguez organizers met with officials in the comptroller's  San Francisco office in August, 1986, to discuss getting their charter efforts  back on track. Two months later, the group reapplied for a charter.  </P> <P> At issue is whether Anderson did more for the bank group than he would have  done for other constituents in his district.  </P> <P> House rules permit members to contact federal agencies on behalf of  constituents to express their opinion on an issue, request information and  status reports, and urge prompt consideration, among other purposes, according  to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.  </P> <P> But the committee has said the service should be made available to all  "constituents equally and should be pursued with diligence irrespective of  political or other considerations."  </P> <P> "That means that as a representative, you've got to represent constituents,"  said David Eppler, an attorney for Public Citizen's Congress Watch, a lobbying  group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. "But you can't do special  favors for special constituents like campaign contributors or relatives. You've  got to do the same for everybody."  </P> <P> Anderson said the call to the comptroller's office was the same type of service  that his office would provide any constituent. He portrayed Kahn's allegation  as an ill-fated attempt to find a political issue.  </P> <P> Said Anderson: "If this is what his campaign platform will be, it's kind of  weak."  </P> <P> Participants in the formation of Rancho Dominguez Bank disagree on whether  Anderson made a special effort on behalf of his wife's group.  </P> <P> De Santis said the congressman merely helped to obtain a reply from a federal  agency that had turned a deaf ear to the Rancho Dominguez group.  </P> <P> "It was an appeal," De Santis said. "We were left out to dry. We didn't hear  (from the comptroller's office), and our operational costs were going on every  month."  </P> <P> Said Lee Anderson: "In frustration, I said (to Rep. Anderson): 'Do you know  anyone?' He said he'd make a call and found out that we would hear from them  shortly. I think that's all that was done."  </P> <P> Wesley Kirchoff, who served on an interim board of directors for the bank while  the institution was being formed, said that, based on remarks Lee Anderson made  after the charter rejection, he believes that Anderson's involvement was more  extensive than a single, neutral telephone call.  </P> <P> "The directors were told by Lee that she had asked Glenn to intervene to see if  he could expedite the approval," Kirchoff said.  </P> <P> Another man who served on the interim board but who declined to be identified  by name, said he got the impression from Lee Anderson that the congressman "was  quite influential in the whole cotton-picking thing. He had more than a passing  involvement."  </P> <P> Dean DeBuck, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the banking group won  approval for its second application because it solved the problems that  prompted the rejection a year earlier.  </P> <P> "They did what should have been done the first time," he said.  </P> <P> Kahn said that even if Anderson's role was limited to a single inquiry, as the  congressman and his wife assert, the call was still improper because he made it  on behalf of an investment group that included his spouse.  </P> <P> The Republican, who lost to Anderson in the 1988 general election by a margin  of more than 2 to 1, said he will use the case to illustrate a key plank in his  campaign platform -- that long-term incumbency leads to abuse of power.  </P> <P> "When his wife is involved, he should say, 'Hands off,' " Kahn said. "Judges  recuse themselves when they are dealing with a case in which they have a  personal involvement. . . . It's sort of like a web. You've got to draw a line  somewhere."  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Sowing seeds of regeneration - Roland Adburgham on funding for companies in areas that have lost their traditional coal and steel jobs Nestling beneath Castell Coch, a 19th-century fantasy castle in south Wales, is the regional base of British Coal Enterprise. A few miles away, in Cardiff docklands, is the regional office for British Steel (Industry). The location of both these job-creation arms of the two industries has symbolism. Castell Coch was built by the Marquess of Bute with fortunes made from the coal of the Welsh valleys, where deep-mining has almost ended. BS(I) is housed at what was East Moors steelworks, which closed in 1978 with the loss of nearly 6,000 jobs. Both organisations seek to stimulate regeneration by encouraging businesses to grow within the local communities. They provide funding to enterprises which find it hard to obtain risk capital elsewhere, at least at such favourable interest rates. Both also offer managed workspace with easy lease terms. Today, BCE's future is in the balance with the privatisation of its state-owned parent British Coal. A government announcement was due before the end of November but last week Charles Wardle, junior energy minister, said: 'The government and British Coal are currently exploring options for the services provided by BCE and no final decision has been taken.' BCE was established 10 years ago and BS(I) nearly 20 years ago to offset job losses in coal and steel communities. Their futures could be finite because the industry restructurings for which they were set up are largely completed. Yet there is still a need for such services. In the Welsh valleys, there are pockets of male unemployment of 30 per cent, and in Scotland BS(I) is still tackling the effects of the Ravenscraig closure. To justify a future, the organisations must demonstrate that they have a cost-effective impact on permanent job creation. Nigel Guy, director of 3i venture capital group in Wales, says that as BCE and BS(I) are not fully commercial animals  - having a social responsibility role  - they cannot be judged solely by private-sector standards. 'But at the smaller end, they have done quite a reasonable job. They have provided real seedcorn capital for businesses and a number have gone on to larger things.' Tillery Valley Foods was set up 10 years ago by husband and wife Chris and Hilary Bradshaw to make quality chilled and frozen food at Abertillery, in the Welsh valleys. The Bradshaws financed the start-up with Pounds 60,000 made from selling their Thames Valley house. BS(I) provided a similar amount in preference shares and loans, subsequently redeemed and repaid. Two years ago, 3i invested in the company by taking a 10 per cent stake. 'BS(I) were sympathetic backers and saw us through the lean first five years when we could have gone bust,' Bradshaw says. 'This year, we should make a profit of over Pounds 1m. We have always exceeded our job creation forecasts and now employ 180 people.' While this may be an exceptional success, BS(I) has been a self-financing subsidiary of British Steel even before the latter's privatisation in 1988. BCE, however, receives Pounds 7m a year from its parent, with which it also has a Pounds 10m a year contract to deliver retraining and outplacement services for ex-miners. It has also built up consultancy work for other companies in the UK and abroad. For the government, this makes its future more complex to determine. BCE, which has a staff of 90 seconded from British Coal and an-other 400 on short-term contracts, does not seek to profit on its business funding because of the risk and low margins. It will make unsecured loans up to Pounds 25,000 on five-year terms. But it can lend much more in loans or equity. This summer it invested Pounds 250,000 in Techboard, a hardboard factory at Ebbw Vale. In common with BS(I), it is not simply filling what is seen as an equity gap. 'With every investment client, we offer a business support service  - a dual role to police the investment and also to try to help if there is a problem,' says Jonathan Thomas, BCE's business funding manager in south Wales. 'Sixty-six per cent are still trading five years on.' He adds: 'One of the myths we have to overcome is that BCE is just for ex-miners  - they are very much in a minority.' David Hughes, BS(I) regional manager for Wales, says: 'We feel comfortable lending in the Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 75,000 range. We're looking for companies to grow irrespective of the starting point. If it is likely to stay a one-man business, we wouldn't be interested.' The organisations stress they act in partnership with other agencies and it is businesses which create jobs. BCE says it achieved a milestone of 100,000 'employment opportunities' in 1993-94, which Philip Andrew, chief executive, described as the 'most successful year' in its history. BS(I) says it has had a similar number of 'job commitments'. Although BS(I), which has a staff of only 36, lost Pounds 1.2m in its last financial year, Vernon Smith, its chief executive, says: 'There is no pressure from British Steel plc to try to cause us to be more profitable. The aims of BS(I) are not in essence profit-making. Having said that, I still have to run this operation as a business.' Both organisations are putting more emphasis on supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises rather than start-ups. Smith explains: 'We realise that it's probably better to help the small business that actually operates. If you back those, then you're backing someone who has a very good chance. 'Over the last six years our failure rate has been 25 per cent of the capital we have put up. Venture capitalists think of that as a fair figure. Last year our losses in relation to capital were 16.9 per cent. We were delighted  - we're obviously past the worst of the recession.'</p>

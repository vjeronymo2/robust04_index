			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken urges the Department to release detailed computer printouts of the final results of review as the limited information released in the preliminary results is insufficient to permit the parties to identify all errors in the computer printout. Since the Department has consistently refused to release ``pre-final'' calculations for review by the parties, Timken contends that the final output often provides the only indication of clerical errors in the Department's analysis. Therefore, at a minimum, Timken believes the Department should release a representative sample of major datasets ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 500 observations for each annual period).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK agrees with Timken that the Department should release detailed computer printouts of its final analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK also suggests that the Department consider releasing the printouts in advance of issuance of the final results, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to expeditiously identify and correct any clerical errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo supports Timken's request for pre-disclosure of the final results in this case due to the very complex nature of the preliminary margin analysis and the number of clerical errors identified in the preliminary results computer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with Koyo and NSK. The issuance of pre-final programs and printouts would only serve to delay the final results of these reviews. We believe that Koyo has misinterpreted Timken's comments regarding release of the ``pre-final'' calculations. In fact, Timken states that the Department's past consistency in refusing to release pre-final results makes a detailed release of the final margin program even more important. We agree with Timken in principle, and intend to provide the parties to this proceeding with a representative sample of the major datasets needed to identify any clerical errors in the computer programs, if they request disclosure after issuance of the final results to identify and comment on any clerical errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Regarding Terminations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mazda states its concern over the Department's refusal to terminate the review of Sumitomo Corp. with respect to Mazda transactions. Mazda notes that in Timken's agreement to withdraw its request to review Mazda, Timken consented to the termination of the review with regard to resale transactions to Mazda's subsidiaries through Sumitomo Corp. Mazda states its interest in this proceeding is to retain its zero margin rate for all U.S. entries of Mazda replacement-part TRBs, without regard to whether such TRBs are imported directly from Mazda or indirectly from Mazda through resales by Sumitomo Corp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mazda suggests three alternative proposals: (1) partial termination of the review of those sales through Sumitomo which both originate and end with Mazda; (2) termination of the review with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp.; or (3) termination of the review with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda and instructions to Customs to liquidate all TRBs sold by Mazda for export to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp. Mazda contends that any of the three alternatives would leave Sumitomo Corp. in the review while clarifying the Department's intent to have all of Mazda's export sales of TRBs to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp. as a reshipper, treated as exports by Mazda. Mazda maintains that such treatment is consistent with both Mazda's and Timken's request to terminate the review, as well as consistent with current and past treatment by Customs of Mazda's exports to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sumitomo Corp. maintains that it is not the importer of record, and therefore has no liability for antidumping duties. Further, by terminating the review of Mazda, the Department will effectively terminate the review of Sumitomo Corp. with respect to Mazda's exports during the POR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken reaffirms its agreement to the termination of the 1985/86 review with respect to Mazda and, of the three alternatives proposed by Mazda, prefers the third, namely, the termination of the review with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda, with a clarification to Customs of the Department's intent that Mazda's exporter rate should be applied to all TRBs sold by Mazda for export to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

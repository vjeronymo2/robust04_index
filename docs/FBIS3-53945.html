After the meeting, Hambley announced that the heads of the  Arab and Israeli delegations will meet on 24 January to make  preparations for a new round of talks. No specific date for the  beginning of the talks has yet been set.    Hambley noted the positive atmosphere created by the  U.S.-Syrian summit and said he hopes that progress will be made  on the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks.    In answer to a question, the U.S. ambassador said the  withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanese territory is one of  the most important tenets of U.S. policy in Lebanon, which  endorses the substance of UN Security Council Resolution 425.</p>

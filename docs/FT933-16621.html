			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Shamrock on bumpy flight path / A look at the proposed rescue package for Aer Lingus THE CORPORATE rescue plan for Aer Lingus, Ireland's state airline, still lanquishes in a government in-tray two weeks after Mr Bernie Cahill, executive chairman, presented it for cabinet approval with a warning that urgent and drastic action was needed if the airline was to survive. The airline is losing money faster than a Jumbo jet burns aviation fuel  - IPounds 120 a minute, IPounds 1.2m per week - and its bankers have threatened to shut off the financial fuel taps next month unless a restructuring plan is rapidly put in place. The core of Mr Cahill's plan, drawn up with Mr Peter Owen, the chief executive who was a former senior executive of British Airways during its preparation for privatisation, is to cut operating costs of the air transport division by some 10 per cent, or IPounds 50m (Pounds 48m) annually, to radically overhaul working practices and to scrap the controversial Shannon stopover to allow direct flights between Dublin and the US. A one-off IPounds 175m cash injection from the government is being sought. About 70 per cent of the savings would be achieved through payroll cuts involving 1,280 redundancies from the airline's 5,500 staff employed worldwide. The remainder would be achieved through improved operational efficiencies. Not surprisingly, the government has been faced with intense lobbying to drastically modify the plan. Pressure has come mostly from trade unions and supporters in the west of Ireland of the Shannon stopover, although backbench unease within the two coalition parties in government has also spilled into the open, as electoral promises made last year - especially by the Labour party - will be blatantly broken if the plan goes through as it stands. Significantly, Mr Cahill stepped outside of his brief in recommending an end to the Shannon stopover, and has made no apologies for doing so. He told trade union representatives last weekend that the airline would be unlikely to survive without the change, as 65 per cent of Dublin-US traffic was now being routed via the UK and being lost to Aer Lingus. Will the plan be sufficient to turn the airline around? Its critics argue that by opening up Dublin to direct flights to the US, reciprocal arrangements will have to be offered to stronger competitors who will be able to undercut Aer Lingus. The novel aspect of Mr Cahill's proposal is that the Shannon stopover would be modified rather than totally abandoned. Instead of being based at Dublin, the airline's Boeing 747 fleet would in future turn round at Shannon, but make a stopover at Dublin. Direct flights to the US from Dublin could thereby be offered, which would link up with feeder flights from the airline's European network. That was expected to be more attractive to business travellers which the airline desperately needs to attract to boost the average fare obtained for each seat sold, and to win back passengers who have deserted Aer Lingus to UK hubs. The catch for the transatlantic competition is that they could be offered reciprocal direct-flight arrangements to Dublin as long as they also serve Shannon like Aer Lingus. What Aer Lingus does not yet appear to have worked out though is whether such an obligation could be enforced under existing bilateral aviation agreements with the US, or indeed whether it would be possible to maintain in the climate of EC deregulation of the airways. The company has no answer to this at present. Another key element to the rescue plan is the reorganisation of the European network with the creation of an 'Aer Lingus express' division which would offer a cut-rate, no-frills service on certain routes which face intense competition such as Dublin-London. About 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' passengers travel this route, but each one is losing the airline money at present due to stiff competition from Ryanair and British Midland. Aer Lingus said: 'We want to create a price-driven operation to be able to react to challenges in an opportunistic way. If we get our cost-base right we can compete, and we might even expand routes rather than contract them. Price wars are a fact of life.' Strategic alliances with other airlines are also under serious consideration 'once we are in a stronger financial position,' the company said. A gradual disposal of non-core assets such as the Copthorne Hotel group would play a vital part in reducing the IPounds 550m debt burden and interest payments which were currently running at close to IPounds 60m per year. Aer Lingus's survival as an independent airline thus hinges on some speedy, but politically difficult, decisions to be made by the government. For most Irish people the disappearance of the 'shamrock-in-the-sky' would be unthinkable, but if Mr Cahill and Mr Owen have done their sums correctly that could indeed be the outcome if their plan is now rejected or substantially modified for reasons of political expediency.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                      AER LINGUS Pre-tax profits (losses)   year-end March (Ipoundsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                            88-89   89-90   90-91   91-92   92-93 Air transport division       2.8   (9.3)  (19.6)    (8.8)    (47) Group                       40.1    39.1     6.6    (3.1)   (173)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Aer Lingus  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / China steps down the path of securities regulation: Simon Holberton finds the Beijing government responding at last to the needs of disaffected investors SPURRED on by riots this summer by 1m disaffected investors in the Shenzen stock exchange the Chinese government appears ready to promulgate national laws governing securities trading. According to central bank officials and diplomats in Beijing, China could, by the end of this year, have set up a national securities regulatory regime. To date, the stock markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai are regulated by local authorities. According to an official, responsibilities for securities markets will be transferred from the People's Bank, China's central bank, to a Securities Commission and a Securities Supervisory Committee to be established under the State Council, or cabinet, later this year. The People's Bank will, however, supply the officials to run at least one of the bodies to be established, he indicated. The reason why two are needed is unclear, but it could reflect battles over turf between competing bureaucratic interests, diplomats say. They note that 10 government agencies and ministries have a finger in the pie of securities market supervision. The establishment of regulatory bodies, will, however, give China the semblance, at least, of national control and regulation of stock markets. This might lessen the concerns of some foreign investors who have shied away from its stock markets for lack of regulation and given those who have taken the plunge added confidence. Foreign interest in China's fledgling stock markets is growing. At the latest count, western merchant banks have raised more than Dollars 1bn to invest in shares listed on Shenzhen or Shanghai. This represents about 13 per cent of the current market capitalisation of both bourses of about Dollars 7.6bn. But, for the wary, the lack of acceptable accounting standards and a regulatory framework which offers protection to minority shareholders - which foreigners by law are - has made many suspicious of investing. The law in China is disorganised. The National People's Congress, a fairly tame parliament, passes laws; the State Council issues 'decisions;' and government departments and agencies promulgate regulations. All have the force of law, but their administration is capricious - Communist party officials are wont to dabble - and their means of interpretation are far from clear. All this leads to an opaqueness in decision-making. One western diplomat, talking about the way companies are chosen for listing, observed: 'Often it appears to have much to do with the strength of a company's political connections as it does with the intrinsic nature of the businesses.' But whatever Beijing does to bring its regulation in line with international standards, it will not follow the western model of share ownership completely. According to the People's Bank official, laws in the pipeline provide for four classes of shareholder: corporate, worker, local private and international. Percentages each may own could be prescribed. China is also unlikely to license the operation of other stock markets in the immediate future. Instead, Beijing has authorised the establishment of three national securities houses to be headquartered in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. They will able to open branches in the country's main towns and cities, thereby allowing local investors a venue to buy and sell stocks. Furthermore, according to current plans, companies not resident in Shanghai and Shenzhen will be encouraged to list on either exchange. Their avenue to do so will be through one of the national securities houses, which will be controlled by a bank. As for the lottery system of share distribution, it is likely to stay. Flawed as it is, officials in the central government see no better way of distributing company shares.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: INJURY LEADS OKURA TO HER FUTURE CAREER  </P> <P> When doctors talk about performing major reconstructive knee surgery, most  athletes begin to think their sports careers could be over.  </P> <P> But for Kristen Okura, a Saddleback College basketball player, such surgery  turned into on-the-job training for her future career.  </P> <P> Okura, a 5-foot-10 forward, had once considered becoming a lawyer. But because  of the work she put into coming back from her knee injury, she is now  interested in physical therapy.  </P> <P> She hurt her right knee in a scramble for a loose ball in a game at Riverside  last January. Okura, from Mission Viejo High School, was expected back within a  couple of weeks. But after the swelling went down, it was clear the extent of  the damage called for an operation. She would not play again that season.  </P> <P> With Okura, who averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds, in the lineup, Saddleback  was 10-8. Without her, the Gauchos went 3-8.  </P> <P> After surgery, Okura hobbled into her second-semester classes on crutches.  Among her classes for the spring semester was one in sports medicine.  </P> <P> "There I was the first day, the perfect model for when we studied the knee,"  she said.  </P> <P> Okura also spent a lot of time that semester at a rehabilitation center near  campus, where she now has a part-time job.  </P> <P> "That's what I'm going to aim for now," Okura said of a career in athletic  injuries. "There are a lot of different things I can work on."  </P> <P> Right now, her favorite project is herself.  </P> <P> Okura spends more than an hour getting her legs (her left knee also bothers  her) and two fingers taped before practices and games.  </P> <P> She has learned to tape herself in case the home team doesn't have a trainer  present when Saddleback is on the road.  </P> <P> "They (the Saddleback trainers) say that I'm using up all their tape," she  said.  </P> <P> Before her injury, Okura led Saddleback in scoring and rebounding last season.  This season she is again near the top and Saddleback is 8-3. Okura is averaging  nine points and seven rebounds despite jammed fingers and soreness in both  knees.  </P> <P> Though she has bounced back from surgery sooner than expected, she isn't  pleased with her play this season.  </P> <P> "I've been frustrated this season at times," Okura said. "I still don't think  my rhythm is back, but I'm getting better. The injury taught me patience, which  is not my middle name. It wasn't in my vocabulary."  </P> <P> The Golden West women's basketball team is off to another good start this  season. The defending state champion Rustlers are 12-1.  </P> <P> Golden West won its sixth in a row Saturday -- a 70-58 victory over Cuesta in  the championship game of the Cuesta tournament. Golden West started sluggishly  in the title game and trailed, 20-16, with about five minutes left in the first  half. The Rustlers then scored 16 consecutive points and lead at halftime,  34-22.  </P> <P> It was also the sixth consecutive time Golden West has won this tournament.  Bits Sirchia, a sophomore guard from Golden West, was selected the tournament's  most valuable player. This season, Golden West also has won its tournament and  finished third in the College of the Sequoias tournament.  </P> <P> However, the Rustlers should find stiffer competition once the Orange Empire  Conference season begins Jan. 3. Fullerton (10-2), Saddleback (8-3) and Orange  Coast (9-5) are playing well, and Rancho Santiago (5-9) and Cypress (1-11) have  struggled.  </P> <P> Cypress (9-5) is the only men's basketball team in a tournament this week. The  Chargers play Snow College of Utah on Thursday in the first round of the Dixie  tournament in St. George, Utah.  </P> <P> The tournament concludes Saturday.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago (13-1) won the annual Pasadena tournament for the second  consecutive year Friday. The Dons, who are the top-ranked team in the state,  defeated Ventura, 78-66, in the title game.  </P></p>

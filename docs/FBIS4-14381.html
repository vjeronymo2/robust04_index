			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Izzat Daraghmah] </F>   [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- In the first Palestinian reaction  to the agreement between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], Fatah Central Committee member 'Abbas Zaki said that  this agreement affirms the futility of betting on Palestinian  division and weakness. The agreement will lead to a unified and  good performance that will enable us to look forward to a good  future. Moreover, it will constitute the groundwork for  expanding the circle of dialogue and finalizing formulas for  Palestinian unity.    In an exclusive statement, Zaki added: This is the first  time in history that the Palestinians have embarked on  establishing an entity. That requires priority in caring for,  protecting, and defending this entity.    Zaki stressed: In order to avoid what happened in other  revolutions that ended painfully with the outbreak of civil  wars, we will not allow those models to be repeated in  Palestine. Therefore, we have continued and will continue the  dialogue with all Islamic and national Palestinian forces and  factions in a bid to avoid the specter of a civil war and  infighting.

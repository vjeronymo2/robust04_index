			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / People: Richards to pep up Peptide Peptide Therapeutics, the biopharmaceutical development company which is planning a flotation later this year, has appointed one of the UK's leading bio-technology scientists, Brian Richards, as its non-executive chairman. Richards, 62, has a string of academic qualifications starting with a first class degree in agricultural sciences from the Aberystwyth branch of the University of Wales in 1952. Ten years later he was Reader in biological sciences at the University of London, assisting in the establishment of the UK's first school of biological sciences. In 1966 Richards helped set up a UK research laboratory for the US company GD Searle &amp; Co, which pioneered research into immunology and genetic engineering. Monsanto bought GD Searle in 1986, whereupon Richards, together with Keith McCullagh and Geoffrey Eckersley, started British Bio-Technology (BB), backed by Pounds 3.5m from UK and US investors; Richards remains non-executive chairman. Peptide's main areas of research focus on asthma, allergies and rheumatoid arthritis, while BB is currently engaged in programmes for anti-cancer treatments, though it too is engaged in research into treating side-effects of asthma. Besides his role at BB, Richards recently chaired a Stock Exchange committee which considered the current listing rules for science-based companies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Teams of 40 to 50 soldiers have been stationed on  the nation's trains to protect passengers from continued Khmer  Rouge attacks, the commander of the Royal Army's train  protection force said.    Service on the Phnom Penh-Battambang and Phnom  Penh-Sihanoukville train lines was halted for most of May  because of attacks and damage to the tracks but resumed on May  21, said the commander, Sok Nearadei.    The Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry  of Defense authorised the resumption of service in late May, he  said. The number of soldiers on board was doubled after service  resumed.    "But I don't know whether they can maintain security for the  passengers or not," he said.    Sok Nearadei has also contacted the provincial commanders on  the trains' routes to make sure there have been no recent  incidents that might jeopardize the safety of the passengers.    Since January 1993 there have been 72 attacks on the  nation's  two trains and their tracks, Sok Nearadei said.    In those attacks 76 people were killed, and 207 wounded. In  addition, 10 train engines, 26 wagons, 11 bridges and 1,008  meters of railway line were destroyed.    Though he said he hopes the teams of soldiers hired to  protect the train will help to improve security, "Soldiers are  helpless when it comes to the mines laid on tracks by guerrilla  forces."    While local authorities in Kampot and Kompong Som Province  have said that security seems to have improved, the train to  Battambang is still plagued by Khmer Rouge activities.    On June 6 the Battambang train was delayed after the Kouk  Trom bridge in northwestern Cambodia was destroyed. Service on  the line currently ends in Pursat, but another train is running  from Banteay Meanchey to Battambang.</p>

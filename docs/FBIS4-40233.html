			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian language will be considered as a state  one in Kyrgyzstan's regions mostly populated by the  Russian-speaking population, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev  stated in his decree, which he read out during a meeting with  the Slav community on Tuesday [14 June] in Bishkek.    Akayev said the decree had been issued in order to prevent  further growth in the number of the Russian-speaking people  emigrating from Kyrgyzstan.    The Kyrgyz Government will try to ensure equal  representation  of the Slav community in the state and local administration.    The decree also provides for guaranteed representation of  the  ethnic minorities in all state power bodies. Within a month the  Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry will work out proposals on the  acquisition of citizenship for Russian-speaking inhabitants of  Kyrgyzstan leaving for Russia and for those willing to come back  to Kyrgyzstan from Russia. The proposals will be coordinated  with the Russian party.    The Kyrgyz Interior Ministry and the National Security  Committee will strengthen their struggle against nationalism.    Akayev suggested that the migration by the Russian-speaking  population was causing large damage to the potential of  Kyrgyzstan on the whole. He emphasized that increasing  migration was due to the problems with the language,  insufficient representation in the state bodies and other  official structures and the display of nationalism in everyday  life.    Akayev announced that he had prepared one more letter to  Russian President Boris Yeltsin asking Russia to help Kyrgyzstan  to resolve the economic problems. Akayev stressed that these  issues must be settled urgently if Russia was interested in  ensuring the position of Russians living in Kyrgyzstan.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991 Organic Methods Manual (EPA, 1991)&blank;One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested a change in the scope of EPA Method 505 because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection limits for some method analytes. These changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included withdrawal of alachlor, atrazine and simazine, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of toxaphene. EPA is evaluating the detection limits in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several methods. When this evaluation is complete, EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to withdraw approval of methods or modify the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods, such as Method 505. In the interim, EPA does not agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the scope of Method 505 should be changed to withdraw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alachlor, atrazine and simazine. However, EPA agrees that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for these nitrogen-containing compounds may require use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a nitrogen-phosphorous detector (NPD) rather than the electron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture detector (ECD). Today's rule specifies that an NPD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be substituted for the ECD in Method 505 (or another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved method should be used) to determine alachlor, atrazine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and simazine, if lower detection limits are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the comment about toxaphene. In today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule EPA is correcting an omission in the 1993 proposal by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing to approve Method 505 for toxaphene. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that the Method 505 MDL for toxaphene is very close to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis analysts may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wish to use Method 508 for toxaphene and other Method 505  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytes for which use of an NPD will not improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity. Method 508 is very similar to Method 505 except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the MDLs are lower, because a larger sample volume is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extracted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL compliance determination for PCBs requires that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method 505 or 508 be used as a screen for PCBs as Aroclors prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to quantitation as decachlorobiphenyl by EPA Method 508A. Three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters requested that EPA switch the sequence of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for PCBs, i.e., use Method 508A to screen and Method 505  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 508 to quantify PCBs. The suggested change in the sequence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance methods is beyond the scope of this rule since it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require amending the MCL compliance determination sequence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 40 CFR 141.24(h)(13)(i)&hyph;(iii). Only Method 508A can measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decachlorobiphenyl, and &sect;141.24(h)(13)(ii) specifically requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``using Method 508A to quantify PCBs as decachlorobiphenyl''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was suggested by a commenter that EPA include hexachloro-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cyclopentadiene (HCP) in the scope of EPA Method 508. EPA agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the commenter, and will allow measurement of HCP with EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 508. However, the analyst must show that the analyte  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoveries and other criteria, which are specified for HCP in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9 of Method 508.1 are achieved using Method 508  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. This option will be described in the document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 EPA Inorganic Methods Manual (EPA, 1993a)&blank;A commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asked what the differences were between Method 335.3 and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> updated version, Method 335.4, since both versions require manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distillation of the sample to prepare it for measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cyanide. The technical differences between these methods are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor. EPA improved the automation of procedures in Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 335.4, and added the option to use a labor-saving distillation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure. The distillation option is described in Method 335.4,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and it is approved and described for other spectrophotometric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters objected to replacement of Method 335.3 with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 335.4. The objection appeared to be based on the mistaken belief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Method 335.4 requires a manual distillation of the sample to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare it for measurement of cyanide and that the earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> version, Method 335.3, did not. EPA has never allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spectrophotometric measurements of cyanide in water samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without manual distillation of the sample using SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;C (cf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 136.3, Table 1B; 59 FR 4507, January 31, 1994; and 57  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31839, July 17, 1992). Commenters may have been misled by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion in Method 335.3 of an alternate ultraviolet (UV)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digestion procedure that does not require manual distillation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has never approved this optional UV procedure for compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements of cyanide, because EPA has no data to show that UV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digestion would not provide inaccurate results that underestimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level of contamination. To avoid manual distillation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample, laboratories may use a selective electrode method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cyanide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Foreigners still nervous about business climate IF RUSSIAN reformers are wondering how western business reacted to this week's bloodshed, they could take some comfort from the Moscow manager of Perestroika, a Russian-US joint venture construction company. Yesterday morning, Mr Peter Degermark wrote to Moscow's deputy mayor congratulating him on suppressing the rebels - a victory he believes will open the way for more western business in Russia. But though his relief at President Boris Yeltsin's victory was echoed across the business community in Moscow yesterday, western businesses remain far from ready to rush into Russia. Mr Yeltsin may have ended the paralysis between the parliament and government, but sorting out the relationship between the regions and the centre will be as crucial for investment, they say. Scepticism remains about how fast the president can turn his rhetoric into consistent legislation. For the moment at least, most businesses are still nervously assessing the aftermath of the turmoil. Mr Jean Yves-Durel, eastern European regional sales representative for General Electric, said although he had been 'very afraid' on Sunday that a victory for Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov would have 'pushed them back' and created a climate hostile to western investment, GE was now pressing ahead, convinced that 'Russia is a huge market for the year 2000'. Mr George Reese, Moscow manager of Ernst and Young echoed the optimism, pointing out that dissolution of parliament had removed the key obstacle to business reform. But the business community is aware Mr Yeltsin has repeatedly frittered away opportunities. And with parliament now suspended, there are fears that badly needed tax and investment laws could be delayed again, or introduced by presidential decree in the interim and then amended by any future parliament. 'We just don't know what the situation with laws is now that there is no parliament,' says Mr Anders Morland, resident manager of Amoco, the US oil group. 'Until you have the legislation in place you can't expect major investment.' Mr Morland predicts it will be at least a year before there is any large investment by oil and gas companies. One group that has, ironically, benefited inadvertently from events has been foreign banks. Parliament had been due to debate a plan to ban foreign banks in Russia from taking deposits from Russians from next January to 1996. But Mr Sergei Yegorov, head of the Russian Bankers' Union, suggested on Tuesday that although Russian banks needed protection from foreign competition there was little point reversing the terms of licences already given to foreign banks. Nevertheless, Mr Jurgen Woller, representative of Dresdner Bank, which has recently opened a joint subsidiary with Banque Nationale de Paris in St Petersburg, insists that reforming the banking law is a priority. Meanwhile, as Mr Hans Jochum Horn, Moscow director of Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, points out, a clearer monetary framework is also essential. The other great challenge for the government, he notes, will be sorting out the relationship between regions and centre. With the regions increasingly independent - and in some areas, significantly more reformist - threats by Mr Yeltsin to impose greater control are viewed with concern. Mr Gerald Presky, representative of John Brown and Davy Metals, said: 'It will be difficult to bring the regions back into the fold - it would not be good for investors.' John Brown has a clutch of projects in the regions and has found, he says, that local officials are often far more open to investors than central government.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Westpac chairman and four directors quit after criticism THE chairman and four directors of Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's biggest bank, resigned yesterday in the face of criticism from the markets and financial institutions. Sir Eric Neal, chairman, Sir Neil Currie, deputy chairman, and three other long-serving directors had accepted responsibility for heavy losses and bad debts which had halved the bank's share price. Westpac's problems came to a head last week when a ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds 488m) rights issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, forcing the underwriters to take up shares worth about ADollars 860m. This followed a disastrous first half in which the bank incurred pre-tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts, including a ADollars 2.1bn write-down of its property portfolio. Westpac said Sir Eric would be replaced by Mr John Uhrig, chairman of CRA, the mining group 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK. Sir James Balderstone, chairman of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, was appointed deputy chairman. None of the departing directors was available for comment. Mr Uhrig said they had resigned voluntarily 'on the basis of the need to demonstrate board responsibility'. He would not comment on why a number of other long serving directors had not resigned. Mr Uhrig said there would be no immediate change in the bank's strategy of cutting costs, improving efficiency and resuscitating its battered public image. Analysts said the resignations would help stimulate market support for Westpac's shares, which have collapsed from ADollars 3.87 in August to less than ADollars 3, about half the level of two years ago. Westpac has suffered deteriorating losses for the last two years as falling asset prices have exposed the poor quality of many loans and property investments made during a period of rapid expansion in the late 1980s. The mass resignation follows strong private pressure for tough action from institutional investors, and a campaign against the bank by dissident shareholders and much of the media. The Australian Financial Review yesterday called for the resignation of the entire board. Westpac shares closed one cent higher at ADollars 2.86 on the Australian Stock Exchange.

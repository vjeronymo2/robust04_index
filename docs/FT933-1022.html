			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions THE SALE of 20,000 shares by Gordon Bond at Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the specialty paper group, was made following the announcement of interim figures which were marginally up on the same period last year. The sale by three directors of Jupiter Tyndall, the banking and investment management group, of more than 1.5m shares has been made just before the company went into its close period. The share price has been performing well over the year but the sale almost halved the holding of chairman John Duffield. The Scottish packaging company, MacFarlane Group (Clansman) has enjoyed a good rise in its share price over the past year. Directors have been selling the whole way up; the most recent transaction, by Gordon Lane, was made at 209p. Simon Engineering announced interim results at the beginning of September. In spite of announcing a loss before tax for the first six months of the year, three members of the board, including A M Davies, the new chairman, bought a total of 79,000 shares at 59p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                 Sector          Shares      Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Arjo Wiggins A'lton       Pack          20,000         43           1 Beattie (James)           Stor          79,000        117           1 Birkby Group              Misc          20,000         39           2 Border TV                 Med           20,000         28           1 British Land              Prop          52,631        211           3 Capital Radio             Med           21,000         44           1 Cater Allen               OthF           6,000         30           1 Conrad Ritblat Sinc       Prop         750,000        356           1 Croda International       Chem          33,000        109           1* Dalgety                   FdMa         135,858        666           1* European Motors           Motr          70,000         98           1 Fairway                   Misc          25,000         18           1 Hambro Countrywide        Prop          60,000         49           1 Henlys                    Motr          35,000         84           1* Jupiter Tyndall           FdMa       1,525,279      3,478           3 Land Securities           Prop           5,000         32           1 MacFarlane (Clans)        Pack          45,000         94           1 Meyer Int'l               BdMa          70,095        283           3* Perkins Foods             FdMa         933,313        873           1 Prudential                InsL         150,000        505           1* Rea Brothers              Merc         150,000         74           1 Reed International        Med           12,758         89           1 Rolfe &amp; Nolan             BuSe          10,000         24           1 Taunton Cider             Brew          10,000         21           1 Warner Estate             Prop         300,000        750           1 Wessex Water              Watr           6,000         39           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Babcock Int'l             EngG          50,000         16           1 Beattie, James            Stor          17,466         27           1 Business Technology       Misc         205,000         25           2 Fairhaven Int'l           O&amp;G           50,000         13           1 Forminster                Text          10,000         55           1 Forth Ports               Tran          30,000        107           2 Hall Engineering          EngG          10,000         27           1 Holmes Protection         BuSe         300,000        108           1 Molynx                    Elns         600,000        120           1 Primadona                 InTr          18,000         41           1 Regalian                  Prop          90,000         18           1 Savills                   Prop          50,000         30           1 Sheffield Insul'ns        BdMa          12,000         27           1 Simon Engineering         EngG          79,000         47           3 Specialeyes               Hlth         500,000         75           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

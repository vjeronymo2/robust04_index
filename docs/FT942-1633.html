			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: ICI The stock market's reaction to the appointment of an outsider as ICI's chief executive was muted compared to the celebration which greeted Mr Martin Taylor's arrival at Barclays last summer. But Mr Charles Miller Smith, who is moving to ICI from Unilever and was rumoured to be in the running for the Barclays job, should not feel slighted. The process of cultural change is already well established at ICI following last year's demerger of Zeneca. The main comfort in the appointment is that there is less danger of ICI sliding back into complacency now that profits are starting to improve. Mr Miller Smith may also be able to add value to ICI's investment decisions, which will be just as important for the company's long-term success. The chemical group's record on this score has been patchy. With its balance sheet restored to health thanks to the demerger, ICI has money to spend. But without the cash flow from the bioscience side, it cannot afford expensive mistakes. While Mr Miller Smith will not bring specialist knowledge to investment decisions, ICI is not short on chemicals industry experience. The chairman-designate and most other executive directors have risen through the ranks. Neither has specialist knowledge always brought the right result in the past. It may be more important that Mr Miller Smith brings a dispassionate view, unencumbered by the past.</p>

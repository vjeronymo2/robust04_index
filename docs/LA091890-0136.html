			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> PARKER AUTOMOTIVE NAMES NEW PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Michael E. Parker will step down as president and chief operating officer of  Parker Automotive Corp. in Costa Mesa. Orange County developer and banker  Timothy L. Strader will take over daily operations of the company, a maker of a  proprietary chemical cleaning system for internal combustion engine fuel  systems.  </P> <P> Parker, the company's founder and major shareholder, will remain chairman and  chief executive. Strader, a former Koll Co. vice president, is president and  co-founder of Legacy Cos., an Irvine builder of upscale homes and commercial  properties, and is founding chairman of CommerceBank, a 13-year-old Newport  Beach bank with about $230 million in assets.  </P> <P> Parker was recently sued for fraud by Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. His dealings  involving bankrupt Parker North American Corp. have prompted the scrutiny of  federal authorities. Company officials said Strader's appointment had nothing  to do with Parker's legal woes. JOHN O'DELL  </P></p>

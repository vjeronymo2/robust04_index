Present at the meeting were Wu Guanzheng, Shu  Shengyou, Huang Zhiquan, Zhou Zhiping, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang  Maoheng, and Jiang Zhongping. Members of the provincial  government and principal leaders of the relevant government  departments also attended the meeting. Governor Wu Guanzheng  chaired the meeting, which discussed and revised the government  work, and reviewed last year's achievements.    The report points out: The past year has been one in which  the province maintained speedy national economic growth, in  which major progress was made in reform, in which the people's  lives continued to improve, and in which new progress was made  in building the material and spiritual civilizations. Last  year, the province's GNP amounted to 68.6 billion yuan, an  increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year. Gross  industrial and agricultural output value amounted to 122.1  billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 percent; of this amount, the  gross agricultural output value was 38.8 billion yuan, an  increase of 5.1 percent. This year is a crucial one for  promoting the establishment of the socialist market economy  structure, an important year for maintaining a good economic  development trend, and a crucial year for accelerating the  construction of basic facilities and industries and for  promoting Jiangxi's economy to a new level.    The provincial government asks the people throughout the  province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, to widen the  scope of opening up, to bring about further development, to  maintain stability, to move forward boldly with an enterprising  spirit, to work hard and in a down-to-earth manner, to base  themselves on agriculture, and to devote major efforts to  industrial development so as to lay a good foundation for future  development.    In his speech at the meeting, Wu Guanzheng stressed: In  economic work, we must bring economic returns into prominence.  People in all trades and undertakings must pay close attention  to improving economic returns and must work out detailed  measures and objectives. There is a need for county-level  economic development; for developing high-yield, high-quality,  and highly efficient agriculture; and for accurately selecting  projects and improving economic results in the development of  town and township enterprises. In the meantime, it is necessary  to continue developing the individual and private economic  sectors, as well as the foreign-invested economic sectors. In  the course of stimulating economic development, we should handle  correctly the relationship among reform, development, and  stability; accelerate the establishment of the social insurance  system; strengthen control over government officials; improve  the comprehensive management of social order; increase the  masses' sense of safety; and ensure increases in the peasants'  per capita net income and increases in revenue.</p>

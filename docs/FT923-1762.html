			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK oil shares Sterling's fall against the dollar has brought some relief to oil shares. While few expected the pound to stay at Dollars 2, the fact that oil companies' revenues are mostly priced in dollars has caused discomfort. But for the largest UK oil firms, BP and Shell, the effect is muted. These oil majors are largely dollar-based stocks with dollar assets and borrowings; which leaves the translation of profits into sterling as the real problem. The geographical spread of the large companies also helps insulate them from dollar movements, with refining and chemicals operations often priced in local currencies. Since early September when the pound was at Dollars 2, Shell's shares have risen by 14 per cent and BP is up only 10 per cent. The currency effect is much more marked in the exploration and production stocks, especially those operating in the North Sea. These have dollar revenues and sterling costs. Their margins were being badly squeezed as the dollar fell during the summer. The 29 per cent rise in Enterprise Oil's shares to 401p in the past two weeks is some measure of the relief. But the oil market remains difficult. With western economies still in recession, demand for oil is unlikely to rise, while extra supply will come on stream over the next year. Doubts about the level of Opec's production targets and its ability to stick to them may prevent the oil price rising much above Dollars 20 a barrel. With refining and petrochemical profit margins still poor, it will take more than a stronger dollar to push oil shares much higher.</p>

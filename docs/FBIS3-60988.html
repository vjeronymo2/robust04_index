According to official figures provided by Turkish security  sources and the Interior Ministry, the number of civilians  killed this year increased by 100 percent compared to last  year's statistics.    Official data shows that in all of 1992 there were 1,920  PKK-related incidents throughout Turkey while this figure  reached 3,901 in only the first 11 months of this year.  Meanwhile, the civilian death toll was recorded at 1,249 as of  November 30, 1993, representing an increase of about 100 percent  from 1992's year-end figure of 618.    During the same period in 1993, a total of 676 security  officials, including temporary village guards, soldiers and  policemen, were killed. Last year, this figure stood at 634.  Official figures, provided in writing to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS,  revealed an increase in PKK casualties and injuries in 1993 with  1,552 terrorists killed and 121 wounded, in contrast to last  year's figures of 1,228 killed and 52 wounded.    However, the number of alleged terrorists caught by security  forces so far in 1993 was 7,640 lower than the 7,908 terrorists  caught in 1992.    While 853 civilians were wounded in 1992, the figure rose to  1,389 in 1993. The number of wounded security personnel also  increased in this year's figures.

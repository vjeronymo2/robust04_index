			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A;  </P> <P> RICHARD HAMILL;  </P> <P> FIRM HOPES TO PASS DRUG TEST;  </P> <P> HYCOR BIOMEDICAL LOOKS FOR WAYS TO GROW WITH DEMAND  </P> <P> Last year, 15 million Americans, from airline pilots to schoolteachers, were  tested for drug use, and even more are expected to face screening this year.  </P> <P> As drug testing becomes more common in our society, questions about the  accuracy of test results persist, and the debate over an individual's right to  privacy versus the public's interest in a drug-free workplace continues.  </P> <P> One small company that has grown along with demand for drug testing is Hycor  Biomedical Inc. in Garden Grove, a maker of such laboratory control products as  specimen samples used to determine test reliability in the screening process.  </P> <P> Hycor President Richard Hamill concedes that the reliability and credibility of  drug testing remains problemtic. At the same time, his firm is developing a new  generation of products that could greatly expand the use of drug tests in this  country.  </P> <P> Hycor's new "pinch test" will allow people to conduct a drug test and see the  results on site. An athletic coach or job supervisor, for instance, could  administer the test in the field and learn the results within minutes.  </P> <P> Hamill, 50, a former executive at G.D. Searle &amp; Co. and Baxter  International, recently spoke with Times staff writer John Charles Tighe about  the reliability of drug tests, whether the industry should be regulated and the  legal challenges to testing.  </P> <P> Q. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, an agency of the Department of Health  and Human Services, last year for the first time developed standards for drug  testing laboratories. Why did they do this?  </P> <P> A. The government got very concerned about the variables of drug testing and  the credibility of test results that were coming out of the laboratories. There  wasn't uniformity. At one laboratory, 200 nanograms (a billionth of a gram) of  cocaine in the specimen would be viewed as a positive. At another lab it might  be viewed as a negative. The standard couldn't be zero because there are so  many factors that can interfere with the results, from foreign materials to  over-the-counter drugs that the person has taken, or the very test itself in  the way it's performed. So the test result could come out 100 or 200, without  the person ever consuming the drug.  </P> <P> Q. What happened after the standards were established?  </P> <P> A. Last year, 150 laboratories signed up to get certified by NIDA, and only 25  of those laboratories passed. NIDA sent samples to all the labs, who ran tests  on the samples and returned them to NIDA, but most labs didn't meet the newly  created standards.  </P> <P> Q. What is the standard?  </P> <P> A. For cocaine, for instance, they've determined the cutoff is 300 nanograms,  which is an amount that rules out a lot of variables, and above that number we  say the person is positive for cocaine.  </P> <P> Q. Why did so many laboratories not meet the standards?  </P> <P> A. A lot of it gets down to the laboratory. How it performs. How its people  perform. These are big variables in results. In the labs, there are people,  there is equipment and there are reagents, and each of those can vary during  the course of the day.  </P> <P> Q. What level of credibility do tests have?  </P> <P> A. There still is a problem. I think until all of the laboratories that are  doing drug testing are certified by NIDA, there remains the question about the  credibility of the results that the laboratories report. The certification  procedure that NIDA went through or that 150 labs went through says something  about the improvement that is still possible.  </P> <P> Q. Does part of the problem come from false positives -- that is, when an  interfering material incorrectly triggers a positive test for drugs?  </P> <P> A. Yes. That's still a problem. I think individuals that are tested should be  interviewed about what other drugs they might be taking. Those medications can  be as simple as over-the-counter items. That speaks to the technology and the  limitations of the technology itself.  </P> <P> Q. How can laboratories improve?  </P> <P> A. They can make sure their people are adequately trained and performing their  jobs correctly, they can use control products and use them frequently during  the day to ensure that the results are good, that the process is in control.  And they can apply to NIDA for certification to get that kind of outside review  of their facilities, their equipment, their people, their training and the  kinds of reagents they use.  </P> <P> Q. What's the role of drug testing control products like the ones you make?  </P> <P> A. The controls are substitutes for patient urine specimens. In the clinical  laboratory many years ago, laboratory directors realized that they could run  controls through their system periodically during the day and that these  controls would be in line with the results they were getting from their actual  patient tests. Then the patient samples had a known level of reliability.  </P> <P> Q. Because the federal government doesn't regulate the testing firms that  perform job-related drug tests, does this mean anyone can enter the business?  </P> <P> A. That's right. But because of the competition in the services sector, with  some very well-established large laboratories, I would think that at this point  in time, they would have to do a pretty good selling job to convince some major  customers, like industry or the military, that they were capable.  </P> <P> Q. Does the industry need to be regulated?  </P> <P> A. No. I think that with the involvement of NIDA and the involvement of the  professional societies, like the College of American Pathologists, and with the  American Assn. of Clinical Chemists who run proficiency tests and encourage  their member laboratories to keep certain standards, the profession manages  itself. Laboratories are motivated to put out good results.  </P> <P> Q. You have developed your "pinch test" that takes a tiny sample of blood and  determines drug content. What impact is this test likely to have on the future  of drug testing?  </P> <P> A. It really gets to the issue of sample integrity. If a test could be  performed, let's say, in a locker room, as opposed to being put in a container  and then shipped somewhere else, then there is the opportunity to thwart the  steps that come between the test site and when the test is performed in the  laboratory.  </P> <P> Our pinch test is designed for those environments outside the laboratory. I  think there's a nice area of growth that we've identified.  </P> <P> Q. Are you concerned that the test might be considered an invasion of an  individual's rights?  </P> <P> A. I think that now that tests are going to be more easily performed, it is a  fact of life that a person is going to be subjected to frequent tests. So I'm  not sure I want to comment on the civil rights issue because our society now  requires drug testing.  </P> <P> Q. Is this test a replacement for lab tests?  </P> <P> A. No. It is an initial screening test that will be used in addition to a lab  test, and the results could signal the need for a further lab screen test or a  lab confirmation test. It's really going to expand the market. This is because  if a screening test says that there is a reason for concern, another test will  be asked for, and that will be sent to another laboratory for confirmation  testing. So we're really going to expand and be a complement as opposed to  being a competitor.  </P> <P> Q. Is the pinch test as reliable as laboratory screening products?  </P> <P> A. I don't know the answer to that right now. Our expectations are that it will  be, and we will have to demonstrate that with test results to the FDA before we  get approval.  </P> <P> Q. What is the market for the test?  </P> <P> A. I think it has some potential anywhere that a quick indication is needed,  whether it be in an emergency room, in an industrial employment situation, an  athletic program or in probation departments. Those are all important markets  for a quick, easy-to-use test system.  </P> <P> Q. The inside cover of your annual report shows off the pinch test, and below  it is a photo of a track athlete. Do you think coaches will buy the test to  check their athletes before meets?  </P> <P> A. The athletic market is going to be one of the markets. I don't know if it's  the ideal one.  </P> <P> Q. Where do you see the test to be particularly valuable?  </P> <P> A. Probation departments are an area we see as a real use for the product. This  is an environment where individuals may be tested as frequently as weekly.  Probation departments want to make sure that people on parole remain clean.  Here they're really looking for an indication. They want to confirm that the  person is staying free of drugs.  </P> <P> So whether every test of parolees is a screening test or a confirmation test is  not as significant, because there's going to be a history of test results, and  any one single test is probably not going to determine the course of events.  </P> <P> Q. What drugs will the tests detect?  </P> <P> A. We're developing separate tests for cocaine, morphine, marijuana,  amphetamines and PCP. The first one we will bring to the market will be  cocaine. And for that one we will be submitting our application to the (Food  and Drug Administration) in another month or so. Our results so far indicate  that we have a very reliable test.  </P> <P> It's a screening test, so it isn't definitive. Therefore, the kinds of  decisions that impact people's lives are not going to depend upon our screening  tests, whereas confirmation tests do provide that kind of assurance.  Confirmation tests involve a more complex study, which merges two different  research tools that provide very specific detection.  </P> <P> Confirmation tests are very expensive. They run in the $100-to-$200 range. A  screening test costs about $25 from the laboratory, and we'll probably sell  ours to our distributors for between $3 and $5.  </P> <P> Q. Your new test is very easy to perform and could be used by a job supervisor  or a high school coach. Couldn't anybody buy these tests and interpret their  results in a broad manner beyond the initial screen that you intend them to be?  </P> <P> A. You're probably right about that. In our labeling we will try to speak to  that issue. I think the way to be careful and assure that the product is  properly used and finds its place is through adequate labeling and very careful  promotion.  </P> <P> Q. What will the labeling say?  </P> <P> A. The labeling will define the test's use, which we are now studying, and  provide some instruction to the user as to what significance he or she should  place on the test results in the absence of further confirmation of that  particular result. And it will contain a thorough direction insert.  </P> <P> Q. The courts are the main arena for the continuing debate over the privacy  issues involved in drug testing. Might the courts finally decide how the  results of rapid, on-site tests like yours can be interpreted and applied?  </P> <P> A. I think there is going to have to be a lot of thought about the procedure.  For instance, if the result is positive in a screening test like this, can  action be taken immediately to ban an individual? We don't know how that's  going to work. Those are questions that have to be dealt with. And I would be  flippant if I were to say those aren't issues that have to be addressed.  </P> <P> Q. Will there come a time when you'd be brought in to defend the results of  your product and their consequences?  </P> <P> A. I think it's possible. I don't think it's very likely because the product  will be adequately labeled as a screening test and not a confirmation test. At  this point we would rather the results be used as an indication, rather than an  absolute. We would rather that the results be confirmed in a laboratory using  an acceptable confirmation test. So I'm not sure that it's going to be used  before a track meet to say that if it's positive you therefore can't compete in  the meet.  </P> <P> Q. Although you say you haven't been involved in court battles over testing, to  what extent are laboratories involved in the court issues?  </P> <P> A. Directors of the labs that do a significant amount of drug testing are in  court weekly defending their test results, which is something that clinical  laboratories did not have to do before drug tests.  </P> <P> Q. Is there a problem with corporations and others interpreting screening tests  too broadly?  </P> <P> A. I don't know the answer to that. I think this is an issue that NIDA is  trying to address by developing standards and defining the rules.  </P> <P> Q. Has drug testing caught on outside the United States?  </P> <P> A Elsewhere, drug testing is still not thought to be as necessary as it is  here. As we go around Europe, the people essentially say, "You have a problem  in the United States. We don't have a problem here." So, until Europeans  perceive that the problem is greater than it is, drug testing will not grow and  flourish and be an important part of decision-making there.  </P> <P> Q. Will drug testing continue to increase in popularity in America?  </P> <P> A Yes. The demand will continue to increase, perhaps limited only by  reimbursement programs and the caps that may be applied to reimbursement  programs.  </P> <P> Q. Who are the largest makers of lab drug testing products?  </P> <P> A. Ciba Co. and Abbot Laboratories are the largest producers of testing  reagents for use in the laboratories. Most of the reagents are controlled by  the two major companies, which are large, credible companies that are well  motivated to provide laboratories with good quality material.  </P> <P> For smaller companies, the opportunities are to provide screening materials for  off-site use and for products used before the screening.  </P> <P> Q. To what degree do you worry about these big companies trying to go after  your smaller market?  </P> <P> A. It's a concern. They are very formidable competitors. Should they decide to  expand their product line and move into the pre-screen area, they would be  tough to deal with.  </P> <P> Q. Where do smaller companies like yours fit in?  </P> <P> A. We have to look for those little segments that we can do well in. For our  company, we started by identifying segment in the drug testing area in the  control side. As a small company we have to be careful about the markets we go  after because we don't want to go up against the major companies.  </P></p>

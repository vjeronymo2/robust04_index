One hour after  the launch, Endeavor was put into orbit at an altitude of 300 km  above the ground, and experiments aboard the space ship began  immediately. Shortly after the experiments were started, a water  leak was found near the power system for the No. 10 rack. A  water leak aboard a spaceship in space can lead to a major  disaster if the floating water droplets find their way into the  electrical system. The supply of cooling water to the rack was  suspended immediately, and the experiment on the rack was  suspended until the leakage could be repaired. A number of  material experiments were scheduled to be conducted in the No.  10 rack using a sound-pressure-floating furnace, an image  furnace, and a zone furnace. These experiments had been selected  from among the many proposals submitted regarding experimental  themes to be conducted in space. The proposals had been  submitted by the public in 1979. During the next 13 years, a  series of experiments had been conducted on the ground and  aboard planes in flight in preparation for the space  experiments. Beginning in April 1992, we conducted three mock  experiments (POCC) at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville,  Alabama, to prepare for the upcoming space experiments. Since  these efforts had extended over many years, the news of the  water leak accident shocked us greatly. At the same time, we  were impressed by NASA's way of handling the accident.  Immediately after the water leak was found, a meeting of  specialists was called aboard the space shuttle to determine  whether the leak could be repaired safely. About 24 hours passed  before they made a decision on the measures to be taken. After  ascertaining safety, they cut open a layer of a material  wrapping the valve where the leak was thought to be occurring.  The image of the repair work was transmitted to the ground  stations. The repair was made safely with the help of ground  engineers. To compensate for the delay in starting the  experiments caused by this accident, the space shuttle's stay in  space was extended by one day. Thanks to this, we were able to  carry out all the scheduled experiments (Tables 1 and 2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

In recent years, the development of materials began to be  made on a commercial basis by exploiting the above advantages of  the space experiment environment (Table 3 [not reproduced]). The  lasting microgravity conditions in space make it possible to  melt glass materials without requiring a material container to  hold them in place. This, in turn, makes it possible to create a  highly pure glass, free of impurities traced to the container.  The microgravity environment also makes it possible to create a  glass without a crystallized structure. If a container does not  have to be used, it is possible to create a high-melting point  glass that is not affected by the thermal limitations of the  container used. In addition, the weightless condition makes it  possible to create new hetero-glasses that cannot be created on  the ground and are completely different from conventional  glasses. The formation of conventional glasses involve a  crystallization process in which the melted materials are  maintained at a quasi-stable state. In developing new materials,  it is important to fully understand the phenomena that are  expected to affect the results of material development in space.  The experiments which we conducted aboard the space shuttle  offered us sufficient time to unravel many of these phenomena,  something that had been impossible in the experiments conducted  using a free-fall tower, aircraft, or by launching small  rockets. Through these space experiments, we obtained valuable  data for creating new materials.    The experiment conducted for the "research to develop the  optical materials for use in invisible light range  applications," that had been proposed by the Government  Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (Item M-17 in Table 1), was  one of those most important experiments conducted aboard the  space shuttle. The purpose of the experiment was to establish  the technology for melting materials using no material container  and to process the melted materials to create new types of  glasses, such as high-purity glass and high melting-point glass.  The experiment was conducted by having the materials floated and  held in place by means of sound pressure. The materials were  melted by light, and then solidified by cooling, producing the  high-purity and high melting-point glasses. One of the purposes  of developing these glasses was to create a glass with a higher  infrared transmissivity than that of the quartz glass used in  conventional optical fiber communications for use in the  next-generation optical communications networks. The space  experiments made it possible to verify the usefulness of the  ground-developed technology for floating glass materials by  means of sound pressure. The experiments also involved testing  the float control techniques and studying the technology's  application fields. Through these experiments, the performance  of the sound pressure furnace (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) used  in the space experiments was also ascertained. Table 4 gives the  compositions of the materials used in the space experiments and  the conditions under which these materials were melted. One melt  experiment was conducted using a low melting-point specimen,  while two experiments were conducted using high melting-point  specimens. These experiments produced a glass with a high purity  that could not be obtained on the ground (Figure 3 [not  reproduced]). However, since the melted glass adhered to the  cage within which the materials were melted, it was impossible  for us to recover the glass as the complete sphere of a  high-purity glass. The experiments we conducted in space and the  results of the experiments are outlined below.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

(Figure  4 [not reproduced] shows a floating specimen being heated.) The  results of the experiment are as follows:    Float control: (1) It was ascertained that the  existing software could be used to control the position of the  floating specimen. The fact that we could confine the specimen  to within a fixed area by adjusting the frequency of the sound  waves to accommodate changes in experimental conditions  indicates that the software functioned as designed. However, it  was found out that the program was slow in responding to these  changes. This required further improvements of the software  speed. (2) The use of the cage (Figure 5 [not reproduced])  proved very useful in easing the unexpected "G-jitters." In  addition, the cage was necessary not only for serving as an  auxiliary heater for melting a specimen, but also for increasing  the safety in handling the high-temperature molten fluid under  weightless conditions. To further enhance the cage functioning,  we used platinum cages coated with a carbon film. Carbon has  poor wettability against platinum, preventing the platinum  element from finding its way into the molten specimen easily. In  addition, the carbon film is useful in preventing the molten  fluid from sticking to the cage.    Spot observation of specimen: The purposes for  conducting the space experiments included the on-the-spot  observation of the specimen floating within the cage and the  observation of the melting process via a fiber scope inserted  into the furnace. However, this time we failed to obtain a clear  view of the melting process due to the low resolution in the  images obtained through the fiber scope. The poor resolution was  attributable to the inability to secure the specimen in a  designated position. When a larger rack space becomes available  in the future, it will become possible to obtain clearer images  by introducing a reflective optical observation system.    Observation of melted specimen: In order to  observe the behavior of the specimen used in the first  experiment, a cobalt marker was applied to the surface of the  specimen that was melted by being floated by means of sound  pressure. When the melted specimen was cooled and solidified, it  was found that the marker had expanded in length, changing from  the original shape of a tiny speck to a bar (Figure 6 [not  reproduced). This change in shape indicates that a glass flow  occurred during the melting and solidification process. The  specimen with the expanded marker was used to calculate the  velocity of the flow, the density change, and the diffusion  coefficient from the melt temperature and time. In the second  experiment, in contrast to the yellowish glass that had been  obtained in ground experiments involving the use of a material  container, a highly transparent glass was created in the space  experiment. The glass contained tiny air bubbles that were  formed on the surface of the glass during the solidification  process. These bubbles posed a new problem that must be resolved  if new glasses are to be created under microgravity conditions.  In the third experiment, it was found that platinum found its  way into the melted/solidified glass and crystallized at the  interface between the platinum cage and the chunk of glass  adhering to the inside of the cage. The invasion of the platinum  into the glass formed the nuclei of nonuniform material elements  inside the glass, leading to the growth of a crystal within the  solidified glass.    Measurement of transmissivity in ultraviolet, infrared  and visible light ranges: The measurement of transmissivity  was conducted using the specimen obtained from the second  experiment since the measurement required the use of a highly  transparent glass specimen. Because the shape of the specimen  was not a parallelogram, an integrating sphere was used for  measuring in the ultraviolet and visible light ranges, while a  condenser beam was used in the infrared range. The  transmissivity thus measured exhibited lower values in all these  ranges than did that measured on the ground. However, compared  with the specimens melted and solidified on the ground, the  second specimen displayed better transparency. Figure 6 [not  reproduced] shows the results of measuring the transmissivity in  the ultraviolet and visible light ranges. It is thought that the  numerous air bubbles that were formed within the second specimen  affected not only light's absorption in the specimen, but also  its transmissivity. Figure 7 [not reproduced] is a photograph of  the bubbles existing within the melted glass fluid.    By conducting these recent space experiments, we have  obtained much valuable data that will prove useful in improving  the purity of glass by melting the materials in the microgravity  environment of space, in creating diversified types of glasses,  in controlling crystallization by steep cooling of the melted  materials, in studying the flow of melted glass fluid under  microgravity conditions, in creating better homogenized glasses,  in unraveling the reasons for the formation of air bubbles, and  in reducing the content of impurities. The author hopes that  this data will be used to help the R&amp;D efforts in realizing  the  construction of the projected space station. At the same time,  the author hopes that this data will also promote the  development of these technologies for use on the ground.</p>

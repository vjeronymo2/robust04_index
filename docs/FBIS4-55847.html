			<p>BFN     [Text] Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the federal  government, especially for this Radio Prishtina Daily News  program, assessed the effects of [FRY National Bank governor]  Avramovic's program so far. He also spoke about further steps  to be taken in its implementation. Slobodan Nikolic talked to  Premier Kontic.    [Begin recording] [Kontic] I believe we should not be  satisfied with the results that we have achieved so far. They  are not definite, they are not final, and they cannot secure the  achievement of those strategic goals of the economic  stabilization that we have set ourselves. We are currently at  the end of one phase -- the reconstruction of the monetary  system -- and at the beginning of another phase -- the recovery  of the economy, that is, the increase in production -- and  parallel to this, certain structural changes. I believe that in  the coming period it will be extremely important and unavoidable  to maintain the stability of prices and the exchange rate.  Moreover, in this context, we have to secure the strengthening  of [words indistinct] activity. If I were to pinpoint the basic  problem of the economic policy at the moment, then I would  define it as revival of production in conditions of price and  foreign currency stability.    [Nikolic] From month to month, the [words indistinct] is  greater and greater. Can we expect this [word indistinct] in  the future as well?    [Kontic] It is true that in the course of the three or four  months since the beginning of the implementation of the program,  the rate of increase in salaries and wages was quite rapid and  that they have now reached a level that -- in comparison to the  social product at our disposal -- is quite serious. According  to [words indistinct] salaries have already reached a level of  17 to 18 percent in the social product, which is considered to  be the borderline of salaries in the social product. [sentence  as heard] Anything that would exceed this level or increase the  participation of net salaries in the social product would at the  same time mean upsetting the balance that is really necessary to  our economic aspirations at the moment.    [Nikolic] How do you assess the [words indistinct] incidents  that have led to a situation that makes it difficult to adopt  laws, for example, the law on companies, and other legislation?    [Kontic] The federal government is conducting an independent  internal and foreign policy, therefore, it can -- within the  authority granted it by the Constitution -- adopt, institute,  and implement all policies that are relevant, but it is quite  certain that without intense legislative activity by the  Assembly, it is very difficult to find the appropriate framework  for the federal government's activity simply because we are  currently faced with building a new economic and political  system, and these are coordinates within which we need to  maneuver, particularly if we keep in mind that the old economic  system has been transcended, the new one still has not been  established. This transition of the economy from one state to  another certainly suffers in a certain sense, because the  legislative activity of the assembly is not progressing the way  we expected it to.

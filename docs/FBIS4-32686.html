			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["P.L."-initialed commentary: "TV Gunpowder"] </F>   [Text] One does not change a winning team. This old, and  well-tested formula from the days when the Serbs ranted (on TV)  about being endangered in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina can  again be heard on Radio Television Serbia at prime time under  the disguise of "special" political programs. For example, on  Tuesday [21 June] (also on Sunday, and particularly on Monday) a  special program was broadcast by TV Belgrade: The guests,  leaders of the Serbs in "the former, unrecognized Yugoslav  republic of Macedonia" [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] seemed to compete in explaining how they had  been "denied their collective rights," while at the same time  they admitted that they were given their "individual rights"  (the right to work, the freedom of speech and expression, the  freedom of movement), and that they had no problems there.    As in previous (already seen) cases, "decent Macedonians"  phoned in to Television Belgrade to express their "support for  the right of the Serbian people to decide on their own fate,"  and to reject simultaneously "the possibility of forming some  sort of a Macedonian party in Serbia."    Of course, the entire program was dedicated to the same  issues: The census in Macedonia is illegal because "no one wants  to admit that there are 250,000 of us in Kiro Gligorov's state"  (all data reveal that this figure is blown out of proportion at  least several times); the census is illegal since "it is aimed  against the Serbian national entity"; the census is illegal  since it "neglects the rights of the Serbs who are defending  their hearths," and so on.    Experience tells us that such TV programs have usually been  followed by going to war for "the liberation of territories" or  for "the defense" of the aforementioned "hearths." The examples  of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are too fresh to be easily  forgotten.    The only question is: Will TV Belgrade (led by Milorad  Vucelic] take that one step that separates peace from war, or  will it stop after the census is over, along the lines of "let  bygones be bygones"?    In both cases, the smell of TV gunpowder is very much in  evidence.</p>

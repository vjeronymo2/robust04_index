			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVE GARVEY  </P> <P> In the Sept. 24 cover story by Peter J. Boyer ("Mr. Clean's Mid-Life Crisis"),  Steve Garvey aired his dirty laundry. Then, as a sequel, we were treated with  Cynthia Garvey's one day in jail for contempt of court. This appears to be no  more than an arrogant egomaniac seeking revenge on his ex-wife. Mr. Garvey  states he would like to run for public office. He can't even run his own  affairs. If this man can't be loyal to one woman, how could he possibly be  loyal to a constituency. His current wife is kind enough to offer to raise the  children born to the other women with whom he had affairs. Who does she think  she is, a saint? I find the "new" Garveys offensive, lacking of intelligence  and devoid of any human compassion for anyone but themselves. They deserve each  other.  </P> <P> KATHERINE WEATHERALL, Upland  </P></p>

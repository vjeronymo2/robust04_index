			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLYMAN BROWN WON'T SEEK ELECTION;  </P> <P> BROWN: GOP ASSEMBLYMAN WON'T RUN  </P> <P> Declaring that the Lord "wants me to do something else with my life,"  Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) on Monday announced he will not seek  reelection.  </P> <P> Brown, 40, a staunch conservative elected in 1978, emphasized that his  announcement followed six to eight months of prayer and was not a last-minute  decision.  </P> <P> "I've been up here 12 years . . . and I never intended to stay this long.  Before I get too decrepit, I want to do something else," said Brown, whose  negative votes on a variety of issues earned him the nickname "Dr. No."  </P> <P> Now, Brown said, he will have more time for religious activities. In fact, he  is immediately resigning from the powerful Ways and Means Committee to have  time to attend Bible classes at a fundamentalist center in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Brown, a former stockbroker, said he may also return to the brokerage business.  But he would not rule out running for office in 1992 or 1994.  </P> <P> Brown's colleagues expressed surprise at his decision to drop out of the race.  It is expected to touch off a scramble to succeed him in the heavily Republican  58th Assembly District, which includes Seal Beach and a part of Los Alamitos  and Huntington Beach in Orange County and parts of Long Beach and Signal Hill  in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Even before Brown's decision, he faced a challenge from Democrat Joel R.  Bishop, 32, a Long Beach computer systems analyst who works for the Orange  County government. Monday, Democrat Luanne Pryor, owner of a public relations  firm and an unsuccessful candidate for Long Beach mayor in 1988, said she is  also planning to run.  </P> <P> Among the Republicans considering the race is Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J.  Mays, who has gained attention with his high-profile handling of the county's  oil spill last month.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely taking a look at it," Mays said Monday. "I was really looking  at 1992 because I didn't expect any of our local legislators to be leaving  office. But I guess opportunities come along and they have to be evaluated."  </P> <P> Dr. Seymour Alban of Long Beach, a past president of the Long Beach Medical  Assn., was also mentioned as a possible Republican candidate.  </P> <P> With Brown dropping out, Friday's deadline to file election papers for the  Assembly seat will be extended until March 14.  </P> <P> Ever since Brown's 1978 election, in which he supported the property  tax-cutting Proposition 13, Brown has been a charter member of the Assembly's  "cavemen" faction, known for their fundamental political beliefs.  </P> <P> Among others in the group were Brown's friends, Assemblymen Pat Nolan  (R-Glendale) and John Lewis (R-Orange). In the past year or so, Nolan has been  the target of a federal political corruption probe and Lewis was indicted for  his role in preparing allegedly phony presidential endorsement letters. A state  appeal court in January dismissed a felony forgery charge against Lewis.  </P> <P> In part because of these two cases, Brown said, "the whole atmosphere (is) more  tense and less friendly" in the Capitol. Also contributing to what Brown called  a lack of "pleasantness" has been increasing pressure to raise money to run for  office.  </P> <P> Brown's announcement is the second by a Republican lawmaker in the past week.  Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) last Tuesday announced that  she is not running for reelection, saying lawmakers should not serve more than  10 years.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said Brown and La Follette will be  missed because they "are the glue that holds the party together up here,"  citing their encouragement of moderate GOP lawmakers to toe a conservative  line.  </P> <P> Times political writer Dave Lesher contributed to this story from Orange  County.  </P></p>

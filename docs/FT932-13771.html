			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Businesses report recovery in Wales and east Midlands THE RECOVERY appears to be under way in Wales and the Bristol region, according to quarterly economic surveys to be published today. A chamber of commerce business trends survey also suggests a return of confidence to the east Midlands. In Wales, 71 per cent of manufacturing companies surveyed for the Wales Chamber of Commerce expect turnover to improve in the next 12 months - the most positive finding for several years. A total of 57 per cent of companies in the service sector expect an improvement, and in both sectors only 8 per cent visualise a fall. Hopes for higher profitability are also rising, with 54 per cent of manufacturers and 44 per cent of service companies expecting to see this. 'The financial picture across Wales is one which shows that confidence is returning to the economy,' said Mr Graham Hall, leading executive of the chamber. The Wales chamber says that cashflow is a cause of concern, with nearly a third of companies reporting a deterioration. The warning is repeated by Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, which points out that more businesses are likely to fail in the early stages of recovery than in the depths of recession. The Bristol chamber also warns that the recovery may be weak at first. The chamber reports that, of about 400 businesses surveyed in Bristol and the surrounding area, 36 per cent of manufacturing companies and 39 per cent of those in the service sector said there had been a rise in domestic sales, compared with about a quarter reporting a fall. Orders showed a similar finding. On export sales, the balance was even more positive and on export orders, the chamber says, 'the picture is one of continuous improvement with manufacturing companies increasingly bullish'. The chamber sees signs that the rise in unemployment may be flattening. There are similar findings in Wales. During the three months, 42 per cent of the 600 Welsh companies surveyed reported that UK sales were the same as in the previous quarter and a third said there had been an improvement. Export orders are more buoyant with nearly half the manufacturers reporting a rise. Nearly 30 per cent of smaller businesses expect to recruit labour in the next quarter. Confidence has apparently also started to seep back into the east Midlands economy. More than half the companies taking part in the latest business trends survey of the regional chambers of commerce expect turnover to improve and slightly less than half expecting profitability to increase. The survey, published yesterday and covering 450 companies in one of the most economically diverse of the UK regions, shows that recovery is potential rather than actual. The proportion of companies operating at full capacity in March was 5 percentage points lower than last December at 22 per cent. Although there is some indication that companies are beginning to revise upwards their investment intentions and 30 per cent of companies, against 24 per cent last December, reported improved cashflow, order books have been at best stable. During the last three months there has been a modest improvement in export orders, with 38 per cent reporting an increase in March compared with 36 per cent in December. In the aftermath of sterling's departure last September from the exchange rate mechanism, half the companies surveyed said the price of materials was their main worry, replacing concern with lower interest rates.</p>

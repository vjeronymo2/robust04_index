			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China  on Thursday [19 May] decided not to adjust the local rediscount  rate and the New Taiwan [NT] dollar's exchange rate against the  U.S. currency.    The Central Bank reached the decision in a meeting of its  board of directors and supervisors.    The bank said it is unnecessary for Taiwan to follow the  example of the United States and raise its rediscount rate, or  the interest rate the central bank charges banks, because  Taiwan's m2 money supply growth rate was still high at over 15.2  percent in April, leaving room for commodity prices to move up.    Taiwan's current rediscount rate was 5.5 percent.    In addition, it said, the new Taiwan dollar's exchange rate  was at a "reasonable" level against the greenback. The U.S.  dollar finished Thursday on the Taiwan foreign exchange at  NT$26.84.    Observers said the central bank's decision to maintain a  loose monetary policy is in line with its policy to revitalize  the stagnant economy and export growth.</p>

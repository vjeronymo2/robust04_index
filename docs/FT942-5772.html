			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Loss at Postipankki widens to FM163m Pre-tax losses at Postipankki, the Finnish state-owned banking group, rose to FM163m (Dollars 29.6m) from FM101m in the first four months as higher costs and reduced income offset a reduction in credit losses. Mr Seppo Lindblom, chief executive, said the bank would make another loss in 1994, after last year's FM353m deficit. Rising long-term interest rates and reduced foreign exchange income helped lower group income to FM1.20bn from FM1.28bn. The fall would have been greater but for last year's purchase of Savings Bank of Finland assets, although costs associated with the acquisition helped drive expenses up 30 per cent to FM934m. Credit losses fell to FM369m from FM599m. Last week Unitas, Finland's second largest banking group, said it had cut pre-tax losses by 18 per cent to FM444m in the first four months, in spite of a 15 per cent increase in credit write-offs to FM976m.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Insurance group ahead in spite of Dollars 23m charge THE EQUITABLE, the US insurer 49 per cent-owned by Axa of France, moved further into profit in the second quarter, in spite of a Dollars 23m after-tax restructuring charge. Net income at the group, which reported losses between 1990 and 1992, rose to Dollars 72m, compared with Dollars 31.8m in the first quarter and a loss of Dollars 31.1m a year ago. The core insurance business made an after-tax profit of Dollars 33m - before investment gains and losses on disability insurance - compared with a Dollars 21m net profit in the first three months. The company attributed the improvement to lower expenses, wider product spreads and improved mortality experience. After losses from disability insurance of Dollars 19.5m (Dollars 10.4m a year ago) and investment gains of Dollars 5.3m (an Dollars 11.3m loss in the 1992 quarter), net profit was Dollars 18.7m, compared with a Dollars 44.9m loss the year before. The company's investment management arm and its investment bank, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, both advanced, before the restructuring charge related to the combination of The Equitable and Alliance investment management businesses. 'Earnings from this segment during the second half should benefit from the absence of non-recurring merger expenses, significant cost savings generated by The Equitable Capital/Alliance combination, as well as from anticipated strong asset growth at Alliance,' said Mr Richard Jenrette, chairman and chief executive. Yield on investments climbed during the quarter to 7.64 per cent from 7.5 per cent, as real estate yields rose and the group moved into longer-dated bonds. Half-year net income was Dollars 79.3m, or 37 cents a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of Dollars 22.5m a year earlier (before costs associated with its switch from a mutual organisation to a public company).</p>

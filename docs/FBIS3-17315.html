			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mecheslaw </F> Hryb, by Uladzimir Hoytan, place and date not given: "Without a  Real State Structure There Can Be No Real Power"]    [Excerpt] [Hoytan] What is being done today to prevent a  further economic slump?    [Hryb] Unfortunately, so far, there have been no concrete  changes for the better. To some extent, this is because we  announced the formation of an economic union with Russia and a  single ruble zone a long time ago. This somehow restrained  people and prevented them from taking active measures to develop  production. Enterprise, kolkhoz and sovkhoz managers, as well as  ordinary people were waiting for the unification to occur.  Special hopes were pinned to an exchange rate of 1:1. Many  people thought: Why invest Belarusian payment bills in anything,  when tomorrow I may receive valuable Russian rubles for them.  Mutual payments between enterprises and even states were  stopped, because everyone was thinking: When? I do not know  who is to blame for prolonging unification; everybody acted in  good faith. However, not everything depended on us -- there was  the Russian side, too. There are advocates and opponents of  this "marriage" both in our Republic and in Russia. The entire  affair has been dragging on for too long. That is why we, the  Supreme Soviet, had to discuss the issue of a credit-monetary  system. The question was asked squarely: Until the issue of an  economic union with Russia is finally resolved, payment bills  should be granted the status of full-fledged money. We should  decide and explain to the people what we do next -- form a  unified monetary system or make our payment bill the only legal  tender on our territory.    We are very concerned with other economic problems, too. In  particular, these are our old ailments: A need to liquidate  customs barriers and grant our products wider access to the  Russian market, because our industries have always been oriented  toward the latter. Without this, we will hardly resolve our  other problems.    [Hoytan] Once there was a suggestion to unilaterally  liquidate customs posts on the border with Russia. How do  things look in reality?    [Hryb] Such declarations were voiced, all right. However,  this has not led to anything. We do not have a customs union  with Russia thus far. If we managed to liquidate customs posts,  the cost of our products would be some 40 percent lower,  regardless of the high prices for power resources. I believe  that the issue of an economic union with Russia has not been  removed from the agenda yet. However, this unification may last  longer and be carried out step- by-step.    [Hoytan] What measures are envisioned for a structural  reshaping of production? For instance, for a couple of years  now we have been speaking about producing Belarusian cars. What  for? Are we seriously planning to catch up with Japan, South  Korea, the United States, Germany, and France in the motor  industry?    [Hryb] In my opinion, priority should primarily be given to  high-tech industries in which we have an appropriate material  base and a qualified staff. However, it will take time to  introduce these structural changes. In general, we do not aim  to catch up with anybody. We should develop those industries in  which we have certain experience and with which we can easily  enter the world market. Nobody in the West would sell us  designs yielding huge profits; most probably they will try to  palm off today's or even yesterday's technologies. With regard  to the conversion of our defense industries, we have a certain  plan which will soon be discussed by the Supreme Soviet.    We are planning to form a nonstaff economic council  subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. The council will  be comprised of 25 leading economists. We are also going to  form a nonstaff committee for legal issues made up of leading  lawyers. The main authors of the Constitution will become  members of the committee.    [Hoytan] A couple of weeks ago, the Russian Gazprom almost  brought the Republic to her knees by announcing a dramatic  reduction of gas shipments. What is being done to improve the  situation and avoid these kinds of cataclysms in the future?    [Hryb] We have managed to resolve this issue. Besides, the  Russian side brought the price down from $80 to $50 per cubic  meter. A governmental delegation headed by Deputy Council of  Ministers Chairman Stanislaw Bryl visited Moscow to discuss this  issue. Moreover, we have reached an agreement to recalculate gas  payments as of January 1994.    [Hoytan] Let us now address the topic which is more familiar  to you, that of fighting crime. What measures does the Supreme  Soviet and the government take to normalize the criminous  situation?    [Hryb] The increase in crime is an acute problem in both  Belarus and other CIS states, where the criminous situation is  no better. While the disruption of the single economic space  brought about most negative economic consequences, the  disruption of the single legal space had an even more dramatic  effect on the increase in crime. Besides, for a long time there  were no state structures in the Republic; in fact state power  was absent altogether. In other words, without a real state  structure there can be no real power.    That was why the Supreme Soviet has recently directed all  its  efforts to adopt a constitution. The Constitution has been  passed and it precisely distinguishes between legislative,  executive, and judicial powers. Our Republic is going to be  presidential. All this will add prestige to the executive power  and will make it possible to step up the fight against crime and  corruption. At the same time, we have drafted a special program  on fighting organized crime. The program will have been  discussed by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and the government by  1 April. Incidentally, we have never had a similar program  before. The issue of fighting crime is being treated at the  state level for the first time ever. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: KLM seeks Fl 1bn to cut debt KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday unveiled plans to raise almost Fl 1bn (Dollars 510m) through a global offering of about 20m ordinary shares. The Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent of KLM, is to maintain its holding by participating in the issue and by buying preference shares. It is estimated that the state would contribute at least Fl 370m. The issue would help reduce long-term debt of Fl 6.3bn and give the group scope to invest. The announcement of the issue, scheduled for March, coincided with news that the Dutch flag carrier achieved a third-quarter net profit of Fl 15m against a Fl 437m loss a year ago. The return to profit in the third quarter, which covers the traditionally weak months of October-December, is due mainly to the fact that KLM no longer carries its 20 per cent stake in Northwest Airlines on its book. In the corresponding period of 1992-93, the Dutch airline took a large extraordinary charge to write down the remaining book value of its investment in Wings Holdings, Northwest Airline's parent company. Its refusal to drop Northwest from its international expansion plans in favour of Swissair's US partner, Delta, was a prime reason for the failure of the four-way European airline merger. The third-quarter improvement also reflects cost-cutting efforts. Salaries and related expenses fell 7 per cent, due partly to a two-year 'holiday' on pension premium contributions. Overall, operating expenses were barely changed at Fl 2.02bn, even though capacity rose 12 per cent. Revenue grew 7 per cent to Fl 2.1bn. Traffic growth was 17 per cent but growth in yields was 8 per cent due to competition and a shift in demand to tourist class. KLM said it expected a fourth-quarter loss. But it repeated earlier forecasts of a 'modest' full-year profit.</p>

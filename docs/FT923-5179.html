			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Renewed dollar weakness hurts bourses THE renewed tumble in the dollar hit currency-sensitive bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell on the dollar, and on a warning from the outgoing president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Mr Heinrich Weiss, that Germany was heading for long-term recession and a sharp rise in unemployment if wage and budget policies are not changed. The DAX index lost 22.55, or 1.3 per cent to 1,518.70 as the dollar registered its lowest ever Frankfurt fixing, dropping to DM1.3977 from DM1.4097. Turnover fell again, from DM4.2bn to DM3.8bn. Dollar stocks, particularly the carmakers, led the declines with Daimler DM10.30 lower at DM617.70, BMW down DM10 to DM499 and Volkswagen off DM9.60 at DM317.50. Lufthansa rose against the trend, adding another DM3.80 for a two day gain of DM11.80, or 12.6 per cent at DM105.80. Unions at the loss-ridden air carrier agreed to a one-year wage freeze on Monday. PARIS recovered from the day's lows but the mood remained cautious. The CAC-40 ended 10.65 down at 1,674.23, after 1,662.47, in thin turnover of FFr1.15bn. Building stocks remained weak following last week's poor housing figures. Lafarge dropped FFr7.20 to FFr264 while Saint-Gobain, also depressed by the impact of the weak dollar on its US earnings, fell FFr10.80 to FFr489.20. News that Baltica, Denmark's biggest insurer, made a loss of DKr991m in the first six months took Suez down by FFr4.10 to FFr224.40. Suez has an indirect stake in Baltica via Victoire. Total closed FFr1.50 lower at FFr207.30 just before first-half results featured a net profit of FFr1.91bn, down 47 per cent. This fell short of market expectations of FFr2.2bn-FFr2.4bn and dealers expected the shares to open lower today. Among smaller stocks, Seb fell another FFr14.10 or 3.7 per cent to FFr370 as the market responded badly for the second day to its disappointing interim results. MILAN hit another low for the year as uncertainty about the French Maastricht referendum Maastricht kept investors on the sidelines. The Comit index fell 5.94 or 1.5 per cent to 384.99 in turnover estimated at around L50bn on the return of London traders, up from Monday's meagre L35.7bn. Montedison, whose chairman Mr Giuseppe Garofano was due to be questioned by a magistrate later in the day over an alleged payment to a political party, lost L20 to L1,101. Fiat lost L77 to L3,942 and Mediobanca by L300 to L10,100. ZURICH eased, the SMI index closing 4.3 lower at 1,747.3, but company news took some shares higher: Alusuisse rose SFr2 to SFr404 as the diversified metals company forecast a 20 to 40 per cent rise in group net profits this year; Oerlikon added SFr3 to SFr449 on a turnround into profit, and Swissair put on SFr10 to SFr560 as it said that income had outpaced costs in July. STOCKHOLM fell across the board in thin trading as high domestic interest rates and a poor performance in major markets abroad dragged prices down. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 21.1 or 2.7 per cent to 751.6 in turnover of SKr342m after SKr260m. Volvo B shares fell SKr11 to SKr257 on news of a SKr2bn cost-cutting programme for its truck division, which was interpreted negatively by the market. COPENHAGEN fell 2.4 per cent, the KFX index shedding 1.88 to a new low of 74.88 as Baltica fell DKr20 to DKr360. Mr Michael Douglas of Bikuben said that the index was pushed down an hour before noon, ahead of the expiry of futures contracts; it stabilised thereafter, but weakened again in the last half-hour of the day. OSLO continued its recent plunge as the deepening crisis in Norway's financial sector dampened investor interest. The all-share index was down 9.77 or 3.1 per cent to 309.12 in thin turnover of NKr156.6m. HELSINKI, a byword for losses this year, managed to fall on profit-taking, the fall of 11.0, or 1.9 per cent to 561.9 wiping nearly all the Hex index had recovered over the previous three days. MADRID closed modestly higher on a batch of steady, or better first half earnings results, Telefonica, and Dragados among them. The general index closed 1.40 higher at 206.37. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index fell 0.8 to 109.1, weighed down by the weak dollar and firm domestic interest rates. ISTANBUL was volatile on reports, later denied, that the yield on nine-month treasury bills would fall by six percentage points. The index rose to a high of 4,234.46 but later fell on profit-taking to end 20.8 up at 4,168.72. TEL AVIV's blue chip index gained 1.77, or 1.1 per cent to 158.12 in response to positive half-year corporate reports.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1010.42  1009.99  1009.52  1009.19  1008.51  1007.34  1007.93  1007.79  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Day's High  1010.95            Day's Low  1005.96  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Aug 28       Aug 27      Aug 26       Aug 25       Aug 24    1013.54      1017.14      997.98       993.01      1010.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

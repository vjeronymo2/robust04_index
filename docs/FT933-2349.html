			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (19): Homecomings call for careful planning - Expatriates and offshore investment / Donald Elkin examines the tax position of Britons who, through choice or circumstances, live abroad, and of those who eventually decide to return SO PERVASIVE is the UK tax system that few of the estimated 2m Britons who live and work overseas manage to escape its clutches completely. Permanent residents of the UK pay tax on a worldwide basis, ie on income, realised capital gains and, when they die, assets too. However, becoming not resident and not ordinarily resident eliminates the income tax charge on all overseas income and some UK sources, too, together with all capital gains - except those arising from assets used in a UK business. Ceasing to be domiciled in any of the countries which make up the UK reduces the inheritance tax charge to UK assets only. Of course, these reductions in UK liability may be achieved only at a cost of paying tax in your host country. Most working expatriates acquire non-residence by being absent on employment for a minimum of a full tax year (April 6 to April 5), and by ensuring that intervening UK visits exceed neither six months in any tax year nor three months a year on average. By contrast, nothing less than permanent emigration will enable you to replace your UK domicile with a domicile of choice in your new country of residence. As will be seen, provided you eschew all UK taxable investments, becoming non-resident will enable you to ignore UK tax factors when making investment decisions - until resumption of UK residence is once again in prospect. Then, it is clearly desirable to plan ahead, not only to avoid untoward results, but also to achieve the optimum tax position available. Resumption of permanent residence in the UK will, in the normal course of events, reinstate worldwide liability. Whilst you have every right to attempt to modify this by the arrangements you make, remember that in doing so, you may be swimming against the legislative tide. Consequently, the Inland Revenue will not disregard any flaws which your plans may contain. Some planning - for example, for pension provision - needs to be effected at very long range; say, 10 years or more before return to the UK. Since non-residents are not permitted to effect UK personal pension plans, various insurance-based schemes are available, using the concept that the proceeds of a qualifying policy (minimum term 10 years) are tax-exempt even in the hands of a UK resident. By means of a fragmented policy structure, such maturity proceeds can be used as a pension. For those who, at the time the benefits are drawn, are liable to higher-rate tax, the advantages can be considerable, since the tax paid by the life companies on their income and gains is at a rate equivalent to the basic rate. However, this fact usually makes the oft-claimed tax advantages illusory as far as basic-rate taxpayers are concerned. Short-range planning is frequently concerned to ensure that the period of transition to the UK does not produce unnecessary disadvantages. Typically, though, the actual date of arrival in Britain is not critical. Or put another way, the cost of delaying that arrival beyond what would otherwise be the most suitable date, usually outweighs the tax which can be saved. However, particular circumstances can be otherwise; for example, if a large payment of investment income or a large capital gain will arise shortly after your chosen date of entry into the UK. Frequently, tax can be avoided by provoking the realisation of accrued capital gains before UK residence is resumed, using the well known 'bed and breakfast' procedure. Somewhat similarly, tax on income from overseas deposit accounts etc. can be minimised by closing them immediately before you return to the UK. By contrast, holding assets in offshore trusts can produce much longer lasting and highly beneficial results, although great care is necessary. A poorly drawn trust can give rise to endless problems. Undoubtedly, the greatest potential benefit is achievable by returnees who are not domiciled in the UK. For them, offshore discretionary trusts have the capacity to produce total exemption from inheritance tax in relation to all assets held within them - even if the individual himself subsequently becomes a UK domiciliary. Capital gains tax advantages can be achieved by overseas and UK domiciliaries alike, particularly if action is taken in a tax year before UK residence is resumed. Neither offshore single-premium bonds nor offshore 'roll-up' funds give rise to a taxable event until benefits are drawn - and in the former case until they exceed 5 per cent a year. Consequently, such investments can be an important means of deferring tax. Indeed, by delaying drawings until your marginal tax rate has declined or your liability has ceased, perhaps as a result of retirement or resumption of non-residence, tax can be permanently avoided. But what if your return is sudden and unexpected, so that you have no time for forward planning? Even then, all is not lost. Dividing assets between you and your spouse, and making use of the government approved tax-exempt schemes (Peps, Tessas and National Savings certificates) can produce a very satisfactory income tax position, although, depending on the figures, more action may be appropriate on the inheritance tax front. Suppose you return from overseas with Pounds 1m to invest, having already purchased a house valued at Pounds 500,000. If the capital is divided equally between you and your spouse and is invested as follows: Pounds                                  Income 104,000 cash                             6,240 46,000 Peps/Tessas/NS certificates      (2,250) 425,000 fixed-interest investments      27,625 425,000 equities                        14,875 1,000,000                     Taxable   48,740                               Exempt     2,250 the resulting tax position will be: 1. Income tax: Pounds 9,782 a year at a top rate of 25 per cent and an average rate of 19.18 per cent. 2. Capital gains tax: exemptions. Inflation plus Pounds 5,800 a year (each). First Pounds 3,635 of gains (each) charged at 25 per cent. Excess at 40 per cent. 3. Inheritance tax: if the first to die leaves assets of Pounds 150,000 to the children and the balance to the surviving partner, no tax will be payable at that time. Liability on the second death: Pounds 480,000 at a marginal rate of 40 per cent and an average rate of 35.55 per cent. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T . Fry, of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: Measuring up While battalions of analysts and researchers in the West have for years been labouring to discover the reality behind Japan's inscrutability, the Japanese themselves are now delving further into their own physical make-up. The Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life is not doing things by halves. Over the next two years it will take 180 measurements from 50,000 people to determine, for instance, the average size of a man's big toe or the length of a woman's nose. Volunteers - 'We have already lined up enough schools, businesses and old people's homes,' says the institute - will have to wear special underwear for the process; the resulting laser measurements will be fed into computers to create 3-D images. The data will be used to set government standards and could help businesses determine the best sizes for everything from toilet seats to rings that commuters hold in crowded trains. Observer hopes the researchers will take other measurements for those gadgets bound for Europe and America.</p>

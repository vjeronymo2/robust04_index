He said the Russian side promised to speed  up the ratification of the treaty which is of much importance  for creating the legal grounds for cooperation between Russia  and Czechia.    The Czech parliamentarian said that meetings with leaders of  the Russian State Duma and Federation Council, with  representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry and of Russian  political parties indicated that changes had taken place in the  Russian foreign policy. During meetings and conversations that  the Czech parliamentary delegation had in Moscow the sides were  not striving to convince each other of anything. They only  exchanged opinions on matters of mutual interest, specifically,  the attitude to the "Partnership for Peace", European security  and prospects for economic cooperation. "We got convinced that  Russia respects Czechia's sovereignty", Jiri Pein said.</p>

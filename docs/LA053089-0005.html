			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIR TAXES  </P> <P> Bernard Waterhouse's suggested "net worth tax" (letter, May 20) would not only  have a destructive effect on the production of wealth and business development,  but would quadruple the "mountain of complex laws, the bureaus, the offices,  the agents, etc." referred to in his letter. We would all be subjected to  hordes of IRS agents invading our homes, demanding entrance to appraise our  furniture, pictures, stocks, bonds, money supply etc. And the opportunity for  corruption would be enormous.  </P> <P> A far more equitable plan is to tax according to benefits received from the  government. As a direct result of government expenditures for roads, schools,  police protection, fire protection, huge fortunes in the form of windfall  increases in land values have been created. This "unearned increment" is wholly  due to societal expenditures, yet very little of such values is recouped by  society in taxes. Much of it goes into the pockets of foreign and out-of-state  corporations who are taking over so much of our common heritage in land and  natural resources.  </P> <P> A net worth tax would take us only another step towards destruction of  individual initiative and free enterprise. Taxes on land values, excluding  homes, buildings and improvements, encourage better use of land, and return to  society a portion of the unearned benefits received due to governmental  expenditures.  </P> <P> STANLEY SAPIRO  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

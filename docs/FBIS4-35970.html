			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by Salim </F> Badawi; place and date not given; from the "The Event"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Dallul] The situation in Lebanon is particularly  solid. The unity of the Lebanese has precedence over all other  issues. All concerned are alive to their responsibilities,  because the enemy is bent on splitting Lebanon, a goal we are  anxious to foil. The martyrs who fell in this treacherous raid  are all Lebanon's martyrs. Today all the Lebanese are in  mourning to illustrate the condemnation by all sectors of the  Lebanese people of this barbaric massacre, the likes of which  was not perpetrated even in the Nazi days. We are solidly  united to counter Israel's attempts that seem bent on  treacherously striking our people and the reconciliation and  healing process in Lebanon.    [Badawi] Mr. Minister, we hear about Israeli troops  concentrations; we also hear the Israeli Prime Minister issue  threats. What kind of counter strategy is the Lebanese  Government adopting?    [Dallul] We are resolved to deploy all means at our  disposal. We are a people that are being victimized. Israel has  committed countless acts of aggression against us. Israel  occupies a part of our territory. Where is the international  community? Why does the international community act on minor  issues, but does nothing to curb Israel's aggression? Israel  has consistently enjoyed a privileged status at the United  Nations and the UN Security Council. The armed forces of the  West were sent to force Iraq into complying with a Security  Council resolution. But the international community and the  United Nations never apply pressure on Israel to make it abide  by Security Council resolutions. We are witnessing the bizarre  situation of Israel going too far in striking a defenseless  people below the belt, and the international community and the  United Nations are turning a blind eye to these acts of  aggression.    The Lebanese people will not stand for their sovereignty,  dignity, and independence being trampled underfoot. We will  confront all aggressions no matter what the cost. All of us  will turn into a resistance. Israel will not manage to realize  its goals. It is aware that any attempt on its part to extend  the territory under its occupation will be very costly. We are  all mobilized to face all eventualities that may arise from  Yitzhaq Rabin's and other Israeli leaders' threats.    [Badawi] Minister Dallul, in the aftermath of the  abduction of al-Dirani a few days ago, and then yesterday's raid  and the international silence over these acts committed by  Israel, is it possible to say the Lebanese resistance against  Israeli occupation forces has lost its international cover?    [Dallul] The resistance has no need for such a cover. The  resistance is doing a patriotic job; it is resisting occupation.    [Badawi] How, then, do you explain the American silence  since  al-Dirani's abduction?    [Dallul] I don't know; this is a question for the United  States to answer. However, what the international community  must understand is that leaving Israel's recklessness  unchallenged serves no one's interests. Israel is not targeting  the Lebanese resistance; it is directing its fire at an  innocent, defenseless, unarmed people. It is torching  agricultural fields and implements and detonating the homes of  the elderly and children. Israel is not facing resistance; it  is targeting the Lebanese people; it is targeting all of  Lebanon. Formerly, Israel worked through agents on Lebanese  territory. But since the Lebanese security agencies uncovered  these cells and their members were put behind bars, Israel has  begun to perpetrate these massacres, having lost the benefit of  the services of its agents. Or maybe it no longer has a  sufficient number of agents to carry out such acts of terror.    [Badawi] Don't you read in these acts that have been going  on  for days a message to the Lebanese Government that it must  disarm Hizballah, as a prelude to a security agreement with  Lebanon within the context of the peace negotiations?    [Dallul] We will not put the cart before the horse. We work  according to the political logic of things. We have a force of  occupation in our country. This occupation must be removed.  Israel's withdrawal comes before anything else. We have stated  that in the event of Israel's pullout not a single operation  will be allowed to originate in Lebanese territory. We have  also stated that the only weapons that will be deployed in the  border areas will be those of the legitimate Lebanese government.    [Badawi] Following Israel's raid yesterday, northern Israel  was hit by Katyusha rockets, despite a kind of year-long truce.  Does that mean that the tacit agreement is now finished?    [Dallul] The Israeli arm has reached as far as the center  and fringes of the al-Biqa'. Israel's shells hit 12- and  14-year olds, and they abducted a Lebanese citizen. What kind  of truce are you talking about?    [Badawi] We may assume, then, further escalation, as  happened last year?    [Dallul] We expect everything. As long as Israel takes our  people and security and homeland for granted, why should we  stand by with our hands tied? If we did, we would be lax in the  discharge of our duties. We are not such people.    [Badawi] Thanks to his excellency, Minister Muhsin Dallul.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Rise and rise of Japan's trade surplus JAPAN'S current account surplus rose 61 per cent last year to a record Dollars 117bn (Pounds 77.4bn) prompting the government to suggest it may further stimulate the economy in an attempt to increase demand for imports and cut the highly sensitive trade surplus. Tokyo fears the trade surplus, up 28 per cent to Dollars 132bn, will draw criticism from the new US administration, which has indicated a tougher approach to the trade deficit with Japan. Exports rose 7.9 per cent and imports fell 2.6 per cent over the year, as domestic demand fell with the slowing of the economy. The finance ministry blamed the increase in exports on a stronger yen, but the figure also reflected a shift to higher value-added exports and the sustained international demand for Japanese quality. For the month of December, the current account surplus was 10.4 per cent higher at Dollars 11.45bn, a record for the month and the 21st consecutive month of year-on-year increases. The trade surplus for the month rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 13.08bn. Balance of payments figures for the year showed that foreigners' net purchases of Japanese stocks were Dollars 8.5bn, compared to Dollars 45.2bn in the previous year, suggesting that international investors have yet to regain confidence in the Tokyo stock market. However, Japanese investors were net sellers of Dollars 3bn in foreign stocks, against net purchases of Dollars 3.6bn in 1991. The turnaround highlights the retreat of Japanese money from international equity markets, though Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds were Dollars 35.6bn, down from Dollars 68.2bn in the previous year. The long-term capital account showed a deficit of Dollars 28.07bn for the year, compared to a surplus of Dollars 37.06bn in 1991, while the overall balance of payments had a surplus of Dollars 71.60bn, declining from the Dollars 76.37bn recorded in the previous year. Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the vice finance minister, said Japan did not deserve criticism from trading partners because 'we are not flooding other countries with exports' and destabilising the world economy. He said the reduction in the official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent on Thursday should rekindle economic growth. But ministry officials admitted that the surplus will remain large for at least this year, as a recovery in the economy is unlikely before the second half.</p>

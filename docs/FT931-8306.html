			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN cocoa talks enter final round INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation delegates gather in Geneva on Monday for a fourth and final attempt to thrash out a new cocoa agreement under the auspices of the United Nations. Producers and consumers from 45 countries remain far apart after three previous rounds, but observers are not writing off an agreement yet. 'Never underestimate the powers of the UN negotiators, who spend all their lives pushing this sort of thing through,' said one London analyst yesterday. Another pointed out that the last cocoa agreement took five rounds to negotiate, and only in the last did things get moving. The 1986 agreement, which is operating on a purely adminstrative basis, ends on September 30. Unlike the coffee agreement, the cocoa accord has no scope for further extensions. While producers and consumers were in November moving towards agreement over the amount of cocoa which should be withheld from world markets to support prices (between 330,000 and 380,000 tonnes), they were nowhere near agreeing how to finance such a scheme. The current agreement's market support system collapsed early in 1988 when the ICCO buffer stock hit the maximum permitted level of 250,000 tonnes. Since then some of the cocoa has been sold to finance storage of the remaining 233,000 tonnes. The buffer stock is owed Dollars 137m in unpaid levies, with the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, owing Dollars 75m. The EC, which accounts for 40 per cent of cocoa consumption, is adamant that any new agreement should be financed by sales from the buffer stock and payment of existing levy arrears by some producers. However, producers feel that the financial burden of any new agreement should be shared. If the financial hurdle is overcome in the next fortnight, the two sides will still have to agree a price range to be defended. Producers in November proposed a range between 1,180 Special Drawing Rights a tonne and SDR 1,770, while consumers urged SDR 840 to SDR 1,260. The ICCO 10-day indicator price was SDR 713.77 on Tuesday. Adding to the difficulties are the fact that the US, the biggest consumer, is not in the agreement, neither are Malaysia and Indonesia, the fourth and fift biggest producers, who are attending the Geneva talks as observers.</p>

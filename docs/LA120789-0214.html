			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: 'THAT AIDS TEST' SUFFERS FROM SOME COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS  </P> <P> When acquired immune deficiency syndrome first made headlines in the early  1980s, many Americans looked upon the devastating disease as something that  happened only to other people. But as AIDS continues to spread, a growing  number have become concerned -- realistically or not -- that somehow they might  have been exposed to the virus.  </P> <P> From heterosexual singles to gay men to friends, relatives and even casual  acquaintances of people with AIDS, more and more Orange County residents are  inquiring about "that AIDS test." Some ask their family doctors; others call  the AIDS Response Program's hot line, the Red Cross or other agencies.  </P> <P> "That's actually one of the most frequent things people call us about," says  Tim Miller of the AIDS Response Program. "They think they may have put  themselves at risk, or they've already decided but they're looking for a test  site, or they want more information about anonymity vs. confidentiality."  </P> <P> But misconceptions abound when it comes to AIDS, and the same holds true for  AIDS testing.  </P> <P> First, what is generally referred to as an AIDS test is actually a test for  antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is no direct test  for the virus itself. And if a person does have HIV antibodies, that is not the  same as having either AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). Someone who is  antibody-positive may have no symptoms at all for years after being exposed, if  ever.  </P> <P> Those at risk for HIV exposure include: men who have had sex with other men;  intravenous drug users who have shared needles and sexual partners of such drug  users; transfusion and blood-product recipients between 1977 and March, 1985,  as well as their sexual partners; and people who have had multiple sexual  partners or engaged in unprotected intercourse or unprotected oral sex, Miller  says.  </P> <P> For several years after the HIV-antibody test was developed in 1985, many of  those in legitimate risk groups avoided taking it because they felt there was  nothing to be gained. Now, however, "there is a very good body of medical  research which tells us that early intervention and treatment of people who are  HIV-positive but asymptomatic can effectively delay or maybe even prevent the  onset of the disease," Miller says.  </P> <P> Still, many of those at risk remain reluctant. "We know that there are a lot of  people out there who are still very scared to take the test," Miller says.  "There are so many implications with it: discrimination, people rejecting you,  and also just a lot of fear about knowing. Despite the fact that there's this  very optimistic news, a lot of people look at a positive diagnosis as the next  thing to a death sentence.  </P> <P> "But something can be done if you're HIV-positive. We're looking at the place  where we may be able to make HIV infection a chronic manageable disease on the  order of diabetes. And we really need the people to step forward who have put  themselves at risk. We have people who can assist them in discussing their  fears and help them see the benefit of taking the test."  </P> <P> Conversely, there are those who aren't in any high-risk category -- and some  who have no possibility of exposure -- who insist on being tested. AIDS can be  transmitted only by direct contact with blood, semen or vaginal secretions of  an infected person, Miller explains. "And that potentially infected fluid has  to have contact with your blood system.  </P> <P> "You can't get AIDS from a doorknob, or if a person with AIDS is in the same  room or on the same planet with you," Miller says. "But we still get calls from  people who don't understand that. It gets pretty far-fetched."  </P> <P> Miller says many of the calls to the AIDS Response Program are from people who  "have had a casual sexual encounter that they feel guilty about, when in fact  they didn't put themselves at risk at all, or that risk was extremely minimal."  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Schaaf, a family practitioner who works out of Saddleback Memorial  Medical Center, says the question "comes up quite a bit" in his practice.  "Patients bring it up in a lot of different circumstances," he says. "Most  commonly, it's someone who is young, single and still out in the dating world  who really doesn't know what their exposure has been, and they're having a  little trouble sleeping at nights worrying about it. Or you have somebody who's  been married for a couple of years, and they're starting to worry about their  dating life before they got married. And you also get people who have a  relative or friend who has come down with AIDS."  </P> <P> For those who are confused, Schaaf explains how the disease is transmitted.  "But generally, if they're worried, we go ahead and have (the test) done."  </P> <P> Although the HIV-antibody test is more than 99% accurate, false positives are  possible. To be certain, the blood of all those who test positive is put  through another kind of test for confirmation.  </P> <P> Also, there is a "window" of about six months in which a person who has been  exposed may not yet have developed antibodies.  </P> <P> "Generally, if the patient brings the subject up, I'm kind of nosy," says Dr.  John Quinn, a family practitioner in Garden Grove. "I want to know if they have  a risk factor, and if it's a valid one, then by all means we do the test."  </P> <P> With callers to the AIDS Response Program's hot line, Miller says: "We try to  determine whether there's any need for testing based on where, and how  frequent, the exposure may have been. If a person has had a blood transfusion  prior to 1985, or if a person has used IV drug needles, particularly in  high-risk geographical areas such as New York, any time in the last seven  years, definitely.  </P> <P> "In any situation where a man has had sex with a man, we would always recommend  HIV-antibody testing. For heterosexual intercourse in Orange County, there's  less of a chance that they had contact with an infected person than in  someplace like New York." Of course, contact with a person from a high-risk  area, or someone who has had contact with that person, makes exposure more  likely.  </P> <P> Although California law requires that HIV-antibody test results be kept  confidential, Miller believes that complete anonymity is the best guarantee.  </P> <P> "We only recommend that people go to the . . . test sites around the county  where testing is done anonymously," he says. "We still do not have  discrimination protection for people who are HIV-positive.  </P> <P> "Also, (these) test sites use the highest quality testing procedures, so that  by the time a person gets back a positive test result, the blood has been  divided four ways and tested three times by one test and one more time by  another."  </P> <P> Yet another advantage to these test sites is the counseling that is an integral  part of the process, Miller says. "All the sites we recommend have both  pre-test and post-test counseling. And that's very important both for  understanding the process and for risk reduction."  </P> <P> Quinn, however, says there are advantages to being tested through your family  doctor. "Whenever the subject comes up, that gives me the opportunity to bring  up safe sex, even if the test is negative. Even if we find out that AIDS is not  much of a risk in this particular patient, we can talk about other matters,  such as birth control, for example."  </P> <P> Some of his patients may blush, but Quinn says he uses questions about AIDS as  a springboard to explain the proper use of condoms ("Most guys don't know how  to use them properly -- you should always leave a little room at the end,  withdraw immediately and hold the condom as you do") and explain the risk  factors. "People may listen to us when they might not be willing to hear it  from anybody else," he says.  </P> <P> In any case, experts say, those who have been at risk for AIDS should never use  blood donation as a testing method. Although all donated blood is tested for  HIV antibodies, there is always the slight possibility that infected blood  could slip through undetected, particularly if a person has been exposed but  has not yet developed antibodies.  </P> <P> The Red Cross does notify donors who test positive, but it is legally required  to wait 60 days before doing so. The delay is intended to discourage blood  donations for the purpose of AIDS testing.  </P> <P> The AIDS Response Program recommends these Orange County test sites:  </P> <P> * Orange County Health Care Agency, Special Diseases Clinic, 1725 W. 17th St.,  Santa Ana.

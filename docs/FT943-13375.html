			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Prison-building programme 'hit by delays' The extensive prison-building and modernisation programme in England and Wales has been dogged by cost overruns and delays, the National Audit Office says in a report published today. The public expenditure watchdog found that costs exceeded estimates in every one of the seven new prison projects - all completed since 1991 - examined for the report. There were also overruns on 15 refurbishment programmes. Total construction costs for the seven prisons were Pounds 475m - Pounds 78.9m more than the estimated costs. With Woodhill, near Milton Keynes, the cost of Pounds 102.3m was 31 per cent over the tender price. The time taken to build the seven prisons varied between three years and eight-and-a-half years, the report says. On all 15 of the refurbishment projects, the final cost exceeded the contract price by 10 per cent or more. Seven of the 15 were completed in time, with significant delays on some of the rest. The watchdog says however that the building and modernisation programme is the greatest effort to improve conditions and provide accommodation since the 19th century. It also commends the Prison Service for reducing the average time to build a prison from seven years to four years. Delays and extra costs were incurred because of changes in design - often the fault of contractors - and improvements required by the service, some of them prompted by incidents at other prisons. The report puts the blame for many of the problems on the service for overloading project managers. The service gives managers a workload that leaves them little time for adequate financial and managerial control. It also says that Treasury rules limiting the scope for carrying forward unspent money constrain effective management of prison building works. Control of Prison Building Projects. HMSO. Pounds 8.95.</p>

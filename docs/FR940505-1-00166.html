			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Additional Measures for the South Coast. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Fleet Average Standard Program. The reductions required for the South Coast to attain the air quality standards by 2010 cannot be achieved without significant reductions in every source of emissions. EPA estimates the national program for freshly manufactured locomotives would reduce emissions in the South Coast by approximately 5 percent to 7 percent by 2005 and 11 percent to 14 percent by 2010. The addition of either option 1 or option 2 for in service locomotives would result in total reductions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in the South Coast of approximately 35 percent to 43 percent in 2005 and 38 percent to 46 percent in 2010. <FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>  As the total NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction from all sources required in the South Coast is 70 percent, EPA would like to achieve percent reductions of this magnitude from the rail industry. These requirements call for a more stringent program regulating locomotive emissions. EPA's plan to further regulate locomotive emissions in the South Coast, hereafter referred to as the ``South Coast locomotive fleet average standard program,'' is designed to achieve reductions on this order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Actual emission reductions for the South Coast from the national program may be slightly lower than the national average because locomotives moving freight out of and into this area tend to be somewhat newer than the national fleet. Newer locomotives are generally cleaner than older locomotives; thus the emission reductions due to an emissions standard for a newer fleet would not be as large as that for an older fleet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not currently proposing to require additional locomotive control measures for the Sacramento and Ventura FIP areas. EPA believes that Sacramento does not need further NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions beyond the programs described above to meet its attainment requirements. Ventura's train traffic is very limited, and any additional program there would only achieve small benefits, with costs out of proportion to the benefits received. EPA determined that further reductions are necessary for the South Coast, due to its massive non-attainment problems, and the significance therefore of any source of pollution. Locomotives currently contribute 2 percent of South Coast NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and that percent contribution would be expected to rise without further regulation, due to the regulation of other South Coast emission sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes and asks for comment on the following locomotive NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reduction plan for the South Coast. All railroad locomotives or locomotive engines used by a railroad company in the South Coast area would be averaged together to achieve an average emission standard level. EPA proposes that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission levels from the regulated sources must be no greater than 5.5 g/bhp-hr by 2007 and 4.0 g/bhp-hr by 2010. Average emission levels would be calculated for each railroad company based upon fuel usage and engine emission levels. For each ton of emissions over this average, a noncompliance fee will be assessed based on the $10,000/ton figure used for on highway heavy-duty engines. EPA is interested in including other locomotive emission sources <FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>  in the average but has very little information regarding use or emissions levels. Commenters are urged to provide this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Additional sources may include but not be limited to the following items: track maintenance equipment, locomotive maintenance equipment, and roundhouse emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program preserves as much flexibility as possible for railroad companies to meet the additional emission reductions in the South Coast. This flexibility will allow individual railroad companies to reduce emissions in the most cost effective manner possible for their companies. EPA believes that an averaging program will be the most cost effective method of reducing locomotive emissions in the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Starting January 1, 2007 and effective until December 31, 2009, each individual railroad company that operates within the South Coast will be required to meet on average, an emissions level of 5.5 g/bhp-hr. Starting January 1, 2010 and in effect thereafter, each individual railroad company that intends to operate within the South Coast will be required to meet on average an emissions level of 4.0 g/bhp-hr. Average emissions would be calculated based on fuel usage. The g/bhp-hr level of a locomotive engine would be multiplied by the gallons of fuel that an engine consumed during a given year within the South Coast nonattainment area. The products of the locomotives' g/bhp-hr level and fuel usage would be summed for all of the engines in a railroad company's fleet. The resultant sum would then be divided by the total gallons of fuel used. The resultant g/bhp-hr average must be at or below 5.5 g/bhp-hr for the years 2007&hyph;2009 and below 4.0 g/bhp-hr for 2010 and thereafter. This calculation is summarized in an equation in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA realizes there may be alternatives to basing the average calculation on fuel usage such as basing the average calculation on mileage or hours of operation. These two alternatives do not necessarily reflect emissions level well because they take improper account of idling. However, EPA is interested in comments regarding the appropriate measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that electrified mileage be counted as producing zero emissions as long as the electrical powerplants supplying the electricity are located outside of the South Coast. If the powerplants were inside South Coast, some calculation of the pollutants created from the production of the electricity consumed would have to be used. Additionally, a conversion factor to equate kilowatt hours used to gallons of fuel used would be necessary so appropriate credit may be given for electrification for purposes of calculating the emissions average. The Department of Energy recently proposed a rule, ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Vol. 59, No. 24, February 4, 1994), that specifies how to calculate such a conversion factor. EPA requests comment on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

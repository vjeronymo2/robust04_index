			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 23 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government's  anti-inflationary program was strongly supported today when, in  a final vote, the bicameral Congress approved the Social  Emergency Fund, described as a vital instrument for the  program's implementation.    The Social Emergency Fund bill received 402 votes,  equivalent  to 80 percent of the 500 congressmen -- of a total of 584 -- who  participated in the vote. Ninety-five legislators voted against  the government.    After the general support for the bill, the congressmen will  vote on various proposals to change particular points. The  government guarantees that it has enough support to achieve the  rejection of these proposals to change particular points.    The Social Emergency Fund, endowed with $16 billion, will  allow the government to curb inflation through direct control on  public spending in social security and special health and  housing programs and programs to eradicate hunger and misery.</p>

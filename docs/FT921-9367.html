			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Top underwriter bloody but unbowed  -Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who acted to recover heavy losses THE PROFESSIONAL reputation of Mr Richard Outhwaite, the 56-year-old underwriter at the heart of the affair, will be dented by yesterday's settlement but seems likely to remain intact. Bearing in mind the way Mr Outhwaite has been pilloried in the press and by the prosecution in the case, that might be surprising. Mr Anthony Boswood QC, for the prosecution, said Mr Outhwaite had been responsible for the City's biggest and most costly act of 'single-handed negligence'. Yet with the exception of the disastrous 1982 year, when Mr Outhwaite reinsured the loss-making contracts that are the subject of yesterday's accord, his record has been an impressive one. His syndicate - 317/661  - has produced profits in every single other year of its existence. Names have queued to obtain places on it. Many who are party to the legal action against him voluntarily remain members of his syndicate. This year the syndicate's capacity - the amount of premium it can accept on behalf of Names - will increase from the Pounds 66m of last year. Ironically, in view charges against him for underwriting asbestosis risks, Mr Outhwaite has won a reputation as a technically correct underwriter. In a market where many underwriters are given to undercutting their rivals in order to increase their share of the market, he insists on setting the right rate for the risk and has been bitterly critical of under-pricing by fellow underwriters - which he has labelled 'the very opposite of good business practice, and economic suicide.' Yesterday he was to be found - 'subdued and thoughtful', according to a colleague, at his Lloyd's box (the open-plan office used by all underwriters) insuring the ships and cargoes in which his syndicate specialises.</p>

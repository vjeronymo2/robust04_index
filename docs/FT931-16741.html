			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Personal View: Look to consultants for NHS efficiency As if to be sure of starting the new year with a new crisis, the government is planning to lose no time in cutting London hospitals. Though the official Tomlinson report that recommends closing 2,500 acute beds in central London looks increasingly tattered as 'consultation' proceeds, health ministers say the government will not waver. The official line is that central London is overprovided with acute hospitals, but general practitioner and community services need strengthening. The latter is beyond dispute. However, in a wider appraisal of London's health services, a King's Fund report concluded that inner London was not over-bedded. Tomlinson's approach to the problem of assessing future needs for health services in central London was casual - 'we have looked briefly at various indicators'. The report is full of contradictions; for example, it says that on average 'Londoners are no less healthy than people elsewhere', yet on the next page mentions death rates 21 per cent above average for people aged 15-64. Similarly, Tomlinson refers to 'large numbers of homeless people' and quotes a 'conservative estimate' of 60,000 people in London sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation. But what, if anything, is allowed for extra hospital needs for homeless people is (typically) not stated. The implication is that it is nothing. Though Tomlinson found that waiting times for treatment in inner London are generally longer than average, he treated the problem as unimportant because they had recently improved somewhat. Nonetheless, at June 1992, and even on government figures, one in seven patients of inner London teaching hospitals had waited more than a year for elective treatment, after the wait for original consultations. Then Tomlinson's assessment of acute hospital beds was that inner London beds were not used efficiently. For instance, he says London teaching hospitals in 1990-91 treated 1,000 'episodes of care' in 20.3 beds on average whereas teaching districts outside London used 18.8 beds. Tomlinson assumes that because such 'patient throughput' has been speeding up in the UK and because some patients are being sent to outer hospitals, inner London needs about 2,500 fewer beds. He doesn't tells us - because he doesn't know  -how much London slowness is due to inefficiency and how much to other factors such as in-patients not having a suitable place for discharge. Perhaps the most critical feature Tomlinson overlooked was the mushrooming of commercial medicine since the Thatcher government in effect deregulated NHS consultants' contracts in 1980. A recent King's Fund report estimates that 'full-time' and part-time NHS consultants in greater London as a group now earn more from private fees than from the NHS. However, research has shown the critical importance of consultants in determining hospital efficiency. Are they available? Are they diligent in supervising their junior staff? What should be done? First, the one sensible proposal in Tomlinson should be implemented at once  -the strengthening of GP and community services. Second, now that commercial medicine in London has grown from a marginal to a major commitment for many consultants, they should be asked to choose which demanding job they want to do, NHS or commercial medicine. Since waiting lists are the main reason people use commercial medicine, it is bizarre to put the senior NHS medical staff into a conflict of interest worth another Pounds 50,000 a year on average. Third, the auditor and comptroller general should make his presence felt. Consultants who look in briefly at their NHS hospitals and then spend the day in commercial medicine are giving their staff too much exciting experience and defrauding the NHS. When contracts have been tightened, when waiting lists have been cut and when community care has been rejuvenated, it will be time to implement other long-term plans for Londoners' health. Plan, that is, from a competent, on-going health planning group for the capital that should be set up now. The author is emeritus consultant to Guy's Hospital</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays SOME ARTS are live arts, and in recent decades a few creative artists have taken that liveness to new extremes. Back in 1953, Merce Cunningham made an audience draw cards from a pack to determine the order in which the sections of his new work, Dime a Dance, would be performed. In 1980, Alan Aycbourn began experimenting with a similar method - giving variable middle scenes to his 1980 Sisterly Feelings; and later providing 16 different potential endings to Intimate Exchange. Now, in the second part of Ayckbourn's Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays, the audience votes for which route little Suzy and her dog Neville take through the vast and many-roomed house of the sinister Mr Acousticus. Down the passage or into the music-room? Down into the garden or up in the lift? You vote; they follow your poll. Later, as they escape, you are asked to help them remember which route they came by: which proves much harder. And part of the fun en route is that Mr Acousticus has stolen sound and misplaced it  -so that the noises of the house are all topsy-turvy. Rats sound like motorcycles; doors open like sheep baaing; a harp sounds like a drum. The play, first shown in Scarborough in 1988 but now new to London, is designated by the National Theatre 'for children (of 6 upwards) and intelligent adults'. Its story shows us Ayckbourn in Roald Dahl vein. The idea that sound can be stolen - even from the birds on the trees (wonderful touch) - and stored and given to the wrong object recalls Dahl's BFG and his bottlefuls of dreams. Another nice stroke is the way Suzy first hears about the loss of sound. Her sometime pal, the pleasant but exaggerating Mr Passerby, explains to her that he used to be an opera singer until he lost his voice; and that his current voice is nothing like his former one. 'Whenever there's an opera on TV or the radio, I always listen, and try and see if I can recognise it.' This is Ayckbourn making magically sensible nonsense in the tradition that descends via Dahl from Lewis Carroll. But does some of it sound a bit too sweet, too cute? Well, some of it is. I, like almost everybody, loved Suzy's huge, silly, restless dog Neville (Adam Godley) - though surely his bark should be louder. But Suzy herself (Judith McSpadden) tended to be rather yuckily Andy-Pandy - and too goody-two-shoes for comfort. Only Neville is charcaterised with any detail; the rest are one-dimensional. Two male narrators steer us through the story, and they are part of the reason that Part One plods. Of the two six-year-olds near me, one perked up only in Part Two - by which time the other had gone home. In Part Two, however, you could hear six-year-old gurgles and excitement everywhere. Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays means to show kids just how much more lively a live art is than a screen one, but it comes close to underestimating its audience. At the Cottesloe; then goes on tour to Poole, Whitley Bay, Dartford, Oxford, Preston and Coventry in April and May</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softens on rate news THE dollar weakened slightly against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank revealed that it would not be cutting the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to German commercial banks, writes James Blitz. Currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were mostly unaffected by the Bundesbank's decision to leave the 14-day repo in its weekly securities repurchase tender unchanged at 8.49 per cent. However, the German central bank's decision showed a far more cautious stance on monetary policy than foreign exchange dealers had expected, and the run-up to tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting will be unsettled. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, believes that if the discount rate is not reduced, the French franc will break through the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark in the ERM, closer to its floor of FFr3.4330. For some days now, the dollar has been trading in a broad range of DM1.62 to DM1.6650, restrained by indicators that show the US economy is recovering at only a sluggish pace. Yesterday's move by the Bundesbank underlined that the differential between US and German short-term rates may remain in the D-Mark's favour for some time to come. There was also a disappointing economic indicator, with US new home sales dropping 13.8 per cent in January after a downward revised 4.7 per cent increase in December. The dollar finished in London at DM1.6425 from a previous DM1.6465. In New York it slipped further to close at DM1.6390. In Europe, the French franc remained fairly steady against the D-Mark, ending at FFr3.389 from a previous FFr3.394. Sterling gained a pfennig, closing at DM2.3800. Some dealers had expected the British currency to perform more strongly in the wake of comments from the Bank of England governor that UK base rates would rise if the currency depreciated further. Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation believes that if sterling breaks above DM2.40 in the next few days, it will have been through the worst. On German rates, Mr O'Neill said: 'It is a brave person who has a confident view about the Bundesbank in the run-up to a council meeting. There is a clear group in the council who are in favour of easing and will be in favour of easing again.' But he also believes that, whatever the Bundesbank does, it will be hard for the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt to stay in the ERM. 'Their relatively poor fundamentals and, most importantly, the instability of the lira and sterling make it increasingly difficult for this group to remain within the ERM,' he said. The yen firmed against the dollar to Y117.70 from Y118.60, and in New York closed at Y117.58. It will remain buoyed by repatriation of Japanese funds as the financial year-end approaches on March 31 but may decline after that.</p>

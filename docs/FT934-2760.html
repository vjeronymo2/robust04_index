			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Smells for men with refined taste If you are bewildered by the confusing array of men's scents on sale this Christmas, look no further than the superior smells made by the House of Creed, writes John Morgan of GQ. One of the few remaining privately owned parfumeurs, Creed was once a British company but it moved to Paris on the suggestion of the Empress Eugenie and is still to be found in its beautiful premises in Paris's luxurious 8th arrondissement. Its scents are as distinguished as its list of clients which has included emperors, kings and others with fragrant aspirations of imperial proportions. The best of the range is Green Irish Tweed - a wonderfully-civilised and beguiling blend of floral, green and woody notes. The Chablis of the scent world, it enjoys a cult following among the men's style press. The range also includes Zeste Mandarin Pamplemousse, which, as its name suggests, is fresh and citrusy; Orange spice, a classically masculine concoction of oranges, clove and cinnamon; the rich and woody Bois de Portugal; and the latest offering, Erolfa, a bracingly oceanic fragrance that combines the fashionable ozonic note with bergamot, sandalwood and ambergris. Some of the scents bear the millesime classification which denotes a higher concentration of essences than ordinary eau de toilettes, and therefore a more enduring and profound smell. Prices start at Pounds 38.95 from Les Senteurs, 227 Ebury St, London SW1 (mail order 071-730-2322); Harrods Knightsbridge, London SW1; Liberty, Regent St, London W1; Selfridges, Oxford St, London W1; Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1; Frogget, Brighton and Tunbridge Wells. Jo Malone is one of London's best-kept secrets. For several years she has been tending some of the most high-profile skins in the UKand many have become addicted to her hand-made range of body lotions, bath oils and colognes. She uses French limeblossom, nutmeg, ginger, muguet, lime with basil and verbenas of Provence to scent the potions and her packaging is impressively simple - elegantly plain glass flagons for the oils and cologne and they come in beautiful ivory and black boxes tied with grosgrain ribbons. A large box of pot-pourri smelling deliciously of wild orange and ginger is Pounds 27, a small box containing two flagons of bath oil and cologne is Pounds 29.95, a large box containing two decanters of bath oil and cologne is Pounds 59.95 (the prices do not include postage and packing). Orders can only be made by telephone: 071-589-5600.</p>

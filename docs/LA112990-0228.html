Final  </P> <P> 3 SAN FERNANDO RESIDENTS DIE IN UNRELATED KILLINGS  </P> <P> Los Angeles police this morning were attempting to identify killers in the  unrelated deaths of three San Fernando residents, including a Van Nuys man who,  after being shot outside a supermarket, drove himself 2 1/2 miles to a hospital  before dying.  </P> <P> There were no suspects in any of the slayings and the exact motive for each  attack was not known, detectives said.  </P> <P> Clarage R.

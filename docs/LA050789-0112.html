			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS IN REVIEW  </P> <P> Peter Hebbethwaite's review of Penny Lernoux's "People of God" was beneath your  usual standards. Knowing your preference for "authority" reviewers who are  authors or chairs of commissions and universities, I can see why you chose  Lernoux's colleague at the Reporter, but I don't know why you persisted in  printing the review you received. We find out very little about the book  reviewed, much more about the book reviewer.  </P> <P> I disagree with much of Lernoux's thesis, but I think she makes a cogent case  and the review you ran failed to do it justice.  </P> <P> JOHN PAUL ARNERICH  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

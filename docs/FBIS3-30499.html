			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] The Velika Kladusa War Presidency today issued an  appeal to its citizens, asking [word indistinct] residents and  members of [Fikret Abdic's] paramilitary formations in  particular to be sensible and to place themselves under the  command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Velika Kladusa has  been experiencing unprecedented terror and (?suffering) under  the veil of [word indistinct] quasi democracy for (?six) months,  the appeal states. The peace that was established on 12 January  has only partially helped us to alleviate the consequences of  Abdic's insane idea.    We are most concerned by the fact that our town, your town,  is now full of foreigners, who are pushing arms into people's  hands, people who, for their own aims, have caused a fratricidal  war. The arms that they have pushed into people's hands will  always be an obstacle to peace and therefore we should listen to  reason.    The appeal further states that Velika Kladusa has been  burdened by about 2,000 orphans since 3 October last year,  children whose fathers have been killed. They were forced into  a struggle for some kind of a quasi state. There are many more  children in this region who are without fathers. This should be  a warning to listen to reason and find a peaceful settlement of  the crisis, the appeal of the Velika Kladusa War Presidency  states, asking its citizens, particularly members of the  paramilitary formations, to be sensible and place themselves  under the command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10  February of this year.</p>

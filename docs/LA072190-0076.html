			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY HURT BY SAW GETTING LOTS OF SUPPORT DURING RECOVERY  </P> <P> Antonio Galvan and his 3-year-old son, Ryan, are nearly inseparable. And since  Tuesday, when the shipping clerk's only son was nearly cut in half by an  electric circular saw, the two have grown closer than ever.  </P> <P> With the exception of a quick trip to his Fullerton home for a shower and a  change of clothing Thursday afternoon, Galvan has ventured no farther from  Ryan's side than the cafeteria at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where the  boy, the youngest of five Galvan children, remains in critical but stable  condition.  </P> <P> Each evening, Galvan has put aside a good night's sleep to stand by the frail  boy's side, stroking his thick, black hair and whispering encouraging words in  his ear while nurses periodically replace fluid bottles and check the various  tubes that are connected to his small body.  </P> <P> "Now that he's awake all the time," Galvan said, "he is hurting a lot. He  doesn't want me to go away."  </P> <P> Ryan was injured around 4 p.m. Tuesday when he wandered outside his family's  West Baker Avenue home after he and his father had returned from a trip to the  grocery store.  </P> <P> Nearby, a family friend who was using the power saw to replace some front  windows on the house had put the tool down -- plugged in and without a  protective guard around its blade. As the friend walked away to get another  blade, Ryan, fascinated by tools, picked up the saw.  </P> <P> Seconds later, Galvan was putting away groceries when he heard his son scream  for him.  </P> <P> "I lost track of him for just a moment," Galvan said.  </P> <P> The saw blade became embedded in the boy's lower abdomen, severing much of his  large and small intestines but, luckily, leaving his stomach and other vital  organs mostly intact, doctors said. The boy, who underwent four hours of  surgery, is expected to fully recover.  </P> <P> Hospital spokeswoman Ellen S. Ball said that hospital administrators have  arranged for a trust fund to be established at a local bank and are encouraging  concerned callers to send checks to help defray the cost of the soaring  hospital bill that the family is expected to face.  </P> <P> She said that the hospital has already received dozens of calls from  well-wishers inquiring about where to send money, get-well cards, balloons and  flowers.  </P> <P> "For every person that called and offered help," Ball said, "I believe that  there are many more who haven't called but want to."  </P> <P> Lois Rotruck, an administrator for Security Pacific National Bank, said that  she opened the free account on Thursday afternoon after Ball called.  </P> <P> "It's the least we can do, from one human being to another," said Rotruck, who  visited Ryan as he rested in the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit.  "This little guy is really the hero in all this. He's a real little trouper."  </P> <P> Galvan said that insurance will pay 80% of the bill. The remaining 20%, Ball  acknowledged, is likely to run into the thousands. Galvan said he may have to  mortgage his house or liquidate some life insurance to come up with the money.  </P> <P> His son is expected to remain in intensive care for at least another six days  and then be transferred to another room for an undetermined period.  </P> <P> "We don't know when he will come home," Galvan said. "But he is real tired of  the place. He keeps telling me to take him home."  </P> <P> To keep Ryan's mind off the recurring pain that racks his body, hospital staff  brought in a videocassette recorder so that he can watch "Ghostbusters" and  "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," his two favorite movies, Galvan said. In addition,  his bed is cluttered with stuffed cartoon characters such as Bart Simpson,  Mickey Mouse and Wile E. Coyote.  </P> <P> Galvan said that Ryan does not consciously recall any details surrounding the  accident. He still wonders how he got hurt and ended up in the hospital.  </P> <P> Gracie Galvan, the boy's mother, said he sometimes is startled by loud whirring  sounds.  </P> <P> "Someone was using a vacuum cleaner outside (the intensive care ward)," she  said. "It woke him up, and he started crying. I think he was afraid. . . ."  </P> <P> Antonio Galvan said the family is considering psychological therapy for the boy  once he is released from the hospital. But he is confident that the only  permanent scar the boy will carry is the one that will stretch across his  belly.  </P> <P> "He's going to be fine," Galvan said.  </P></p>

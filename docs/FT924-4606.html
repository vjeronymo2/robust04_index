			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): Hambro's head for innovation A BIOGRAPHY OF JOCELYN HAMBRO by Andrew St George Printed by Cambridge University Press, available on request from J O Hambro Ltd 'MERCHANT bankers aren't supposed to be conventional bankers; merchant bankers are supposed to be risk-takers, as opposed to joint stock (clearing) bankers who never take a risk but manage to lose money all the same.' Whether an insight - or a spirited aside about his profession - it reflects the quintessential Jocelyn Hambro style which permeates this short, fascinating biography by Andrew St George. Banking is obviously in the blood, but it is the 'fringe activities' expansionist moves initiated under the stewardship of Jocelyn and his cousin Charles which created the real excitement. Were they ahead of their time, diversifying into unit trust management, venture capital, insurance broking, investment management, Eurobonds, corporate finance, forming trading companies and the first consortium bank in London and becoming involved in various forms of banking business worldwide? Jocelyn was 46 and had worked in the bank for 20 years when he took over as chairman in 1965, remaining fairly active until the late 1980s. People liked dealing with him. He was also a good picker and delegator. But in spite of his privileged background and what must have been an enormously satisfying career, there were many tragic phases. His two brothers died young. The mother he adored drowned when he was 13. He was not happy at school, even less so at Heidelberg just before the war, during which he was seriously wounded. His first two wives died of cancer. Silvia, his first wife and mother of his three sons, must have been a character and a tower of strength. She forbade any business discussion at home. At Christmas she shopped in bulk for their 26 godchildren at the Houndsditch Warehouse. Silvia's death left the family devastated. Her parents, the Roland Muirs, were clearly a great comfort. Roland Muir had teamed up with the late Anthony Fisher who created Buxted Chicken which Hambro floated and also founded the Institute of Economic Affairs. A wide circle of banking and business friends, fellow sportsmen, wartime colleagues and charities he worked for with dedication will relish this biography of a distinguished and innovative banker, a witty character, the head of a closely-knit family yet a charming, modest and unassuming man.</p>

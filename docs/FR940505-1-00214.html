			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The two remaining emission controls, the oxygen sensor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalysts (both under body and quick light-off) are widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized as key components in maintaining proper in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions performance. A manufacturer could decide to improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the durability of the active surface of the oxygen sensor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change its placement in the exhaust to limit deposits and thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degradation. Likewise, more durable catalyst washcoats exist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to those commonly used and the overall loading of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic material can also be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding evaporative emissions, its more basic operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should make a manufacturer's durability assessment much easier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The key components besides the onboard computer are the purge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve, the vapor lines and the charcoal canister. The design of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a durable purge valve should be much easier to assess and improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary, relative to an EGR valve, given the clean nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vapor flowing through the valve. Non-metal vapor lines can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be replaced with metal lines if necessary to provide increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence of leak-free operation. With adequate purge, charcoal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister should not fall below their in-use design capacity with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time or usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While uncertainty exists as to exactly how manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will choose to comply with this program, the main issue appears  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be one of further improvements in durability versus cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tradeoffs. The program appears to be technologically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the costs, estimates of which are contained in the draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RIA supporting this FIP, EPA believes them to be reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> j. Alternatives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   The objective of the proposed enhanced in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall program is to identify and correct systemic design defects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or lack of durability within an engine family. However, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in section A.(f)., the proposed enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards could be exceeded if just a few percent of the vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within an engine family had high emissions, even though the rest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted at well below the standard. In this situation, recalling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entire engine family to correct random defects which result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a few high emitters is inefficient, inconvenient and costly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hopefully, the enhanced I/M program will identify and correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these high emitters. However, in some situations such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defect in the cold start emission control system, the I/M program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not identify the problem. On-board diagnostics could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify the problem, but it does not guarantee that the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will seek repair of the defect in a timely manner. This may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially a concern for older vehicles where the relative cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of repairs compared to the value of the car is high.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative to the proposed enhanced in-use recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program involves the use of remote sensing to quickly identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual vehicles with excess emissions. Remote sensing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions is now required by federal law in all non-attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas subject to enhanced I/M, including the three FIP areas. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially more effective approach could utilize recent advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in electronics which allow communication between the vehicle's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-board diagnostic system and a roadside transmitter. This type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of communication with moving vehicles has been developed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute for toll booths on highways and bridges, and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collecting use-fees for heavy trucks. CARB will soon be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating the application of this technology to on-board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostics. Under this concept, when prompted, a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitter on the vehicle would communicate the VIN and if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-board computer has sensed any emission control system defects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The owners of vehicles with defects would be notified by mail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair the vehicle and report to a smog inspection station for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification. This is the same remedy that will soon be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of owners whose vehicles fail a remote or roadside emission test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an area with enhanced I/M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advantages of such a system include assuring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles with high emissions are repaired quickly, rather than up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to two years later at the next  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M test. This would help lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average in-use emissions closer to the certification standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this approach would remain effective throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle's life, an important advantage over the proposed enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use compliance program, since over 40 percent of California's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty on-road vehicles have exceeded their 100,000 mile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like the I/M 240 test, the objective of CARB's OBD program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify nearly all problems causing excess emissions. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this same remote detection system could also lower the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic inspections since the inspection could be performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving by an unmanned sensor at any time. The cost of such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection would be minimal, and could quickly offset the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipping new vehicles with an on-board transmitter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major disadvantage of this approach is that the remote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensing technology has not been fully demonstrated. Thus, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot yet propose the details of a regulation which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement such a requirement as part of the FIP. However, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking comments on whether this approach has sufficient merit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered as an alternative or complement to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use compliance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

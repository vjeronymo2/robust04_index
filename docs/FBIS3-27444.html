"You can rest assured that China will never change its fixed  policy of opening the door to the outside world," Zhu said in a  speech titled "China's Reform and Development in 1994."    Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit, said  China will instead open wider to the outside world and  positively participate in competition and economic cooperation.    The recent reform measures taken by the government are  designed to adapt China to the laws of the international economy  and create a better environment for foreign investment in China,  he said.    He admitted that some government institutions' failure to  link up the work during the early stage of promulgations of the  reform laws has caused concerns among foreign investors over the  preferential policies.</p>

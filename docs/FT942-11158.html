			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals seen past their 'best buy' dates The precious metals price forecasting season is under way as analysts put their gold, silver and platinum market predictions up for inspection. Ms Rhona O'Connell at T. Hoare and Company, in a special report on the silver market, suggests this 'is now one of the most dangerous metals in the non-ferrous sector and carries with it a large Wealth Warning'. Prices may rise, she points out, but 'disillusioned liquidation, or mere profit-taking into a rally, can send prices spinning down again, usually faster than they rose'. While the underlying fundamentals of the silver market are improving, prices will not be sustained for long above Dollars 6 a troy ounce, Ms O'Connell suggests. She sees prices moving between Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 6 an ounce this year and next with an average of Dollars 5 for each year. Stocks of silver in the US alone stand at 36 weeks of supply, which would take some three years to whittle down to a more manageable eight-week level even though the annual supply deficit is forecast to increase from last year's 128m ounces to 137m this year and 150m in 1995. Mr Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland suggests all the precious metals probably achieved in the first quarter their highest prices for 1994 as a whole. He points out that in the January-March period US interest rates were at their lowest level in 30 years and this coincided with a weak dollar and concerns over precious metal supplies, especially supplies of platinum from South Africa. He warns that many of gold's emerging markets are losing their promise. Low oil prices are affecting Saudi Arabia's purchasing power and several Middle Eastern countries may suffer economic dislocation because of the rise in Islamic fundamentalism. The lack of pensions provision in China, South Korea and Singapore may cause personal gold hoards to be sold by an ageing population. Silver's price, which reached Dollars 5.75 an ounce in the first quarter, is forecast by Mr Smith to be down at Dollars 4.50 an ounce in three months time and back up at Dollars 5 in 12 months. He expects platinum, which reached Dollars 418 an ounce in the first quarter, to perform in a similar way, falling to Dollars 360 an ounce in three months and recovering to Dollars 390 in a year. Gold, which has been up to Dollars 395 an ounce in the first quarter, is predicted by Mr Smith to fall to Dollars 350 in three months and recover to Dollars 390 in a year's time. Meanwhile, at the CPM Group, based in New York, Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director, says gold may be at the start of a major cyclical upward move. Private investment demand in gold began to revive sharply in the last four months of 1992, he recalls, and there are several factors that are likely to keep investors interested in the metal, at least intermittently, for the rest of this year and next. Mr Joseph Rosta, CPM research director, suggests platinum is on an upward phase that may last another year or more. He says the time when supply has been growing more quickly than demand appears to be passing 'and it may be replaced over the next several years by conditions in which the rate of growth in fabrication demand outpaces any increases in total supply.' Nevertheless, platinum prices may go down in the coming year as fears about South African supplies diminish.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY REALLY WANT TO GROW UP TO BE RICH  </P> <P> Dr. Joyce Brothers (April 24)) gives some fascinating explanations of why young  people are motivated to enter various careers. She sees medicine as attractive  to those interested in a "nurturing profession (where one) . . . can help  others."  </P> <P> Law is attractive to young people "who feel they were unfairly treated by  adults." On the other hand, Dr. Brothers takes the position that teaching, and  religious ministry, are attractive to those who "like to give orders and be  seen as authorities."  </P> <P> Get real, Joyce. Young people attracted to law and medicine are mostly drawn by  the promise of big bucks; and the desire to help and nurture is stronger among  those who go into teaching and the clergy.  </P> <P> I imagine that Dr. Brothers would assert that young people are drawn to the  profession of psychology because they believe that they will eat of the fruit  of the Tree of Knowledge and become like gods. After reading her column, I  think she could use a few more mouthfuls.  </P> <P> LARRY SELK, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Brazilian privatisation chief retracts resignation THE head of Brazil's privatisation programme has been persuaded by President Fernando Collor de Mello to withdraw his resignation to prevent further delays to already much-postponed state sell-offs. Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank and the Privatisation Commission, had presented his resignation on Thursday along with some 50 government officials, following the departure of the economy minister, Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello. However, after meeting Mr Collor on Saturday, Mr Modiano agreed to stay, explaining later: 'The privatisation programme would suffer a loss of continuity with a change of command at this moment.' He added that Ms Cardoso had encouraged all those of her team 'whose programmes had not yet borne fruit' to stay. Mr Modiano and Mr Joao Santana, the new infrastructure minister, are the only members of the original economic team to stay on. The privatisation programme, initially scheduled to start last June, is now expected to be given a boost. Mr Marcilio Moreira, the new economy minister, has cited it as one of his priorities and according to Mr Modiano the prospectus for the first sale, that of the steel company Usiminas, will be agreed on this week.</p>

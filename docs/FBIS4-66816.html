			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.K. Surendran: "Gowri's Party Riding on Crest </F> of Popularity"]    [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, March 22--The new party,  Janadhipatya Samrakshana Samiti (JSS), launched by the expelled  Marxist veteran, Mrs K.R. Gowri on Sunday brings in a whiff of  fresh air in the caste and communally polluted politics of  Kerala.    Mrs Gowri had earlier steadfastedly refused the company of  many backward castes-minority groups masquerading as political  parties in the contemporary political scene here.    Her rebuff to Mr Kanshi Ram of the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party]  and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) of the  Ezhavas (OBC [other backward classes]) has obviously  disappointed them.    Mr Ram who came to meet her with high hopes had his ego  greatly deflated when the Marxist woman enlightened him on the  need to help all poor people whichever caste or community they  might belong to.    The first show of strength the JSS displayed at Alapuzha, a  coastal town in South Kerala too was impressive. Considering  that Mrs Gowri founded a party single handedly within two months  of her expulsion from the CPM, the maiden show was attractive.    The party constitution provides for grassroots democracy  with  freedom to express one's opinion freely is provided for. The  party has given to itself the task of pursuing Communist  ideologies in the demo set up with sincerity. Thrust of the new  party policy is purging the politics of corruption.    However, the crucial question that bothers political  observers is whether the JSS will grow roots in the tangled  power politics of Kerala where every caste and community has  formed a political party of its own.    Mrs Gowri's clarion call to create a new clean political  party sounds more like the Communist utopia of the state power  withering away gradually.    After all, JSS is the 302d political party of the state  though hardly 12 of them have representation in the state  assembly. More importantly, where will the finance to fight  elections come from?    The charge that the JSS will end up as another appendage to  the Congress soon cannot be dismissed as CPM-spawned slur  campaign. Witnesses to the three-day convention of the JSS at  Alapuzha last week would not have failed to notice the absence  of criticism of the Congress for various ills the country faced.    There was on the other hand a pathetic tinge to the  CPM-phobia the new party evinced in deciding every major policy  of the party.    The overriding passion was to ensure that the JSS stand  looked diametrically opposite to the CPM stand on major issues.    Again, a sizeable number of the delegates at the convention,  appeared to have been a one-time Marxist workers or leaders.  This, say JSS leaders, cannot be helped. Every party will have  some grumblers, gamblers and glam persons.    Which is the major constituency of the new party? The JSS  would surely claim a part of the CPM cadres belonging to the  backward castes. But its prospects of winning over  minorities--Christians and Muslims--are rather dim. Christian  community accounting for nearly 25 per cent of the population  has the Congress(I) and the KLA [expansion not given] Congress  wooing them. While the Muslim League, its rival party being  floated by Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait and the PDP [expansion not  given] of Mr Abdul Nasser Madani are all vying for another 20  per cent of the population. Therefore JSS will find it extremely  hard to get new converts to the JSS especially in the north  Kerala.    Mrs Gowri's refusal to comment on the controversial  palmolein  deal in which the chief minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, finds  himself on a cleft-stick too has engendered the belief that the  JSS is leaning heavily on the Congress for its survival.    It was in this context that the reason [as published]  mischievious comment of Mr Karunakaran that his party would give  Mrs Gowri the high position if she chooses to join the Congress  is to be viewed. His aims seem to have been two folded: having  helped Mrs Gowri to move away from the CPM he now wants to  besmire her spotless political image so that she and her party  would end up in the UDF [United Democratic Front] camp  eventually.    A tacit seat understanding with the Congress for the  forthcoming panchayat/municipal elections is already being  talked about in the political camps.</p>

Juppe and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had a  30-minute meeting, which concluded a short time ago.    Earlier today, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met  the visiting French foreign minister and discussed the crisis in  the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They  also discussed bilateral issues, Cyprus, and Skopje. Papoulias  and Juppe again stressed the friendly Greek-French relations and  added that they agreed on all issues. There were no points of  disagreement, Juppe said. Papoulias described the exchange of  views as positive and productive. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  French foreign minister stressed that a last chance must be  given for a peaceful solution of the problem based on the  European Union plan. But he stressed that humanitarian aid  should definitely be safeguarded and recalled UN Security  Council Resolution 836 and NATO's decision on air strikes.    On Skopje, Juppe said that the establishment of diplomatic  relations between France and Skopje was not an unfriendly act  toward Greece. He stressed that France will contribute to  establishing the necessary conditions for a dialogue between  Greece and Skopje. On the Cyprus issue, Juppe stressed that  France desires a peaceful and just solution within the UN  framework.    Asked whether Greece expects an initiative by the United  States on the dispute with Skopje, Foreign Minister Papoulias  said he does not know if there is anything specific.    Before his meeting with Papoulias, Juppe met Alternate  Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. The French foreign  minister stressed again the excellent bilateral cooperation and  friendship, and expressed his government's full support for the  Greek Presidency of the European Union [EU]. Juppe and Pangalos  discussed all EU-related issues, including implementation of the  White Paper, EU expansion, French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur's proposal for a conference on stability in Europe, and  completion of the GATT agreement. Regarding the accession to the  EU of the four candidates Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Finland,  Juppe expressed support for Greece's efforts to conclude  negotiations by 1 March. The French foreign minister said he  found views converged on all the issues he discussed with  Pangalos.</p>

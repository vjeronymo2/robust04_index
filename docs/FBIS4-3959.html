			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- A ranking industrial  official said Saturday [26 April] that Taiwan's restrictions on  car imports will be significantly eased to meet General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations.    "Imports will be allowed from all but a handful of  countries," said Yin Chi-ming, director of the Industrial  Development Bureau (IDB).    Yin's statement marks an about-face in Taiwan's car import  policy. Taiwan currently allows the import of automobiles from  the United States, Canada and Western European nations, but  proposed regulations will open Taiwan's auto market to almost  all countries.    Yin said that only a few countries, likely Japan, South  Korea  and other countries which have high import tariffs on  automobiles, will be subject to import restrictions in the  future.    A certain number of imports from those countries may be  allowed, Yin said, with the numbers decided upon during  bilateral negotiations.    Taiwan has already held initial consultations with  Australia,  Hungary, New Zealand, and South Africa on import tariffs,  regional restrictions and local content requirements.    During the negotiations, Taiwan requested a five-year grace  period for elimination of its local content requirements, which  support Taiwan's auto parts industry but violate GATT  regulations.    GATT contracting parties ranked as developing countries are  usually given five years for the adjustment of their car  industry. However, Taiwan applied as a developed economy and may  be allowed only two years.    Ho Mei-yueh, deputy IDB [expansion unknown] director, is  leaving for Southeast Asia for similar consultations Saturday.  He will meet with officials in Malaysia, Thailand and the  Philippines.    In addition, laws governing industrial development will be  reviewed and outdated provisions revised to create a healthy  development climate for local industries and help ease the  negative impact of GATT entry, yin added.    Taiwan applied for membership of the world trade regulatory  body in January 1990 and was admitted as an observer in  September 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] O sons of our great people in beloved Aden, in  (?the plains of) al-Hawtah, in the villages and [words  indistinct], and in all areas of Yemen: The rumors circulated  by the trumpeting dwarfs of the gang of apostasy and secession  about your Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, are  stained with a sense of aggressive and regional bias that  reflects the structure of that gang. They have been violating  the will of the people and their values throughout the era in  which they were in control. They, as well our people, realize  the extent of the tolerance, brotherhood, and generosity  displayed by the forces of unity and legitimacy toward the  deceived ones who directed their weapons against unity and  legitimacy.    Can our people believe these degenerate rumors after seeing  with their own eyes the tolerance of the leader president in  'Imran and the tolerance of our forces, the forces of unity, in  al-Dali', Musaymir, Mukayras, Abyan, and (?Rassal).    With all honesty and sincerity, we stress that the forces of  unity and legitimacy view as equal all citizens of Yemen. They  have always been, and will remain, the protectors of the  citizens and their property and honor, and the protectors of the  people's sacred goal in defending unity and Constitutional  legitimacy.</p>

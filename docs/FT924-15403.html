			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Appreciating the yen THE TIDES from Europe's recent currency turmoil are washing up against Japanese shores. But the Bank of Japan would be well advised to keep its sights firmly on Japan's own economic problems. With the economy still weakening, a further cut in the discount rate is already overdue on domestic grounds. But any calls for the Bank of Japan to halt, rather than merely smooth, the appreciation of the yen should be resisted. The rise in the value of the yen against both the dollar and the D-Mark over the past few weeks is understandably unwelcome for Japanese companies. Yet the rise is not merely a short-term spin-off from Europe's difficulties, but a necessary part of the adjustment process after the excesses of the last few years. Over-investment in domestic capacity has left Japan with a distorted domestic economy and a high and rising current account surplus. Only through a higher yen can Japan produce the capital outflow needed to balance this current account surplus and encourage Japan's consumers to buy more imports. There is little that policy can, or should, do to ease the corporate sector's pain. What it can do is encourage other sources of activity, other than investment or exports, to promote growth and soak up labour. That is why the recent Y10,700bn fiscal package of infrastructure spending was so timely. That is also why the supplementary budget needed to allow this spending should be enacted as fast as possible. Still, the current problems of the corporate sector are not the only, or the most serious, threat to Japanese economic prospects. More worrying is the scale of the bad debts, caused by the continuing collapse in land prices, that look likely to cripple the ability of Japanese banks to speed economic recovery when investment finally starts to recover. Policy has not done enough to address this problem. The stock market has rallied in the belief that the authorities are committed to providing more than just words and accounting fiddles. But while August's package promised much, it has so far produced little of substance. The desire of the Ministry of Finance to avoid using public money to bail out the banking sector is understandable but misguided. The banks must be seen to suffer for their past errors. But without some injection of public money to bail out the banking industry, a sizeable economic recovery will not materialise soon. The Ministry of Finance cannot afford to wait for another collapse in share prices before it acts. The proposed land-buying agency, currently being organised by the banks, is the best way to inject liquidity into the land market and speed the painful process of writing down the bad debts. But to be effective, this agency needs much more capital than the banks are in a position to provide. The Japanese government should pledge now that low-cost loans, most likely from the Bank of Japan, will be provided once the agency is established. The Bank of Japan currently has plenty of room to boost bank profitability and to stimulate activity by steepening the yield curve. Inflation is low, the economy is depressed and the appreciation of the yen represents a de facto tightening of monetary policy. It should cut short term interest rates at once.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / US economy set for robust growth: Non-farm employment rises 456,000 - Expansion may force interest rate increase The US economy looks set for a period of strong expansion after a range of economic statistics yesterday all pointed to a robust recovery. But the prospects of further strong growth also increased the probability of a further increase in short-term interest rates. The most eye-catching statistic was that non-farm employment in March jumped by 456,000, far in excess of market expectations and the largest single monthly increase since the Wall Street collapse of October 1987. The New York equity markets were closed yesterday for Good Friday, but prices of long-dated bonds sank. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than 1 1/2 points, sending the yield up to 7.26 per cent, although trading was light. One trader described the market reaction as 'swift, violent and unforgiving'. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied towards the close to finish up 9.21 points at 3,635.96, having fallen 67 points earlier in the day. But most broader market measurements were down, and the Dow ended the shortened week off 138.77 points. The market slide, which has cut share prices by about 9 per cent in two months, was enough to persuade President Bill Clinton, on holiday in California, to state that 'corrections' in the market were normal and to warn against 'skittishness'. Economic fundamentals were sufficiently sound that comparisons with 1987 were invalid, he said. Other economic indicators published yesterday, both for February, showed personal income up 1.3 per cent, reversing the decline of 0.3 per cent in January, and personal spending up 1 per cent, after an increase of only 0.1 per cent the previous month. Final revised gross domestic product figures for the last quarter of 1993, released on Thursday, showed real annual growth at 7 per cent, down from the earlier estimate of 7.5 per cent, but still the strongest three months since the first quarter of 1984. Ms Laura Tyson, head of the president's council of economic advisers, said there was no reason yet to change two of the administration's annual forecasts - of 3 per cent real growth and 2m new jobs. She said there was 'an upside risk on both numbers', though higher interest rates might have a damping effect. Reaction to the data by economic analysts was uniform. Merrill Lynch said first-quarter real growth 'may be closer to 4 per cent than 3.5 per cent', its previous prediction. S G Warburg said it 'may equal or exceed 4 per cent'. All noted no evidence of rising inflationary pressures. Ms Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told Congress that more than half the growth in employment in March reflected a rebound from the weather-ravaged previous two months, exacerbated by the Los Angeles earthquake in January. However, the jobless rate remained unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The bureau explained that whereas a reduction of 100,000 in the official unemployment rolls could produce a 0.1 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate, it could take as many as 700,000 new jobs to produce the same result, because most openings went to those not registered in the labour force. In fact, in March 349,000 of the 456,000 new jobs were part time. Manufacturing employment only rose by 12,000.

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> GANGS GET BOOST FROM NEW BLOOD  </P> <P> The messages that Juvenile Court official David Flores reads these days in the  graffiti and gang slogans scrawled on East Los Angeles alleyways, homes and  businesses are more disturbing than ever.  </P> <P> "I see new gang names showing up on the walls, and placas (logos) indicating  that old, formerly quiet gangs are joining forces with younger groups and  becoming active again," said Flores, administrator of Los Angeles County  Juvenile Court schools. "It's very depressing."  </P> <P> The trend is also seen in crime statistics showing that gang murders are on the  rise in some communities east of the Los Angeles River.  </P> <P> In the unincorporated area of East Los Angeles, for example, gang murders rose  from none in 1988 to 11 in 1989. Similarly, the Los Angeles Police Department's  Hollenbeck Division, which includes the community of Boyle Heights, reported 10  gang murders in 1988, compared with 20 in 1989.  </P> <P> "The sad thing about it is that many of the new groups are composed of very  young boys, 10 to 14 years of age, who are trying to make a reputation for  themselves," Flores said. "I think we are entering a potentially violent period  in East Los Angeles."  </P> <P> There are no easy answers to the gang violence that has returned to East Los  Angeles after two years of relative peace. But interviews with law enforcement  officials, gang experts, concerned parents, educators and gang members suggest  that old-line veteranos -- imprisoned since police crackdowns in the late 1970s  and early '80s -- are returning to the streets as ex-convicts determined to  revive gangs that had dwindled to a handful of members.  </P> <P> "The guys that come out of prison . . . have a reputation in the neighborhoods  they came from," said Fred Martinez of the California Youth Authority's gang  information services unit. "They also have the palabra (authoritative word) and  influence."  </P> <P> One of the best examples is the Geraghty Lomas gang. Its membership was gutted  by drug overdoses, gang murders and heavy prison sentences, and only about 15  aging Geraghty Lomas veteranos were left to claim their hilltop City Terrace  barrio.  </P> <P> As their power ebbed away, a new group of mostly nonviolent but raucous  youngsters calling themselves Rockwood Stoners emerged in the area. These  newcomers wore their hair long, listened to heavy-metal music and partied with  people who did not respect neighborhood boundaries.  </P> <P> Disturbed by what they saw as a breakdown of the neighborhood and the gang  codes they lived by, Geraghty Lomas began courting the younger Stoners, who  numbered close to 100. In October, the gangs voted to merge into a new gang  called Geraghty Lomas/Rockwood.  </P> <P> The new, more potent gang, authorities say, is now at war with many of its  combined list of 49 enemy gangs.  </P> <P> "We got them up again, that's what they wanted," added another gang member, 16.  "They (Geraghty Lomas veteranos) gave us guns, and we started taking care of  business."  </P> <P> Geraghty Lomas/Rockwood is only one of a growing number of East Side gangs to  have propped itself up in the past year with new recruits of Stoners and  impressionable youths. Others include El Hoyo, Barrio Nuevo and even White  Fence, one of the oldest Latino gangs in the city, authorities said.  Separately, some groups of Stoners have cut their locks and traded in their  heavy-metal garb for traditional cholo dress of oversize Pendleton shirts,  khaki pants and short-cropped hair combed straight back with gel.  </P> <P> The fact is "they're back to killing themselves for dirt (territorial  boundaries), and that's really sad," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Joe  Guzman.  </P> <P> Only a mile northwest of the East Los Angeles sheriff's station, Patrick  Vasquez, 30, whose 20-year-old brother was killed in a gang fight a decade ago,  lamented the fact that "they (gang members) don't think about what the mothers,  the wives and children are going through.  </P> <P> "Every morning I tie my shoes and wonder if I'll be untying them at night or if  the coroner will be untying them for me," Vasquez said. "A lot of these kids  think it is all fun and games."  </P> <P> Still, the decline in gang murder rates in unincorporated East Los Angeles --  the birthplace of Latino gangs -- from 22 in 1980 to zero in 1988 led some gang  experts to believe that gang warfare there was a thing of the past.  </P> <P> The decline, which was preceded by a concerted anti-gang effort involving local  parents and churches, the Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles Police  Department, the California Youth Authority and the Community Youth Gang  Services Project, prompted some agencies to switch funding and resources to  other parts of the city that seemed to need them more.  </P> <P> A growing number of parents and teachers living and working in East Los Angeles  neighborhoods that had been peaceful for years now want those resources back.  </P> <P> At Stevenson Junior High School, for example, Principal Edward Amarillas said  at least 5% of the student body of 2,550 students is involved with an estimated  seven gangs from the local area. "Two years ago, it was half that percentage,"  Amarillas said.  </P> <P> Principals from six junior high schools in the area met at the school  district's regional headquarters in Boyle Heights to discuss the worsening  problem of gangs and their growing influence on children. The principals  discussed setting up new sports and other after-school activities for students.  </P> <P> A group of concerned parents called a news conference in November to demand  that county officials strengthen existing gang prevention services in their  area.  </P> <P> At the news conference held at Soledad Enrichment Action, a social services  organization funded by Catholic Charities, the group of about 20 mothers also  called for additional sheriff's patrols and a return of Community Youth Gang  Services Project workers who had been transferred to South-Central Los Angeles  and other communities when gang violence east of downtown subsided.  </P> <P> "The killing has started again," said Virginia Lopez, a spokeswoman for  Concerned Parents of East Los Angeles, a group organized 15 years ago to raise  money to bury victims of gang violence. "We don't want any more suffering."  </P> <P> "We want our gang services back," added Rita Figueroa, who lost two sons in  1971 and 1973 to problems related to drugs and gangs. "I know what it takes to  bury them, what it takes out of your life and how it hurts."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> In East Los Angeles, community leaders complain that the presence of gangs is  often exaggerated by the news media. They estimate that less than 10% of area  youths are active in gangs. Yet few deny the gangs' existence and the pain and  suffering they inflict when violence erupts. After two years of relative peace,  gang violence has returned to unincorporated East Los Angeles. Parent groups  and individuals are calling for the return of a concerted anti-gang effort.  </P></p>

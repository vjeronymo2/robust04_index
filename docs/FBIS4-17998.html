			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Dialogue Which Helps </F> Friendship"]    [Excerpts] A meeting of leaders of the leading Russian  mass media and Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov took  place in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] recently after the former had come  to the republic at his invitation. Such meetings with leaders  of CIS countries have already become a good tradition.    A central place in the program for the Moscow guests' stay  on  Turkmen soil was taken up by a "roundtable" talk with the head  of state. [passage omitted]    The SELSKAYA ZHIZN representative was interested primarily  in  the agrarian reform which is being conducted in Turkmenistan.    "Our policy, known as `the New Countryside,'" the president  noted, "is of a balanced and gradual nature as regards changes  in the agricultural sector. It proposes a diversity of forms of  ownership and economic management of the land. Strong,  flourishing collective and state farms will undoubtedly be  retained. Unprofitable farms and farms operating in the red will  be transformed into peasant and private farms and various  associations of landowners. Some 150,000 hectares of land have  been distributed for private ownership in the country. Every  family has the right to 50 hectares. State support is being  rendered to the development of the agro-industrial complex."    The task of overcoming grain dependence on the foreign  market  is being resolved as a priority. The grain purchased from CIS  countries is costing Turkmenistan very dear. That is why the  aim of achieving self-sufficiency with regard to grain has been  set. Areas sown to wheat are being expanded and this year 1  million tonnes of grain will be obtained. As of 1997, the  Republic intends to switch to the population's free provision  with bread. According to calculations, 164 kg of flour is  needed per inhabitant.    The talk, which lasted over two hours, was of a relaxed and  congenial nature.</p>

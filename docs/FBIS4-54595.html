			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- The parliament today  approved a government proposal for foreign army units to be  allowed to carry out short-term military exercises on Czech  territory and for the Czech units to go abroad for similar  exercises there.    The government is to inform the parliament about every  exercise in advance and parliament is to give its prior approval  each case foreign troops are to stay in this country. A maximum  700 Czech troops may take part in the exercises abroad lasting  up to 30 days, and up to 5,000 foreign troops may take part in  exercises in the Czech Republic lasting up to 21 days, Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys said.    The proposal limits the foreign countries (as venues for  exercises and participants in exercises held on the Czech  territory) to those that the Czech Republic wants to integrate  into, those participating in the Partnership for Peace project,  and European neutral countries.    Joint exercises will involve Czech units, staffs, and  commanding officers in the training of humanitarian, search and  rescue, and peace operations, and allow Czech Air Force and  ground-based anti-aircraft units to receive training of a kind  unavailable in the Czech Republic but necessary to maintain  their combat readiness.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Snezana Rodic; Churkin speaks in English with </F> superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Text] Shortly before his departure from Belgrade, Vitaliy  Churkin was once again received by Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic. The talks were attended by Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime  minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina. Churkin also met  delegations of the republic of Serbian Krajina and the republic  of Srpska today. Here is a report by Snezana Rodic on how  today's talks were held and how they were assessed:    [Rodic] How would you briefly assess the second round of  talks with President Milosevic?    [Churkin] We were summarizing the overall talks we held  today and I think that the Serbian side is serious and that it  is seriously going to attend the Geneva meeting with a view to  agreeing on the cessation of hostilities. They are preparing  themselves for the second round of negotiations with the contact  group. This will take place soon. I think that all this was  worthwhile. We in Moscow are planning a very busy month of June  as regards the matters that will have to be done urgently.    [Rodic] Did you talk about sanctions with President  Milosevic?    [Churkin] If I had not mentioned them, he would have  mentioned them to me. This issue is usually mentioned at our  talks.    [Rodic] (?Would) you say something more about that?    [Churkin] We have this position that I think is a very good  one. It is included in the ministerial communique. Therefore, a  solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will lead to the  suspension of sanctions. I think that this is an encouragement  to the Serbian side to reach a solution.    [Rodic] In the Russian Embassy in Belgrade, Vitaliy Churkin  first met a delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina which  included Milan Martic and Borislav Mikelic. They discussed the  continuation of negotiations with Croatia. It was pointed out  that the Republic of Serbian Krajina is an equal partner and  that it has respected the peace agreement on cease-fire,  something which was also confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]. The main problem is where the peace negotiations are  to be held.    [Martic] Our stand is that this should be a neutral venue,  outside the territory of either Croatia or Krajina, although  Croatia insisted that the venue be exclusively in Croatia or  Krajina, thereby prejudging the political solution that Krajina  is within Croatia and wanting somehow to reduce this to its  internal problem. We are still insisting that this should be a  neutral place. It can be a Russian embassy in any foreign  country. However, we still remain open for negotiations, but of  course should hold consultations within our ranks, that is, in  the parliament and the government.    [Rodic] Churkin then had talks with a delegation of the  Serbian Republic, Dr. Nikola Koljevic and Momcilo Krajisnik.  This was a consultative talk on the eve of the Geneva  negotiations that have been convened by Yasushi Akashi. The  Serbian side pointed out that a new Croatian-Muslim federation  must not turn into an anti-Serb coalition.    [Krajisnik] (?I) informed Mr. Churkin that our negotiating  team will go to the meeting to conclude an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities and that we are going to take part in  the next meeting of the contact group.    We have also discussed certain (?disputable) issues. Maps  are always (?disputable) issues. There has been no special  progress. Muslim proposals presented to us are already known.  This is east Bosnia, western Bosnia, they are all questions  demanding great attention and effort in order to reach the final  solution.    [Koljevic in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] We think that the cessation of hostilities is  by far the most important thing. We are prepared to discuss  territories. We do not think that percentages are a good  approach to the beginning, but we are ready to discuss  territories, albeit with arguments about the maps -- quality,  infrastructure, communications are much more important things  than percentages.    [Churkin] I am encouraged that my talks with Mr. Martic were  very useful. I think that everything is moving forward, toward  the beginning of the talks about economic matters, so I expect  that before too long we shall find a way to begin these talks  about economic normalization between Knin and Zagreb, that is,  about the second stage of their difficult road toward a  normalization of relations. I also had useful talks with Mr.  Krajisnik and Mr. Koljevic.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Koljevic told us half an  hour ago that one should talk about the quality of territories.  Would one have to redefine the 49-51 percent relation?    [Churkin] No, that will stay. They have to talk about these  details within the framework of the concept approved by foreign  ministers of the key countries. This was not a frivolous  decision, but one based on the months of very long discussions  and talks between all sides. They will have to stick to that  concept.</p>

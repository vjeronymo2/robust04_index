			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 28 (YONHAP) -- U.S. reconnaissance  satellites detected preparations by North Korea to test-launch a  new missile about two weeks ago, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported in  its Saturday editions.    Quoting military sources here who were informed of the  North's movements by the United States Government, YOMIURI said,  "there is a possibility North Korea would soon test-fire a  second missile following the launch of the Nodong-I missile in  the East Sea in may last year."    According to the YOMIURI report, many trucks, launchers and  other vehicles have been sent to the detected launch site and  vessels were swarming around ports along the east coast,  apparently to determine the landing point of the missiles to be  launched.    Asked why the North would try to test a new missile when the  international community's attention is already focused on its  suspected nuclear weapons program, the sources said, "the action  seems to be timed with the warm seasonal weather conditions in  the East Sea and we do not believe North Korea has any  particular political intention of influencing nuclear  negotiations."    The TOKYO SHIMBUN carried a similar story, quoting Foreign  Ministry officials as saying that "we obtained information that  North Korea is preparing to test-launch a missile in the East  Sea."    The officials said the information had been supplied by the  United States, adding, "the missile to be launched by the North  this time appears to be a revised version of the Nodong-I  missile," according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN.    "Washington and Pyongyang are likely to hold a third round  of  high-level talks soon, regardless of the attempt by the North to  test-launch a missile," according to the officials, who hinted  they had the impression that Washington considers the North's  missile launch as a separate issue from the talks.    The North's Nodong-I that was test-launched in May last year  has a range of 1,000 km.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Political anchors on Qantas float - No date has been set for the airline's sell-off A big political question mark overshadows the latest results from Qantas. Will the airline be floated this autumn? Or will it come to the stock market in mid or even late 1995, a full two years later than the Australian government originally planned? Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas' chairman for the past year, says the decision must be made in the current financial year to allow for all the administrative work involved in the 'early' privatisation option. And he is blunt about Canberra's options: 'It's going to be judgment call for them, and not an easy one. They've got, in many ways, conflicting considerations. One is the state of the share market, which at the moment is strong - that would argue for going earlier. 'On the other hand, Qantas has been subject to very significant changes  - the merger with Australian, and in its management. The business is improving, and we're making progress. So from that point of view, you'd be persuaded to give it more time.' This is Mr Pemberton playing diplomat. Pushed a little further, he admits that management wants to wait - a view also expressed by British Airways' chairman, Sir Colin Marshall - and cites two simple reasons. First, there is Qantas' profitability - or lack of it. 'We've set ourselves a (profits) target of over ADollars 400m (USDollars 285m). That's what we've set as the right return on shareholders' funds,' he says. 'We never quite meant it as a precondition to privatisation. What we were really conveying is that any discretionary shareholders will be looking for that sort of return. The yardstick has to be a normal commercial yardstick, not what people might be satisfied with because the airline industry's going through a tough time.' Secondly, there is enormous internal upheaval which currently suffuses Qantas, as it tries to blend long-standing international operations with Australian's domestic network and undertakes an extensive executive overhaul. 'From a management perspective, we'd like to have the time. It's easy to overlook the fact that privatisation, and all the due diligence, is a horrendous process for management.' Yesterday's results will almost certainly add ballast to the Qantas/BA point of view. Net profits of ADollars 71.7m, coupled with Mr Pemberton's prediction that the second half will be 'something less,' suggest that Qantas will miss its ADollars 400m target by a very large margin in 1993-94. Moreover, much of the latest improvement seems to come from lower interest charges - the product of a recapitalisation which accompanied BA's ADollars 665m investment last year. Adjusting to reflect a full six-month contribution from Australian in the first half of 1992-93, Qantas calculates that first-half operating profits rose by around ADollars 73m, year-on-year. The fall in interest charges, net of the increase in depreciation and amortisation costs, explains more than ADollars 47m of this. Yesterday Qantas declined to quantity the fall in operating yields during the first half - beyond saying that, in percentage terms, it was in single digits. But it did make it clear that the fall affected both domestic and international operations, although the latter suffered more markedly. Since December, it suggests that the overall position is little changed from last year. While reporting only 'acceptable' figures for the first half, Qantas also plays up the extent of the changes which its new management still feels the carrier needs to make. 'I think there's a very big issue about the quality of our revenues - the markets we're in, the routes that we're flying. There's a lot of room for improvement,' says Mr James Strong, who took over as managing director last autumn. Then there is the labour situation. 'I don't believe the company has got anywhere near the productivity trade-offs that we should have got in terms of the enterprise bargaining agreements that were entered into,' he continues. Even in those areas where optimists might envisage short-term progress, the carrier takes a very cautious line. Qantas, for example, said that its American routes continued to make losses in the first half - in contrast to Japan, the Orient, New Zealand and the UK. But the Pacific market has seen two major US players - Continental and Northwest Airlines - retreat during recent months. Fares have jumped significantly. But Mr Strong refuses to be bullish. 'There's a tendency to say, they've gone, terrific, everyone's going to make money in the Pacific. But there really are tremendous time-lags. It's been a sea of red ink for a long, long time and it's not suddenly going to be awash with US greenbacks.' In short, Qantas has made its case for a late float. Over to Canberra.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Continuing problems at DRS will hit second half DRS Data warned yesterday that continuing trading problems would result in disappointing second half profits. The shares were unchanged at 30p, compared with the 110p offer price in May. The flotation of the scanning equipment manufacturer has been followed by a catalogue of disasters, including a change in ownership of its main distributor and a collapse in demand from schools, its largest market. The statement yesterday said there was no signs of a recovery on educational sales. Schools accounted for about 70 per cent of sales last year, but shortly after its share offer demand dried up. The group said some schools were reconsidering the need for DRS's main product the Optical Mark Reader, following recent relaxation in National Curriculum requirements. There has also been a trend for schools to build up cash reserves, with a corresponding decline in expenditure. Nottingham Group, the educational products supplier, also revealed declining sales to schools in the first half of 1994, shortly after its March flotation. DRS said the collapse in sales was unforeseeable at the time of its share offer. Mr Malcolm Brighton, founder and managing director, made about Pounds 3.5m from the offer. The company's shares fell 58 per cent last September, after its interim results revealed declining profits and collapsing sales. In a year littered with the corpses of disastrous flotations, only Aerostructures Hamble has performed worse, closing yesterday at 25p, compared with its offer price of 120p.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price slide continues GOLD'S PRICE plunged again yesterday to the lowest level for nearly six years, wilting under steady selling pressure for the second successive day in a market with few buyers. 'Someone had to raise dollars for gold and was taking little account of the condition of the gold market. It wasn't a large amount of gold but in these quiet markets the selling had a disproportionate impact,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland. The effect was compounded by the behaviour of computer-driven US funds. Gold tumbled to Dollars 336.75 a troy ounce in early afternoon trading in London yesterday, its lowest since June, 1986. It closed at Dollars 339.40, down Dollars 3.80. Since Monday morning gold had therefore lost 2 per cent of its value. On the New York Commodity Exchange the most-active April contract saw gold at Dollars 337.30 at the opening and back up to Dollars 339.40 by midday. Dealers guessed the selling might have been by an east European central bank outside the former Soviet Union or by a South African producer ahead of its financial quarterly results and amid the nervousness associated with that country's referendum. Demand for gold is usually subdued at this time of year during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which in 1992 runs between March 6 and April 6, and when the market has emerged from the periods of peak consumption: Christmas in the west and the Chinese New Year. Mr Smith said US funds had sold a good deal of gold short (sold metal they did not have in the expectation that they could buy it later at a lower price) and would want to lock in their profit of about Dollars 10 an ounce. This would result in a short-term price recovery. If there was also a 'no' vote in the referendum in South Africa, the world's biggest gold producer, raising the possibility of civil unrest, 'then watch the price take off', Mr Smith added.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada grows hungry Granada's ambitions to expand its television and catering arms look sensible enough. While it is still too soon to know whether the LWT acquisition will enhance shareholder wealth, Granada was bullish yesterday at its interim results on how things are progressing so far. There would be an opportunity to apply the same rationalisation formula on another ITV company, with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television the group's favoured target. Similarly, there is presumably scope for rationalising Britain's fragmented catering industry. Granada has already proved it can manage such businesses. Margins at Sutcliffe, bought last year, are up 60 per cent. Chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson retains an affection for the industry from his days at Compass. And while there is nothing obvious on the market at the moment to bid for, Gardner Merchant could become available in a couple of years. Financing further acquisitions should not be a big problem. The group as a whole, and the rental side in particular, are strongly cash-generative. Though the LWT deal has temporarily pushed gearing above 100 per cent, the more important measure of Granada's financial strength is its interest cover of 6.6. As cash from the BSkyB refinancing flows in, group gearing and interest cover will improve. If Granada is able to sell its BSkyB stake, worth about Pounds 500m, the position would be stronger still. The longer-term question is whether there is any point in keeping TV, rental and catering operations in the same group. Mr Robinson shows no desire to split them. But investors watching Thorn EMI inch its way towards a demerger may have other ideas.</p>

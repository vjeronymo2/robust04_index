			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cui Yanming (1508 1693 2494): "Mao Zedong Thought and </F> Deng Xiaoping Theory"]    [Text] Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole  party is a fundamental task put forth by the 14th CPC National  Congress for strengthening party building during the new period.  For this reason, it is necessary for us to theoretically  clarify relations between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to  increase our understanding, dispel misgivings, enhance our  consciousness, and sharpening our sense of urgency for  strengthening our study, so that we can grasp in a still better  way the origin and essence of the theory.    1. Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is the latest product of the integration  of Marxism and the practical reality in China. It is an  inheritance of Mao Zedong Thought under the new historical  conditions, and Marxism in contemporary China.    Our party is a vanguard of the working class, which takes  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding thought. In  the past, now, and in the future, we unswervingly regard  Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding thought of  the whole party. However, in the course of historical  development, and in different historical stages, Marxism -- as a  unified ideological system -- has different theoretical  manifestations. The integration of Marxism with the reality in  Russia gave rise to Leninism. The integration of Marxism with  the reality in China gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought. The  continuation of the development of Mao Zedong Thought has  inevitably given rise to a new theoretical summation. This is  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This does not mean that the latter negates the  former, or that they are completely the same. This can only  mean that the latter inherits and develops the former, so that  Marxism, as a comprehensive ideological system, can constantly  enrich and improve itself, and is full of vigor and vitality  with the development of practice.    Proletarian revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and  Mao Zedong successfully expounded and solved the problem of how  the proletariat must seize state power. Due to restrictions of  historical conditions, the problem of building socialism, and,  in particular, the problem of how to consolidate and develop  socialism in countries which are economically and culturally  backward, has not yet been solved well.    Chinese communists of the new generation, represented by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, have shouldered this important historical  task. They respect practice, the masses, and their pioneering  spirit. They have scientifically summed up the experience and  creativity of the masses. They have inherited the experiences  of their predecessors, broken with outmoded conventions, and led  us to successfully carry out reform, opening up, and  modernization. In the process of making great achievements,  they have gradually formed and established their socialist  theories with Chinese characteristics. For the first time they  have systematically and initially answered a series of basic  questions, including the road of socialist development, stages  of development, fundamental tasks, motives for development,  leading force, the force which must be relied upon, external  conditions for building socialism, political guarantees,  strategic steps, unification of the motherland, and so on. They  have pointed out the way to carry out socialist construction,  consolidate and develop the basic principle of developing  socialism, and the way forward. They have inherited and  developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.    2. It is imperative to correctly comprehend how Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism inherits and develops  Mao Zedong Thought, and corrects Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes  committed during his remaining years to enhance our  consciousness in implementing the party's basic line.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Since the Third Plenary  Session, we have restored those correct things of Comrade Mao  Zedong. In other words, we have accurately and comprehensively  applied Mao Zedong Thought. This still remains our basic point.  Now we are doing things which Comrade Mao Zedong raised, but  had not completed. We should advocate matters which he wrongly  opposed, and do things which he failed to accomplish. For a  fairly long period of time in the future, we must still do these  things well. Of course, we must develop, and continue to  develop them." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks have actually  revealed the three relations between the inheritance and  development of Mao Zedong Thought by the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the correction of  the mistakes committed by Mao Zedong during his remaining years.    Let us first talk about inheritance. Inheritance means  receiving a valuable legacy from predecessors. Inheriting and  receiving can be traced to the same origin. For example,  seeking truth from facts is our party's ideological line. Both  Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Deng Xiaoping actively advocate  this line. This is a main line linking Mao Zedong Thought and  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I believe in  seeking truth from facts advocated by Chairman Mao. In the  past, we relied on it to fight the war. Now we must also rely  on it to carry out construction and reform." He added:  "Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Marxism. We must  advocate this, but not book worship." Let's look at another  example. The mass line is our party's basic working line.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping leads the whole party to inherit and  persist in pursuing this line which Comrade Mao Zedong advocated  and followed. In the meantime, he arouses the enthusiasm and  creativity of the broad masses of people through reform and  opening up. This has enabled our country to considerably  develop productive forces, and greatly improved the living  standard of the people. Attaining the target of common  prosperity is no longer an invisible dream. It is precisely  because Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited from Comrade Mao Zedong  the fine tradition and work style of the mass line -- and that  he is good at applying a good method of summing up the  experiences of the masses and refining, processing, and  developing them into theories -- that the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics is close to life and is  welcomed and accepted by the masses, just as Mao Zedong Thought  was. There is one more example. Independence and initiative is  our party's basic principle for developing itself and handling  external relations. It is an important component of Mao Zedong  Thought. It is also a spiritual fulcrum and theoretical  prerequisite for the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics created by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and has  enabled China to take a road of development different from those  taken by other socialist countries. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  repeatedly told the whole party: "Combining the universal truth  of Marxism with the practical reality in China, taking our own  road, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a  basic conclusion drawn from our long-term historical  experiences."    In addition, Mao Zedong Thought also includes rich contents  of upholding the socialist road, the people's democratic  dictatorship, the communist party leadership, and  Marxism-Leninism. With regard to the issue of the four upholds,  Comrade Mao Zedong's firm conviction and systematic guidance  educated the Chinese communists of the entire generation well.  It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping who has inherited this spiritual  legacy well, and constantly injected contents of the new era  into it, and carried it forward.    Thus it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics has fully inherited the  living soul of Mao Zedong Thought. Without such an inheritance,  the party history will be cut off, or even negated. We will  thus lose our basic foothold, and get lost.    As far as development is concerned, it means opening up and  blazing new trails. It also means that in front of the new  situation, we study the new issues, sum up new experiences,  generalize new viewpoints, and establish new theories. This  shows that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics tops Mao Zedong Thought. Since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our  country has entered a new historical period, and great changes  have taken place in both the domestic and international  situation. The new situation and practice has provided us with  unprecedentedly favorable conditions and new experiences. This  has laid a firm and practical foundation for the development of  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and the new theory as well.  For instance, with the deepening of reform, our party has put  forth a series of relevant new viewpoints and theories. They  mainly include: The full development of the commodity economy  is an insuperable stage of the development of the social  economy; the planned economy is not tantamount to socialism, and  the market economy is not tantamount to capitalism; socialism  can also pursue the market economy, and the aim of our country's  economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market  economic system, and so on. In the development of Marxist  theory, they have theoretically solved, for the first time, the  issue of combining commodity economy with market economy and  socialism so that we can make a major breakthrough in  understanding relations between planning and market. This has  brought about unprecedented and fundamental changes in the  socialist economic pattern. Revolution means emancipation of  productive forces, and so does reform. Reform is also a  profound revolution, and the only way for emancipating and  developing productive forces under the socialist conditions. In  the history of the development of Marxism, they have, for the  first time, correctly pointed out the driving force for the  development of socialism. This negates the theory which has  always taken class struggle as a driving force for the  development of socialism. This has enabled us to find a road  for rapidly developing socialism and making our country powerful  and strong. The essence of socialism is the emancipation and  development of productive forces, elimination of exploitation  and polarization, and eventual attainment of common prosperity.  This is a major supplement and correction of the previous  standards on socialism.    Lastly, let us talk about correction. Correction means  correcting a few inferences wrongly drawn by Comrade Mao Zedong  during his later years due to historical conditions, and which  have been proved by practice that they no longer conform with  the demand of the new era. It means amending, supplementing,  and improving certain viewpoints which can no longer conform  with the new situation due to changes of conditions. This shows  that the latecomer (Deng's theory) is highly responsible for the  old timer (Mao Thought), the masses, and history. For example,  with regard to the issue of concentrating our efforts on  developing productive forces, Comrade Mao Zedong realized this,  because it is a common knowledge of Marxism. This was also a  problem which he strived to solve all his life. However, owing  to the fact that he made a wrong estimation of the class  situation in our country and the political situation of the  party and state, he adopted a wrong method to deal with it. In  this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly told the  whole party that we must concentrate our efforts on developing  productive forces, and treat this as the most fundamental task  of the entire party.    In a word, Deng Xiaoping theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristic has inherited the living soul of Mao  Zedong Thought and developed Mao Zedong Thought and has, through  practice, found the road of reform and opening up for the  Chinese people with an aim of making their country powerful and  strong. The nucleus of the theory is "one center, two basic  points," and its nature and essence are emancipating the mind,  seeking truth from facts, and everything proceeding from  reality. The nucleus of the theory is our political line, and  the party's unshakable basic line in the entire initial period  of socialism. The essence of the theory is our cognitive line,  and an ideological line which our party must stick to under all  circumstances. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, let  us strive for a new victory in reform, opening up, and  modernization!</p>

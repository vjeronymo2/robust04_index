			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Discord in the Space </F> `Alliance'"]    [Text] Fierce competition among satellite builders,  particularly in telecommunications, has done nothing to  strengthen the European industrial association.    The European space "Alliance" formed over one year ago  between Aerospatiale, Alcatel Espace, Alenia Spazio and Deutsche  Aerospace has not grown stronger with time. Quite the opposite,  judging from some recent "episodes," which incidentally are not  to be credited specifically to any one of the partners, but  which raise questions about the true effectiveness of the  association the four firms created to build civilian and  military satellites, particularly for telecommunications.    For example, some express shock at what they call "the  Artemis scandal"-- arising from the fact that Alenia Spazio is  getting paid to develop a new 2.5 ton-class satellite platform  instead of building the ESA's relay satellites (see A&amp;C No.  1443), while the Alliance has in principle decided to  standardize its platforms by opting for the Spacebus 2000 and  3000 developed by Aerospatiale and DASA.    Another disagreement which is depriving some members of  considerable financial support is the "absence" of Alcatel  Espace--as well as of the major American partner Space  Systems/Loral--alongside Aerospatiale and DASA, promoters of the  Nahuelsat company which will take charge of building the Nahuel  Argentine telecommunications satellite (see A&amp;C No. 1448).    Another similar occurrence is the "questioning" of the SS/L  European partners who are still very reluctant to commit  financially along with Loral for its Globalstar  telecommunications satellite constellation project.    As a last incident (to-date), there is the unilateral DASA  "initiative" to create together with China, a joint company to  manufacture and sell telecommunications satellites and  eventually observation satellites, a project which may (to a  certain extent at least) compete with the Alliance's activities  (see A&amp;C No. 1448).    The Alliance therefore has limits which a good grasp of  commercial interest will not hesitate to cross. Thus, for  example, Aerospatiale is again joining with Matra Marconi Space  to build second generation weather satellites (MSG).    We are told that "this is a pragmatic decision. You don't  replace a winning team." True, if you consider that indeed, in  technical and operational terms, Meteosat is a model program.    The occasional partnership of Aerospatiale and Matra in  space  (as well as in missiles, with the Apache) is not in fact as  surprising as it may seem: the two firms also collaborate on  Helios, Eutelsat 2, and so on. It has even been pointed out that  "Matra is both the prime customer and the prime supplier for  Aerospatiale!"    All of this can be considered rather healthy, showing the  adaptability and therefore the dynamism of satellite builders.  But in that case, what is the use of an "Alliance"?</p>

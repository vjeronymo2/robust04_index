			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA SUES STATE TO BAR PAROLE OFFICE  </P> <P> City officials said they filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the state to stop a  parole office from opening near the Civic Center in March.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against two state agencies,  the Corrections Department and the General Services Department, alleges the  state arbitrarily and capriciously agreed to accept relocation money from the  cities of Alhambra and Monterey Park.  </P> <P> Both cities, which pledged $100,000 apiece, objected to a Garvey Avenue parole  office that straddled the Alhambra-Monterey Park border. Another parole office  is on Main Street in Alhambra, and state officials said 20% of the parolees  served by the two offices live in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also claims that the state violated its own procedures by choosing  to lease the Pasadena location at 333 E. Walnut St., a site previously judged  unacceptable by the state.  </P> <P> Finally, the suit claims the state failed to prepare an environmental study as  required by the California Environmental Quality Act.  </P> <P> The decision to sue was made in closed session Tuesday by the Pasadena Board of  Directors, which has fought for the past two years against locating a parole  office in Pasadena.

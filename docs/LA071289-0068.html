			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> An art exhibit featuring a nude baseball player has touched off another  controversy in Chicago, the third time in three years that the nation's  third-largest city has been the scene of an art display some find  objectionable. Protesters have been out in force at the Chicago Public Library  Cultural Center since the exhibition, "Diamonds Are Forever: Artists and  Writers on Baseball," went on view. The painting, "Boys at Bat" by American  artist Eric Fischl, depicts a boy in a baseball uniform, a picnic table and a  frontal nude of a man swinging a baseball bat. Chicago Cultural Affairs  Commissioner Joan Harris described the show as a traveling exhibition of 100  artworks and literary passages organized by the New York State Museum and the  Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services. It is scheduled to be on  display through Sept. 9 at the Cultural Center. Two previous displays at the  Art Institute of Chicago also were controversial. Earlier this year, an exhibit  by an art student invited people to step on an American flag placed on the  floor. The display brought daily demonstrations from several veterans' groups  and some state lawmakers. Last year, a painting of the late Chicago Mayor  Harold Washington in women's lingerie touched off another flap. Several members  of the City Council stormed the Art Institute and removed the painting. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / IG Metall in 'social conflict' wages threat Labour conflict in Germany's vital engineering industry loomed yesterday when wage negotiations ended in deadlock in two key regions. Union negotiators warned that 'massive' token strikes were likely from next Monday, after the engineering employers refused to move from their insistence on a wage freeze, and a reduction in holiday entitlements for the 3.4m members of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union. The fourth round of talks between the union and Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, ended without movement on either side in both North Rhine-Westphalia, with 950,000 workers involved, and northern Baden-Wurttemberg, where the negotiations cover 750,000. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader, warned that his members were gearing up for a 'major social conflict' in the light of the employers' refusal to compromise on their demands. At a national conference of the opposition Social Democratic party in Bonn, he appealed for support to counter what he described as the 'catastrophic course' of the engineering employers, who have called for cost cuts of up to 10 per cent from the current wage round. The employers, however, are expressing much greater confidence that a deal will be agreed without an all-out strike. Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of the German chambers of trade and industry (DIHT) and former engineering industry negotiator, said he did not believe either side was prepared for such a conflict. He predicted a 'relatively extended wage round' before a conclusion was reached. The union is seeking wage rises of between 5.5 and 6.0 per cent in the different negotiating regions, to compensate for inflation and claimed increases in productivity. In contrast, the employers say that with job losses in the industry running at around 30,000 a month over the past year, real cost cuts are essential. Mr Zwickel appeared to moderate his position yesterday, when he said the union had made job security its highest priority. At the start of negotiations, he said that both job security, and the maintenance of real income levels, were of equal priority. Both sides are obliged to negotiate without strikes or lock-outs only until Friday this week, which is why a campaign of token strikes is expected from next week. However, if neither side formally declares the negotiations failed, the existing wage levels, and the existing package of holiday bonuses, will remain intact. Government bonds, Page 33</p>

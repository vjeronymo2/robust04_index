			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Ray of hope for home owners / A look at the options for dealing with mortgage arrears A FAINT light for home-owners glimmered this week from the Lord Chancellor's office - the number of repossession proceedings reaching court has declined slightly in the last quarter. The rash of job losses over the same three months suggest that this has little to do with any improvement in the economy. Rather, lenders are exercising more discretion before opting for the last resort, repossession. Lenders are prepared to accept that what is an acceptable lowered mortgage payment today may not have been acceptable two years ago, when repossessions began to multiply. However, the Lord Chancellor's figures do not include those who voluntarily surrender their keys and leave the house. This move never made any sense, as you remain liable for mortgage repayments on the house whether or not you happen to occupy it. Therefore, those in trouble with arrears may as well continue enjoying their house until the last possible moment. Many more people may now be in arrears, but at least the options facing them are much broader than they used to be. This is particularly the case if you do not have an endowment mortgage. If you have a repayment mortgage, you can lengthen the term, which may not have a great effect on outgoings, or switch to repaying interest only. Interest can also be deferred for a period, which makes sense if your shortfall in income is likely to be temporary. If there has been a build-up of arrears, some of the outstanding interest can be capitalised, so you then resume paying interest on a higher amount. Those stuck with endowment mortgages could as a last resort sell the endowment to a marketmaker, which will be easier the longer the policy has been in business, and then make repayments on a capital repayment, or even interest-only basis. All of these measures can be executed more smoothly if you stay in regular contact with the lender. Borrowers are often nervous to do this, but repossession is such a severe problem for building societies now that they will be quite as keen as you are to avoid resorting to taking control of the property. Most of the big lenders have organised free debt counselling for borrowers in trouble, and it is foolish not to ask about this possibility. Then there are the mortgage rescue schemes. Most of these have been introduced in the last year, and none should be regarded as an easy option. They typically involve selling the property back to the lender, or to a housing association. You would then become a tenant (or perhaps part-owner part-tenant) and pay a rent, for which housing benefit might be available. These schemes may not be available in many cases, and the Council of Mortgage Lenders suggests they should only be consided by families who have suffered a severe reduction in income and have no entitlement to income support. But they are better than repossession. Those still nervous about talking to their lender could look at the following, recommended by the Council of Mortgage Lenders: SHAC (the London Housing Aid Centre) 189a Old Brompton Road, London SW5 0AR, (tel: 071-373-7276) offers advice on housing problems in the Greater London area.

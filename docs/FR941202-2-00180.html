The on-site assessor should use a variety of tools in the evaluation process. The experience of the assessor, his/her observations, interviews with laboratory staff, and examination of SOPs, raw data, and the laboratory's documentation will all play an important role in the assessment. The role of the on-site assessor is a critical one in the entire laboratory accreditation process. The accreditation of a particular laboratory will depend to a large extent on the assessor's recommendation. While much of the on-site assessment will depend upon the assessor's judgement, the recommendation not to accredit a laboratory must be based on factual information, not on opinions or suppositions. Therefore it is crucial that the on-site assessor have a clear understanding of the laboratory's procedures and policies, and that the assessor document any deficiencies. Also the assessor should discuss any deficiencies with the laboratory's management in order to allow them to provide additional information which might affect the assessor's recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.6.3&blank;Checklists <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standardized checklists for the on-site assessment must be used. The use of checklists does not discourage the need for additional observations and staff interviews, but is merely another tool in the assessor's inventory which assists in conducting a thorough and efficient evaluation. Using a checklist as a substitute for assessor training and experience must not occur. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It is anticipated that standardized checklists will be developed or adopted by NELAC's On-Site Assessment Committee for the assessor's review of analytical and biological methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.6.4&blank;Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

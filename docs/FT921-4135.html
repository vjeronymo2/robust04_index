			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: French property question is referred to European Court WEBB v WEBB Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Taylor and Lord Justice Scott): February 27 1992 THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice is to be asked to make a preliminary ruling as to whether the effect of the 1968 Brussels Convention is that French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to hear a case concerning French property bought by an English father in his son's name, for the alleged purpose of a trust in the father's favour. If on the true construction of article 16 of the Convention the object of the claim is to establish rights of ownership in land, French courts have exclusive jurisdiction. If the object is to enforce personal rights arising from arrangements between father and son analogous to contract, the English court has jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal adjourned an appeal by the defendant son, Mr Lawrence Desmond Webb, from a decision of Judge Paul Baker QC sitting as a High Court judge, dismissing his application for summary dismissal of an action brought against him by his father, Mr George Lawrence Webb. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said that an agreement to purchase a property in Antibes, France, was concluded between the vendor and Mr George Webb, the father, in July and August 1971. In October 1971 the purchase was completed and the property was transferred into the name of Mr Lawrence Webb, the son. The purchase price of FFr600,000 was provided by the father and was placed pending completion in an account in the son's name at the Antibes branch of Barclays Bank. Payment to the vendor was made out of the funds in that account. The necessary exchange control permissions from the Bank of England were obtained on the footing that the property would be purchased in the name of the son. After the purchase the property was used by the father and his wife, as well as by the son, as a holiday home. The bulk of the outgoings since purchase had been borne by the father. The father contended that it was agreed between him and his son that the son would hold the property in trust for him. He contended that he was entitled to the use and enjoyment of the property to the exclusion of the son, and to require the son to transfer the property into his name. The son contended that the property and its contents were a gift to him from the father. The 1968 Brussels Convention was incorporated into domestic law by section 2 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. Section 3(1) of the Act provided that any question as to the meaning or effect of the Convention should, 'if not referred to the European Court in accordance with the 1972 Protocol', be determined in accordance with European Court decisions. Section 3(2) provided that the report by Professor Schlosser on the Accession Convention might be considered in ascertaining the meaning or effect of any provision of the Conventions. Article 16 of the Brussels Convention (section 5 Title II) provided that '(1) in proceedings which have as their object rights in rem in . . . immovable property, the courts of the contracting state in which the property is situated' should have exclusive jurisdiction. The issue was whether the action constituted 'proceedings which have as the object rights in rem in immovable property'. If it did, then the courts of France, being the contracting state in which the property was situated, had exclusive jurisdiction and the English action should be dismissed. The judge concluded that the action was not caught by article 16(1). The son appealed. The case for allowing the appeal was that the father was bringing the action in order to establish his rights of ownership of the property. The property was 'immovable property'. Rights of ownership were rights in rem. So the action was covered by article 16(1). The case for dismissing the appeal was that the father and son both intended, when the property was purchased in 1971, that it would be put in the son's name. The rights asserted by the father in the action derived from the arrangements between father and son when the property was purchased. Those rights were in personam rights, not in rem rights. They had nothing to do with French land law. They were analogous to rights deriving from contracts for the sale of land. Actions for enforcement for sale of land were not, according to the Schlosser report, caught by article 16(1) (see paragraphs 171 and 172 of the Report). There were two European court decisions in which dicta bore on the issue (see Rosler v Rottwinkel (1985) 1 CMLR 806 and Reichart v Dresdner Bank, January 10 1990, Case C, 11/88). Those dicta were not, however, conclusive of the issue. The 1971 Protocol also was incorporated into domestic law by the 1982 Act, and was set out in Schedule 2 to the Act. Under article 3(2) of the Protocol the present court was empowered to request the European Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on a question of interpretation of the Brussels Convention 'if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment'. A preliminary ruling should be sought from the European Court before judgment was given on the present appeal. If it had been necessary to give final judgment now, his Lordship would have dismissed the appeal on the ground that the 'object' of the action was the enforcement of rights in personam arising out of the arrangements between father and son, not rights in rem, and that accordingly the action was not caught by article 16(1). But the matter was not clear, particularly as Lord Justice Nourse was in disagreement. Moreover, if the English court wrongly retained the action, the French courts might decline to enforce any orders made (see article 28). The proper scope of article 16(1) might depend on identification of the policy underlying the article. The European Court was the appropriate forum to identify the correct purposive interpretation of article 16(1) in its application to the facts of the case. Therefore, the court should request the European Court to give a preliminary ruling on the question whether, on the true interpretation of article 16(1), the present proceedings were proceedings in respect of which the courts of France had exclusive jurisdiction. Pending the preliminary ruling, the appeal was adjourned. LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR agreed. LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that the 'object' of the action, by which was meant the subject matter, was a right in rem in immovable property within article 16(1) of the Brussels Convention. He would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. But the division in opinion meant that a decision of the European Court on the question was necessary to enable the court to give judgment. He therefore agreed that a preliminary ruling of the European Court should be requested under article 3(2) of the 1971 Protocol. For the son: Mark Blackett-Ord and Barbara Rich (William Sturges &amp; Co). For the father: Michael Briggs (Bower Cotton &amp; Bower).</p>

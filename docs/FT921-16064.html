			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Recruitment techniques likely to be exported THE BRITISH approach to the selection of job candidates is likely to be exported to other European countries as companies increasingly recruit across national boundaries, according to British psychologists. There are large differences in recruitment methods among European countries. The French, for instance, rely heavily on graphology - the analysis of candidates' hand-writing. Only 2 per cent of British companies use graphology, according to a survey of nearly 1,000 organisations cited yesterday at the annual occupational psychology conference in Liverpool of the British Psychological Society. Nearly two thirds of British companies use ability tests and more than a third use personality testing. Almost half use assessment centres and 'task simulation' to evaluate job applicants' potential, according to the survey. Mr Roger Holdsworth, from one of the leading publishers of psychometric tests, Saville and Holdsworth, said at the conference that French subsidiaries of British companies were having to adopt more rigorous methods of selecting job candidates, using, for example, personality and ability tests. According to Mr Holdsworth, the British 'go a bundle on empirical evidence. The French don't operate like that and are more likely to employ pure Cartesian reasoning. They don't require vast studies, as we would, to establish that handwriting analysis actually works.' The Germans have been less successful than the British in integrating psychological testing in the recruitment process because of the greater 'professional elitism' of psychologists in Germany, said Mr Holdsworth. Germans are more likely to rely on interviews and candidates' track records.</p>

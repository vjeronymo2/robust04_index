			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source in Sanaa categorically denied that  government troops had fired any missiles on Aden yesterday or  today. The source stressed that only the city's airport was  targeted by Yemeni Armed Forces artillery.    In a statement transmitted today by the official Yemeni News  Agency, SABA', the source said that the objective of the  shelling is to prevent the secessionists from using the airport  to launch raids with warplanes on defenseless citizens and the  forces of unity and legitimacy.    The source stressed that none of the civilian installations  or residential areas in Aden will ever be a target of the  artillery shelling. The source explained, however, that all  military targets in the city are now within the range of the  unity forces' artillery, which is now engaging them from a  distance of no more 14 km.</p>

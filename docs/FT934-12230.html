			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (1): Progress is hampered by conflict - Sri Lanka's gross domestic product grew by 4.3 per cent in 1992 and exports climbed by more than 20 per cent. There is optimism in Colombo, but the war against Tamil separatists is a big obstacle to long-term economic progress ON the morning of May 1 1993, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, Sri Lanka's president, was on his way to a political rally. A populist given to flamboyant gestures, Mr Premadasa jumped out of his car at a busy junction and started directing traffic. A man pushing a bicycle walked towards the president. A bomb tied to the man's waist blew the president to bits. More than 20 other people were also killed in the blast. A few days earlier, Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, a popular opposition leader and former defence minister had been shot dead. The government blamed both murders on Tamil separatists fighting for statehood in the north and east of the country. The prophets of doom forecast that another round of bloodshed was about to sweep the country. There were fears that after five years of autocratic Premadasa rule, there would be political instability and the economy would nosedive. In the event, a power transition was effected with the minimum of disruption. Mr D. B. Wijetunga, the mild-mannered former prime minister, moved up to the presidential position. Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, the 44-year-old industries minister, became prime minister. The economy proved resilient to events. Despite continuing violence and the worst drought to hit Sri Lanka in 50 years, gross domestic product grew by 4.3 per cent in 1992 and officials say GDP growth this year is likely to be 5.7 per cent. Exports climbed by more than 20 per cent in 1992 and seem set to expand by a similar amount this year. Moves towards a more open, free market economy are continuing. There is plenty of optimism about. 'It is our goal to achieve newly industrialised country (NIC) status as we enter the 21st century,' says President Wijetunga. But violence and the war against Tamil separatists remain the biggest obstacle in the way of Sri Lanka's long-term economic progress. Fighting between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels has not only cost thousands of lives. The war has also cut off almost a third of the country from normal economic and social activity. The war costs the equivalent of between 3 and 4 per cent of GDP each year, with security eating up 15 per cent of precious budget funds. Former President Premadasa tried and failed to negotiate with the Tamil Tigers, the main rebel group. President Wijetunga shows signs of taking a harder line. But the government has learned that it is very difficult to defeat a disciplined guerrilla force whose tactics include suicide bombings. Any full-scale military offensive against the rebels in the north could provoke mayhem in other parts of the island. While the war continues, Sri Lanka is unlikely to attract the sort of long-term capital-intensive investment it so urgently needs in order to achieve NIC status and follow in the footsteps of dynamic economies such as those of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The country needs mills to feed its textile industry. If industrial expansion is to continue, new power plants should be coming on stream. But in the present circumstances investors, both local and foreign, seem unwilling to commit large-scale funds to Sri Lanka on a long-term basis. It is a credit to the government that despite the war in the north and a Maoist-style insurgency in the late 1980s, which caused havoc in the south of the country, considerable progress has been achieved on many fronts. Sri Lanka has been praised by aid organisations for its poverty eradication programmes. Standards of literacy and health are well in advance of any other country in the south Asia region. Over the past five years Sri Lanka's economic structure has undergone fundamental change. Agriculture, once the mainstay of the economy, has declined in importance with tea and other traditional crops accounting for less than 24 per cent of the total value of exports last year. Meanwhile, industrial exports, mainly textiles and garments, grew by 41 per cent last year and now account for more than 65 per cent of total export values. In the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has been a pioneer in introducing market-based reforms. Exchange controls have been progressively lifted. Tariffs have been reduced. A number of state enterprises have been privatised. 'The results of these policies are clearly evident,' says President Wijetunga. 'We have more than doubled our rate of economic growth. Our average per capita income has risen from SLRs1,902 in 1976 to SLRs24,234 in 1992 (Dollars 214 and Dollars 553 at prevailing exchange rates) despite having 3.7m more mouths to feed. 'We have made a dent in unemployment, which has declined from about 24 per cent to around 14 per cent. . . there is hope in the air and the international community has developed confidence in our land and its policies.' But not all government policies have worked. Inflation, now running at between 12 and 15 per cent according to central bank officials, remains an intractable problem. The government has made large cutbacks in spending in some sectors and a tough budget is forecast in early November. But spending on security is rising rapidly and while considerable progress has been made in cutting the budget deficit, which now amounts to 7.4 per cent of GDP, Sri Lanka remains dependent on foreign funding to meet its spending needs. Sri Lanka received Dollars 840m in aid last year; a far higher amount, on a per capita basis, than other countries in the region. Foreign direct investment in 1992 nearly doubled to Dollars 120m and further strong investment growth has been evident this year. But most of this investment is relatively short term. A large proportion of inward investment has gone into textiles: some argue that the country is now overly dependent on one industrial sector. A lot of investment has come from the east, particularly from South Korea and Taiwan. Sri Lanka needs to build an industrial base but many companies use the island only as an assembly point for garments, taking advantage of cheap labour and the country's quotas. Most cloth for the textiles factories is imported. Owners of the few textile mills operating in Sri Lanka allege that the South Koreans and others are dumping cloth on the island and threatening the survival of their mills. Although significant progress has been made in fiscal reforms and moves towards a more open economy, the process has been slow. The IMF is concerned about recent public sector pay rises and excessive credit growth, particularly in the plantations sector. Last year, Mr Wijetunga, then prime minister, admitted that the two big state banks, which control more 65 per cent of the banking industry, had accumulated a total of SLRs18bn in bad loans and were technically insolvent. Privatisation - termed 'peoplisation' by the government - has so far excluded many of the big state enterprises such as the two biggest banks, the telecommunications company and Air Lanka, the national carrier. Sri Lanka is arguably a more democratic country than its economically thriving neighbours to the east. 'We are the opposite of Singapore or South Korea,' says Mr Wickremesinghe. 'Democracies have to carry people along; a government has to explain. We are a politically mature country.' But an active democracy often leads to tough economic decisions being put off for political reasons. Government officials acknowledge they have to tread very carefully with privatisation so as not to offend powerful unions. The present Wijetunga government is regarded as less tough in many areas than the Premadasa regime. More political trade-offs are likely, particularly in the run-up to presidential elections due to be held before the end of 1994. For the moment, the United National Party, in power since 1977, seems secure in office, with the main opposition party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, a former prime minister, divided by bitter quarrels. The government still has a very tough job. Sri Lanka's well-educated people have high aspirations. In the late 1980s, former President Premadasa ruthlessly quashed a left-wing insurgency in the south. Remnants of that movement, resentful at the lack of economic opportunities available, still exist. But above all, it is a settlement of the fighting in the north and east which holds the key to Sri Lanka's future. In Colombo, the war often feels remote. But as long as the fighting continues, it will be difficult for Sri Lanka to climb the economic ladder and capitalise on its impressive advances of recent years.</p>

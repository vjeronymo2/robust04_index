			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 13 (TANJUG) -- President of the Bosnian  Serb republic Radovan Karadzic has warned that the war in Bosnia  might continue if totally unacceptable maps are offered.    Karadzic is in Moscow to receive the Mikhail Sholokov prize  for literature which has been awarded to him by the Association  of Russian Writers.    In a statement to reporters at Moscow airport upon his  arrival on Monday, Karadzic said that no-one can expect Bosnian  Serbs to accept something in whose creation they did not take  part, including maps which do not take into consideration the  actual situation in the field, without respect for the  historical factors and especially the vital interests of the  Serb people.    Under the plan of the contact group which consists of  representatives of the United States, Russia, and the European  Union, the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-  Herzegovina will be divided into two parts, 51 percent for the  Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Serb republic.    Some U.S. circles are behind the beginning of the Bosnian  war  and its prolonging, Karadzic said, emphasizing that he was not  blaming the entire U.S. administration for this.    Pointing out that the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-  Herzegovina was created without the participation of Bosnian  Serbs, Karadzic underscored that the federation was created only  by respecting the military factor, in the sense of forming an  anti-Serb coalition.    Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croatia  signed a preliminary agreement in Washington on March 1, under  strong pressure from the U.S., on the forming of a federation of  the two peoples in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which  would later enter into a confederation with Croatia.    Political analysts believe that Washington is again trying  to  isolate Bosnian Serbs with this initiative and pressure them  into making territorial concessions more easily at the  conference table.    Despite the embargo, Moslems and Croats in Bosnia are arming  themselves, so that the decision adopted by the House of  Representatives of U.S. Congress last week to exempt Moslems  from the embargo on arms sales to former Yugoslavia actually has  no major significance.    I would like such a decision to be adopted, because in that  case I expect Russia would lift the sanctions against  Yugoslavia, Karadzic said.    The United Nations Security Council imposed an embargo on  arms sales to all republics of the former Yugoslav federation in  the autumn of 1991, and two years ago, also comprehensive and  tough sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  unjustly accusing it of having the greatest responsibility for  the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Karadzic concluded that Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina are  not  interested in the establishment of peace, but urge the war  option, because they have the support of the United States.    The Bosnian Serb president said that he expected he would  meet with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other ministry  officials. He expressed hope that he would meet also with Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin.</p>

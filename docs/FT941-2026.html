			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Major defends Ulster policy Mr John Major yesterday promised to try to improve Anglo-Irish security co-operation, as fresh misgivings about the government's Northern Ireland policy surfaced on the Conservative back benches. Mr John Wilkinson, Tory MP for Ruislip Northwood, said recent terrorist attacks showed Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, was right to say that December's Downing Street declaration had 'run its course'. Mr Wilkinson said: 'Political progress is dependent on progress on the security front.' But Mr Major told MPs he would continue a twin-track approach of pursuing talks while cracking down on terrorism through cross-border security co-operation. This was currently 'at an all-time high', he said. 'We propose to build on that security co-operation. . . There have been welcome recent successes on both sides of the border.' The Commons exchanges came after Irish police announced the discovery of a suspected IRA weapons hoard near Skreen, County Sligo.</p>

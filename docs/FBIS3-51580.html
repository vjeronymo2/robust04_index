Velasquez to deal with the national financial system crisis  resulting from the fall of Banco Latino, and to stop the  "dangerous" rumor campaign, was warmly welcomed by banking  representatives who said the program arouses feelings of  security and confidence in the future.    As he left the site of the president's speech, to which all  the sector's representatives were invited, National Banking  Council President Jose Bouzas Izquierdo said that the  president's announcement to the effect that the BCV [Venezuelan  Central Bank] will support the country's financial institutions  constitutes the beginning of the definitive solution of the  crisis created by the Banco Latino intervention. Bouzas  characterized as very healthy the measures aimed at stemming the  wave of rumors, comments, and remarks about specific banks  which, in his opinion, should be rejected for the good of the  financial sector and to safeguard those banks' depositors.    The president was very emphatic in pointing out that  criminal  action will be taken against individuals who in any way spread  such rumors or instigate distrust toward certain financial  institutions. That is a fundamental issue, Bouzas said; it is up  to us to work within the framework of the law and to adhere to  the healthiest banking conventions, and it is up to the news  media to echo the president's remarks concerning the need to  control those rumors.    Meanwhile, Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said it was  necessary to undertake this package of measures in view of the  regrettable Banco Latino episode. In Silva's opinion, this plan  not only has the full support of the national government but  that of the president-elect and his team of collaborators.    Silva stated explicitly that reducing the quantity of bank  deposits will allow the release of [word indistinct] that could  be very useful at this time of financial need. Silva confirmed  the resignations of Banking Superintendent Roger Urbina and  Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza Martino who,  according to Silva, resigned "to facilitate the work of the  next government."</p>

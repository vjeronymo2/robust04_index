			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Gracechurch action group - At a Glance Dissatisfied investors in the Gracechurch BES Companies may like to know that Gordon Leighton, chartered accountants, are organising an action group. (For more information, contact Andrew White on 071 935 5737.) This loan-back business expansion scheme, launched by Barclays de Zoete Wedd in March 1993 was, along with National Westminster's Homeshare scheme, caught by the Budget announcement banning such schemes. Investors in the BZW scheme who expected a tax-free return of 14 per cent after six months, have been offered 5 per cent after 18 months or have been locked in for five years.</p>

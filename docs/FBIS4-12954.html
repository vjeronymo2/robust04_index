			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "As al-Tall Continues His Visit to </F> Iraq, Attempts To Mar the Jordanian-Iraqi Relations"]    [Text] Amman--AKHIR KHABAR--It has been reported that some  Iraqi opposition members met in Amman in March. Husayn  al-Hakim, an Iraqi opposition leader, took part in that meeting.    AKHIR KHABAR has noticed that reports of that meeting were  leaked at a time coinciding with the visit of Dr. Sa'id al-Tall,  Jordanian deputy prime minister and minister of higher  education, to Baghdad to brief the Iraqi brothers on the latest  developments in the siege imposed on Iraq and al-'Aqabah.    The reports came on the heels of a successful recent visit  to  Baghdad by a Jordanian parliamentary delegation. Informed  sources said the Iraqi leadership welcomed the delegation's  proposal that multilateral parliamentary delegations should  visit the big powers in order to support the Iraqi position on  the blockade. The Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) has  issued a statement praising Jordan's stand on the official and  popular levels.</p>

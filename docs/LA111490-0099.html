			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA OKS A CAP OF 6% ON RENT INCREASES AT MOBILE HOME PARKS  </P> <P> Santa Clarita City Council members approved a tough ordinance Tuesday night to  limit rent increases at mobile home parks, saying retirees and low-income  families need the protection.  </P> <P> The product of 10 months of negotiations between city officials, park owners  and residents, the ordinance originally proposed an 8% cap on yearly rent  increases.  </P> <P> But the council, to the delight of about 200 mobile home park residents who  packed the council chambers, unanimously lowered the cap to 6%.  </P> <P> The ordinance will tie rent increases to the consumer price index, up to a  maximum of 6% annually.  </P> <P> Council members said they were philosophically uncomfortable with rent control  but had to protect low-income residents who could not afford spiraling rents in  the city's 17 mobile home parks. "It isn't that we want to put in rent  control," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy told park owners in the audience.  </P> <P> During a two-hour hearing, park residents pushed for the 6% cap and seven other  modifications to the ordinance. David Evans, a member of the Western Mobile  Home Assn., a park owners group, complained that the residents had negotiated  in bad faith.  </P> <P> "I feel like we need to start all over again," Evans said. "I feel like we've  been betrayed."  </P> <P> Formal negotiations on the ordinance between park owners and residents began in  February, but the foundation for the measure was laid in 1988 when owners of  the 60-space Desert Gardens Mobile Home Park announced they were shutting down  the park to build a shopping center. Because of the area's rapid growth, the  site had become ideal commercial space, the owners said.  </P> <P> At the time, mobile home residents predicted that the demise of Desert Gardens  would set off a spate of closures, with park owners trying to cash in on  rapidly rising property values in the region.  </P> <P> In response to pleas from mobile home park residents, the City Council passed  an emergency moratorium on park closures. When the measure expired this past  summer, the council revamped its zoning ordinance to make it more difficult to  close a mobile home park.  </P></p>

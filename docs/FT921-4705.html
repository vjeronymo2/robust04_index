			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Private View: A veteran keeper of the Olympic flame Arthur Gold discusses the British sense of fair play and the Hellenic view of sport EURIPIDES was scornful. What use to his city, he asked, is a man who wins prizes for wrestling, running, throwing the discus or smiting jaws? The old tragedian's cynicism was premature, perhaps. But the spirit of the Olympic Games was indeed eventually undermined by bribery, professionalism and politics. The nadir came when the Emperor Nero won a gold medal in the AD 67 chariot race in spite of being the sole contestant and failing to finish. After an unbroken run of nearly 1,200 years (some say even longer) the Games were abolished in the year 393. Yet the spirit lingered on, especially in philhellene England: the Cotswold Olympics were staged in 1636 and the Much Wenlock Olympic Society was formed in 1850. And when Baron de Coubertin resurrected the Games in 1896 one of the first gold medallists was a young British scholar, George Robertson, who happened to be on holiday in Athens and submitted a Pindaric ode. Those were the days. What would Euripides have said if he had been at this year's winter Olympics in Albertville and seen men in luminous zoot-suits and Darth Vader helmets hurtle down near-vertical ski slopes at 130 mph? What verdict would he pass on the summer Games coming up in Barcelona? One man who has tried to shield the pure Olympic flame from polluting airs is Sir Arthur Gold: high jumper, team leader at Mexico, Munich and Montreal, doyen of British athletics' officials and, at 75, still chairman of the British Olympic Association. I asked him to define the Olympic spirit - or 'ethos' as he prefers to call it. 'Oh, dear. You may as well ask Dr Johnson how he arrived at the meaning of words in his dictionary] 'I tend to use 'ethos' because it's a nebulous word. Sport is a cross between politics and religion. You can't define sport as such. And the Olympic ethos means doing something not necessarily for profit or for position but for the satisfaction of knowing that on that particular day you were the best. 'It's an awfully trite thing to say, but the victory itself is a bonus on top of doing something that you enjoy - or should enjoy.' Sir Arthur clearly enjoyed his own athletics. In the real world, he runs the family garage business, a repair shop and Renault franchise in north London. (His grandfather was a hansom cab proprietor). But once established as an international high jumper, though he missed Hitler's 1936 Olympics by a whisker, he went on competing until the age of 43. Adopting the Eastern Cut-off (this was before things like the Fosbury Flop were allowed, giving jumpers another foot) he achieved a best of 6ft 3in, and is proud of the fact that for 28 consecutive seasons he never vaulted less than 5ft 8in. I reminded him of the fate of the ancient Games and asked whether the modern Olympiad was heading in the same direction. 'Sadly, we've got human nature at work. The original games lasted for more than a thousand years; things happen much more rapidly these days. I would have to be a great optimist to think ours would survive the intrusions of commerce and politics for the next thousand years. I doubt it. 'There is a very real danger for the Games now. Particularly since 1984, the International Olympic Committee has been conscious of the vast sums to be made from sponsors and television. In the pursuit of television coverage they may make some unwise decisions.' By this he meant the temptation to promote sports popular on television  - tennis, soccer, even baseball - at the expense of traditional athletics. But these sports all have their own world championships, and the Olympics would be second-best. 'You could find the IOC, accustomed to living in champagne style, reduced to a ginger beer pocket.' What, I said, do you think of events like ice dancing where it's a matter of subjective judgment? 'Subjective sport is always a difficult issue: diving, skating, even boxing without a knockout is subjective. It certainly calls for skill to skate, it calls for skill to dance on skates. 'Oliver Cutts, who was involved in ballroom dancing, used to ask me: 'Why can't ballroom dancing be an Olympic sport?' I would waffle away and say it's not really a sport. Then he would say: 'What about ice dancing? The only difference is the skill required to stay on skates.'' Remembering the bad press suffered by the recent winter Olympics, I asked Sir Arthur whether the winter games were degenerate. 'Degenerate is not a word I would accept. But I think there's a real difference.' He described how limited was people's access to winter sports, in spite of the appearance at Albertville of bobsleigh teams from the Caribbean. 'Now take the 100 metres. Every child at the age of eight, if not sick or infirm, has run a race even if only at a Sunday school. So sprinters are the best of a nation. How do you relate a gold medal for the 100 metres with a gold medal in the bobsleigh where number two and three run like mad for 30 yards, jump in, keep their heads down and pray for the next minute . . . and win a gold medal?' Ideally, then, Olympic sports should be universal. But Sir Arthur goes even further. 'The very nub is not the competition itself but the Olympic village. For two or three weeks the cream of the world's youth share, metaphorically at least, one roof. They learn how much they have in common. They share the hopes, the fears. The US competitors and the Soviet Union competitors find their rivals don't have horns or tails.' You have been called a conservative, I said. Are you part of a dwindling minority at the top of the Olympic movement? Sir Arthur protested. 'I don't consider myself conservative. I prefer 'traditionalist'. I don't subscribe to the idea that all change is necessarily for the better. 'If you ask me whether sport is to be run for the benefit of the competitors or the benefit of those who batten on to the competitors and make fortunes as a result, I would say sport is for those who participate.' Sir Arthur is gold dust for sports writers because he usually comes up with the good quote. Especially on the subject of drugs. 'It is long-term, calculated cheating,' he said. 'Fundamentally, sport is about health and honesty and drugs are the very negation of it.' When he protested about athletes taking body-building drugs, at the 1968 Mexico Games, he was 'laughed out of court', he says. Is your view prevailing? 'Well, I'm an optimist. Whenever I look up and see how far we have to go I look back and see how far we've come. The first battle is always for the hearts and minds of men. Now very few people if any are prepared to defend drug abuse in public. Much of the drug abuse has been eradicated. 'Remember, our task is not to detect those who do cheat, but to protect the majority who don't cheat. If in sport you are going to allow the cheats to prosper - we all as kids learn that cheats never prosper  - when you see a Ben Johnson (100m gold medallist in Seoul) offered Dollars 30,000 appearance money as world record holder but Dollars 1m for an appearance as a convicted cheat, there is a stench about it, something that stinks.' He agreed that for drug abuse to continue undetected required the connivance not only of coaches but of officialdom. He had been told by a top pharmacologist that his worst enemies were chemists in his own university who were trying to develop undetectable drugs. ('This was not in the UK, I hasten to add]') This week, Boris Becker, the former Wimbledon tennis champion, was reported as saying he would not support Berlin's bid to host the Games in the year 2000. Having been abused by neo-Nazis for going out with a coloured woman, he was afraid that success for Germany in those Games would excite the racists once more. Sir Arthur agreed that in recent years countries had tried to use the Games as an advertisement for the superiority of their system - capitalist or communist. But not all nationalism was inflammatory. 'I think there is pride in the performance of one's own countrymen. I don't look upon that as a bad aspect of nationalism. 'In a sporting sense that can be negative. But if it's an alternative to making war, it's positive. We live in a very imperfect world. We may all seek perfection, but we're never going to achieve it. We're human, we're fallible and if sport can minimise a few of those failings, it's better than nothing, isn't it? 'There's this awful English phrase 'fair play'. But we know what it means and I think it is the very nub of the Olympic Games.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smlth] </F>   [Text] The government has vowed not to back down on moves  to improve public access to official information despite China's  confirmation yesterday it would dissolve the new measures after  1997. Meanwhile legal experts have told the government the  package of measures does not go far enough nor comply with Hong  Kong's Bill of Rights.    Secretary for Home Affairs Michael Suen told the Sunday Hong  Kong Standard yesterday that it was up to Beijing to bring  forward its concerns to the government. "I think the initiative  does not lie with us," Mr Suen said. "We have taken the first  step and informed them."    The government announced last week it would give individuals  access to their personal files and establish a British-style  code of practice covering the release of official data. But  Chinese officials -- who were not consulted over the move --  lashed out on Friday, warning the measures breached the Joint  Declaration. Deputy director of Xinhua News Agency Cheung Kwok  Hung reiterated last night that China had not been consulted on  the proposals, which Beijing would dissolve after 1997. "If  there is such a great change of policy without discussion with  the Chinese side, we will not accept it," he said.    Mr Suen played down the latest rift in Sino-British  relations  and said consultations would resolve the problem. "I think all  they (China) are saying is that they need to be consulted," Mr  Suen said. "That should allay any fears. It is a whole package  of measures which will improve the efficiency of the civil  service, something I believe both governments want."    The government's package, which does not go so far as to  give  Hong Kong people a legal right to obtain information on  government operations, has angered key backers of Freedom of  Information legislation who say the proposals are toothless.  Senior Hong Kong lecturer in constitutional law Nihal  Jayawickrama said Section 16 of the Bill of Rights gives people  the right to seek information. "When you create the right to  seek information from the government there is a corresponding  right by the government to provide that information," he said.  Dr Jayawickrama said there would be grounds for a court battle  if an individual was refused information by the government.  "But the government is securely protected by those exorbitant  (court) fees," he said.    Mr Suen disagreed. "There is no obligation for an unwilling  party to give information," he said.</p>

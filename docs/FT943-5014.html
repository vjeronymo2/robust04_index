			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Asia Pacific side behind 17% JIB rise A strong performance from its Asia Pacific operations helped JIB Group, the insurance broker in which Jardine Matheson has a majority stake, turn in a 17 per cent increase in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 13.7m. Turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 107.4m), while earnings per share were unchanged at 6.4p, as was the dividend of 2.5p. Turnover in the Asia-Pacific region rose 19 per cent to Pounds 19.7m as the company reaped the benefit of opening new offices in South Korea and India and reorganising its operations in the Philippines. Mr John Barton, chief executive, said that JIB was looking to further expand its Far Eastern operations to benefit from the region's burgeoning economies. 'We will be building on our successes in our Asian Pacific insurance operations and overseas reinsurance business,' he said. He added that the company had been surprised by the toughness of the UK insurance market. Turnover here grew by just 9 per cent in the first half to Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 42.2m), with margins coming under pressure as brokers reacted to strong competitive pressures by reducing rates, particularly in the marine market. JIB's US operations also performed in competitive conditions, with Mr Barton blaming difficulties in the Lloyd's market as part of the reason for an increase in business remaining in the US. He added that the business was undergoing some restructuring. London was also a difficult market for the reinsurance business, with reduced demand dampening prices required for reinsurance cover. However, JIB was boosted by a good performance from its overseas reinsurance division.</p>

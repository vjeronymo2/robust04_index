Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of these proposed regulations is to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory preventive controls to ensure the safety of seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products sold commercially in the United States and exported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abroad. These preventive controls will be based on a system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known as HACCP. HACCP is a system by which food processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers can evaluate the kinds of hazards that could affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their products, institute controls necessary to keep these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards from occurring, monitor the performance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routine practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require that domestic and foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers adopt HACCP controls to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood products for consumers. If these regulations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted, FDA will review the adequacy of HACCP controls as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its program of mandatory inspections and import examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a review will occur in addition to traditional inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. FDA is also encouraging, but not proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require, that processors and importers adopt the same types of controls for nonsafety hazards relating to economic adulteration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to make HACCP mandatory for the seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Adoption of HACCP controls by the seafood industry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coupled with inspections by FDA based on the HACCP system, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a more effective and more efficient system for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety of seafood products than currently exists. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current inspection system places too great a burden on Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspectors to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address those problems. HACCP places primary responsibility upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the industry to demonstrate that hazards are understood and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A nationally mandated HACCP system will provide a basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for enhanced consumer confidence in the safety of seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Consumers should not be afraid to eat foods, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood, that are recommended as useful lower fat and lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saturated fat substitutes for higher fat meats (Ref. 1, p. 13;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ref. 2, p. 21).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The know-how for applying HACCP to seafood is in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advanced state of development. A considerable amount of work on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying HACCP to seafood has already been done by some States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academia, and the Federal Government as well as through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperative activities between the Federal Government and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry and through independent industry efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

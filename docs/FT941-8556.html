			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (12): The high tech way ahead - Indonesia - Paul Betts and Kieran Cooke look at the region's only aircraft manufacturer Indonesia, at present the only manufacturer of aircraft in south-east Asia, is multiplying its efforts to secure partnerships and collaboration with western aerospace groups to develop its growing indigenous aircraft industry. Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN), at its giant complex in Bandung on the island of Java, already produces the CN235 transport aircraft in co-operation with Casa of Spain. It is also a licensed assembler of a wide range of helicopters and is involved in several manufacturing programmes with western companies, mainly associated with offset deals on sales of commercial and military aircraft to Indonesia. The most recent example of the country's aerospace ambitions was an agreement signed at the end of last year with British Aerospace to co-operate in the development and manufacture of regional turboprop aircraft. At the same time, BAe is also considering establishing an assembly facility in Indonesia for Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft if Indonesia were to buy more Hawks. Last summer Indonesia ordered Pounds 500m worth of Hawks, becoming BAe's second biggest overseas military export market after Saudi Arabia. The aircraft co-operation deal with BAe coincided with an agreement between Rover, the BAe subsidiary recently sold to BMW, and Indonesia to develop a national car project to design, develop and manufacture a small car for production in Indonesia. Co-operation between Indonesia and the UK group could also eventually extend to the regional jet business. BAe has so far failed to negotiate a regional jet joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace and has been looking for possible alternative partners for these activities, including IPTN, although the main thrust of aerospace co-operation with Indonesia is currently focused on turboprops. To some, IPTN is a considerable achievement, an example of Indonesia's determination to leapfrog its way into the field of high technology and become a fully industrialised country. But IPTN also has its critics, who say it is a expensive enterprise which does little to promote overall development. Mr Bachariddin Habibie, founder of IPTN and Indonesia's minister of research and technology, has no doubts. 'We have to be in a position to master, understand, develop and control all the technologies in aerospace . . . this is only possible if the man who plans it knows exactly what he wants. I am a man who knows exactly what he wants.' IPTN was established in 1976. In 1983 the first CN235 was rolled out of the Bandung plant. Since 1989 IPTN has been planning the larger CN250, which will be the first commercial aircraft to be designed and built entirely in Indonesia. At first, the CN250 was to be a 50-seater aircraft. In the middle of last year Mr Habibie announced IPTN would go straight into production of a stretched 70-seat version of the aircraft. The first CN250 is due to be rolled out of the Bandung plant later this year with deliveries, mainly to Indonesian internal airlines, starting in early 1997. The ultimate aim, says Mr Habibie, is to produce a range of commuter aircraft ranging from 20-seaters to 130-seaters and make IPTN into 'the Toyota of aerospace'. IPTN plans to spend Dollars 250m to expand the Bandung complex to cope with nearly 170 commitments and options it has received for the CN250. Mr Habibie's critics say that despite the many millions of dollars spent on building up IPTN, very few linkages have been made between its high tech work and the rest of the Indonesian manufacturing sector. There is also concern about the lack of transparency in IPTN's accounts. However, Mr Habibie says that within Indonesia alone there will be a substantial market for IPTN's aircraft over the coming years. With revenues from oil and gas exports falling, Mr Habibie says the only way Indonesia can maintain a trade surplus is to develop technological manufacturing capability. 'If my country concentrates on low tech products and imports high tech products we will face a problem,' he says.</p>

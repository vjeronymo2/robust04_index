[Rexrodt] As a result of the companies' efforts to trim  production processes and of the slimming down of the economy,  even more jobs may be abolished. That is why it is so important  to break up the structures of the labor market: more  flexibility, more part-time work.    In 1995 at the latest, we will lastingly undercut the  4-million mark in unemployment.    [Hoeren] Where are the new jobs supposed to come from?    [Rexrodt] The greatest reserves exist in the service sector.  If we give services to people a higher social standing again,  there will be a labor boom in this field.    [Hoeren] The Bonn government has repeatedly cut back social  benefits. When will it finally be the turn of the big ones?    [Rexrodt] We are working on a complete restructuring of the  current system of subsidies: In the future, subsidies are to be  generally granted only for a specific period. I am thinking of  a period of five years.    In addition, the state subsidies are to be reduced in  certain  steps within this period.    We must also come to a regulation that state subsidies must  be repaid on principle as soon as the company's economic  situation has improved again. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions alert over spread of 'churning' - The needless switching of investments CHURNING, or unnecessary switching of investments to generate commission, appears to be spreading in the pensions market. One large firm of investment advisers, asked for a second opinion about pensions advice given by a competitor, was so alarmed that it reported the matter to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra), the self-regulatory body for financial advisers. The query came from a man made redundant two years ago who was advised at that time to transfer his preserved company pension into a personal pension policy. Several weeks ago, the broker which arranged the transfer sent a circular recommendation encouraging the man to switch his pension from the managed fund run by an insurance company into the broker's own fund. The adviser giving the second opinion said: 'It looks like an assembly line job. The paperwork is of a very poor standard and there is hardly any justification for the recommendation at all, apart from the expectation that their own broker fund will perform better than the insurance company's fund, based on past performance of just six months.' Although the adviser suggested that the recommendation might have come from a rogue individual within the particular firm, he considered it worth telling Fimbra that the material appeared to be part of a sizeable mailing. Fimbra refused to confirm it had received the adviser's report and said any possible disciplinary action was not for public discussion. It added: 'Any problem will have to be rectified by the member and, if it is not, they will be suspended from doing any investment business.' At the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Organisation (Lautro), a spokesman said that suggesting a switch into a broker bond might be a legitimate option providing investors were made aware of all costs and charges involved. But he stressed that Lautro would not take kindly to over-emphasis of short-term performance, such as a six-month record. The organisation insists on the use of figures covering at least five years, where these exist. Another form of churning most unlikely to be reported to investment watchdogs involves collusion between adviser and client to raid the accumulated pension. Industry sources say churning of personal pensions has focused on the cash-generating opportunities. Brokers can offer to share 4-5 per cent commission with a policyholder each time the accumulated transfer value of the pension is moved from one life company to another. This might seem insignificant but, even at middle management level, transfer values of Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 are not uncommon. Furthermore, commission levels in regular premium contracts are about 12 times the single premium rate. So, a Pounds 20,000 pension contribution could 'free' Pounds 12,000 to be allocated between the broker and the client. Such strategies would have to be concealed from watchdogs. 'The investor protection rules include a general obligation not to churn, and it cannot be compatible with good advice or suitability,' says Mike Wadsworth, of actuary Watsons. Life companies do not pay commission to an intermediary unless it can recover this from the fund. At some point during the life of the pension contract, the company will make sure it gets back from the customer the 5 per cent or more paid out. In the course of three or four moves from one company to another, the customer would also have to meet charges for setting up policies. All this could mean a significant reduction in the final value of the pension. A higher-rate taxpayer might take the view that 75 per cent of his final fund will be taxed at 40 per cent, whereas a rebate of commission from a broker will be tax-free. But this is a mistake. Tax inspectors see rebated commission as income, subject to tax. Wadsworth says there might be tactical reasons for switching a pension from one life company to another. For example, with a Section 32 buy-out policy, there are strict limits on the maximum pension and lump sum that can be taken out, with any surplus going to the life company. 'It is possible to play the system a bit,' adds Wadsworth, stressing that his own firm is not involved . 'Churning can happen in pensions - and sometimes does.'</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAY OF THE 'CONDOR' MARKED JONES' RETURN  </P> <P> Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall, with an arm span of nearly 7 feet, Dana Jones  of North Hollywood High has the appropriate nickname of Condor.  </P> <P> But after being grounded for 5 games because of a damaged left wing (sprained  wrist), several people questioned the Condor's flight condition before a Valley  Pac-8 Conference opener against Grant on Friday.  </P> <P> Would he be able to soar like before?  </P> <P> The answer was a resounding yes as Jones swooped for 19 points, 15 rebounds, 7  assists, 7 blocked shots and 5 steals in the Huskies' 67-57 victory over the  Lancers, ranked fifth in The Times Valley Poll.  </P> <P> "I was really looking forward to that game," Jones said. "I really wanted to  come back and help the team start winning."  </P> <P> "He was probably only 80%," North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller said. "But  Dana's the type of player who makes everyone else play better. . . . He just  seems to bring out the best in his teammates."  </P> <P> Jones was particularly impressive in the second quarter when he hit all 6 of  his field-goal attempts and helped North Hollywood extend a 12-point  first-quarter lead to a 36-18 advantage at halftime.  </P> <P> Wearing an Ace bandage to protect his wrist, the junior made 8 of 10 field-goal  attempts and has hit 65.6% (42 of 64) of his shots this season.  </P> <P> "My shot felt a little awkward when I was practicing during the week," Jones  said. "But I think it really came back that night. . . . The wrist felt like it  was close to 100%. It didn't give me any problems, except on free throws."  </P> <P> Foul shooting is Jones' weakness. He made 3 of 7 against Grant and has hit only  11 of 24 (45.8%) this season. However his strengths make him irreplaceable in  the Huskies' lineup.  </P> <P> "We're a completely different team without him," Miller said. "He's just such  an integral part of our offense and defense."  </P> <P> Statistics support Miller's claim.  </P> <P> After Jones suffered a severe wrist sprain in a 69-67 loss to Gardena in the  fourth game of the season, the Huskies (6-4) struggled to a 2-3 mark in the  North Hollywood and Bell-Jeff tournaments. Without him, North Hollywood was  outscored by an average of 66-60.  </P> <P> With Jones in the lineup, the Huskies are 4-1 and have outscored opponents by  an average of 72-59.  </P> <P> Sporting averages of 19 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 3 steals and 5.6  blocked shots a game, the Condor is again soaring high.  </P></p>

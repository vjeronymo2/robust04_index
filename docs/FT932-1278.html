			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: A buyer's Charter Charter's disentanglement from Minorco leaves it free to pursue life as an independent company. Without the spice of the South African connection, though, the prospects for its diverse collection of engineering, mining and building products interests look pedestrian. Charter's shares have kept pace with the market in recent years, but largely due to the rising value of its stake in Johnson Matthey. Since that holding - which accounted for around half Charter's market value - was disposed of in February, it has notably underperformed. With Pounds 200m in the bank after buying back Minorco's stake, and a balance sheet almost free of debt, Charter will doubtless look to add to its empire. An acquisition for cash to complement its railway equipment business, for example, would make strategic sense and improve earnings. But once the cash pile is exhausted, Charter will find the going tough. Its continuing business might be expected to trade on a price-earnings ratio a shade below the market average. Unless that can be remedied, using paper to fund acquisitions will be far from easy. A further question is whether more seasoned conglomerates might take a shine to Charter now the Minorco stake has gone. Hanson might value its interests in US coal; railway equipment looks like a classic business for BTR; Williams Holdings fancies its chances in building products and fire prevention. Whether it is predator or prey, Charter will feel the pressure to sustain a rating well up with the market average.</p>

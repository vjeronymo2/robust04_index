			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The population  issue is, in essence, an issue of development, and the two  issues are interwoven, a Chinese delegate said here today.    Peng Yu, head of the Chinese delegation, was speaking at the  third session of the preparatory committee for the International  Conference on Population and Development, which opened here  today.    Peng said, only by promoting socio-economic development can  the population problem be solved in a reasonable way.    "Population policies and programs should be treated as an  integral part of national socio-economic development  strategies," Peng said.    She pointed out that as the situation differs from country  to  country, the government of each country should set its own  policies and objectives that reflect the best interests of the  nation, local communities, the families and individuals.    Governments are duty-bound to achieve their population goals  through improving economic conditions and upgrading the quality  of life for their people, Peng said, adding "family planning  should be promoted without any forms of coercion."    Peng also noted that it is of major importance to enhance  women's status, protect their legal rights and interests, offer  them with more opportunities for education, and encourage them  to participate in the process of political and economic  developments.    The international conference on population and development  will be held in Cairo, Egypt, from September 5 to 13.</p>

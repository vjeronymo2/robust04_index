Mr. Mugabe ordered the release of an official in the secret  Central Intelligence Organization, (Elias Khenagoni), and the  provincial youth leader of the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe  African National Union Patriotic Front] party, (Khezito  Tshibambu). The two were last year sentenced to seven years in  prison for shooting (Patrick Khumbayi), who was contesting a  parliamentary seat against the vice-president Simon Muzenda in  the 1990 election. They were pardoned hours after their appeal  against their conviction was thrown out by the country's supreme  court.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: No truck with inheritance trade-offs - Off the Wall THE BATTLE to keep Holbein's 'Portrait of a lady with a pet squirrel and a starling' in the UK is far from lost. Indeed the very haste with which the owner, Lord Cholmondeley, advised by Christie's, has rushed the painting to auction on April 15, with no attempt at a private treaty sale, has aroused the fury of the heritage lobby. The pressure is on the Minister for the Arts, Tim Renton, to use his powers to steer this poignant picture towards its natural home in the National Gallery. Renton has some powerful cards. Lord Cholmondeley expects a bonanza price from the open market, an optimistic Pounds 15m plus. But whatever sum the picture makes at Christie's he will have to pay inheritance tax of a reputed 60 per cent on the sale, which could reduce his actual cash in hand to nearer Pounds 7m. Of course he is reluctant to pass over so many millions to the Inland Revenue. To avoid doing so he proposes to offer the 18th century William Kent furnishings at Houghton, his Suffolk seat, to the nation under a unique Acceptance-In-Lieu of tax package. But there are good reasons why Renton, who has the final say, should oppose such a deal. It makes nonsense of the AIL provisions to use them to secure one heritage item, the Houghton furnishings, at the expense of another, the Holbein portrait. And for Lord Cholmondeley the actual cost is minimal - the furniture would still grace his home. When Lord Rothschild tried to introduce an element of flexibility into AIL last year, offering to buy Canova's 'The Three Graces' for the nation if the cost could be set against his inheritance tax bill, the Minister gave him a dusty answer. A timely word from Renton, making clear that he will have no truck with trade-offs, could put a private treaty deal, which would include a tax sweetener, back on the table. The National Gallery was able to acquire an important landscape by Aelbert Cuyp from Lord Bute by persuading him to accept the Pounds 8m price over three years. If the after-tax value of the Holbein is also around Pounds 8m and Lord Cholmondeley is prepared to take the money in annual payments, the National Gallery, aided by the National Heritage Fund, becomes a serious buyer. Another incentive for Lord Cholmondeley is the absence of obvious bidders on the open market. The inevitable candidate, the Getty Museum in Malibu, has kept so far to its policy of not bidding for art works which are considered to be part of a nation's heritage. The recession in Germany must deter the German buyers that Christie's is lining up. A guaranteed sum from the NG, and the thanks of a grateful nation, could seem to the young marquess an attractive alternative to the vagaries of the market. What has happened to Tim Renton, the normally benign Arts Minister? While handing out his weekly alms for the needy - in this case Pounds 2m for a Theatre Restoration Fund to patch up the likes of the Hackney Empire and the City Varieties, Leeds - he suddenly announced the abolition of the Arts Council as we know and love it. Well, almost. He said he had been converted to direct Government funding of the national flagship companies - the National Theatre and the RSC, Covent Garden and the ENO, and other big recipients of state subsidy. This would take away the Council's raison d'etre. Under chairman Lord Palumbo the Council is trying to off-load the funding of smaller arts organisations to the new regional arts boards. To retain any influence at all it must sign the cheques for the major clients. The views of the Big Four tend to change with the wind, championing the Arts Council as their paymaster when they are getting large grants, preferring direct Government funding when they think it might be more generous. At the moment only Covent Garden, which is cross because its grant was only marginally increased this year, supports a change. The others are reluctant to become the pawns to what would inevitably be political decisions. The arms length principle gives them that bit more artistic freedom. Why has Renton rallied to what is basically Labour Party policy? It would not be the first time the Government has done so: the switch to local arts funding is another conversion. But setting loose this hare was totally unexpected. It could be that Renton believes he is unlikely to keep his job even if the Conservatives win the Election. He might as well go out with a few fireworks. It could also be that he feels hard done by. He travels the country with his small initiatives - a National Music Day here; a Museum and Galleries Improvement Fund there - but the big decisions are taken behind his back. The Prime Minister grabbed the kudos for the European Arts Festival; the previous Arts Minister, David Mellor, in his current job at the Treasury, is credited with getting the arts their substantial funding rise last autumn. Renton might be demob happy, stirring things up for his successor.</p>

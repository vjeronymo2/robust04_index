			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON SENTENCE CUT FOR FAN OF ACTRESS  </P> <P> A judge on Tuesday reduced by two years the prison sentence of an obsessed fan  who barricaded herself inside the Studio City house of actress Sharon Gless.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major reduced the sentence from six  to four years after reviewing a favorable progress report prepared by the  California Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> The report stated that Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove has not created  problems for guards or other prisoners while serving her sentence in the  California Institute for Women in Frontera.  </P> <P> On July 16, Major sentenced Penn to six years in prison after she pleaded no  contest to two counts of burglary stemming from the March 30 standoff and an  earlier break-in at Gless' house. At the time of sentencing, the judge reserved  the right to reduce the jail term pending an evaluation of Penn's prison  behavior.  </P> <P> The sentencing arrangement was part of a plea bargain under which Penn was able  to avoid being imprisoned for the maximum of nine years, eight months if  convicted after a trial.  </P> <P> Penn's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell J. Bruckner, said he believes  that Major reduced the sentence in part because Penn apologized to Gless during  the July 16 sentencing hearing. Under the reduced term, Penn could be freed as  early as March, 1992.  </P> <P> Penn broke into Gless' house when the actress was away and barricaded herself  inside with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition.  </P></p>

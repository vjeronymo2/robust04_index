			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hiteshi Takesata, chief of the First </F> Research Office of the Second Research Department in the  Japanese Defense Agency's National Institute for Defense  Studies, by Foreign Affairs Department reporter Bumigo Ozawa;  place and date not given -- first paragraph is MAINICHI SHIMBUN  introduction]    [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began  holding a session of its Board of Governors in Vienna on 6 June,  and high on the agenda of the session is the issue of North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. MAINICHI  SHIMBUN Foreign Affairs Department reporter Bumigo Ozawa has  interviewed Hiteshi Takesata, chief of the First Research Office  of the Second Research Department of the Defense Agency's  National Institute for Defense Studies on the present state of  and prospects for the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons.    [Ozawa] Why is North Korea so hastily removing fuel rods  from  its experimental (five-megawatt) nuclear reactor at Yongbyon?    [Takesata] North Korea is doing so because it is actually  hastening the development of nuclear weapons. There is an  argument that the DPRK has suffered a loss of prestige because  it has been criticized for developing nuclear weapons although  it has not actually engaged in developing them. I do not agree  with this argument. North Korea has refused to give IAEA  inspectors access to the removal of the fuel rods at the expense  of resuming high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, and this is evidence  that the country is developing nuclear weapons.    [Ozawa] At what stage is North Korea's development of  nuclear  weapons?    [Takesata] The DPRK is said to have extracted plutonium from  the experimental nuclear reactor in question, and the plutonium  is enough to build one or two atomic bombs. Once North Korea  extracts weapons-grade materials from the experimental nuclear  reactor, the next stage is to develop detonation devices for  atomic bombs and technology to miniaturize the atomic bombs.  According to a South Korean defense white paper, in North  Korea, about 70 craters have been found where detonation devices  are believed to have been tested. The DPRK has provided Iraq  with missile technology and has the technology to assemble  MiG-29 fighter jets. Given these technological capabilities,  North Korea is close to building nuclear weapons.    [Ozawa] Is there any relation between North Korea's  development of nuclear weapons and the present situation of that  country?    [Takesata] The power base of Secretary Kim Chong-il, the  heir  apparent to President Kim Il-song, is not as solid as is his  father's. Secretary Kim Chong-il has no experience in fighting  against the Japanese, and this lack of experience is a fatal  blow to him in terms of his assuming power in North Korea. The  development of nuclear weapons is a means to make up for this  lack. Perhaps the DPRK aims to earn foreign currency by  exporting nuclear weapons.    [Ozawa] What effect will economic sanctions have against  North Korea?    [Takesata] It is difficult for the United Nations to adopt a  resolution imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK because it is  believed that China would veto the resolution. Some take the  view that there has been a change in China's policy toward North  Korea, but there is no change in its stand against the economic  sanctions. If China exercises its right of veto to block the  United Nations from adopting the resolution, this would create  an irreversible situation for the Clinton administration, which  has renewed most- favored-nation trading status for China. The  United States will withdraw the resolution when it finds that  China will certainly exercise its right of veto. Any economic  sanctions imposed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea  would be 80 percent ineffective. On the contrary, the economic  sanctions would prompt North Koreans to unite. The economic  sanctions must be viewed as a necessary means for a diplomatic  "settlement" to the issue.    [Ozawa] Is there any possibility that North Korea will  compromise with the international community in the future?    [Takesata] The DPRK aims to resume high-level talks with the  United States. North Korea will put forward a compromise  proposal at the talks, and the United States will accept it.  There is a possibility that the United States will shift to a  policy under which it will not make an issue of North Korea's  development of nuclear weapons and will seek a pledge from the  DPRK that it will not sell nuclear weapons to other countries.  With midterm elections soon to be held in the United States and  an international conference scheduled to be held next year to  discuss the question of extending the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT), the issue of North Korea's suspected development  of nuclear weapons is likely to continue to remain deadlocked  for the time being.</p>

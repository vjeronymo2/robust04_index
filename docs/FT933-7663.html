'Seasonal factors will also have had a depressing effect, since July is traditionally a month when consumers withdraw funds to finance both holiday spending and purchases of new cars,' he said. Lending for new mortgages continued on an uneven course with net new commitments falling last month, reversing a rise in June. Net new commitments fell to Pounds 2.9bn in July from Pounds 3.2bn in June. The figure represents a significant fall from July last year, when net new commitments totalled Pounds 3.4bn. Mr Coles said, however, that a year-on-year comparison was misleading because this time last year buyers were rushing to beat the deadline to avoid paying stamp duty on house purchases up to Pounds 250,000.

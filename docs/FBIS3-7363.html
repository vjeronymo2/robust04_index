			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The song "We Will Win  Because You Are Leading Us" is widely sung among the Korean  people.    The poem of the song was written by Ni In-mo, the  incarnation  of faith and will. It represents the unshakable idea that the  cause of socialism is invincible as long as it is guided by the  Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The Korean people are firmly defending the cause of  socialism, holding General Kim Chong-il, the great iron-willed  brilliant commander, in high esteem as supreme commander of the  Korean People's Army.    General Kim Chong-il is a great military genius endowed by  nature with the resourcefulness and personality of a brilliant  commander.    Possessed of flawless quality and traits of an iron-willed  brilliant commander and ever-victorious military strategist, he  has strengthened the people's army and increased the might of  socialism to be invincible with his unrivalled military  intelligence, matchless grit and distinguished commanding art.  Under his guidance today the Korean People's Army has grown  into ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces equipped with  modern offensive and defensive means and the entire people have  been armed and the whole country has been fortified.    The Dear Leader is a great brilliant commander who is  possessed of iron will not shaken by any roar of thunder.    Whenever the situation was carried to the brink of war in  Korea by the aggressive war moves of the U.S. imperialists, he  dealt a bitter defeat to the enemy in the spirit of decisive and  fierce attack, without a moment's hesitation and vacilation.  When the U.S. imperialists and their stooges ran riot last year  to stifle the DPRK, resuming the frantic team spirit joint  military exercises and demanding "a special inspection" of it,  the supreme commander instantly proclaimed a semi-war state and  powerfully aroused the whole party, the whole country and the  entire people in defending the dignity and sovereignty of the  country and the nation.    Now the U.S. imperialists are rendering the situation of the  Korean peninsula extremely strained, after massively bringing to  the Korean peninsula and its surroundings new-type fighter  planes, warships and other means of nuclear strike of different  types and Patriot missiles, totally reversing the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York.    The United States is trying to bring the Korean people to  their knees with a strong arm and pressure. But it is a mistake.    Nobody is equal to the strength of the singlehearted unity  of  the Korean people rallied closely behind the great brilliant  commander.</p>

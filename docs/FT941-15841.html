			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Anger at delay for health debate The government sparked pandemonium in the Commons last night by postponing a Labour-led National Health Service debate, which was scheduled for today, in order to make further progress on the non-domestic rating bill. The move was announced by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader. It prompted Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, to accuse the government of being 'gutless'. She said Mr Newton had not even bothered to offer any justification for the decision. Mr Newton said the government would introduce a timetable measure to ensure the bill's remaining stages were dealt with today. The move took the edge off Labour celebrations of its first success of the year in its procedural 'trench warfare' campaign against the government. Ministers had abandoned their original plans to rush through the bill, which sets business rates for the coming financial year. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, described this retreat as 'extraordinary'. The government secured a majority of 74 to defeat a Labour attempt to deny the bill a second reading. The bill was given a second reading by a majority of 187.</p>

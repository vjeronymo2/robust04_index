			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Threefold rise for BA as main markets pick up British Airways yesterday reported a threefold increase in third-quarter profits on the back of a recovery in first and business class traffic, and a continuing cost-cutting drive. Pre-tax profits for the three months to December 31 rose to Pounds 65m from Pounds 20m. For the first nine months pre-tax profits increased 21.5 per cent to Pounds 300m. Although the latest figures confirm BA's position as one of the world's most profitable international carriers, BA shares dipped 1p to close at 473p because third-quarter earnings were at the lower end of City expectations. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said the results reflected economic improvement in the airline's two biggest markets, the UK and the US, and a recovery in premium traffic. The outlook remained encouraging, with economic recovery in several main markets enabling the airline to maintain traffic growth consistent with increases in capacity. After making cost savings of about Pounds 450m in the past two years, the airline was on target to cut another Pounds 150m this year, Sir Colin said. However, excess capacity in the industry continued to put pressure on scheduled passenger yields. These increased by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter because of favourable currency fluctuations. In local currency terms, the yield would have declined by 2 per cent. BA said this still reflected an improvement after a 6 per cent decline in the first quarter and a 4 per cent decline in the second quarter. The airline also dismissed fears over its Air Miles frequent flyer programme. The programme continued 'to generate valuable incremental revenue with redemptions utilising seats which would otherwise be empty', Sir Colin said. The outstanding Air Miles issued since the programme was launched five years ago accounted for 10 per cent of one year's surplus capacity. However, BA confirmed it was in negotiations over the future direction of the Air Miles company with the other shareholder, Mills Cowdrey Management. BA, which owns 51 per cent of Air Miles, is understood to be discussing increasing its share or taking full control. Third-quarter turnover rose 11.9 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn with 8.6 per cent more passengers and 15.6 per cent more cargo carried. For the first nine months, turnover rose 13.4 per cent to Pounds 4.83bn. Third-quarter operating profit rose 38.6 per cent to Pounds 97m and 31.6 per cent to Pounds 441m for the nine months. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 6.1 per cent to 5.2p in the quarter and by 0.8 per cent to 25.6p in the nine months.

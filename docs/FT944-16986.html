			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Step-by-step response to IRA considered The British government is considering a step-by-step response to the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland amid acknowledgement among senior ministers that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that it is permanent. The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues next week. Ministers accept that in spite of worrying comments in recent days by senior Sinn Fein officials and of evidence that the IRA is maintaining its military capability, the signs are that the republicans intend the ceasefire to be permanent. A staged response - perhaps involving first the lifting of the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn Fein members and the re-opening of indirect contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts. Such an approach would allow the government to test further Sinn Fein's commitment to a permanent peace by exploring whether the IRA was ready to give up its arms and ammunition. No decisions will be taken during this week's Conservative party conference but ministers are expected to consider a detailed assessment of the situation in the province on their return to Whitehall next week. The government faces a potentially hostile response to its Northern Ireland policy on Thursday when a number of party activists intend to press for the full integration of the province into the UK. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hinted at the change of tack yesterday. He said that the government was still not satisfied that the IRA had halted violence permanently, before adding: 'If we are not satisfied at the moment, we do not know for sure that we will ever be.' Sir Patrick said in Belfast that there had been 'encouraging progress' but the government was fully justified in its caution. He rejected suggestions from Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative backbench MP, that Mr Major would accept the permanence of the ceasefire soon after this week's conference but did not rule out a more limited response.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Grzegorz Dziemidowicz, Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs press spokesman, by Katarzyna Janowska; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Janowska] Klaus Kinkel, former German foreign  minister [as published], said recently that the admission of  Poland and Hungary into the European Twelve would be a serious  mistake because of the economic backwardness of both countries.  He is not isolated in his opinion as far as Western diplomats  are concerned. So what chances do we have?    [Dziemidowicz] Poland's admission into the European Union  [EU] will not take place tomorrow or even the day after. Our  full integration is a question of at least 10 years. First the  Union must "digest" our offer, as it were. This could take two  or three years. Only then would the real negotiation begin, in  respect of the terms of our accession and its precise date. It  could be that the option they adopt will be that of granting  Poland membership of the Union's political structures first and  economic structures later. However, all that will be the  subject of the eventual negotiation process.    [Janowska] Precisely. Western politicians claim that Poland  will find it easier to join the Western European Union, which is  the political suprastructure for the Communities rather than  their economic structures.    [Dziemidowicz] It is hard to tell now whether that is really  what will happen.    [Janowska] Politicians of the European Twelve stress very  strongly Poland's economic backwardness in relation to the  Union's member states.    [Dziemidowicz] I believe that backwardness is too strong a  term here.    [Janowska] But it is true that such disproportion exists.    [Dziemidowicz] Indeed, in respect of such countries as  France, Germany, and Britain. On the other hand, we can compare  Poland with Greece or Portugal at the time when those two were  applying for membership in the EEC. The disproportion between  the condition of their economies then and that of our economy  now is not as drastic as that. During their years in the EEC,  those countries made enormous progress. I believe that in our  case, too, these economic disparities will disappear very  quickly. In the end, it will be the political will of the  European Twelve that will decide our membership.    [Janowska] But can we really compare ourselves with Greece  or Portugal at a time when our national per capita income in  Poland does not exceed $2,000 a year?    [Dziemidowicz] We are not only looking at present-day  comparisons here. During the past few years, very rapid  economic progress, especially involving privatization, occurred  in Poland. Changes are now taking place much more quickly than  any of the past prognoses could have predicted.    [Janowska] In an interview he gave to RZECZPOSPOLITA, Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus criticized the proposal for Poland  and Hungary to join the Union. He stated that the Czech  Republic would not be submitting its application to join the  Union but that it would nevertheless find itself among the  European Twelve earlier than we. What is the Polish Foreign  Ministry's reaction to this?    [Dziemidowicz] I would not say that Prime Minister Klaus  criticized us. The Czech Republic is simply choosing a  different way. Apart from that, Poland and Hungary are already  associated with the EU, while the Czech Republic still is not.  This situation changes the perspective slightly. Each country  chooses its own preferred and most convenient way to the Union.  It is neither the Olympic Games nor a race. The objective of  all four countries in the Visegrad Group is to join the EU  eventually, and we should wish each other the speediest  fulfillment of that objective.</p>

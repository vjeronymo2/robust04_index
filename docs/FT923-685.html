			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Stolzenberg denies Castor loan MR WOLFGANG Stolzenberg, the German-Canadian financier who controls Imry Merchant Developers, a UK property developer, has strongly disputed evidence of a CDollars 93m (USDollars 75.60m) loan to Imry, from a bankrupt Montreal company, whose creditors face losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. The row over the alleged loan to Imry has come to light with the collapse of Castor Holdings, the Canadian company which is at the centre of a tangled international property finance empire also controlled by Mr Stolzenberg. Imry was taken private in a highly-leveraged deal in 1989. Mr Stolzenberg last year bought out other investors as part of a restructuring in which Barclays Bank increased its loans to the Imry group to more than Pounds 400m (Dollars 680m). Castor's creditors, who are mostly banks and wealthy individuals in Germany and Switzerland, have raised numerous questions about the collapse of the company, which specialised in high-risk mortgages and construction loans in the US and Canada. According to accounting registers reviewed in Zug, Switzerland, by auditors Peat Marwick, the loan to Imry was channelled through Castor's wholly-owned Rotterdam-based subsidiary, CH International (Netherlands) BV. Peat Marwick acted as a 'co-ordinator' for Castor while the company was under court protection earlier this year, prior to being put into receivership. According to Peat Marwick, the registers also indicate that roughly the same amount was deposited with Castor's subsidiary in Curacao by Bristol Holdings, a company believed to be connected with Imry. Peat Marwick has been unable to verify the legality of the documents it reviewed. Its report was not cleared with Castor's management. However, Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer representing Castor's directors, said he has been assured by Mr Stolzenberg as well as various Imry directors (whom he declined to identify) that 'they are unaware of any amount of money being owed by Imry to Castor or any of its subsidiaries.' Mr Stein said Mr Stolzenberg is drafting a letter to Castor's bankruptcy trustee which will flatly contradict the Peat Marwick finding. Mr Stein said he expects to receive further details next week of Mr Stolzenberg's dealings with Imry.</p>

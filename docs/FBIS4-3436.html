			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb  Presidential Office today announced a unilateral peace in  Gorazde to allow U.N. peacekeepers into the city.    The announcement came after yesterday's peace agreement  between Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. peacekeeping force allowing  the latter to enter Bosnia's eastern city of Gorazde Wednesday  [19 April] to enable humanitarian organizations to pursue their  work.    This act was in response to statements Tuesday from the  Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton.    The Bosnian Serbs also called for the international  community  to press the Muslims to accept the cease-fire agreement and hold  peaceful negotiations to solve the crisis.    Foreign press reports said that by the noon Bosnian Serb  forces continued to shell the besieged Muslim enclave of  Gorazde, despite their "unilateral peace" announcement.    The three-week Serb offensive has killed at least 345 people  and wounded more than 1,000, the reports added.</p>

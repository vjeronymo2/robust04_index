			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE ASKS $5.4 MILLION TO IMPLEMENT PROP. 103  </P> <P> State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has asked for authorization to  spend $5.4 million more than budgeted for her department in the fiscal year  ending June 30 to immediately hire 200 more employees to implement Proposition  103, it was disclosed Monday.  </P> <P> The state Department of Finance forwarded the request to legislative leaders  with a notice that a review of it was not yet completed. But legislative  sources said Gillespie would not likely have made the request without knowing  that it would be approved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Deficiency Request'  </P> <P> Under established procedures for such so-called "deficiency requests," once  approval comes from the Finance Department, Gillespie could begin spending the  money unless the Legislature objects within 30 days.  </P> <P> Gillespie said she needs the funds to begin establishing a plan by which the  Insurance Department will approve and monitor rates charged by insurance  companies beginning next Nov. 8, according to provisions of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Both industry and consumer groups have been suggesting in recent weeks that  procedures must be established and personnel hired well in advance of November  if the rate regulation system is to avoid becoming bogged down as soon as it  goes into effect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planned $18-Million Increase  </P> <P> Gillespie said in an interview last Nov. 21 that she planned to eventually add  300 employees to her 515-member staff and increase the annual budget of $33  million by $18 million.  </P> <P> But when Gov. George Deukmejian forwarded his budget request for the next  fiscal year to the Legislature, none of these additions were in it, and  Gillespie explained she was waiting until later to see what would be necessary.  </P> <P> The request revealed Monday means she wants to embark on a major part of the  staff increases and new spending now. According to terms of Proposition 103,  the insurance industry itself will pay for the increased Insurance Department  budget.  </P></p>

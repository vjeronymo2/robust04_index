			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> SPECIAL TRAINING AIDS CITY EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> Keeping city employees motivated in small communities -- where the employee  base is low and opportunities for advancement scarce -- has long been a problem  facing municipal governments.  </P> <P> With a city staff of 270 employees serving 35,000 residents in this seaside  community, San Clemente has faced this challenge.  </P> <P> But a year-old program called Leadership '90 has gone a long way toward  boosting morale and providing employees with strong management skills, city  officials say .  </P> <P> Wednesday night 16 employees were honored at an awards ceremony for their  participation in a series of intensive daylong workshops and field studies  during the past nine months.  </P> <P> The participants, who were nominated for the program by their department heads,  were trained for administrative duties that normally are not part of their  jobs. For example, they recently were taught emergency management techniques  during a recent trip to the San Onofre nuclear power plant.  </P> <P> "The program has been extremely helpful," said Bonnie Martinez, a city  recreation supervisor, "not only about learning administrative  responsibilities, but in forming relationships with people in other divisions  that you don't normally work with."  </P> <P> The leadership program was developed last year by Greg Hulsizer, former  assistant city manager.  </P> <P> "Leadership '90 provides an opportunity to grow personally and professionally,  and to develop strong leadership skills," Hulsizer wrote in a brochure sent to  all city employees. The format offers "an excellent combination of individual  and group learning as well as opportunity for hands-on experience." FRANK  MESSINA  </P></p>

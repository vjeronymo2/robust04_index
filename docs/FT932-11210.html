			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Record capital increase at Banesto BANESTO, the large Spanish commercial bank, is to make a capital increase worth some Pta130bn (Dollars 1.12bn), the largest in Spanish history, in a three-stage plan co-ordinated with J. P. Morgan. The plan, early details of which were made public in February, would be used to strengthen the bank's capital base. Its BIS ratio would rise from 9.3 per cent to 12 per cent. A weak capital base has long been a drag on Banesto's profitability, analysts say. Banesto said the three phases of the plan, which had also attracted a promised investment from GE Capital, would involve: A three-for-one rights issue, announced in February, designed to raise Pta52.66bn in new capital. New shares would be priced at Pta1,500. J. P. Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair bank fund will invest Dollars 200m in this issue, offering an extra Pta400 per share for subscription rights. This could give the fund a stake of close to 10 per cent in Banesto. Mr Mario Conde, Banesto president, will also subscribe to the issue to raise his personal holding of 2 per cent. If the Corsair fund is unable to spend all Dollars 200m on the rights issue it would commit the remainder to the second phase; A placement, with investors, of 22.2m shares worth Pta42.25bn. Some Dollars 20m of this will be shares distributed by the bank to employees priced at Pta1,900. Banesto said this was 27 per cent more than current shareholders had paid but the bank's stock closed in Madrid yesterday at Pta2,350. Banesto also said GE Capital and Northwestern Mutual would invest Dollars 25m each while an investor group led by Mr Jose Roquette, president of Banco Totta &amp; Acores, the Portuguese bank bought by Banesto two years ago, would spend Dollars 50m. A Dollars 400m convertible bond issue abroad. Banesto said the five-year bonds would carry a coupon of between 6 and 7 per cent and would help increase its second-tier capital. Although some analysts in Madrid questioned how easily the bank would meet its dividend obligations next year to a much wider group of shareholders, the plans have been greeted positively. The presence of J. P. Morgan as leader of the Corsair group has lent credibility to the operation. Banesto's successful sale earlier this year of its Banco de Madrid affiliate to the Deutsche Bank for Pta42bn has also greatly strengthened market confidence in the bank. It was, nevertheless, being vague last night about what it intended to do with the money it was raising, saying, among other things, that it wanted to attract first rate shareholders, to strengthen collaboration with Banco Totta and to unite the interests of the board and the bank's workforce.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is predicted that the situation will develop  into a grave phase if North Korea, which has declared its  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],  should go out of the way to expel two IAEA inspectors who are  now staying in North Korea.    A government official concerned warned: As a sovereign  state, North Korea has the full freedom to withdraw from an  international organization. If North Korea should expel the  IAEA inspectors who are now staying in Pyongyang, however, this  will not only be noncompliance with Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT], but also a direct challenge to the UN Security  Council (?exhorting) that inspectors be permanently stationed in  Pyongyang. This will bring about a serious consequence.    He also said: North Korea's duty to undergo IAEA nuclear  inspections is not a requirement as a member of the IAEA, but as  a party concerned to the NPT. Therefore, North Korea's latest  measure is evaluated to be nothing but a political message  simply aimed at achieving symbolic effects.</p>

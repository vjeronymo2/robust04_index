			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Bonds: American Express arrives with card-backed issue AMERICAN Express yesterday launched its anticipated Dollars 1bn global issue of bonds backed by charge-card debt, the first securitisation by the US financial services group. The issue was structured in equal tranches of five-year and seven-year paper. The bonds carry a top triple-A credit rating on the basis of Dollars 55m subordinated bonds, which will absorb any losses on the underlying charge card loans. The shorter-dated bonds will be priced today to yield between 42 and 44 basis points over US Treasury bonds. The long-dated tranche will yield between 45 and 47 basis points over Treasuries. Outstanding bonds backed by credit-card debt trade on a yield spread of over 50 basis points. Hence, the indicated pricing was seen as aggressive by new issue managers and likely to appeal only to US investors. However, participants in the deal reported steady buying in Europe and the Far East. Lehman Brothers, which lead-managed the transaction Express, said the tighter pricing was justified by the characteristics of the underlying charge-card loans. For example, American Express card-holders cannot maintain unpaid balances, so the pool of assets which backs the bonds turns over around seven times every year, compared with 1 1/4 times for a typical pool of credit-card debt. American also claims a lower default rate on its charge cards. Elsewhere, Toyota Motor Credit, the consumer finance subsidiary of the Japanese car-maker, raised Dollars 250m three-year funding through a deal lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation. The paper carries a 5 per cent coupon - one of the lowest coupon issues outstanding in the mainstream of the Eurodollar sector. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.65, where the yield spread over US Treasury bonds was 35 basis points. Although the bonds are not securitised, the deal drew comparison with the American Express transaction. The Toyota Motor Credit deal also carried a triple-A credit rating, and the main business of the issuer is consumer lending. Both transactions benefited from the shortage of outstanding Eurodollar bonds trading below par. Since US interest rates have fallen sharply, most Eurodollar bonds in the three- to five-year maturity range are trading substantially above par. Toyota Motor Credit has existing bonds maturing in 1995 which trade as high as 109 per cent of face value in the secondary market. The US Treasury market rallied again yesterday. The Toyota paper quickly rose above its issue price, prompting some participants to sell paper back to the lead manager at a profit. However, genuine demand from both retail and institutional investors was enough to absorb most of the loose paper. At the close, the bonds were bid at 99.80, with the yield spread held at the launch level. Another consumer finance subsidiary of a motor manufacturer, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, launched CDollars 100m five-year deal lead-managed by Scotia-McLeod. The 7 3/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 107 basis points more than Canadian government paper of the same maturity. The bonds sold fairly well into a rallying market, although GMAC is a weaker credit, rated five notches below Toyota Motor Credit.</p>

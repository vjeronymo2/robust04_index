			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the value-added tax (`VAT'') assessed on comparison sales in Israel, in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the court of International Trade (``CIT'') decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul, et al v. United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  834 F.Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Final determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carmiel made sales only to the United States and Israel during the POI. Based on the substantial quantity of home market sales in relation to its U.S. sales, we determined that the home market was viable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have preliminarily determined that respondent's method for determining date of sale is not consistent with the Department's practice. According to the response, Carmiel makes most of its home market sales over the telephone and does not document these orders. Moreover, the company did not know the specific date of each sale, but claimed to know the month in which the sale was made. Therefore, Carmiel reported its home market sales as having occurred the first day of the month in which the sale was made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our practice with respect to the date of sale is to use the date of the first  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> written <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document which sets the price and quantity for the sale ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Certain Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe and Tube fittings From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 12240, 12241; March 16, 1994) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Rolling Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , (58 FR 39729,39783; July 26, 1993)). In Carmiel's case, the first written document with this information is the invoice. Thus, according to Commerce practice, Carmiel should have reported home market sales that were invoiced during the POI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of our preliminary determination, however, we have used the sales reported by respondent. we will be requesting a better explanation of whether the date of sale used by respondent can be documented, or, in the absence of documentation, a new sales listing before verification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have calculated FMV using the delivered prices reported by Carmiel for its home market sales. We adjusted the prices for discounts offered to home market customers. Also, in light of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir., 1994), we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstances-of-sale provision of 19 U.S.C 1677b(a)(4)(B). This adjustment included home market inland freight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also made circumstance-of-sale-adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the borrowing rate in Israel on short-term New Israeli Shekel (``NIS'') loans linked to the dollar. In calculating the home market credit expense, we used the borrowing rate on unliked short-term NIS loans.

Esserman <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (September 26, 1994) on file in room B&hyph;099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice.

Section 733(e)(1) of the Act Provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this Investigation, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over a relatively short period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding A(i) above, in determining whether there has been a history of dumping, we normally look to see whether there has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere on such or similar merchandise. Regarding (A)(ii) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price sales sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping.

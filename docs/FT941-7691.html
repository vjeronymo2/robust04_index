			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses halved in nervous trading session - Market Report The UK stock market ended one of the most difficult trading sessions of recent weeks in relatively good form, helped by a rally in government bonds following first reports from the testimony to the US Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Traders admitted that nerves had been taut throughout the day but regarded the final loss of 16.6 on the FT-SE 100 Index, against a 30-point fall at midsession, as bearable, even though the important 3,350 testing level was lost in early trading. The closing Footsie reading of 3,333.7 left the index with little apparent support above the 3,300 or even 3,250 mark. But in the stock index futures sector, which has seen most of the recent sell-ing pressure, the March contract on the Footsie index finished virtually in line with fair value, a welcome improvement on recent performance. Mr Greenspan's warning that real short-term interest rates in the US are likely to rise was no worse than the market had expected and international market analysts tended to focus on the more positive aspects of his speech. The session had started uneasily for London, with government bonds reversing early gains and the stock market hit by weakness in stock index futures. The hardest blow, which sent the Footsie down by 30 points, came from the UK government's panel of independent economic forecasters - the Wise Men  - who warned of upward, as well as downward, pressures on domestic interest rates. But the panel also suggested that economic growth would be solid enough to withstand the tax rises due in April, a view supported by stronger GDP statistics for the final quarter of last year. These two factors strengthened stock market confidence in the outlook for UK company results. The consensus view was that economic growth must be good for shares, even if it diminishes the chances of a base rate cut in the near term. At Strauss Turnbull, analysts drew attention to the strength of the consumer spending content in the GDP figures. The market soon recovered from the setback, which had also been wrought by disappointment with trading statements from Unilever and Guardian Royal Exchange. The uncertainty across the range of equities took a further 15 points off the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which ended at 3,968.9. Trading volume was light at first but picked up sharply towards the close as European bond markets responded well to Mr Greenspan's comments. Seaq volume was finally 625.2m shares, just below the total for the previous day. On Monday, London equity trading was inhibited by the holiday closure on Wall Street, and customer, or retail, activity in UK shares returned a value of only Pounds 983.6m, the first non-holiday session to fall below the Pounds 1bn mark for many months. Dealers stressed that selling pressure over the past fortnight has been relatively modest London markets were happy to see Mr Greenspan's speech to Congress safely out of the way and confidence was encouraged by Wall Street's strong rise in early trading yesterday. The Footsie has fallen nearly 6 per cent from its peak, largely in response to worries over Federal Reserve policies. UK stocks will this morning face the question of whether yesterday's warnings on near term interest rate trends will put further pressure on valuations of the equity market.</p>

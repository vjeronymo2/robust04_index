			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SANTIAGO'S 'SMURFS' SCORE ANOTHER BIG VICTORY OVER KENNEDY  </P> <P> Santiago High School's baseball players are unlikely to strike terror in a  pitcher's heart by digging in at the plate.  </P> <P> Even their coach admits as much.  </P> <P> "Our guys are all about 5-feet-10, 155 pounds," Myron Pines said. "I call them  the Smurfs."  </P> <P> Undersized or not, Santiago has been toppling giants this season. The Cavaliers  earned another Garden Grove League victory Friday, beating visiting Kennedy,  6-3.  </P> <P> Santiago (10-4, 4-0 in league) took over first place in the Garden Grove  League, a game ahead of Kennedy (5-6, 3-1), La Quinta and Los Amigos.  </P> <P> A Garden Grove championship would be Santiago's first since 1968, when the  Angels' Bert Blyleven was the school's top pitcher.  </P> <P> "I really don't know how we're doing it, to tell the truth," Pines said. "We've  got no real strengths, but then again, we've got no real weaknesses either."  </P> <P> Friday, the Cavaliers won with timely hitting, smart baserunning and clutch  defense.  </P> <P> Santiago scored three times in the first inning with the help of an error by  Kennedy first baseman Min Son. But the Fighting Irish tied the score on a pair  of mammoth home runs -- a second-inning solo shot by Scott Jones and a two-run  blast by Scott Wood in the third.  </P> <P> Santiago catcher Adrian Borbon broke the tie with an opposite-field RBI single  in the fourth. The Cavaliers added two runs in the fifth on a triple by second  baseman Marco Perez, a sacrifice fly by Enele Scanlan and Erick Paniagua's RBI  single.  </P> <P> Right-hander Robert Leon (3-1) got the victory in relief, and Mike Kissell shut  down Kennedy in the seventh for his second save. Kennedy's Brian Faddoul (3-2),  who pitched a perfect game a week ago against Bolsa Grande, was the loser.  </P> <P> A big test for Santiago will come Wednesday, when the Cavaliers travel to La  Quinta. Theyhaven't defeated La Quinta in baseball in 15 years.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Garden Grove 2, Pacifica 1 -- Joe Aguirre, a junior left-hander, pitched a  two-hitter, striking out five and walking one, to lead host Garden Grove (4-5,  2-2). Donnie Johnson had two hits and an RBI and Raul Gonzales had two hits and  scored twice for Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Los Amigos 7, Rancho Alamitos 4 -- Bill Speer allowed seven hits, struck out  six and walked three to lead host Los Amigos (4-7, 3-1). Speer had two hits,  scored one run and had one RBI and John Morgan had three hits, scored twice and  had two RBIs for Los Amigos.  </P> <P> La Quinta 9, Bolsa Grande 3 -- Jason Cherms had three hits and scored twice to  lead host La Quinta (9-4, 3-1). Kenny Granger had two hits and three RBIs for  La Quinta.  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia faces mine crisis BOLIVIA'S MINING industry, which has only just begun to recover from the market crash caused by the collapse of the International Tin Council's buffer stock operation in 1985, is bracing itself for a second shock. Both the private and public sectors have already suffered a depressing opening to the new year. Lithco pulled out of a Dollars 1.5bn deal with the Bolivian government in January. Shortly afterwards Jordex Resources withdrew after selling its majority stake in Minera Tiwanacu. Some private mining concerns, including Britain's RTZ are said to be considering slimming down their presence in Bolivia. Two existing joint ventures between Comibol, the state mining corporation, Cominesa and a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema are still inoperable because of union opposition. The government's continuing reluctance to tackle the unions means further joint venture contracts are likely to be stalled before the June general elections. This already fragile situation is complicated by the fall in international prices for zinc, which now tops Bolivia's mining production, and also gold, silver, wolfram and antimony. Bolivian mining minister Mr Alvaro Rejas believes the industry is facing a crisis similar to that caused by the collapse of tin prices in 1985, when some 23,000 state miners were made redundant.</p>

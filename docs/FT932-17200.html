			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (12): Market re-examined - Multinationals show interest in main sectors FOR ALL the private sector's complaints about the inhospitable nature of Nigeria's business climate, year after year companies continue to turn in handsome naira profits. Last year, the pre-tax earnings of some 70 listed Nigerian commercial and industrial companies rose 43 per cent, while after-tax earnings were up 40 per cent. Both fell behind the inflation rate of 46 per cent. While in hard currency terms earnings have plummeted with naira devaluation since 1986 and will do so again this year. Despite this, leading multinationals are taking a fresh look at the Nigerian market, though in some sectors, - banks and pharmaceuticals - there has been substantial disinvestment. Almost all the US banks have gone, though this was partly the result of their industry-specific problems at home. In pharmaceuticals, Boots, Beyer, ICI and Merck have divested, while Wellcome has signalled its intention to quit, to be followed, industry sources say, by Roche and CibaGeigy. But it is not all one-way traffic. Proctor and Gamble has come into the market through the Vicks group, and Colgate Palmolive may follow. Rothmans has opened up in tobacco and Nestle is beginning its second substantial expansion project in recent years. Glaxo is likely to expand with a Dollars 10m injection of new capital from abroad. Nigerian Bottling has raised N100m offshore in non-voting equity to strengthen its balance sheet and sharpen its competitive edge. CMB Toyo Glass Nigeria recently raised N150m in the Nigerian market to finance the acquisition of African Glass Ltd, and expand and modernise its production lines. Guinness is considering a Pounds 5m investment, funded from head office, to refurbish and expand while Cadbury Schweppes is putting Dollars 7.5m, partly funded offshore with a loan from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, into a new cocoa processing plant which will produce cocoa butter for export. Some of these investments represent balance sheet restructuring and the bolstering of working capital that is necessary at a time of rapid inflation and devaluation. The overseas funding reflects the lower cost of capital abroad though the Nigerian firms are saddled with the foreign exchange risk and some indigestion in the domestic capital market, where there were more than a dozen new issues in the first 10 weeks of 1993. That all this should be taking place against a background of economic crisis and political uncertainty is explained by three main strategic considerations. First, with a GDP of some Dollars 30bn Nigeria is the second largest market in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Few multinationals, especially in basic consumer goods, can afford to ignore such a market explaining why the Rothmans, Colgates and Proctor and Gambles are showing interest. Guinness, for instance, sells 1m hectolitres of its stout in Nigeria making it the third largest market after Ireland and the UK. In the mid-80s, Cadbury was selling more Bournvita in Nigeria than in the rest of the world. Second, Nigeria is the logical platform from which to operate an Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States) strategy. Few manufacturers export significant volumes directly, and the mere mention of the export processing zone planned for Calabar, provokes ribald comment from industrialists, but indirect, smuggled exports are important and growing and, even if the CFA (French African Community) franc is devalued, as widely anticipated, Nigeria will continue to have a marked competitive edge in costs in regional markets. One successful exporter, CMB Toyo Glass, says its labour costs are less than 4 per cent of turnover. But manufacturers are among the first to admit that delivery logistics, infrastructure and quality are significant obstacles to exporting. Third, intense competition in principal world markets is driving multinationals into peripheral markets which in less competitive times they might have ignored. Although Nigerian sales are negligible by global standards, multinationals cannot afford to allow their competitors a free ride. Alongside strategic considerations are the need to reduce import dependence in an economy where between half and two thirds of industrial inputs are purchased abroad. Cadbury, which with a technical partner, has a worldwide patent for producing malted drinks from maize and sorghum, Guinness and Nestle, have all invested in local sourcing. Multinationals would invest more, making greater use of state-of-the-art technology were the Nigerian Enterprise Promotion Decree to be amended allowing foreign firms majority ownership. But the main obstacles to greater investment in Nigeria are structural - infrastructure, the level of risk, investment and operating costs and, above all, market size.  ------------------------------------------------------------ CORPORATE PERFORMANCE INDEX  ------------------------------------------------------------ Reporting   Turnover   Pretax   Price   Margins                 year   profit   index         %  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1984             100      100     100      12.7 1985             102      130     104      16.2 1986             109      133     111      12.3 1987             128      156     121      12.3 1988             166      187     170      11.0 1989             227      303     253      11.2 1990             311      390     275      12.4 1991             410      494     311      11.7 1992             562      706     454      12.2  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: FT Statistics  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Burmah chief's pay rises 40% despite static profits THE PAY of Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman and chief executive of Burmah Castrol, rose by 40 per cent last year according to the group's annual report and accounts. The increase was recommended by Burmah's remuneration committee despite the fact that annual profits were static and earnings per share fell by 19 per cent. Mr Urquhart earned Pounds 385,000 in 1991, against Pounds 277,000 previously. Burmah said the increase contained equal amounts of performance-related bonus, a straight percentage annual rise and an element related to his post of chairman. The comparison with the previous year is complicated by the timing of his promotion at the start of July 1990. The accounts show that Mr Urquhart received Pounds 156,000 as chairman and chief executive in the 1990 second half, which means he earned Pounds 121,000 as chief executive in the first half. That implies an annual chairman's salary of Pounds 70,000 before last year's increase. The accounts also reveal details of Burmah's purchase of Foseco, the chemicals group, for Pounds 270m at the of 1990, giving the fair value of Foseco's net assets as Pounds 110m. Much of the goodwill was written off against reserves in 1990, leaving a Pounds 30m write-off last year.</p>

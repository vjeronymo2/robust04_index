			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Students say no to taxing careers with the Revenue IT MAY be one of the world's oldest professions, but life as a tax inspector is the last thing graduates crave, according to the latest annual Mori poll of final-year university students. Only 5 per cent  - down from 8 per cent in 1989  - said they were at least fairly interested in the tax inspectorate, with 79 per cent saying they were not interested at all. Next in unpopularity were the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Marines. The news is a blow for the Inland Revenue, which has tried hard to spruce up its image in the last two years with the use of corporate identity consultants and the launch of its taxpayers' charter. 'We have an image problem,' one official conceded last night. 'People think we're bureaucratic and dull. In reality nothing could be further from the truth. We are changing our image and are seen within the Civil Service as one of the more dynamic departments.' The Mori survey was based on interviews with 1,024 final-year students from 18 universities in March this year. It found that there was most interest  - 49 per cent  - in broadcasting and journalism, 39 per cent in public relations and 38 per cent in teaching. At least one third were interested in management consultancy, advertising and the Civil Service. Asked more generally about what they would like to do, 22 per cent said research and development, followed by general management and scientific research. The proportion interested in finance was 17 per cent, 2 per cent lower than last year. Intellectual challenge was the main influence on the choice of a job at 55 per cent. More than one third mentioned the opportunity to be creative and original, and to work with people rather than things. Only 20 per cent rated a high starting salary as important. The average expected starting salary was Pounds 12,330, 2 per cent in real terms below the level a year ago. Women expected significantly less than men - Pounds 11,590 compared with Pounds 12,830. When deciding on specific employers, three-quarters said the most important factor was the opportunity to progress on merit. More than one third also mentioned long-term career development, company culture and style of management, training and long-term rewards. Most graduates considered themselves responsible with a broad outlook on life. Nearly half said they were realistic, imaginative, had initiative and wanted to do something useful. But 11 per cent  - up from 7 per cent 12 months ago  - described themselves as 'desperate for a job'. Only 56 per cent of the sample had picked a career field by Easter, down 4 per cent on the previous year, but 17 per cent had decided before university and 16 per cent in their first or second academic year. The most popular technique for applying for a job  - for 51 per cent  - was speculative applications, while about 40 per cent replied to advertisements. Only 13 per cent expected to use a summer recruitment fair. London remains the most desired location for a job.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Camdessus pursues campaign Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is pursuing a 'quiet diplomacy' strategy in seeking to overcome Group of Seven opposition to his plan for the fund to provide more financial aid to developing countries, he said yesterday. In a briefing at the end of a four-day visit to Manila, Mr Camdessus said he remained 'confident' that negotiations on the proposed assistance scheme 'will come to a successful conclusion'. He had proposed the IMF create SDR50bn (Pounds 53bn), that could be tapped for developing economies encountering serious external payments problems. The Camdessus proposal was rejected by the Group of Seven industrial nations at the IMF-World Bank meetings in Madrid early this month.</p>

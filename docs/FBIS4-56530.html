			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Perez Balladares, Panamanian presidential </F> candidate of the United People alliance, marking the conclusion  of his campaign for the 8 May presidential elections, at the  Cinco de Mayo Plaza in Panama City -- live]    [Text] Friends: I am very proud to be standing on this dais  -- the same spot where so many times I was at the side of our  leader, Omar Torrijos Herrera. Viva Omar Torrijos! [applause]    Oh, how many happy memories bring back to me this Cinco de  Mayo Plaza. I can recall the rally for what represented the  culmination of our generational struggle -- the Canal Treaties,  as notorious people have labeled the treaties that we know as  the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. [applause]    I want to tell the spirit of Torrijos, who is here with us,  this: Those of us who picked up your flag are here; those who  gave your Panamanian flag the kiss of dignity and those who will  not rest until we have the free, independent, and sovereign  country you dreamed of are here. [Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro,  Toro"]    Friends: In 1990, we initiated a substantial reorganization  of our political movement -- the political movement of Omar  Torrijos. We have come a long way. We have brought our original  concepts back to our party. We have regained the love and the  affection of the Panamanian people. Now we solemnly swear never  to betray the goals marked by Omar Torrijos Herrera.    The campaign has been one of proposals and decency. We have  not and will not hurt any opponent. We will never hurt anyone.  We have already forgiven those who have offended and insulted  us. Let them not be worried: People who are united do not have  time for foolish retributions. [applause]    We are going to be the best government the Republic has ever  had, because we have a historic commitment and vision. We also  have a commitment to the children and the young people of this  country. We, for their sake, will create the best government in  the history of the Republic. [Unidentified supporter shouts:  "Viva Toro Balladares! Viva Panama! Viva Omar Torrijos!"  Crowd responds: "Viva!"]    This will be a government with no hatred and no discord; a  government that will not return to past models; a government in  which all Panamanians will feel they have equal opportunities; a  government under which there will be no first class, second  class, or third class citizens; a government under which the  children of all Panamanians -- whether black, white, or Indian  -- will have equal opportunities. [Unidentified supporter  shouts: "Viva the Panamanian women, the youth, the children!"  Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro"]    We are going to have a government that will respect the  rights of all groups; a government that will properly appreciate  teachers, because they deserve not to be mistreated or despised;  a government that will not use the tools of the transportation  workers to harass them; and a government that will be committed  to opening the doors of the 21st century the way we Panamanians  want them open -- through the efforts of the people and the  government working together.    Recently, there was an incident in which a Public Force  officer dressed as a civilian pulled out a weapon. We do not  know what his intentions were. Today, while standing here, I  want to tell Juan Bautista Zapata this: Regardless of your  intentions, my family and I have already forgiven you. There is  no problem. [applause; crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"]    Not only will we forgive him morally and spiritually, but I  will also ask my party to withdraw whatever charges or lawsuit  it filed against citizen Zapata. [Unidentified supporter  shouts: "Long live Toro Balladares! Long live the PRD!"]    This is the type of government we will truly have: not a  government of false pledges, hatred, or a return to the past,  and not a government of old commitments. Instead, we will have  a government that is looking to the future and committed to our  children. We will advance toward this goal --- all of us,  united -- because people who are united... [pauses] [crowd  shouts: "Will never be defeated!"]    We will all go, together, and recover for these people their  health, reopening health centers that have been closed; again  stocking those health centers with medicine; providing dignified  education for our sons and daughters; and building true homes  instead of the dismal rooms -- rooms that insulted the dignity  of the people of Colon. Friends: In sum we will work together  as a country to recover our Panamanian pride and dignity, which  has been trampled on by this puppet government! [applause]    I also want to tell you that this is hardly a sample of the  total number of votes the United People have decided to cast on  Sunday. There is no doubt in any of the polls that we lead the  next closest candidate not simply by 4, 5, or 6 percent, but by  thousands of votes more than anyone else we will get! [Crowd  shouts: "Long live United People!"]    Shortly after Sunday, shortly after Sunday [repeats himself]  we will truly begin the real work -- in other words, working on  specific proposals with our elected community representatives,  with our elected mayors, and with our elected legislators, all  of whom will comprise a team that on 1 September will not have  to sit down and carry out a survey at the provincial level,  because we will already have it. We only have to implement the  measures, solutions, and proposals that we already know of!  [Unidentified supporter shouts: "You can feel it! You can feel  it!" Crowd responds: "President Toro!"]    It is a young team and a team into which we want to invite,  as my teacher Omar Torrijos did, all Panamanians, but most of  all, those who have the greatest ability, without asking their  surname or even taking into consideration their political  affiliation, because this is what the homeland demands at the  end of the 20th century.    Friends: I am aware of the capacity of our party's  followers, and I know you will not be forgotten or cast aside.  On the contrary, you must be our government's backbone, and you  will be because you are the memory of Omar Torrijos Herrera.  [crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"]    But in order to do all of this we must first get past  Sunday,  8 May. I want you to accompany me and the vice presidents in  spirit because at 0630 we will be in line to vote so no one gets  the idea they can scuttle our decision. Our vote must be first;  our vote must be early -- one more early morning wake-up call  for the sake of Torrijos and for Panama to overwhelmingly win.  [applause]    I cannot fail to mention something very important: Our  United People alliance comprises three parties. Regardless of  your party affiliation, make sure your vote is an alliance vote  from top to bottom. [applause]    Friends: On Sunday a new era for the Republic of Panama  begins, and the end of the era of this century begins. Our  commitment begins with those who will replace us on 1 September  1999, which we hope will be other Torrijos followers. They will  find a united country, an independent, free, and sovereign  country, with an outlook toward the future; a country which will  work with its children for their children and grandchildren; and  a country, my friends, where everyone without exception can feel  proud and full of patriotism and may sing that stanza of the  national anthem, which I invite you to sing along with me: We  have at last reached victory in unity!    A united people will never be defeated. Many thanks,  friends. Push ahead so that victory is ours.</p>

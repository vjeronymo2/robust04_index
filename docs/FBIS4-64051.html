			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oleksandr Moroz Suspended As </F> Ukrainian Socialist Party Leader"]    [Text] On 21 May, the Ukrainian Socialist Party [SPU]  Political Council held a meeting. The SPU leadership met  Oleksandr Morozov's request and decided to suspend his powers as  the party's leader. According to a declaration issued by the  Political Council, this was a justified move: The Supreme  Council chairman is not allowed to pursue internal party  interests (which are many) to the detriment of national  interests (which are even more). On the other hand, the  document's authors said that Oleksandr Moroz will remain  unquestioned leader of the party. Sergey Kishko, people's deputy  and assistant professor at the Donetsk State Technical  University, was appointed acting head of the organization.  According to its statute, the issue of the party's chairman  will be examined at its congress set for this fall. Curiously  enough, Oleksandr Moroz did not attend the meeting since he went  to Kanev to participate in festivities devoted to the reburial  of Taras Shevchenko's remains.</p>

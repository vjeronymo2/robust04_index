			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian market has best returns THE Australian market posted the best returns of any government bond market in 1991, providing total returns of 24.5 per cent for local currency investors, 23 per cent for dollar-based investors and 25.3 per cent for sterling-based investors, according to Kemper Investment Management. Dollar-based currencies generally performed well over the year, with New Zealand, Canada and the US also among the best, but their performance waned towards the end of the year. The strong appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar pushed bunds into the top position for dollar-based investors in November and December. Not surprisingly, Finland proved the weakest market in the fourth quarter, due to the devaluation of the Finnish markka in November. The four dollar markets also slid towards the bottom of the rankings in the fourth quarter. The gilts market ranked around the middle in all categories taken over the year, but achieved the best returns for both dollar and sterling-based investors in the third quarter. All the 21 markets monitored by Kemper offered returns higher than coupons in local currency, providing capital gains.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (8): Contemplating Europe - Karen Fossli finds non-oil industry has benefited from lower costs Norway's non-oil industry last year clawed its way out of the doldrums, where it had been trapped for more than five years. The return to profitability has been spurred to a great extent by an improvement in the domestic economy, which was helped by a sharp increase in oil activity, rather then a marked improvement in main export markets. For the past two decades, the country's land-based industry has remained largely in the shadow of the petroleum industry. 'The manufacturing sector has been driven mostly by the oil industry, which has entered a period of decline,' according to Mr Tor Steig, the chief economist at the Confederation of Business and Industry (NHO). This means that the prospects for the sector are mixed: the driving force of oil industry is entering a downturn, while export markets are only beginning to show signs of recovery. This means that investments in capacity are likely to remain on hold until export markets pick up momentum and the issue of membership of the European Union is clarified. Norwegian industrial competitiveness has nevertheless improved sharply over the past few years, mostly because of modest wage settlements and improved cost-competitiveness, rather than domestic currency weakness. A recent report on Norway, by analysts at Kleinwort Benson, concluded that the Norwegian cost base in 1977 was an estimated 26 per cent higher than that of its main competitors, but has since narrowed to about 11 per cent, having improved by as much as 8.6 per cent over the past year. The differential is forecast to narrow to 2 per cent by the end of 1995. In many ways Norway could be compared to a developing country, for its main exports consist mainly of raw materials rather than finished products. Manufacturing industry accounts for just 15 per cent of gross domestic product, which is considered a minimum for modern industrialised countries. And with the uncertainty over Norway's vote on membership of the European Union later this year, investments on expanding domestic capacity will remain on hold, despite improvements in export exports. EU membership is the single biggest issue concentrating the minds of companies which rely on exports and which already have a high concentration of operations outside Norway. NHO, which represents 11,000 companies which provide jobs for over 400,000 people, has urged its members to vote yes in the referendum. In a recent survey, nearly 90 per cent of 310 industrial leaders polled said membership would have a positive effect on business and industry. With the exception of the food-processing industry, many of Norway's industrial leaders believe that membership will lead to lower costs and higher exports. Every fourth industrial leader polled in the survey also believed EU membership would lead to greater investment in plant and operations in Norway. Not surprisingly, EU optimism rises almost in direct proportion to the level of exports of the companies polled, and it is the export-driven companies that plan to increase domestic investment in plant and operations if Norway's becomes a member. Although the poll could not establish a direct link between EU membership and plans to relocate production outside Norway, several of the country's business and industrial leaders have cautioned that it may be necessary to do just that. Foreign investors are also wary of providing risk capital to companies that face the prospect of remaining outside the EU - in spite of Norway's membership of the European Economic Area, the largest free-trade zone in the world. Investments in industry have been declining for several years, and while the government is optimistic that overall investment in Norway will regain momentum this year, investment in manufacturing industry may even decline until the results of the referendum are known. The government, however, forecasts that investment by non-oil industry will increase by 5.25 per cent this year and that the mainland economy will expand by 3.5 per cent. Mr Steig believes the government's forecast for private consumption, at 3 per cent, is grossly underestimated and that it is more likley to grow by 8 per cent. He says that each percentage point increase in private consumption translates into NKr800m in extra VAT revenue for the government, and in 1994 could create 20,000 jobs, but that industry will nevertheless in future rely more on exports than on domestic private consumption as its main fuel for growth. NHO is optimistic about the prospects for mainland industry, whose order book rose by 9 per cent from the third quarter of last year until this year's first quarter, with exports to Europe's automobile industry being the driving force. The order book for the metals industry alone rose by 11 per cent in the same period, but Mr Steig points out that the Norwegian economy is at an early stage in the overall upturn of the European economic cycle. One of the stronger sectors emerging is the furniture industry, whose exports soared by 13 per cent between last year's third quarter and this year's first quarter interim. After near collapse, caused by Norway's recession, the industry reoriented its strategy towards exports. Mr Arve Thovik, head of the Federation of Norwegian Process and Manufacturing Industries, is cautious in his optimism about the strength of Norway's export markets. 'Until Europe finds its way, it will be difficult for Norway, as the future production patterns of Europe are only just being established,' he believes. Mr Thorvik thinks membership of the EU would allow Norwegian land-based industry to remain in Norway, in spite of the distance to markets, higher taxes and higher costs. 'If we join, we know we will be part of the structural decisions to be taken in the EU, and this will affect our investment decisions and long-term strategies. The uncertainty will be removed,' he said. In the event of a No vote, Mr Thorvik does not believe there will be a mass exodus of industry from Norway, but that investment in capacity will be made in companies with operations outside Norway, causing value creation for Norwegian industry to stop up. He heads a lobbying group called 'From Nei til Ja' ('From No to Yes'), consisting of members who rejected membership in 1972 but will vote yes in November. 'I would rather see Norway enter the EU ready and willing than a Norway which grudgingly backs into the EU like some other countries have,' he said.</p>

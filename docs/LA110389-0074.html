			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> NORTH PENSION ISSUE SPLITS SENATE PANEL  </P> <P> The Senate Judiciary Committee has split along partisan lines on the issue of  whether to restore former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's $23,000 annual  retirement pay, lost after he was convicted last May of shredding government  documents. Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and six of his  Democratic colleagues filed a report contending that Congress should take no  action in North's case and leave it up to the Navy and the courts. But the  committee's six Republicans dissented, saying the law that led to revocation of  North's retirement pay was not intended to have such an effect.  </P></p>

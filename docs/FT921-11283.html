			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady The UK money market ended the week facing a sizable liquidity shortage following several days during which easier conditions had prevailed, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.2bn early in the session, revised up to Pounds 1.3bn. As has been the pattern this week, maturing treasury bills and assistance were the main components of the shortage, draining Pounds 1.18bn from the market. However, there was no early rush for funding and in early assistance the Bank of England injected just Pounds 386m. The Bank purchased bills for resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent on February 17 and 18, switching the repurchase dates from February 12 and 13 seen earlier in the week. Later in the morning session a further Pounds 151m was purchased for resale on the same terms. In the afternoon the bulk of the remaining shortage was taken out, through the outright purchase of Pounds 704m band 1 bank bills at 10 7/16 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 75m bought the total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 1.316bn. The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent for most of the morning but fell back to close at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent. Longer rates were little changed. Three month interbank funds traded at 10 9/16 - per cent from 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent on Thursday; one month interbank money closed at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange lost ground during the day and closed at 89.67. In mid-week the contract had traded as high as 89.82. In Frankfurt, call money traded up to 9.75 per cent, the same level as the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions. The authorities injected funds at 9.7 per cent, transfering funds held on deposit for public sector bodies, in an effort to relieve the the shortage. The squeeze this week was sparked by pension payments draining cash from banks and heavy funding towards the end of the month. The pressure was evidenced by a surge in borrowing at the Lombard rate. Financial institutions' Lombard borrowings reached DM7.1bn on Thursday, having been static at under DM1bn for most of the month.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply disruptions boost zinc - Week in the Markets THE ZINC market has responded to further disruptions to supplies this week, brushing aside yet another increase in London Metal Exchange stocks and news that the Russians have sharply reduced export tariffs. Three-month zinc broke through the Dollars 1,200-a-tonne level on Wednesday when Grupo Minera Mexico said its zinc refinery had declared force majeure on deliveries because of a strike. The refinery, which is in central Mexico, was scheduled to produce 96,000 tonnes of zinc this year. Last week Minero Peru's Cajarmaquilla smelter, which is the largest in Peru and produces 93,000 tonnes a year, declared force majeure because of problems with its power supply caused by a drought. Traders believed that it was delivering up to 95 per cent of its orders, however. Late on Thursday Minero Peru said the force majeure would be lifted next week. Market sentiment was further boosted by news of a strike at Asarco's New market zinc mine in Tennessee, which produced about 29,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates last year. On the bearish side of the equation Russia was reported yesterday to have cut the export tariff on zinc. In addition LME warehouse stocks, which rose by 3,050 tonnes on Tuesday, advanced by a further 2,875 tonnes yesterday to a record 209,175 tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, the London brokers, yesterday described the fundamental factors in the zinc market as 'robust,' pointing out that prices had increased by 10 per cent over the last couple of week's in spite of the rising level of stocks and the threat of more imports from Russia. Zinc - usually behind aluminium and nickel in any recovery - should see an accelerated drawdown in stocks once the economic situation recovers in the second half of the year, he suggested. Cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,206 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 10 on the day but a rise of Dollars 20.50 on the week. LME aluminium stocks have continued to climb inexorably to a new record of 1,130,825 tonnes, rising 4,325 on Tuesday and 11,450 tonnes yesterday. The increase - mainly Russian metal  - was hardly unexpected, but the cash price retreated to Dollars 1,278 a tonne yesterday, a fall of Dollars 20.50 on the week. The London gold market suffered a fit of the jitters early in the week following the Indian government's weekend Budget statement proposing a relaxation of a 22-year ban on gold imports. Monday saw the market immediately retreat below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on Middle Eastern selling before recovering to close Dollars 2.35 down at Dollars 350.85. The Indian proposal would allow expatriates to import five kilograms of gold in a bid to end smuggling, which has been the main source of supply. About 200 tonnes are smuggled each year, mainly through Dubai, in order to avoid import restrictions. Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said the situation was reminiscent of 1990 when gold fell Dollars 23 an ounce on Middle Eastern selling within seven days of the Indian budget. That year it removed controls on the internal market, sending local prices down 10 per cent. Mr Smith pointed out that,while the Indian proposals were an incentive to buy in the longer term, in the short term many Middle Eastern suppliers were facing reduced margins on their Indian sales and might be tempted to sell. On Tuesday the Bombay gold market, re-opening after a holiday on Monday, saw an immediate 5 per cent fall in prices. Yesterday the London gold market closed at Dollars 349.70 an ounce, down Dollars 3.50 on the week. The coffee markets have continued to decline. The London May robusta coffee contract closed at Dollars 803 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 15 on the week after having failed to sustain a rally as high as Dollars 844 on Wednesday. London appears to be taking its direction from the New York arabicas market, which has this week been monitoring talks between Latin American producers who have been meeting in Costa Rica to discuss ways of restoring economic clauses to the international coffee agreement. The countries at the meeting said they had lost Dollars 6bn in export revenues since the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system broke down in 1989. They will be seeking support from Brazil, the world's biggest producer, which has yet to make up its mind over market support measures for coffee.  ------------------------------------------           LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------------                    tonnes Aluminium  +11,450 to 1,130,825 Copper        -425 to   302,325 Lead           +50 to   134,875 Nickel        +306 to    22,656 Zinc        +2,875 to   209,175 Tin            -60 to    12,555  ------------------------------------------</p>

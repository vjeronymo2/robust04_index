Replying to questions by a Turkish Radio and Television  correspondent, Aliyev said that he does not foresee any changes  regarding Turkey's share in the agreement. Pointing out that  there are various oil pipeline projects, Aliyev added, however,  that in most of these projects having the pipeline cross Turkey  is a high consideration.    He noted that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are  continuing on their normal course but that the cease-fire plan  that has been proposed was not found suitable. Aliyev stated  that Azerbaijan will be deciding on which countries might  participate in the peacekeeping forces to be stationed in  Karabakh and that his country wants Turkey to participate in  these forces. He noted that the unconditional withdrawal of  Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory is the first  condition for a possible peace agreement with the Armenians.</p>

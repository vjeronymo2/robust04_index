			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report under the "First Night" rubric] </F>   [Text] The list of organizational matters the Fifth  Russian Duma managed to resolve on its first work day boils down  to the creation of purely technical commissions, the election of  a provisional secretariat (under Sergey Stankevich's  chairmanship), and also determining the minimum number of  parliamentarians required to set up a new deputy faction.    Only the last of these problems seemed more or less  significant, because establishing the lower limit for a deputy  group's strength may give "Russia's Choice" extra advantages in  the future: It is this faction that has so far managed to win  over more deputies elected in majority districts as  "independents" than anyone else. With the emergence of a number  of groups "Russia's Choice" may see its replicas of sorts appear  in parliament -- each of them with the rights of a full-blown  party faction regarding a guaranteed representation in the State  Duma's ruling bodies, the right to be given the floor in  discussions, and so forth. A multistage voting procedure  finally enabled the Duma to set the minimum number at 35 people.    To make this decision, however, took nearly six hours of  painful efforts (including two hours of consultations during the  lunch break), when the State Duma posed as an entirely  unprecedented farcical show both comical and absurd in nature.  This came as no surprise to anyone, though. On the contrary,  we should rather say that our preliminary expectations and  suspicions were strikingly confirmed: Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia [LDPR] leader Zhirinovskiy was indeed obnoxiously  scandalous and the deputy corps' doyen, Georgiy Lukava, who was  elected on the LDPR ticket, actually appeared as a barely sane  personality.    Sprinkling his speech with thoughtful absurdities, like  "developing the potential at the level of a factor" or "bringing  addresses within the framework of collaboration," Mr. Lukava  easily and quickly brought the Duma to a scandal bordering on  collective hysterics with disorderly shouts into the microphone  and a threateningly multitudinous babel in front of the  presidium (where deputy Shabad was noticed a number of times).  In the end, 190 deputies, threatening to refuse to register and  to boycott the meeting, demanded that Lukava be relieved of the  unbearable burden of chairmanship, because the Constitution  calls for the first meeting only "to be opened" by the oldest  deputy, not to be steered further. Mr. Zhirinovskiy,  overstraining his voice, guided his subordinate from the  audience, and in one moment demanded that "an order be given to  switch off all microphones, to call security to protect those on  the podium, and to continue the voting without any discussions."  Mr. Lukava was willing to hand over his powers only to Anatoliy  Ivanovich Lukyanov in person.    In the end, the Duma managed to cut Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  and  his comrades down to size. From now on, meetings will be  chaired by members of the Council of Elders. The Duma took a  timeout for forming factions until noon, 13 January.    Aleksandr Kotenkov appears to have summed up the results of  the first day of deliberations in the best possible way: "This  brouhaha is unbearable. It cannot last for long. And it  won't..."</p>

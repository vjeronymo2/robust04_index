			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROWD FORCES JUDGE TO HALT SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM TRIAL  </P> <P> Rowdy supporters of a man charged with inciting hostility against Jews forced a  Soviet judge Tuesday to adjourn the man's trial almost before it began in a  case that has become the symbol of blatant and growing anti-Semitism among  Russian nationalists.  </P> <P> Hundreds of unruly spectators sitting on wooden benches and packed into the  aisles of the steamy courtroom repeatedly interrupted the short proceedings by  loudly clapping in response to comments made by defendant Konstantin  Smirnov-Ostashvili, 64, and shouting angry demands such as "Toss out the  liberal journalists!"  </P> <P> Smirnov-Ostashvili, a charismatic leader of Russian ultranationalists, is the  first person in the Soviet Union to face charges of inciting ethnic strife,  according to the official news agency Tass. Soviet law prohibits inciting  ethnic violence, racial hostility or religious animosity. If convicted,  Smirnov-Ostashvili could spend up to 10 years in prison.  </P> <P> Smirnov-Ostashvili, a blue-collar worker, is accused of organizing a group of  Russian nationalists who interrupted a political forum of liberals at the  Central House of Writers in January. The intruders roughed up the participants,  called them "Yids" and shouted, "Go to Tel Aviv!"  </P> <P> No one was seriously injured, and Smirnov-Ostashvili, who used a megaphone to  shout down the speakers at the forum, is the only one charged.  </P> <P> But the case was so controversial that the investigation took several months  and interviews with 400 witnesses.  </P> <P> The prosecutor's decision on whether to try Smirnov-Ostashvili and the others  involved in the fracas became a test of the government's willingness to  confront increasing anti-Semitism here.  </P> <P> With the trial as a political battlefield between ultranationalists and  liberals, the courtroom was packed even before the proceedings began.  </P> <P> Arguments broke out almost immediately between the defendant's supporters and  his opponents. Several television crews and dozens of Soviet and foreign  journalists flooded into the front of the courtroom, surrounding the judge and  the defendant and adding to the mayhem.  </P> <P> Smirnov-Ostashvili, a fiery man with a wreath of gray hair surrounding a large  bald spot, started off the proceedings by brashly demanding that the judge oust  Yuri D. Chernichenko, a liberal member of Parliament acting as the public  prosecutor, from the front of the courtroom.  </P> <P> The nationalists in the crowd, many of whom had straggly beards and wore black  clothing, cheered loudly when the judge, Andrei I. Muratov, agreed.  </P> <P> Smirnov-Ostashvili next asked to have his publicly appointed lawyer taken off  his case, claiming that she is part of the Jewish-dominated Moscow lawyers  association.  </P> <P> He said that he would like to be represented by a lawyer from West Germany,  Finland, Sweden or Norway. His followers in the hall chanted "Shame!" when  Muratov denied the request for the dismissal of his attorney.  </P> <P> The tumult was so great that Muratov announced a 30-minute recess in an effort  to restore order in the crowded courtroom. But the confrontation between the  nationalists and the liberals over the merits of the case only grew hotter  during the break.  </P> <P> When Muratov returned, he asked the spectators to clear the aisles, but they  only retreated a few steps. With no control over his courtroom, Muratov  adjourned the case until today.  </P> <P> The defendant's supporters included young, old and middle-aged men and women.  Many said they were members of Russian Patriots or Pamyat, two ultranationalist  groups.  </P> <P> "I have heard a lot about him, and I support him because he is fighting for  Russia," Liliya I. Bogoroditskaya, 58, a grandmotherly woman wearing a popular  Russian nationalist pin of St. George slaying a dragon, said of  Smirnov-Ostashvili.  </P> <P> "I like his platform. He's fighting against Zionism, and this is necessary  because the news media is totally in their hands -- television, radio and the  press. And culture and art, too. You won't find one of them (Jews) working. Not  one in a factory nor in a village."  </P> <P> Liberals in the courtroom said a guilty verdict is necessary to fight the  popular trend of blaming Jews for everything from food shortages to the  Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.  </P> <P> "This is very important," Stella I. Aleinikova, a tiny woman in her 70s who had  videotaped the original incident at the House of Writers, said as she walked  out of the courthouse with her camera again on her arm. "It would be the start  of a very strong anti-fascist movement."  </P> <P> Oleg Fainstein, 32, a liberal writer who witnessed the January incident,  commented: "I hope anti-Semitism, which has so far been denied to exist at all,  will at least be acknowledged. It will set a precedent."  </P> <P> But supporters of Smirnov-Ostashvili contended that a verdict of innocent will  enshrine the right to freedom of expression in a country where speaking out has  often been paid for with death.  </P> <P> "Human freedom is being tried here," Alexander Kulakov, the 28-year-old  executive secretary of the People's Orthodox Movement, said. "It is a human  right to say what you are thinking. They are trying to do away with someone who  just said what he thought."  </P> <P> Even Pravda, the Communist Party daily, has acknowledged that anti-Semitism is  rising and threatens to undermine the country's political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> Jews had long been victims of official discrimination in the Soviet Union,  which kept them out of universities and top-level political jobs and prevented  them from openly practicing their faith. But the discrimination has been  significantly reduced in the last five years.  </P> <P> OVERHAULING A NATION: Soviets rethink state of their union, consider new  treaty. A4  </P></p>

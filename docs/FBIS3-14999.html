Ryabchikova; place and date not given: "'We  Must Make Crimea Open to All'"]    [Text] Ye.F. Saburov, who has accepted President  Yu.A. Meshkov's offer of the vice premiership of the Republic of  Crimea, arrived in Crimea the day before yesterday.    Ye.F. Saburov is a candidate of economic sciences and  full member of the Academy of Computerization and the Academy of  Social Sciences of Russia.    Following graduation from the Mechanico-Mathematical  Faculty of Moscow State University, he worked in a number of  research institutes. From August 1990 through April 1991 he was  deputy minister of education of Russia, from April through  August 1991 he headed the group of economic advisers of the  chairman of the Council of Ministers, after this he was deputy  chairman of the Council of Ministers and minister of economics  of Russia, and since January 1992 he has been director of the  Government of the Russian Federation's Center for Information  and Social Technology.    The day before yesterday, Ye.F. Saburov gave KRYMSKAYA  PRAVDA his first interview.    [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, first of all, permit me  to  congratulate you on your arrival on native soil. You are truly a  Crimean?    [Saburov] Yes, I am. I was born in Yalta in 1946, Crimea is  my home. Following school graduation, I left Yalta for studies  in Moscow. I graduated from Moscow State University, married,  and stayed on in Moscow. But, naturally, I never lost my  connection with Yalta, with the Crimea. My parents live here, my  friends are here. And every year, whatever the weather, as they  say, I have tried to get to Yalta.    [Ryabchikova] How will your citizenship problem, which  greatly excites Ukraine for some reason or other, be decided now?    [Saburov] You can get excited over anything. I do not  believe  that there is such a person as Ukraine. This is, you know,  something out of Ilf and Petrov--when the roadside philosophers  sit on the embankment and argue: France wants such and such,  Britain wants such and such. There are no such people as France,  Britain, Ukraine. There are certain politicians in both Ukraine  and Russia to whom confrontation for some personal ends of  theirs is profitable. I do not believe that this question is so  insurmountable that it cannot be settled by way of compromise in  negotiations.    I am altogether a supporter of compromise and believe that  compromise is very good, it is better than confrontation. After  all, as Makarenko once said, if a Russian intellectual is a  stickler for principle and sticks firmly to his positions, in  half an hour the whole apartment is forced to take valerian.  This is not necessary if a compromise is possible, if accord is  possible. I believe that for Ukrainians and Russians the  question of dual citizenship is simply a question of a normal  life. Five million Ukrainians currently working in the Russian  North are Ukraine also.    [Ryabchikova] And, then, you have come home.    [Saburov] Yes, this is truly the case. And it is altogether  very strange to say that there is some Russian or Ukrainian  economic science.    I would like to give you some facts. What is Russian  economic  science? It is Yevgeniy Grigoryevich Yasin from Odessa. It is  Belkin from Kharkov. It is Grigoriy Alekseyevich Yavlinskiy from  Lvov. It is ultimately myself--from Yalta. The policy of such  countries as China, which are calling on their compatriots to  help their homeland and asking them to return and work, would  seem to me absolutely correct, therefore. It is strange to me  that the Ukrainian state is not calling to such a brilliant  economist as Yuriy Vasilyevich Yaremenko, a Ukrainian, he  emphasizes this, but talking about a shortage of personnel here.    When Yu.A. Meshkov made me the offer and this become known,  the telephone was ringing off the hook with calls from former  Crimeans who live in Moscow and in Russia and who are doctors of  economic sciences and very important specialists in particular  sectors. They would very much like to come to Crimea and work  for the good of their motherland. Does Crimea believe that these  are not its sons?    [Ryabchikova] How will you embark on the fulfillment of your  duties? Where will you begin?    [Saburov] I would like first of all to clearly determine  what  I can do and to remove all the exiting disagreements. I repeat:  I am a supporter of compromise. This is not weakness but quite a  strong position. And it means that I want to have freedom of  action at the level I deem necessary. But for this I have to  turn to the people of Crimea to learn my fellow countrymen's  opinion.    First, people must understand that there will be no miracle.  Any person who promises to make Crimea replete and prosperous in  two days is a liar. The people must not be fooled.    I can promise only one thing--that I myself and the people  whom I bring in will work as hard as they can for the good of  Crimea. That we will try to do everything possible in this  difficult situation with two inflating currencies and severed  connections.    With the strange games of politicians, who do not know what  they are doing. I promise to make every effort to overcome the  obstacles, which there will be, of course.    I will take as the basis healthy business, primarily Crimean  business, but with the attraction of businessmen of Ukraine,  Russia, Turkey, France, whoever. I have already received certain  offers. Very great interest has been expressed by Spain, for  example. The Mediterranean countries are in principle longing to  enter the Black Sea, and we must help them do so.    We must make Crimea open to all. Crimea never was and must  not be an island fenced off from all countries. It must become a  focal point of interests.    It is all this that will help create in Crimea prosperity  and  well-being and jobs and decent earnings, in a word, a normal life  for society.    [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, could you name the  members  of the team you intend to bring from Moscow? And, further: How  will you build your relations with the present Council of  Ministers?    [Saburov] I believe that the enlistment of quite serious,  efficient personnel would be not at all a bad thing for the  structure of government of the Republic of Crimea. I have won  the consent of certain people to live and work here, in Crimea.  But I will decide later. I need first of all to familiarize  myself with the present makeup of the government and to take a  look at and scrutinize these people.    And, generally, I am not the sort of person who is inclined  to go in for radical reshuffles for the sake of reshuffling.  Each person who is currently part of the structure of government  of the Republic of Crimea or its cities may count on my  assistance, help, and the heartiest cooperation if he is really  disposed to work for the good of Crimea. I will change people  only if they are unwilling or unable to work or if they reject  the proposals pertaining to a reform of the economy of Crimea  which I intend to make.    [Ryabchikova] What will your first steps in reform of the  economy of Crimea be?    [Saburov] There is a very varied structure of production in  Crimea: industrial and agricultural and recreation zones and  port installations. The speed of the solution of questions in  these sectors will vary also, therefore. I understand what an  onerous and difficult task this is, I understand that the  economy of Crimea has been reduced to a condition which no  longer fits within any economic notions even. This had to have  been specially contrived.    But it is easy to fall into the abyss, climbing out of it is  not that simple. I anticipate a program of Crimea's emergence  from the economic crisis being drawn up in the coming months. It  will be quite complex, evidently, and will require complex  technical approaches.    This program will be presented for Crimeans' approval. To  what end?    First, compiling an intelligent program is only half the  battle, because it then needs to be fulfilled.    And, second, approval of a program in this way or the other  imposes a responsibility on those who execute it. There is  something for which people can be held to account. And in  principle a person engaged in state administration (the  executive) should be under supervision. For the executive,  supervision means not trifling tutelage or immersion in  paperwork but verification: whether the charted strategic  program is being fulfilled or not.    [Ryabchikova] In consenting to become vice premier of Crimea  you familiarized yourself, in all probability, with Yu.A.  Meshkov's program and the promises he made to the people. Do you  consider these feasible?    [Saburov] I would answer this question this way. For me  personally it is perfectly clear that people voted for Meshkov  inasmuch as he was, indeed, serious in formulating the question  of an alliance with Russia, primarily of an end to the economic  stupidities that have been perpetrated here. I believe that we  need to tackle all economic matters on a purely professional  basis, proceeding only from one consideration: whether things  are better for people or worse. An alliance with Russia is  extraordinarily important for Crimea.    The question of the ruble zone. Poly-currency conditions,  where several currencies are in circulation simultaneously,  would seem more attractive to me. Not necessarily the  karbovanets and the ruble, what is more, there is the dollar and  the mark and everything else. Any economic decision is  ambivalent, everything needs to be computed: Is this  advantageous or disadvantageous.    I fully understand Yuriy Aleksandrovich, who, of course,  proceeded from the fact that being in the ruble zone is better  than in the karbovanets zone. But for Crimea the question is now  somewhat different: It needs to be understood what it is  beneficial for us in Crimea to have as the special conditions.  Everything needs to be looked at and computed here.    I would like to make separate mention of relations with  Russia. Russia will sign an economic treaty with Crimea if it is  duly substantiated, if it does not cause any international  obstacles, and if it is beneficial to Russia itself.    We must proceed from the fact that no one will help us. Nor  should they! We ourselves need to pull ourselves out of this  difficult situation in which we have landed.    It is natural that Russia was and remains the most important  and most profitable partner of Crimea, as of all of Ukraine  also. That treaties with Russia are possible. And that it is  perfectly possible to fulfill the necessary conditions about  which I have spoken. It is perfectly possible to have direct  relations with Russia. But why only with Russia? We will  endeavor to ensure that each enterprise of Crimea might have  direct relations with Russian enterprises and with Greek,  French, or Swiss enterprises. It is all the same to us--just as  long as life becomes somewhat better.    [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what was your family's  attitude toward the decision to move to Crimea?    [Saburov] What is my family? My mother lives in Crimea,  although she is now in Moscow, it is true, since she has been  indisposed. I brought her here because she could not live on her  doctor's pension. Having worked, God knows, for so many years,  she ultimately found herself destitute. But my mother is longing  to return to Crimea, of course, as soon as it gets just a little  warmer. My daughters are married, and they will, therefore, be  going nowhere, most likely. And my wife was one of the main ones  urging me to make this decision.    Truly, I very much want to do what I can here. I very much  want to live and work for the good of Crimea and its  inhabitants--my fellow countrymen.</p>

[Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan has entered into the  community of nations who are producing their own locomotives.  This momentous occasion of commissioning Pakistan's first  locally manufactured locomotive is indeed an historic milestone  in railways' industrial capacity as well as the country's  history. [applause] Development activity in the country gives  us satisfaction and pride. Risalpur is one of the backward areas  of Pakistan. The establishment of a locomotive factory here will  give a boost to the area and to the Frontier Province. The  Risalpur Locomotive Factory is a tribute to the resilience of  the workers of Pakistan Railways. This factory speaks volumes of  the talents, the skills, the capability of all those who worked  day and night in the respective positions in the Railways  workshop. [end recording]    The prime minister also spoke about the collaboration  between  Pakistan and Japan in the economic and technogical fields and  said on a number of international issues Pakistan and Japan  share common perception.    [Begin Bhutto recording] We have benefited immensely from  Japanese investment and technical assistance in locomotives, in  the automobile industry, fertilizer production and power  generation. We have worked together in the field of economy as  well as in the sphere of science and technology. The  inauguration today of this locomotive factory and the launching  of the first locomotive built is a testimony of our growing ties  in the fields of science, technology, and economy. Japan and  Pakistan share similar views in the field of foreign policy.  Both countries seek to build a world where there is a  limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. We share the  same concern about nuclear proliferation, about human rights,  and narcotics control. [end recording]    [Passage omitted on speeches of Secretary for Railways and  Japanese ambassador and Bhutto's visit to various sections of  factory]    Talking to newsmen before her departure from Risalpur, Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto said the Kalabagh dam will be built only  if all the four provinces agree to it. The prime minister said  the NWFP [North-west Frontier Province] and Sindh have some  reservations on the constructions of this dam. We will  negotiate with these provinces and then go for it if a consensus  emerges.    On the country's nuclear program, she reiterated in  categorical terms that it would not be rolled back.</p>

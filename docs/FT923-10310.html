			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: ICI does the splits ICI's demerger plan is a splendid example of how a supposedly hidebound management can be rendered nimble by a sense of threat. The two new companies would not be obvious takeover candidates, since one would be on a drug company p/e and the other would consist of cyclical commodities. At the same time, the bulk of the group's cash would presumably go to the commodities side, leaving the drug side to replace it by a rights issue. ICI would thus achieve the rather neat trick of raising equity for the group as a whole on a drug company multiple. Or perhaps not quite. As a drug company, ICI suffers the not unfamiliar problem of having a blockbusting product going off patent with not very much in the pipeline to follow. The proposed drug company would also derive a fifth of its profit from agrochemicals, only deserving a high multiple on the doubtful premise that the GATT will never make much headway in curbing agricultural subsidies. All the same, the drug side might conceivably be worth 15 times this year's earnings, or around 750p per share. The commodities business is more problematic, since applying a multiple at any given point involves an assumption about where that point is in the chemicals cycle. One very rough measure might be as follows. The historic peak in trading profits from commodities was Pounds 1bn in 1988. Assume the trough comes this year at around Pounds 280m. Take the mid-point, assume a conservative dividend cover of 3 times and a 5 per cent yield, and the result is some 450p per share. That gives a total of 1200p - pretty much where the shares closed last night. The real question is how far demerger would affect the valuation there-after. There is room for scepticism. The divisional barons would split into two teams, lodged in the present head office under the present chairman. For shareholders, the demerger plan offers a welcome diversity of opportunity. How radical it proves in operational terms is a more open question.</p>

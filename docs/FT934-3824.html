			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Seagram shares THE Canadian members of the Bronfman family, through the Charles Bronfman trust, have sold 3.7m Seagram shares on the New York stock market for nearly USDollars 100m. The sale reduces the trust's holding from 62m shares to 58m shares or almost 16 per cent. Three Bronfman family trusts control Seagram, one of the world's top drinks groups. Mr Michel Boucher, vice-president of Claridge, the Montreal-based holding company for the Charles Bronfman group, said the sale was 'part of the family's financial planning'. The shares included a block of 3.28m cross-traded by Goldman Sachs yesterday. Mr Boucher said he was unaware of the buyers of the Seagram block. Seagram shares fell about 3 per cent following the block trade. The stock sale came several days after Seagram reported a third-quarter loss of 27 US cents a share due to a 64 cents special charge, Seagram's share of a USDollars 1.3bn write-down by Du Pont. Seagram holds 24.3 per cent of the chemicals giant. In New York, Seagram spokesman Mr Chris Tofalli said the sale was made for personal reasons. 'It happens from time to time but such sales are not that frequent.' Charles Bronfman is co-chairman of Seagram. His elder brother, Edgar, of New York, is chairman and his son, Edgar Bronfman Jr, took over as Seagram president several years ago to reorganise the worldwide group.</p>

A group of CP  MPs made it clear during a caucus meeting yesterday that they  believed the party should go to the polls.    One source said they had effectively "thrown down the  gauntlet". They argued that if the right wing could get support  for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] council -- provided for in  the Interim Constitution this week -- it could force a new  government to seriously consider allowing for the creation of  such a homeland.    Developments in Durban during the meeting between ANC  [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu  Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi were increasing the pressure  on the party leadership. Some members of the caucus said  bluntly that if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and  Bophuthatswana did provisionally register for the election, the  CP would be making a fatal error not to do the same.    Yesterday afternoon a CP MP said the party had taken no  decision on whether to follow Buthelezi's lead. The party  leadership had been trying to establish contact with Buthelezi  for clarity on his plans. There were attempts to call a meeting  of the Freedom Alliance as soon as possible, and CP leader Dr  Ferdi Hartzenberg had held extensive discussions with Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front] (AVF) leader General Constant  Viljoen since he arrived in Cape Town late on Tuesday.    A prominent CP member said some rightwingers had considered  forming a breakaway organisation to contest the election. Those  in favour of this move were waiting to see whether the CP as a  whole, or the AVF, would decide to take part, he said. He  believed a major consideration was finding a "face" -- a  well-known leader who could draw support -- to lead a breakaway  party.    It it understood that younger MPs like brothers Pieter and  Corne Mulder were among the prime movers in the participation  lobby. Respected MP for Parys Dr Piet Gous is also thought to be  in favour of contesting the election. A senior CP source said  a major factor behind the cracks in the party was the fact that  some younger MPs saw their careers going down the drain.    There also appears to be disillusionment with Hartzenberg's  leadership. Another party member said the divisions were not  about what the party should be striving for, but how to achieve  it.</p>

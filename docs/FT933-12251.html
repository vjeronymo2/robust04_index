			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Wolf at the door I HAD another chess lesson yesterday in the company of two friends: Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of Windsor, and John Major, prime minister of Britain. We are preparing ourselves for the world chess championship tussle in September between Britain's Nigel Short and the title-holder, Russia's Gary Kasparov. Our teacher is Nigel himself. The Queen is the star pupil, for she demonstrates mid-game finesse, deep strategic skill, and end-game brutality. Nigel has warmed to her greatly; his affection is reciprocated. John Major is the dunce: unable to master tactics, utterly free of guile, and a ditherer to boot. Nigel treats him kindly. With the country teetering on the brink of a bottomless chasm, you might think it strange that the Queen and prime minister found time to indulge themselves in a chess lesson. I was surprised they turned up. But they always keep their appointments. The Queen chimed and shone. She is convinced that the danger in which her family found itself earlier this summer is receding. The monarchy is safe. It has had to trim its sails, but there will be a king (or queen) of England long after she has gone. The prime minister, however, is not yet aware of the danger he is in. He is still a cheery chappie - like a dinosaur happily munching while the asteroid that will obliterate it settles into its approach run. Yesterday, we were supposed to be studying Nigel's game against Ljubojevic (Reykjavik, 1987), in which he used the Yugoslav Attack. But our hearts were not in it. There was far more chat than chess. The Queen was worried in case Nigel was being hounded by the media in the run-up to his title match. She said: 'It is imperative that one is not distracted from one's mission in life by the tittle-tattle of gossips, or by pensees creuses. The newspapers are appalling. But book-writers are worse. There has been such a flood of books about oneself and one's family that one was in danger of submerging. 'For example, there was a book recently by the dreadful Anthony Holden in which this provincial little man - he really is quite short, you know, and was born in the north of England - had the gall to estimate the cost of the monarchy to the British taxpayer in 1992 as exceeding Pounds 75m, or Pounds 192,000 per day - 'more', claimed this common little person, 'than 13 times the average national wage, before tax, per year.' 'What an impertinence. With whom did this gobe-mouches check his facts? One could have pointed him in the right direction had he consulted oneself. But of course he did not telephone one. How could he possibly dare? Lupo affamato mangia pan muffato, Nigel - a famished wolf eats mouldy bread. Whatever you do, avoid journalists and book-writers. They will stab you in the back.' 'Actually,' said Nigel, 'it's really brill at present. No one is hounding me. They've forgotten I exist. People have convinced themselves that Kasparov the Barbarian is going to tear me into such small and bloody pieces that they're avoiding me like the plague.' 'I wish I could say the same,' said the prime minister soulfully. 'It is a considerable surprise to me how consumed the media are with negative matters. Because the Maastricht treaty has encountered a few administrative difficulties in the House of Commons, the political journalists - a singularly ill-informed group, if I may venture to say so - are whipping up hysteria. 'But you only have to peruse the inside pages of the newspapers to acknowledge that many excellent developments are happening in Britain. We have the strongest economy in Europe. The number of abortions in England and Wales fell in 1991 for the first time since 1983. A considerable enlargement of the M25 orbital motorway has been announced. 'The long-range weather forecast is particularly excellent. Our cricketers are reasserting themselves. Crime is falling. Arrests are rising. The number of operations conducted in our hospitals is increasing all the time. We have much to be proud of. Our astronomers at Greenwich have even spotted a new asteroid. I believe it is a large one. It is emitting steam and flames. When I get home tonight I plan to observe it, through my binoculars.' Just then, the lesson ended.</p>

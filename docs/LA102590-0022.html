			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS 26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT;  </P> <P> BERMAN'S GOP RIVAL RUNS ON MEAGER FUNDS  </P> <P> Incumbent Democrat Howard L. Berman of Panorama City, who is seeking a fifth  term in the 26th Congressional District, faces an under-funded campaign  challenge from Republican businessman Roy Dahlson of Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Like his colleague Henry A. Waxman in the neighboring 24th District, Berman is  regarded as a heavyweight in the House and in California politics.  </P> <P> Before his election to Congress in 1982, he served 10 years in the state  Assembly, where he lost a bitter fight for the speakership.  </P> <P> In the House, Berman is a member of the Budget, Foreign Affairs and Judiciary  committees, and is particularly influential on immigration matters.  </P> <P> He also has been a leader in the effort to restore Hansen Dam in Lake View  Terrace to being a regional recreation area that will include a lake, and has  sponsored successful legislation to partially fund the facility.  </P> <P> Berman had $285,040 on hand in May.  </P> <P> Dahlson, a wholesale florist, reported campaign funds of just $513. He said his  campaign is based generally on a conservative Republican philosophy of "peace  through strength." He said he is opposed to tax increases of any kind and  supportive of cutting government spending and waste.  </P> <P> Berman is a leading advocate of a woman's right to choose an abortion, but  Dahlson said he opposes abortion in most circumstances, though he stops short  of advocating a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.  </P> <P> Libertarian Bernard Zimring of Van Nuys also is on the ballot. He opposes any  tax increases and said he considers the income tax to be unconstitutional and  an invasion of privacy.  </P> <P> The district is heavily Democratic and, in 1988, Berman easily defeated his  Republican challenger, G.C. Broderson, 70% to 29%.  </P></p>

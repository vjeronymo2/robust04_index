			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: " Rolls Royce Coasts Over </F> the Great Wall"]    [Text] Rolls Royce Motor Cars yesterday signed an  agreement with a Hong Kong firm to exclusively import its 3.75  million yuan ($431,000) luxury sedans to the Chinese mainland.    And the British car maker plans to set up a series of multi-  million dollar dealerships and service centres in cities like  Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou.    The new company, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, will  invest  in parts plants and training centres, said Ian Skeggs, of  Inchape Motors International in Hong Kong.    However, a source close to Rolls Royce said it had ruled out  manufacturing cars in China because local workers were not as  skilled as those in Britain.    Demand for the expensive cars in China has been on the rise,  prompting the import deal with Inchape, executives said.    Michael Donovan, a Rolls Royce managing director, signed the  deal with Skeggs yesterday on the Great Wall.    "This new venture provides us with a great opportunity to  show our confidence in the future, our commitment to Asia in  general and China in particular," Donovan said.    "It's an indication of the dynamic approach our new  re-vitalized company is making to ensure that our future is as  glorious as our past."    Rolls Royce's has sold 50 cars on the mainland in the past  18  months. Donovan said rising demand has given him confidence in  the market.    Sales in 1992 hit 10 cars, in 1993, 30 units. And in the  first quarter of this year, 11 sedans were sold.    The cars cost 1.5 million Yuan ($172,000) each on average,  not including the 150 percent tariff they face which boosts the  total price tag to about 3.75 million yuan ($430,000).    The government early this year cancelled preferential  policies, which allowed foreign-funded ventures to buy duty-free  imported cars.    Donovan said that the tax change will not hamper business  because of Rolls' long-term commitment to the country.    He denied rumours that Rolls Royce is opening markets in  China because business is plummeting in Britain and across the  world.    After experiencing extreme difficulties in 1991 and 1992,  business began to turn around last year, he said.    And the first quarter of this year continued the gradual  upturn wit 10 percent growth over the same period last year,  Donovan said.</p>

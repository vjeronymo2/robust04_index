Noting that President Kim Il-song has built Korean-style  socialism centred on the popular masses in the Northern half of  Korea and wisely led the struggle to accelerate the  reunification of the country, the messages express the  determination to wage a vigorous struggle in response to the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country.    The messages sincerely wish President Kim Il-song a long  life  in good health.</p>

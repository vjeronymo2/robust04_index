Each zone--one ``dirty'' and one  conditionally clean (Ordzhonikidze borough and Khorti  neighborhood)--house a city weather forecast station. The former  is located 2-3 km from an industrial area while the latter--at a  10 km distance. Morbidity data are classified by the frequency  of aid requests and are obtained from current files maintained  by treatment and preventive care facilities covering both  children and adults. The findings are backed by a sound  statistical correlation and are consistent with the results  produced by the laboratory of genetic research at the Republican  Scientific Hygienic Center at the Ukrainian Ministry of Public  Health. For children, morbidity in the dirty zone is higher than  that in the clean zone by 3.51 times for blood diseases, 1.81  times for eye diseases, and 1.79 times for upper respiratory  tract disorders while the combined morbidity is 1.6 times higher  than in the clean zone, 1.45 times higher than in the rest of  the republic, and 1.39 higher than the USSR average. Upper  respiratory tract disorders have the highest incidence  (75-87%). The findings served as the basis for developing  and  implementing the Biosfera comprehensive target-oriented program  for improving the environmental conditions in Zaporozhye.  References 5.</p>

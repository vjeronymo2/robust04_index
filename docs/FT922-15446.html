			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Congress sings the incumbency blues: US legislators may face growing difficulty in getting re-elected TWO YEARS ago, as now, incumbency was not the flavour of the month. Congress, facing mid-term elections, was in bad odour because of assorted savings-and-loan scandals, and the nasty smell of higher taxes was in the air after a decade of fumigation from the Republican White House. So what happened? No fewer than 96 per cent of all congressional incumbents were returned to office, and the Democrats slightly strengthened their hold on both houses. State governors did take a hit, with 14 out of 36 losing their jobs and with some political heavyweights, both Democrat and Republican, suffering narrow squeaks or bloody noses. But, mostly, the status quo was maintained, in good measure because of money. Only 23 challengers were able to raise half as much as their incumbent opponents. Political action committees, the principal vehicles for campaign finance, donated 19 times as much to incumbents as to challengers. In all, of the 406 seeking re-election, 79 were unopposed and a further 168 were up against challengers able to raise less than Dollars 25,000, which barely buys one television advertisement in a big market. The anti-incumbency mood seems stronger this year, and the general discontent with politics-as-usual in Washington reinforced by specific factors. The House of Representatives' cheque-bouncing scandal has helped drag Congress down to its lowest-ever level of public esteem. The movement to limit the terms of elected officials has gathered some steam; voters in the state of Washington last November rejected such an initiative, but this has been offset by a recent Supreme Court ruling leaving intact a new limitation law in California. Also, the 1990 national census has meant the redrawing in the last two years of many congressional districts to reflect shifts in the national population. Finally, an unusual number of sitting congressmen, about 50 in the House and six in the Senate, have announced retirement or have already been defeated in primary elections. Some, like Mr Warren Rudman, the Republican senator from New Hampshire, made many an incumbent look over his or her shoulder, by issuing farewell blasts against the political establishment's unwillingness and inability to face up to real problems. The only hard evidence of the strength of feeling against incumbents came on March 17 in Illinois, the first primary combining both presidential and congressional races. It saw several entrenched incumbents thrown out and others winning only with greatly reduced majorities. Local and personal circumstances were dominant in some cases, but not in all. As a result, the forecasts for what might happen in Congress this year are being reconsidered. The 435-seat House of Representatives - currently split among 268 Democrats, 166 Republicans and one socialist independent - could get as many as 100 new faces in November, approaching the post-war high of 118 in 1948. There are 35 seats up in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 57-43 edge, 20 defended by Democrats and only 15 by Republicans, and the proportional turnover could be as great. Naturally, as the minority party in Congress, the Republicans sense a rare opportunity, especially if President George Bush's onslaught on Democratic control of Congress takes hold. It was considered inconceivable that the Democrats could lose control of the House, which they have run since 1954, and it probably is still unlikely. But, assuming the Democrats lose some seats, the House may acquire the sort of ideological majority that prevailed in President Ronald Reagan's first term, with conservative southern Democrats, probably the least vulnerable at the polls, often joining forces with their Republican colleagues. In the Senate, the additional Democratic vulnerability means that an earthquake comparable to that which produced a Republican majority in 1980 for the first time in 26 years cannot be ruled out. As many as 13 Democratic seats, several won in 1986 when control was wrested back, are reckoned to be particularly shaky, compared to only seven for the Republicans, according to a recent survey by the National Journal. Part of the Republican optimism in the House stems from the fact it has done better than expected in the state fights over redistricting. The general population shift to the south and west, giving California, for example, seven more House seats, favours the Republicans, but this might have been negated by Democratic control over the majority of state governorships and legislatures which redraw boundaries. That seems not to have happened. Money continues to favour incumbents, but smart money always hedges its bets. Moreover, Mr Jerry Brown has already demonstrated in the Democratic presidential primaries that it is possible to make a political virtue out of running on a shoe-string, with small contributions, and thus beholden to no special interest group. Perhaps because of this, nearly twice as many challengers have declared their intent this year as against this time in 1990. These are, however, very early days. Most congressional primaries will not take pace until the summer and autumn. Even then, it will be difficult to differentiate between national sentiment and local circumstance. Equally, the impact of the presidential race is unpredictable. Ronald Reagan's coat-tails, long in 1980, had disappeared by 1984. Ticket-splitting had become, in effect, the national norm, and, even if the plague on incumbency becomes endemic, the end result may be similar.</p>

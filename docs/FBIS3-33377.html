			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ABC Metal Workers Union President Vicente </F> "Vicentinho" Paulo da Silva, by Liliana Pinheiro; place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Pinheiro] How do you evaluate the country now  that carnival is over?    [Paulo da Silva] You mean after the president flirted with a  girl without panties? Without being falsely moral, I was  ashamed.    Regarding the government, we will continue to criticize what  we have always criticized. The measures being prepared offer us  no guarantees. Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso makes more  mistakes than the ministers of the military regime. He knows  that easy measures like increasing taxes are not enough. Such  measure will appease the crisis only for a few days.    [Pinheiro] Has the government taken too long to react?    [Paulo da Silva] Look at the car industry agreement which  obtained a collective commitment and which created jobs.  Unfortunately the agreement was not repeated in other  industries. The government has been very shortsighted because  it could have made everyone committed to the development of the  country.    [Pinheiro] What does the labor movement expect from the  creation of the URV [Real Value Unit]?    [Paulo da Silva] To establish salaries based on a URV  calculated from the previous month's average price increases  represents a salary squeeze. In our case we would loose one  month's salary increase which amounts to 40 percent. What can  the URV do against inflation? Does this mean the government  will create a currency that can be manipulated, that will not  take into account price increases? Will salaries be controlled  by this currency? The government cannot do this. This could  worsen the already poor distribution of wealth in Brazil. It is  condemning those in the slums to stay in the slums. Beside  this, there is no mechanism forcing the businessmen to establish  their prices in URV.    [Pinheiro] What if salaries are related to the previous  month's average price increases?    [Paulo da Silva] We will hold an assembly next 25 February  to  discuss the salary campaign. If a salary squeeze is imposed on  us, a general strike will have to be considered at a national  level.    [Pinheiro] A national general strike?    [Paulo da Silva] We cannot allow society to again pay for  the  bankruptcy Brazil has been led to. I am speaking of the  workers, the small businessmen, who pay more taxes than big  businessmen, than everybody else.    [Pinheiro] You will probably win the CUT [Sole Workers  Center] elections in three months. Will your administration be  marked by large mobilizations?    [Paulo da Silva] The CUT cannot lose its great weapon which  is its mobilization capability. Negotiation is worthwhile only  if you are strong. Current conditions to defend the workers are  concrete. The government better not fool around. Remove our  accomplishments and see what happens. Perhaps because of its  immaturity, the government is overlooking the labor movement's  mobilization potential.    [Pinheiro] The Union Force is also calling for a strike.  Could labor unions unite in a national strike?    [Paulo da Silva] The CUT will not negotiate with [Labor  Force  President] Luiz Antonio de Medeiros. There are different  interests and total antagonism. There is a possibility of  dialogue but with serious people of the Labor Force. Medeiros  is losing credibility. [passage omitted]    [Pinheiro] You will support Lula [Workers Party President  Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] for president. Is the labor union  structure part of this support?    [Paulo da Silva] The labor union cannot remain isolated from  national changes. It must not favor a party but it can be  politicized. We will call the candidates we like and place our  support at their disposal. The labor union will not lend money  to any political party but we are free to politically support  Lula, just as Medeiros is free to support Collor or Maluf.</p>

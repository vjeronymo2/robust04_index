			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Ice-cream clash with EU looms Leading UK ice-cream manufacturers were yesterday cleared of anti-competitive distribution practices by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The decision, however, is set to spark a clash with Europe over competition policy. A nine-month inquiry found that 'freezer exclusivity' - providing free freezer cabinets to shops on condition they are not used to stock ice-cream from other suppliers - did not operate against the public interest. The commission found no evidence of excessive prices or profits being made in the sale of ice-cream for immediate consumption - so-called 'impulse ice-cream'. It said recent market trends suggested competition had been effective irrespective of any exclusivity. But its conclusion that the tied offer of freezers to retailers was not a barrier to market entry could bring the UK into conflict with Brussels. The European Commission is also investigating the issue of freezer exclusivity after a complaint from Mars, the US confectionery group, which entered the impulse ice-cream business in 1989. Brussels has yet to rule on the issue but an indication of its thinking came recently when it vetted the takeover by Unilever, the UK-Dutch consumer goods group, of Ortiz-Miko, France's third-biggest ice-cream producer. The European Commission said freezer exclusivity was a serious barrier to market entry. Disagreement between London and Brussels over the issue could force the UK authorities to back down, thereby throwing into doubt the practicality of Brussels's attempts to encourage greater subsidiarity - the principle where powers are devolved to the lowest practical level  - in competition policy. The MMC report was welcomed by Unilever, whose subsidiary Birds Eye Walls has two-thirds of the market for impulse purchases of wrapped ice-creams, and more than half of the total UK impulse market, valued at Pounds 275m in 1992. The company said it was 'a clear vindication of its practice of providing free brand-linked freezer cabinets to its retail customers'. It has supplied 60,000 freezers to 42,000 shops in the UK. Mr Simon Bullimore, managing director of Mars Confectionery, said the report protected Wall's existing and profitable exclusive distribution arrangements. 'Freezer exclusivity is clearly an anti-competitive practice which still adversely affects competitors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers alike,' he added. The Consumers' Association was also critical. 'The MMC has once again failed consumers with a muddle-headed and misguided report which puts the interests of industry firmly in first place.' The MMC found a simple monopoly existed in favour of Birds Eye Walls and a complex monopoly in favour of BEW, Nestle, which bought Lyons Maid at the end of 1992, and Mars. Together they accounted for 88 per cent of sales of wrapped ice-creams for immediate consumption in 1992. BEW and Nestle operate and enforce exclusivity where possible. Mars supplies cabinets to retailers but only requires that a full range of its ice-creams be stocked. The monopolies commission concluded this had the same effect as exclusivity. BEW and Nestle argued that freezer exclusivity had extended the market and consumer choice to many small outlets which would not otherwise have stocked ice-cream. Mars had asked the MMC to ban exclusivity as anti-competitive. Since entering the market in 1989 it has achieved a market share of 16 per cent for wrapped ice-creams. The MMC's conclusions were that exclusivity posed less of a problem than when it last looked at the the market in 1979. Retailers could add a second freezer, and this had happened in as much as 80 per cent of outlets. They could terminate exclusive agreements at short notice and could purchase their own freezer and buy ice-cream at lower prices. It concluded: 'We are not convinced that consumer choice would be significantly improved were exclusivity ended.' Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

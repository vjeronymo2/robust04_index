			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 9:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service's use of BT, a biological pest control, was listed as a primary threat to Holy Ghost ipomopsis in the proposed rule, yet no such activities have taken place on the Santa Fe National Forest for over 25 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the area was sprayed with BT in the 1980's. Although the Forest Service has no current plans to use BT, the potential to destroy the lepidopteran pollinators for Holy Ghost ipomopsis still exists. The State of New Mexico has also been involved in spraying BT for control of spruce budworm infestation on private property in New Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 10:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> How will the listing of Holy Ghost ipomopsis restrict recreation, wilderness and campground access, or existing cabin leases in the area?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service believes that listing will have little, if any, impact on recreation, wilderness and campground access, and cabin leases. The Service will work with the Forest Service to minimize possible adverse impacts to the species from human activities in Holy Ghost ipomopsis habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 11:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Listing the Holy Ghost ipomopsis will not provide any more protection for this species than it already receives under Forest Service management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Holy Ghost ipomopsis is currently protected under the State of New Mexico Endangered Plant Species Act (75&hyph;6&hyph;1 NMSA) and is on the U.S. Forest Service's Sensitive Species List. Even so, it does not have the same degree of protection and management as a federally listed species. Listing under the Endangered Species Act promotes recovery through the development and implementation of a recovery plan, provides additional management opportunities by drawing attention to the species and its habitat requirements, creates the requirement for interagency consultation through the section 7 process, and makes it illegal, with possibly severe penalties, to maliciously damage, destroy, or remove and possess plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commercial nursery has Holy Ghost ipomopsis under cultivation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Apparently, propagation material was obtained several years ago by a commercial grower of native plants. Nursery propagation of this material could provide a commercial source for Holy Ghost ipomopsis plants, and thus help conserve this species by discouraging the collection or digging of plants from wild populations. Propagation knowledge gained by the commercial grower may be of considerable value in establishing a refugial population or in reestablishing populations in natural habitat within the species' historic range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 13:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat should be designated and an economic analysis should be done. Although critical habitat was not proposed for Holy Ghost ipomopsis because of a perceived threat from overcollection that could be worsened by publication of critical habitat locality maps, this species can be located from available information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

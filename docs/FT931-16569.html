			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Patten predicts rise in school opt-outs MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday predicted an acceleration in the number of schools opting out of local authority control. But he set only a modest target for the number likely to opt out this year. Seeking to counter claims that the government's campaign to sever the link between state schools and local authorities is failing, Mr Patten said the popularity of grant-maintained schools was undeniable. He said: 'I believe that 1993 will see the one thousandth school endorse a ballot to become grant-maintained.' The target of 1,000 is much lower than projections made by ministers a year ago. At present, only 334 of the 21,000 state schools in England are grant-maintained. Most of the schools that have opted out are in Tory-controlled authorities. A study this week by Labour local authorities claims that as the number of ballots on opting out has increased in recent months, so has the number going against. In October, parents at 75 schools voted to opt out, while in 20 they voted against. In December the numbers were 57 for opting out and 21 against. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said opting out was causing chaos in the education system and that 1993 would see 'the fightback' against 'increasing centralisation'. Nevertheless, Mr Patten's bill to provide for a new funding council for grant-maintained schools will soon complete its passage through the Commons, and looks poised to become law before the summer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth of four installments: "Special article" by Chu </F> Hsing-fu (2612 1630 4395): "China and the United States Should  Highly Value Their Harmony--Written on the Eve of Christopher's  Visit to China" -- previous installments published in the 9, 10  March China Daily Report]    [Text] Mutual Hostility Is Not Good    When U.S. Secretary of State Christopher arrives Beijing on  11 March for a visit, what the Chinese and American officials  have to discuss is how to enhance understanding, reduce  friction, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on the basis on  equality and reciprocity. It can benefit both sides if China  and the United States, two big countries, can strengthen  cooperation in various domains, whereas mutual hostility and a  drain on strength is not good for either side.    China does not constitute any threat to the United States.  China and the United States and the peoples in the two  countries have traditional friendship, and even during the Cold  War period, they could be friends. Why cannot they get along  well after the Cold War? If the United States cancels China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status because of the human  rights issue, it will strip away the good feeling toward the  United States among the Chinese people and the People's  Liberation Army [PLA], China's policy toward the United States  might become conservative and hard-line, and China might even  adopt an uncooperative attitude toward some important  international issues which concern the United States. A  hard-line, conservative, and uncooperative China is obviously  not in the strategic interest of the United States.  <H5>  Strengthen Contact for Mutual Understanding </H5>   What is worth mentioning is that although China and the  United States have gone round and round in the strange circle of  human rights for several years, the armed forces of the two  countries have already made a gratifying step in contact. In  September last year, the United States adopted a new "contact  strategy" toward China. Under the guidance of this strategy,  U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Freeman visited China at the  end of last year, resuming high-level military contacts and  interaction with China. Recently, the president of U.S.  National Defense University has also visited China. Military  contacts and exchanges between China and the United States can  help foster mutual understanding between the two armed forces,  and help the two countries to strengthen bilateral military  cooperation.    According to the press, the Clinton administration has  reached some consensus on relations with China. The consensus  includes: China is a country to be reckoned with in the world;  and the Chinese military has a recognizable role to play in  China's foreign policy formulation, and only through contacts  can the United States influence the PLA, continue to urge China  to develop in the positive direction, and continue to make  China, which will be economically and militarily strong in the  future, a friend of the United States. U.S. Assistant Secretary  of Defense Freeman said recently that although this kind of  "contact strategy" cannot solve the issue of human rights and  trade between China and the United States, it can ease the tense  situation which might arise between the two countries regarding  security issues.    Secretary of State Christopher said recently that if China  makes positive efforts in the areas of abiding by the  International Human Rights Declaration, releasing political  prisoners, stopping interference in the Chinese-language  broadcast of Voice of America, then, the United States will  consider discussing extension of China's MFN status every  several years. Officials in the U.S. Department of Commerce and  Treasury Department advocated a permanent settlement of the MFN  status for China. However, the United States should understand  and sympathize with China's concrete conditions, and should not  just exert great pressure. So long as China and the United  States can understand each other and make mutual concessions,  bilateral relations will be smooth, and if both sides can step  back half a step on the issues which cause controversy,  relations between the two countries will have broad room for  development.  <H5>  Bill of the Cold War Era Should Be Scrapped </H5>   Judged from the current situation, the practice that the  United States extends China's MFN status every year is one which  costs the U.S. Government and people money; it affects  confidence and long-term planning among American businessmen and  industrialists who want to invest in China, and lets some  congressmen and human rights organizations pull the U.S.  Government by the nose in the area of relations with China,  thus, putting the government to a very passive position. Even  if the MFN status is extended every several years, by then the  White House might be troubled by various interest groups when  the decision has to be made. Therefore, the best method should  be neatly settling the issue of China's MFN status once and for  all.    To extend China's MFN trade status once and for all, the  United States should abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This  bill of the Cold War era was formulated for the Soviet Union  which had no freedom of migration and had non-market economy  system, and it is now outdated. China has always allowed  freedom of migration, and China has announced it would walk  toward market economy. Even the countries which have been  blacklisted as terrorist countries by the United States, such as  Syria, Libya, and Iraqi can easily enjoy MFN status, so why  cannot China, which is opening up and is converging to the track  of world economy, enjoy MFN status which is being enjoyed  unconditionally by almost every country?  <H5>  Should Grant China Permanent MFN Status </H5>   Dr. Michael Svens, a researcher specializing in East Asian  problems with Rand Corporation, pointed out in a recent speech  in Washington that, he believed the Clinton administration will  continue to extend China's MFN status this year. He said that  if the United States cancels China's MFN status, conservative  forces inside China will emerge. Many experts in American  academic circles have the same viewpoint. They advocated that  human rights and trade issues should be handled separately. If  Sino-U.S. relations are built on the narrow basis of human  rights, once a problem arises in the area of human rights, the  whole Sino-U.S. relationship will be in danger.    Looking at problems from a macro-viewpoint, the United  States  must not cancel China's MFN status in the future, even more, it  must also permanently extend China's MFN status. Only by so  doing can China and the United States walk toward a bright and  splendid 21st century hand in hand. Both the Chinese and U.S.  Governments have now this hope and wish. Christopher's visit to  China is very important in terms of whether the United States  can do this. (10 March, Washington)</p>

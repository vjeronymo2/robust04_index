			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Labour will consider elected mayors THE Labour party is to examine the case for elected mayors of councils, and its leadership has accepted the principle of the council tax and compulsory competitive tendering for local services, after strenuously opposing both. Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, announced the policy shifts as Labour councillors met in Bournemouth for their annual conference. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, hailed them as 'the latest humiliat-ing climbdown by Labour.' Although Mr Straw limited his acceptance of compulsory tendering to blue-collar services such as refuse collection, his announcement will be controversial among Labour councils and local government unions, which wish to protect direct labour organisations. At the last general election Labour proposed to abolish compulsory tendering and the council tax. In an interview published in yesterday's Tribune magazine, Mr Straw said: 'There is wide acceptance that the division between contractor and provider that compulsory competitive tendering has produced has been sensible. It has meant that in areas of basic services there are now clear definitions of what services should be provided.' On the council tax, he said: 'The underlying principle of council tax is OK  -it's a property tax. But some of the practice is bad. We'll be working out how it can be changed so that it becomes much more like what we wanted in the fair rates system.' Addressing the conference, Mr Straw emphasised that 'the model council should be an enabling council', aiming to 'help people to organise for themselves'. Although he said that he was 'not in favour of following the Tories' agenda', hitherto the case for both competitive tendering and 'enabling councils' - as opposed to councils directly providing services - has been argued mainly by the Conservatives. Mr Straw commended 'looking at the idea' of elected mayors as a way of giving councils 'a political focus'. He added: 'We must also look at the idea of having fewer council committees and perhaps fewer councillors, alongside an extension of community and parish councils to the whole country.' Elected mayors were last raised as a serious possibility by Mr Michael Heseltine, on becoming environment secretary in 1990. The cabinet gave no encouragement, with other ministers concerned that they might strengthen local government. Mr Heseltine got no further than establishing a review of local authority internal management, which is due to report soon.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Hermosillo, Sonora, 20 April--A shipment of  nearly a ton of cocaine was seized early this morning at the PGR  [Attorney General's Office] checkpoint set up at Km 120 north of  this town. The announcement was made by Miguel Angel Cortes  Ibarra, the PGR's circuit representative.    The federal official added that these drugs were concealed  under a load of pine logs arriving from the southern part of the  country, and were bound for a site in the state's northern  section.    The drugs were being transported on a gray Kenworth tractor  trailer truck with Federal Public Service [SPF] plates 660-AT-1,  hitched to a red flatbed carrying SPF plates 371-TXS. The  information concerning the driver was not disclosed, so as to  avoid interfering with the pertinent investigation [passage  omitted]</p>

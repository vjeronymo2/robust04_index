			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Three Graces unveiled at the V&amp;A The Three Graces were unveiled in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London yesterday, ending a five year battle over ownership of the 19th-century sculpture. The Graces have been the subject of controversy since the Marquess of Tavistock, whose ancestor commissioned sculptor Antonio Canova in 1814, offered the work to the V &amp; A almost a decade ago. The museum could not afford the Pounds 1m price, condemning the Three Graces to years in a London warehouse, the property of the mysterious Fine Art Investments &amp; Display. In 1989 the J. Paul Getty Museum at Malibu paid Pounds 7.6m for the work, but attempts to export it were thwarted by British heritage groups, which raised Pounds 3m from the National Heritage Fund, Pounds 1m from John Paul Getty 11, Pounds 800,000 from Baron Thyssen, Pounds 500,000 from the National Art Collections Fund and the remainder from the V &amp; A and the National Gallery of Scotland. National heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell said yesterday that the unveiling of the sculpture was a boost for the nation's heritage and the end of a 'long saga'. The Graces will leave London in July for Edinburgh, where they will spend the next four years in the National Gallery of Scotland. They will return to the V &amp; A in 1999 then rotate between the two institutions every seven years.</p>

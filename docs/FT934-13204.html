			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Forestry side helps Repola out of red ANOTHER strong performance from its forest operations helped Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, achieve profits of FM86m (Dollars 15.1m) in the first eight months after sales grew 12 per cent to FM16.8bn. The result compares with a FM415m loss in the same 1992 period and reflects the benefits of the weaker Finnish markka and increased production at its main unit, United Paper Mills (UPM). Operating profits more than doubled to FM1.79bn from FM818m. However, financing costs rose to FM1.7bn from FM1.23bn partly because foreign exchange losses increased to FM408m from FM109m. UPM saw sales rise 21 per cent to FM10.8bn and pre-tax profits increase to FM725m from FM133m. The division benefited from streamlining, higher magazine paper sales, a good paperboard market and increased sawn goods exports. Sales fell 3 per cent to FM5bn at Rauma, the group's metals and engineering unit, although the division's pre-tax loss fell sharply to FM15m from FM238m. Rosenlaw, the company's packaging unit, lifted sales by 7 per cent to FM910m as it swung to a FM21 pre-tax profit from a FM27m loss last time round.</p>

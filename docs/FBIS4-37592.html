			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has renewed his call to the  Yemeni belligerents to abide by the UN Security Council's  cease-fire resolution to safeguard the lives of the Yemeni  people and to enter into a constructive dialogue to promote  security and stability for the fraternal Yemeni people. He  expressed the Arab League's readiness to do its utmost to  achieve this goal.    In an interview with the weekly magazine AL-MUSAWWAR  published today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the fighting  between brothers in Yemen has led to divisions and exacerbated  the crisis. He expressed the hope that the two sides in Yemen  will resume their dialogue as soon as possible.    Asked whether South Yemen has submitted an application to  the  Arab League to become an independent member, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  said: Yes, it did, but no action has been taken. The  application is held in the General Secretariat until the Arab  League Council holds its next meeting.    Asked about the internationalization of the Yemeni crisis  and  the fact that some states prefer to refer Arab problems to the  United Nations, the Arab League secretary general pointed out  that North Yemen was the one that first objected to Arab League  mediation, because, as the Yemeni officials said, this is an  internal matter. He said that North Yemen objected not only to  Arab League mediation but also to UN mediation.    Regarding the Libyan-Western crisis and whether Libya has  accepted the Arab League's proposal to conduct the trial of the  suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague  according to Scottish law and with Scottish judges, Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid expressed his thanks to the Libyan leadership for  accepting this delicate and sensitive political and legal  situation. He noted in this regard that the recent Nonaligned  Movement foreign ministers' conference in Cairo supported this  initiative. He said that contacts have been held with UN  Security Council member states and the European Union in this  regard, and the atmosphere is completely suitable for discussing  the means to achieve a peaceful settlement to this problem. He  added that this will prevent an escalation of the Libyan-Western  crisis in August, sparing the area further tension. He noted  that a number of European countries who have interests in Libya  do not want an escalation of the crisis and are ready to listen  to Libya's views on the issue.    Regarding the embargo on Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid expressed  hopes that the embargo will be lifted and that the Iraqi people  will enjoy freedom, security, and stability. He said that  everything is in the hands of the Iraqi Government. It can ask  the UN Security Council to lift the embargo after it implements  the UN resolutions, including those concerning recognition of  Kuwait's sovereignty, the border demarcation, compensation, and  the prisoners.    Regarding Israeli operations in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  said that what Israel has done and is doing against Lebanon is  contrary to peace. He affirmed that Lebanon has the right to  defend its territory and to demand the withdrawal of the Israeli  forces.    He added that if Israel really wants peace in the area, it  must stop its actions and embark on serious and effective  negotiations to avoid operations by the Lebanese resistance,  which is defending itself and trying to end the occupation.  This, he said, is a legitimate right that applies to Lebanon,  Syria, and the Palestinians, just as it applied in the past to  Egypt before the liberation of its national territory.</p>

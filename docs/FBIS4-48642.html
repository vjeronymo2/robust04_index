			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] He sat with arms folded, occasionally nodding with  approval or narrowing bloodshot-weary eyes as he listened to a  briefing on the new water policy. When Minister without  Portfolio Jay Naidoo rose to leave, his colleague, Water and  Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, remarked to him: "Our door is  always open to you. We will be knocking on your door."    The comment speaks volumes about Mr Naidoo's status in the  new government and the relationship he will have with his  colleagues in the cabinet. Armed with the budget and a red pen,  Mr Naidoo has the full backing of President Nelson Mandela to  intervene in every area of government. No door will be shut to  him and his team operating form the floor above Mr Mandela's  office in the Union Buildings.    "I may be a minister without portfolio, but it does not mean  I do not have a job," Mr Naidoo said this week. His task is to  ensure that the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme  (RDP) -- a plan to provide millions of jobs, 10 years free  education, health care for all, electricity, housing and water  on a massive scale -- is implemented.    He has to bring together all the various departments into  one  coherent programme.    It is a job that involves "a lot of talking" with ministers,  the provincial governments and with civil society. Crucial to  the success of his task is to build a partnership between the  government, the private sector and the labour movement in a  common national endeavour to better the lives of the people, he  says. To carry out his task, he will have a transition team in  his office and a cabinet sub-committee of ministers crucial to  the RDP -- those from labour, trade and industry, finance,  housing, transport, telecommunications, provincial affairs,  health, education and water -- who will thrash out the  programme's priorities before reaching the cabinet.    In implementing the RDP, Mr Naidoo is constrained only by  four factors: he must maintain a macro-economic balance; retain  fiscal discipline; he cannot fuel inflation; and he must be  guided by the principle of not raising the level of taxation.  He is the minister that will work closet with Finance Minister  Derek Keys.    His task seems impossible given the constraints and the  limited amount of money at his disposal. But Mr Naidoo is  contemptuous of scare stories of R80-billion [rand] in addition  to budgetary allocations being spent on the RDP by the end of  five years, the spectre of a debt-trap and rocketing inflation.    "The RDP is not an add-on programme. We are not talking  about a new list of demands and adding on (to the Budget)."  Instead, he says, each department's budget will be examined to  see whether it fits the new priorities.    "Finance is not the problem. The government, having resolved  (the RDP), made the funds available and set up a plan -- the  acid test is getting the plan working on the ground."    And Mr Naidoo believes it is nonsense that the government  cannot deliver housing, infrastructure and services. "There are  communities out there that want the stuff. We have to break  through the red tape of bureaucracy, go down and deal directly  with the communities," he says.    He talks of using the unions, business expertise and other  non- governmental oragnisations to do this in the absence of  effective delivery mechanisms.    "It takes a lot of organisation but it does not come  overnight. That is what frustrates me. We can do all of this.  There are people on the ground ready to do it. What is  stopping us from doing it?"    It is all a question of reorientating the government  departments towards effective delivery of services, establishing  local government structures and being ruthless with a  bureaucracy that absorbs more than it delivers, he says. "Part  of my work is moving towards greater efficiency. Within five to  10 years, the framework in which the new government can operate  will have been achieved and there will be no reason to have an  RDP team."    There are four sources of funds for the RDP. The first  comprises "wedges" from the Budget which will increase each  year. One scenario, released by the National Institute for  Economic Policy this week, is that R80-billion from the Budget  will be spent on the RDP in the next five years. The other  sources are: development aid; donations from the private sector;  and resources from non governmental organisations.    Then there are always the "windfalls" that Mr Naidoo says he  will have no reservation about using -- selling off assets like  the "macho white glory projects of the past" that are not  directly linked to delivering the RDP.    He is also confident that with the restoration of services,  the rent and services boycotts will come to an end. "Within  these constraints, we are going to put forward a realistic plan,  and we are confident that we have one. We have worked through  mechanisms of harnessing resources, especially with the private  sector, organised labour and other stakeholders. We are quite  confident that we have drawn them into a real partnership," he  says.    The first small signs of the RDP will be visible in the  Budget that will be presented on June 22.    Work has already been done with Mr Keys, former State  Expenditure Minister Ami Venter, Deputy Finance Minister Alec  Erwin and Mr Naidoo over the past several months on identifying  sources of funding in the Budget. They have examined  expenditure patterns and carefully gone through the budgets of  all the departments, arranging them in the order of priority for  the RDP and assessing what could be achieved in this year's  Budget.    They have taken their red pens and marked areas of saving,  and put a line through those projects which are no longer  priorities. This money will be spend on RDP priorities in the  first year.    "We are not so naive as to think that we are going to  achieve  everything that we talked about in the RDP this year. We have  to prioritise, but we have a clear idea of what we can achieve  in the first year," he says.    They will particularly focus on "kick-starting" the RDP,  beginning with very visible programmes that will indicate to the  electorate that the new government is different from the old.    These priorities are programmes in the areas of education,  jobs, health and infrastructure. The plan will be discussed at  the cabinet meeting tomorrow.    "It is only in the 95/96 Budget that we will begin in a more  systematic way to reorganise expenditure along the lines of  expanded priorities," Mr Naidoo added.    It is the beginning of a reorganisation process that will  take at least 10 years to complete. By then, Mr Naidoo says:  "The entire Budget will be one of reconstruction and  development. That is the ultimate goal.    "The government will be the epitome of the RDP, operating  under the mandate of the people and serving the people. My job  is an interim function -- to get the government to become what  it is supposed to be."</p>

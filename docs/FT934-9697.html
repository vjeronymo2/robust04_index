			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (5): An accommodating computer does the bookings - Paul Taylor on advances in hotel technology Even before setting foot in the hotel lobby, the chances are that today's business traveller will have, probably unknowingly, benefited from the introduction of computer technology to the hotel industry. If the reservation was made via a travel agent, perhaps in conjunction with air travel, an airline computer reservation system (CRS) or dedicated hotel CRS may have been used. Alternatively, the booking may have been made by calling a hotel's computerised central reservation system. All the main airline-owned CRSs, including the US and European market leaders Sabre, Galileo International and Amadeus, now provide their travel agent customers hotel and car hire information as part of their services. For example, Sabre's Shaarp Plus hotel booking service carries information from over 180 hotel chains and reservation companies along with details of more than 27,000 hotels. A direct connect service is available for 57 hotel groups, enabling Sabre to link into hotels' host computer systems and provide latest room availability and rate information, together with immediate confirmation of the booking. Some large hotel chains have installed their own central reservation systems while others have joined one of the marketing consortia such as Best Western Hotels and Supranational Hotel Reservations which run reservation systems or one of the booking services like Utel International Reservations which handle telephone bookings for a wide range of independent hotels. These central reservations systems use sophisticated software developed in-house by big chains such as Forte or by software specialists including MDIS (McDonnell Douglas Information Systems) which has installed 26 'Hornet' systems in the UK and continental Europe. MDIS customers in the UK include Best Western and Hilton whose system, installed three years ago, handles bookings for 42 Hilton hotels in the UK. In the wake of the Gulf war and the recession, Mr Stephen Sawyers, general manager for hotel and leisure industry operations at MDIS, says: 'Hotels and hotel groups have woken up to the need to market their services more effectively and aggressively and they need technology to help them do it.' Central reservation systems like Hornet also handle the links between hotels' host computer systems and global CRSs. 'It is quite a difficult integration job,' says Mr Sawyer. One key advantage of these systems is ease of use. For example, a traveller visiting several European capitals can telephone a central reservation system and make confirmed bookings for each city while on the line. The central computer system then updates individual hotels' host computer systems, either electronically or by fax, and updates the records held in any participating airline CRS. If the booking covers several different hotel chains, the central system will handle all the electronic 'paperwork' and charge the hotels the appropriate commissions. Some travel management companies have gone one step further, providing an integrated approach to hotel booking. For example, Thomas Cook Travel Management has spent 18 months and more than Pounds 1m to develop a new booking system called System Four. Mr Bill Kirkwood, director of sales and marketing, says of the system: 'On a single CRS screen, which is divided into four segments, all the relevant information necessary to book flights, hotels and car hire appears.' As with central reservations systems, the main advantage for the business traveller is that hotel bookings are confirmed on the spot, while the customer is on the telephone. A profile of the client is held on the system, so that preferences such as a non-smoking room or business facilities can be arranged without the caller needing to ask for them. 'Technology will be the key differential between travel management companies in the future,' says Mr Kirkwood. Technology is also becoming increasingly important in the internal management of hotel systems. As soon as a guest arrives in the hotel lobby, another range of sophisticated computer programmes called Property Management Systems (PMS) comes into play. Many varieties of PMS are available from software companies and specialist system houses on both sides of the Atlantic. Most consist of a central or core programme which handles basic functions such as reservations, check-in and check-out and accounting. They also accept add-on specialist 'modules' and provide electronic links or 'interfaces' to other automated hotel systems, including energy management, electronic key and telephone management systems. Among the PMS suppliers in the UK is Avon Data Systems, which has been selling a range of PMS packages which run under MS-DOS on desktop computers for 10 years. Its software packages cater for hotels with between six and 1,500 bedrooms and prices range from Pounds 600 for an entry level system to Pounds 3,500. Mr Clifford Springer, Avon's managing director, says that these days customers are demanding more integrated packages and sophisticated reporting so they can do budgeting and yield management, of critical importance in the fiercely competitive hotel industry. Mr Christopher Lomax, managing director of Misys' Innsite subsidiary, another UK-based PMS supplier, adds that 'some hotel groups are realising that they have to use sales and marketing more.' Data collected by a PMS can help this effort and most PMS packages such as Innsite's Omega accept add-on sales and marketing modules. Another large PMS supplier is Hotel Information Systems, a specialist software group with operations on both sides of the Atlantic and customers around the world. HIS supplies a wide range of PMS products designed for all sizes of establishment. Its flagship, Paragon Front Office PMS, which runs on IBM AS/400 computers, provides a range of tools for managing guests from reservation to check-out and integrates with Paragon Back Office, Central Reservations, Yield management, Concierge and other add-on modules and complementary products. Among its features, it enables hotel operators to develop sophisticated rate structures, maintain records of previous guest visits and generate a wide range of financial and other reports. The latest generation of the product offers more than 300 interfaces including connections to point-of-sale, call accounting, mini-bar, voice mail and other hotel-based systems. Information technology is also helping to improve other aspects of hotel performance. Security is being tightened. The days of the traditional hotel room key already look numbered. For instance, Sargent Systems markets a system that includes a card-producing computer, up to 16 levels of magnetic stripe keycards, computerised card-reading door locks and a hand-held computer that programmes, interrogates and troubleshoots door units. When a guest arrives, a new card key is made which automatically expires at a designated date and time. Using the hand-held computer, management can also track the last 120 entries for each room by date, time and by card type and serial number meaning that no-one - guest or staff - can use the lock without leaving a clear trail. Once inside the hotel room, other IT systems monitor and control the environment. For example, Staefa Control Systems, based in Switzerland, provides a highly sophisticated automatic temperature control system which can be integrated with a front office booking system and enables the hotel to control energy usage precisely. Most hotels will also have an automated telephone management system. These work with a hotel's private automated branch exchange (PABX) and its PMS and some provide automatic wake-up calls in a guest's native language or enable the guest to control a hotel pay-movie video system from the room telephone. Even the mini-bar has been automated in some hotels. One system manufactured by RoboBar provides on-line information on stock levels, sales analysis, automatic billing and accounting audit trails for room mini-bars which can be connected to any PMS system, or work on its own.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Inefficient Election--"Give or take a few rough edges," the  South African election will probably be "a fair reflection of  the broad will of the people," notes an editorial in the  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 2 May on page 12. However,  "too many foreign observers" assessed the polls "as remarkable  and then added the rider `...by African standards.'" "A cold  assessment of the election will not cast a particularly  complimentary light on its administrators, the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission]." Voting was "chaotic in some areas," as  "vast numbers of ballot papers went missing and the required  voting equipment just did not arrive." "Crisis management" was  supplied as "the Government, the National Peace Secretariat and  others came to the IEC's rescue." "The new South Africa could be  born into a culture of sloppiness -- where crisis management  becomes a way of life. During the transition to democracy it was  sometimes necessary to bend the rules, to turn a blind eye. In  the interests of good government and an ordered society, that  must not be repeated."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Journalists Coverage of Election -- As the media "definition  of news" is "that which is unusual," says the editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN on 2 May, "it is therefore not susprising  that they have turned the attention of the country to what went  wrong during the election. We have written extensively about  problems with the delivery of material to voting stations, the  late starts at polling stations, the problems at the counting  centres and the painful struggle to get the results out." "The  only sad thing is that we might have shifted the focus away from  the great things achieved in a short week of history-making."  "We did not make a noise about the IEC's achievements." And the  rightwing strategy to disrupt the elections "went terribly  wrong. It seems its potential threat to a democratic South  Africa was overblown or only in the imagination of foreign  journalists." "It is now history that last week's four days of  polling were the most peaceful in South Africa in years."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Loyal Opposition -- "By next week we will have swapped  one-party rule for what might be no more than two-party power  sharing in a government of national unity," notes an editorial  headlined "Election Comment -- the Editor" in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 May on page 1. "Ironically the Nats  [National Party] will be cast in the role of a loyal opposition,  loyal to the extent that party members will be in the Cabinet  and will be jointly responsibile with ANC members for Cabinet  decisions." "While the totalitarian impluse might be to dismiss  the small parties as irrelevant, the contributions the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party], Freedom Front and DP [Democratic Party]  can make should not be overlooked. They might be thorns in the  government's flesh and some might represent fairly narrow  interests, but their opposition must be viewed as constructive  if the country is to succeed in its quest for national  reconciliation." The "different factions" of the ANC are  expected to "hold together" and to "continue to do so for a  while, reaping popular support from Nelson Mandela." "Eventually  the ANC will need to develop a role as a broadly popular party  of the center capable of building a strong economy while  retaining mass support," however "this may eventually cost the  party a radical wing which tires of power-sharing." "Making the  transition will be a necessary foundation for the country's  future stability. It will be made easier if the concept of a  loyal opposition is acknowledged for the first time in decades."    New Economic Era -- The country is poised to enter a new  economic era, just as surely it is entering a new political  one," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY on 2 May  on page 12. "South Africans need and expect thoughtful economic  stewardship just as they need and expect thoughtful political  management. Without the first, the second cannot succeed." While  the threats of inflation and recession remain, "sound economic  stewardship" implies "fiscal incentives that encourage  industrialists to expand and to create jobs." While funds have  been promised from abroad, state borrowing cannot "force up  interest rates to levels that halt industrial expansion.    Sound economic stewardship should, however, lead to growth  rates that quickly expand the country's tax base. The conomic  cake will then be big enough for eveyone to have a fair share."</p>

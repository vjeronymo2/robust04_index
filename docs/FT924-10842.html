			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley defends stance on tobacco MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday defended the government's reluctance to impose a ban on tobacco advertising, in spite of the publication of a government report which concludes advertising does have a positive effect on consumption. Mrs Bottomley told the commons select committee on health that the government saw tobacco advertising as important, but a statutory ban was 'a very serious step to take in a free country,' as it would have grave implications for commercial freedom of speech. She said the UK had already reduced the proportion of smokers from 45 per cent of the population to 30 per cent, second only to the Netherlands in Europe, and had set a target of 20 per cent in the Health of the Nation white paper. A range of measures would be deployed to reach that target, including possible strengthening of the current voluntary arrangements limiting tobacco advertising, and maintaining high prices for tobacco products. Mrs Bottomley said Britain was attempting to persuade other EC countries of the importance of pricing in reducing tobacco consumption.</p>

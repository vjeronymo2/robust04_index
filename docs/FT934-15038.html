			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (32): A helping hand from shared ideas / A look at an initiative that has brought together companies from three European countries to learn from each other's experiences - Supporting exports, The ICDP THE ADVENT of the European Single Market has meant that companies large and small are increasingly being cajoled to adopt an 'export-or-die' approach to their business. But, for the small or medium-sized business with limited management resources and little experience outside its traditional home market, the effort needed to break into an export market can be a bewildering and even traumatic experience. It was with such companies in mind that an initiative was taken several years ago by the Irish Productivity Centre (IPC) - an organisation jointly funded by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions - to bring together a group of small but expanding companies, from different countries and business cultures, in order that they might learn and swap experiences. Called the International Company Development Programme (ICDP), Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands each selected six companies to participate in an 18-month programme of seminars and workshops. The Dutch Institute for Small and Medium Craft Businesses (CIMK) and the Jutland Institute of Technology co-ordinated the programme with the IPC. 'The focus of the programme was on management development, to develop a team rather than individuals,' says Tom McGuinness of the IPC. 'The idea was that the participating companies would develop a strategic development plan to make them more competitive and give them greater export potential'. The first programme ran from 1989 to 1990, and for some companies it meant that up to 20 per cent of management effort was taken up over this period in attending and preparing for the seminars and workshops. 'The main problem was the release of people,' Mr McGuinness said. 'There was always a temptation for production managers not to attend, while the whole point was precisely to get managers not normally associated with the export side of the business there and to understand their role as part of a team.' Most believed, however, that the programme represented management time well spent. Rob Zaadnoordijk, the sales director of a yacht-building firm Fripol BV near Amsterdam, said that his company had benefitted from the project. 'We are now working much more intensively on our export business,' he said. 'The EC borders are now open, so our home market is much bigger and there is much more competition. The really important thing we learned is that we have to be much more competitive.' He said the programme made clear that 'it is not enough to say we are European to be European. Each country has its own culture and own particular way of doing business'. Jan Klingeman, managing director of Spijkstaal - a Dutch company with a Fl30m annual turnover, which manufactures electric vehicles and truck bodies  -said his five-strong management team used the programme 'to find out how we can better go about getting foreign customers'. He said that while it has since taken three years to begin developing the export side of the business, it was precisely the ICDP programme that made them realise that this time was needed to prepare the company thoroughly. 'Now we are ready to go looking abroad. We have taken over another company and largely closed down another arm of the business. That has taken a lot of time. But the experience of the development programme helped us to plan more strategically and we are now better prepared to go into the export market'. The need for preparation was one of the strongest messages to come out of the programme according to Mr McGuinness. 'Costs associated with exporting are greater and profit margins are often smaller,' he said. 'Preparation is very important. Many small companies are not prepared sufficiently and exporting is not necessarily the best approach. If you cannot service the home market profitably it is unlikely you will have success in the export market.' A more ambitious programme undertaken in 1991 involving Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Portugal and Scotland was run over a period of 13 months instead of 18. But it was less successful according to Mr McGuinness. 'There is an exponential rise in difficulties with the number of countries participating,' he said. Organisation was more complex and participants did not interact as well, tending to stay within their own language groups, he added. Nevertheless participants reacted positively. 'It succeeded in getting everybody pointing in the same direction. We found we were not unique with our problems and it led us to take the conscious decision that we should look at the British Isles as our home market and not just Ireland,' said Tony Gillespie, marketing manager of Solids Technology, an Irish company specialising in the separation and treatment of slurry wastes. 'We also spend more time now on strategic thinking. For instance, we have decided that licensing our technology in the United States rather than exporting from Ireland is a better option because of exchange rate uncertainty and because we cannot afford to dedicate the resources that an export strategy requires,' Mr Gillespie said. John Harris, production director of Printech, an Irish company producing computer manuals was enthusiastic about the project. 'It was an excellent programme. It gave us a platform from which to understand other markets and cultures and helped us develop our middle management'. Company work practices had changed as a result, he said with more flexibility and less demarcation on production lines now than in the past. Printech now generates 10 per cent of its Pounds 20m turnover from exports. Oddly, neither of the two programmes involved any structured follow-up, a fact which most companies said would have been helpful. 'There is a wealth of knowledge out there, but not enough co-operation. The experience gained is not being fully utilised,' one manager said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Shuming (6392 2562 2494) and Zhu Nongfei </F> (2612 6593 7378) from Nanjing University's Institute of  International Business: "Impact of North American Free Trade  Zone on China's Economy and Countermeasures That We Should Take"  -- First paragraph is SHIJIE ZHISHI's introduction and the  editor responsible for this article is Fan Xinyu (5400 2450  1342)]    [Excerpts] Forming regional groups for developing economy  and trading is a new trend for the promotion of world economy  and trading since the mid 1980's. This article analyzes the  background in the establishment of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA), the current economic and trade situation  between China and the NAFTA countries and the impact of NAFTA on  China's economy. It also proposes a development strategy that  China should adopt. [passage omitted]  <H5>  II. Establishment of NAFTA and Its Impact on China's Economy </H5>   Due to the fact that North America has always been a key  district in which China carries out its economic and trading  activities and makes investments, our nation has maintained fine  relations and close contacts with the United States, Canada and  Mexico for a long time. From Table I, we can see that the share  of China's imports and exports in this district ranks third,  only next to Hong Kong, Macao and Japan. Furthermore it also has  a fairly high rate of growth.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table I. China's Exports to World's Major Countries and Districts            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nation or D-|Hong Kong a-|Japan       |EEC         |NAFTA       |World       |  |istrict     |nd Macao    |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year        |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990        |2665006     |901103      |473045      |572038      |6209141     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |42.92|14.51|7.62|9.21|100|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991        |3213719     |1021911     |573892      |680024      |7184254     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |            |44.73|14.22|8.00|9.47|100|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: 1991 China Statistics Yearbook                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      However, following the signing of NAFTA, import duties are  eliminated, quotas abolished and production costs lowered. This  will produce a direct or indirect impact on China's economy and  its enterprises. We can see this impact from three different  angles:    A. On Sino-U.S. Trade    1. China's trading pattern to the United States is  basically unilateral. From Table II, we can see that the total  amount of China's exports to the United States has continuously  increased in recent years.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table II Share of China's Exports to the United States                    |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year          |1989          |1990          |1991          |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nation        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |USA           |338176 (7.1) |439101 (8.3) |517946 (8.3) |615851 (8.5) |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |World         |4751584 (100)|5253809 (100)|6209141 (100)|7184254 (100/|  |              |              |              |              |)             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: 1991 Yearbook of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The aforementioned percentage will be even greater if  transit  trade is also taken into consideration. Moreover, the annual  rate of growth of China's exports to the United States exceeds  that of China's total amount of exports. It has reached 20  percent, 4 percent higher than the average figure. In addition,  most of China's exports depend on the U.S. market. For example,  the rate of dependence for the service trade reaches 20.14  percent, that for toys 12.42 percent and that of cotton textile  8.13 percent. However, the average tariffs among the United  States, Canada and Mexico will drop and the volume of trade  within the free trade zone increase after the signing of NAFTA.  Particularly in Mexico where there are plenty of raw materials  and minerals, NAFTA will further reduce production costs and  help these three NAFTA nations enjoy comparative advantage  within the free trade zone. As seen from the execution of the  free trade agreement between the United States and Canada, which  went into effect in 1989, the volume of trade among the United  States, Canada and Mexico will definitely grow. Relatively  speaking, the volume of trade outside the free trade zone is  expected to drop. This is particularly true for the supply and  demand of primary products. The share of Chinese products in the  U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets is expected to decline.    2. The United States remains the main resource from which  China attracts its foreign investments. Table III shows that  except for Hong Kong, Macao and Japan, the United States ranks  top among all other countries and districts. What is more, its  rate of growth ranks top among all the nations, exceeding Hong  Kong, Macao and Japan. It accounts for 13.31 percent of the  negotiated foreign investments in China. However, after the  signing of NAFTA, investments from any country outside the free  trade zone in the other two NAFTA countries will enjoy the  national treatment [of the third NAFTA country]. In addition,  the NAFTA nations will make more direct investments in each  other's territories. Especially Mexico needs a large amount of  construction funds. It also shares a long boundary line with the  United States. This will attract more U.S. factories and  businessmen to make investments and run factories in Mexico,  causing a shift of investments and eventually affecting China's  attraction of foreign investments.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table III. Amount of Negotiated Foreign Investments in China              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nation        |Hong Kong and |Japan         |U.S.          |World         |  |              |Macao         |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988          |209520 (65.61|51453 (16.11)|24198 (7.58) |319368 (100) |  |              |)             |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989          |207759 (61.24|35634 (10.50)|30122 (8.88) |339257 (100) |  |              |)             |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990          |191342 (54.87|50338 (14.44)|46403(13.31) |348771 (100) |  |              |)             |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Same as Table II                                                  |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      From this table, we believe that the signing of NAFTA will  affect China's foreign trade, its attraction of foreign  investments, its import of technology from abroad and its  trading and investments.    B. On Sino-Mexican Economic Relations and Trading    1. As seen from the trade pattern, the main exports from  Mexico to the United States include fish, fruits, coffee,  petroleum, chemicals, products made of metallic materials,  clothing, electronic parts and transport equipment. This kind of  export mix is similar to China's export mix to the United  States. It is mainly composed of labor-intensive products. The  signing of NAFTA is of great disadvantage to China's exports.  Let us take cotton textile and clothing as an example in the  following table:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table IV. Cotton Textile and Clothing Exported From China to World's Major C-|  |ountries and Districts ()                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |Year        |Hong Kong   |Japan       |NAFTA       |Others      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cotton Text-|1990        |24.92       |11.99       |15.71       |47.38       |  |iles        |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |1991        |36.33       |14.67       |15.87       |33.13       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Clothing    |1990        |31.09       |18.31       |22.98       |27.62       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |1991        |39.05       |16.98       |19.62       |24.35       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Same as Table II                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      From this table, we can see that the share of China's cotton  textiles and clothing exported to the North American Free Trade  Zone is 15.87 percent and 19.62 percent respectively which are  considerably large. After the signing of NAFTA, some of China's  share on the North American market will be replaced by NAFTA  nations (particularly Mexico). Moreover, it is not likely that  China will be able to shift its export of cotton textiles and  clothing to other markets due to limitation of the tariffs and  the quota system. Therefore, China will face a fierce challenge.  Furthermore, Mexico is located at the center of the North  American market. It has maintained traditional ties with the  United States. It is a country with a strong industrial  foundation with which foreign investors often attain higher  profits from their investments. As a NAFTA nation, Mexico enjoys  preferential treatments which make its products much more  competitive.    2. Due to the fact that NAFTA nations ordinarily enjoy  national treatment in making direct investments in each other's  territory, they may shift their investments in non-NAFTA nations  to NAFTA nations. This is of disadvantage to China's attraction  of foreign investments and its opening-up policy.    3. Because of the signing of NAFTA, various countries  (particularly the third world nations) will make investments to  run factories in Mexico in the hope to enter the two major  markets in the United States and Canada through Mexico. This  will become a strong external barrier to China's enterprises in  entering the Mexican market and the U.S. market via Mexico.    C. On Sino-Canadian Economic and Trade Relations    Canada is the largest trade partner of the United States.  However, Canada's exports have already reached 18 percent of the  total volume of U.S. imports. Moreover, the average of tariff  rate between the two countries is only 3.5 percent, while some  of the products are already duty-free on the basis of the  U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement which went into effect in  1989. Therefore, it is not likely that people would favor  Canadian products more because of the elimination or further  reduction of tariffs. Thus, there will be little effect on any  third nation to take action for "trade diversion."    On the other hand, by comparing what China exports to the  United States with Canadian products, we can see that China's  exports to the United States are mainly composed of clothing,  woodwork, rubber products, shoes, porcelain and other  labor-intensive products, while Canadian exports to the United  States are mainly composed of auto-parts, foodstuff, raw  materials and automobiles. The comparative earnings of the  Canadian exports are on automobiles, auto-parts and its abundant  natural resources. Therefore, there are not much products  exported by China to the United States that are duplicating  Canadian exports. Thus the impact of the NAFTA is not so sharp  on China as far as Canada is concerned.  <H5>  III. Development Strategy That China Should Adopt </H5>   On the basis of the aforementioned analysis, China should  adopt the following development strategy to promote its export  business, trade and overseas investments in light of the  establishment of NAFTA:    1. Due to the fact that the United States has always been  China's major trade partner for a long time, China should  continue to expand its export market in the United States,  promote its trade whenever possible and avoid shifting its  investments. Many people blame China's difficulties in expanding  its exports to the United States on U.S. trade protectionism.  This view is subjective and unfair. If we judge the situation on  the basis of the indexes such as the average tariff rate, the  percentage of import restrictions and the rate of market  penetration by imports, U.S. trade protectionism is still not so  severe among the developed countries, particularly in its trade  with the developing nations. Although the United States  practices trade protectionism in automobile, textile and shoe  industries, it is quite common that some quotas have not been  fully used up for some of the products now placed under  protection. Meantime, the U.S. market is the largest one in the  world. During the 1980's it has absorbed about 40 percent of the  products turned out by developing countries, about one-fifth of  the total exports of these countries. At the same time, we  should carry out multilateral cooperation with U.S.  transnational companies at different levels, and encourage such  companies to make direct investments in China to manufacture  products which we must produce with high marginal costs or buy  import substitutes at all times. While letting such companies  have access to a part of our market, we must strive to gain  access to their U.S. sales channels and use their influence to  increase the volume of our exports to the United States.    2. As seen from the situation in Canada, our enterprises  should energetically increase their exports to Canada. According  to statistics compiled by a department concerned, Canada has  always had a trade surplus with China. We may try to increase  our exports to Canada through bilateral trade talks between the  two countries. Naturally we must also make sure that our own  enterprises understand what the Canadian consumers need and turn  out more products that cater to the needs of the Canadian people.    3. In addition to increasing our exports to the United  States and Canada, we should also make use of our available high  technology to make direct investments in the United States and  Canada. We may invest in the United States and Canada to  manufacture high-tech products and those products that are not  so easy to copy or imitate. We may also manufacture, in Mexico,  those products that we will be able to produce by using the  local cheap labor such as clothing, shoes and light industrial  products. The main objective is to acquire high technology and  avoid tariff barriers. It is quite difficult for an investment  enterprise to acquire high technology on the market, because  high technology is often protected by intellectual property  rights. By making direct investments, it is relatively easy for  any investment enterprise to acquire such technology. Our  experience shows that the proceeds of such investment are often  higher than the actual investment cost. Also, direct investment  is a more effective method to avoid paying high customs duties.  By making direct investments in the United States and Canada, we  will increase our ability in "market penetration." Once we gain  a strong hold in these two countries, it will be quite easy to  export our products to Mexico and other Latin American countries  through the North American Free Trade Zone. Naturally the  production costs are high in these two areas. Therefore, we must  select high-tech industries to make our investments.    4. In addition, we cannot pay attention to the United States  and Canada only. We should also realize that Mexico will become  China's new trading partner. With the establishment of NAFTA,  Mexico will become a place contested by the strategists from all  the countries in the world. The entrepreneurs in China should  seize this favorable opportunity as soon as possible to build  their own base areas in Mexico as a springboard to enter the  United States and Canada. Considering the actual situation among  our enterprises and the characteristics of the North American  Free Trade Zone, we can see that there are two types of  enterprises which will become our main force in entering the  North American Free Trade Zone. One type of enterprises  comprises large and medium-sized industrial enterprises or  enterprise groups in the manufacturing industry and the textile  industry. After accumulating experiences and absorbing imported  technology for the past several years, most of these enterprises  and enterprise groups have become large in size and advanced in  technology. However, their further development is restricted by  the saturated domestic market and the dwindling natural  resources. All this forces them to compete with other countries  on the international market. Another type of enterprises  comprises large and medium-sized enterprises in trading and  service trades including trading companies of all kinds of  specialties. They have been doing import and export businesses  for a long time, and they are predominant in handling business  transactions and making full use of their financial resources.  If they are given preferential treatments by the government,  they can quickly enter the United States, Mexico and Canada on a  large scale. They may also enter Mexico in the form of joint  ventures or cooperative enterprises, because the economies in  China and Mexico are complementary to a greater extent, and  there are many opportunities to cooperate with each other.  Furthermore, Mexico does not demand very high standards for  engineering goods. It is also comparatively flexible in  conducting performance and quality tests. Its standards are  similar to those of China for its export products. This will  provide Chinese products and enterprises an excellent  opportunity to enter the Mexican market.    5. When China's multinational enterprises select the  Mexican market as a springboard to enter the U.S. and Canadian  markets, they should pay attention to the following issues. One  is the issue on the point of origin. In an effort to prevent any  third country from using Mexico as a "springboard" to sell its  goods in the United States, America has joined Mexico and Canada  in formulating strict rules and regulations on the place of  origin to guard against the import of such goods. As for those  sensitive goods such as textile products, the United States may  possibly limit their imports by imposing a certain quota.  According to the NAFTA provisions, foreign products are duty  free only when more than 50 percent of the production cost of  such foreign goods are from U.S. and Canadian sources. Another  issue is that we cannot regard the Mexican market as a  springboard for transit trade. Nor should we concentrate all our  efforts in transit trade only. This will prevent us from  improving our production quality and increasing varieties. We  should regard the Mexican market as our major market and the  needs of the U.S. and Canadian markets as our guidance to  manufacture our products to satisfy the needs of the consumers  there. We should also provide better services before, during and  after the sales. Only by doing so will it be possible for us to  open up the U.S. and Canadian markets.    6. When attempts are being made to set up factories in the  North American Free Trade Zone, the Chinese government should  energetically support the banking industry to establish branches  there to directly serve Chinese multinational corporations. The  government should also provide long-term low-interest loans to  support large- and medium-sized enterprises to make investments  there. It must help these enterprises in various ways to  understand the local investment climate and political geography  as well as the local policies, laws, taxes and cultural  background. It should promptly supply them with various business  information and forecasts and make things convenient for the  staff members of the multinational corporations to go abroad on  business trips.    7. Regional economic integration has become a trend of world  development. While seeking to join multilateral trade  organizations such as the GATT, China must energetically help  develop the regional economy or organize its own regional trade  group. Recently some people put forward the concept of "economic  China." This merits our attention. That is aimed at combining  the production factors of Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Macao such as the mainland's science and technology and cheap  labor, Taiwan's financial resources and technology, and the  experiences of Hong Kong and Macao in banking, service trade and  market economy; reducing man-made obstacles among the three  sectors; and enhancing mutual understanding and trust to work  hard for the economic interests of all the Chinese and contend  with the world's various major regional blocs.</p>

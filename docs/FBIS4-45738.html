			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank today  approved a credit of 150 million U.S. dollars to help restore  China's heavily eroded loess plateau and lift 1.2 million people  out of poverty.    The bank said that soil erosion has made China's loess  plateau "something like the surface of the moon," and that per  capita income there is only about 35 to 50 dollars a year.    The bank said the project seeks to tackle the issue of  poverty and the environment at the same time and is expected to  increase grain production by 50 percent and fruit production by  400 percent.    "The little rainfall the people get will be kept for crops  and trees, where now it just runs off," said the bank's project  manager Juergen Voegele.    "They will also be able to convert highly eroded areas to  production, utilize river beds and move away from unproductive  and unsustainable planting on sloping hillsides," he said.    The total cost of the project is close to 250 million  dollars.</p>

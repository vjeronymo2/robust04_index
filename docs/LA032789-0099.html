			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REAGAN WON'T TESTIFY FRIDAY BUT MAY BE CALLED LATER, JUDGE SAYS  </P> <P> The judge at Oliver L. North's trial ruled today that Ronald Reagan won't  appear Friday as the defense's first witness but he held open the possibility  that the former President might be called later.  </P> <P> In a two-page order, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell directed North's  lawyers to file "a succinct particularized statement of facts" that North  "desires to elicit from President Reagan." Gesell said the defense should file  that under seal by late Wednesday afternoon. The prosecution won't be permitted  to see it.  </P> <P> "There is insufficient time to resolve the pending questions relating to  President Reagan's personal appearance to contemplate his appearance by Friday,  March 31, as requested," Gesell said.  </P></p>

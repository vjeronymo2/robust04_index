			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The framework conditions for  the Bundeswehr are worse, according to Alfred Biehle, the  Bundestag commissioner for the armed forces. This applied in  particular to the financial framework, Biehle said, as he  presented his annual report for 1993 to journalists in Bonn  today. Politics had left the soldiers uncertain about how much  money the Bundeswehr would finally have at its disposal. There  was also still no constitutional consensus on foreign missions  by the Bundeswehr.    With regard to the German UN missions in Somalia and  Cambodia, the Christian Social Union politician added that  "despite all the problems in the starting up period," an  "excellent service" had been provided. Given the ever growing  spectrum of tasks and the reductions in money, however, the  Bundeswehr was being forced into an "involuntary balancing act."  This had had "extremely negative" effects on the morale and the  confidence of the soldiers. [passage omitted]</p>

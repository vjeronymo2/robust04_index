			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian </F> President's Administration, by correspondent Sergey Medvedev;  place and date not given; from the "Novosti" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Medvedev] Sergey Aleksandrovich, the president is  having a rest. Does that mean that the president's office is  resting as well? I know that many of the president's aides are  also resting or undergoing treatment -- Kostikov, Ryurikov,  Ilyushin -- none of them are in the Kremlin. Who is in charge  of the state in the president's absence?    [Filatov] Well, firstly, the president himself is in charge,  because as you know he went, as he said, both to rest and to  work. He is indeed working every day. Every day we receive  signed decrees and orders from him, various instructions. Every  day we speak to him on the telephone and consult him on various  issues. So firstly, he has the entire situation in the country  in hand. But the prime minister and the government are working,  and naturally the president's office and administration are  working as well. So we are all working.    [Medvedev] At the moment a second wave of rumors seems to be  spreading. In the corridors of the State Duma, for example,  these rumors were whipped up fairly actively on Friday. They  concern Boris Nikolayevich's health. Do you speak to him often  by telephone? Because people are even saying that the president  nearly came back to Moscow in secret.    [Filatov] One of the unpleasant features or actions of the  opposition that I have clearly perceived over the last two years  at least, has been to inflate the question of the president's  health, and especially to raise this question at the moment when  the president is on vacation. And sometimes, I have a suspicion  that these people want above all else to wreck his vacation --  to summon him back early from vacation, for example, or just to  spoil his mood on vacation.    I would like to make use of your camera to say: Give the  president a chance to rest. He is a human being too, and he has  a right to rest for 10 days or so twice a year, and to rest in  peace and quiet, so that he is not tormented by these entirely  superfluous and unnecessary suspicions being blown up. I can  understand why -- in order to create an atmosphere of  nervousness in society. In this instance, I think that if  society is driven into such a nervous state with the help of  such rumors, it could result in some sort of disruption. Well,  we have had enough disruptions.    Naturally, everyone feels a certain anxiety about the way  our  reforms will go in the future. But nevertheless, let us hope we  can go on without any of those upheavals, which unfortunately,  certain forces are trying to lead us into. You see, they are  deliberately trying to remind us of those events, suggesting  that they have thought up a new way to do everything in Russia.    But I think that if we do indeed proceed from civic accord,  if we proceed from the fact that we want to achieve something as  a society, I think we should get through the year all right.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Logic chopping Iraq, the glorious victor of the Gulf war in the eyes of its president at least, has now turned its Baghdad logic on the recession in the west. Iraqi leaders are arguing that General Motors' decision to lay off 74,000 of its workers is the result of the economic embargo against Baghdad. 'The sanctions work both ways,' says trade minister Mohammed Mehdi Salegh. 'They have forced General Motors, for example, to lay off workers and lose business.' His reasoning is that under a 1989 deal worth Dollars 500m, GM was to set up a plant in Iraq to assemble 90,000 vehicles a year, which of course hasn't happened. Hence GM's cuts. Next: how western pressure against Iraq cost New Zealand's cricketers the test series.</p>

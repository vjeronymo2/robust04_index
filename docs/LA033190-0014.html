			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH BANS BROCCOLI  </P> <P> I don't understand all the concern that America's children aren't going to eat  their broccoli simply because President Bush doesn't eat his. As vice  president, Bush couldn't keep the broccoli off his plate; he had to become  President to do that. So the message is clear: The only way to avoid eating  broccoli is to become President.  </P> <P> STAN SEAVEY  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Sopoci: "What Will a Year Bring?"] </F>   [Text] According to many a political observer, this year  the crystallization of our political scene in the form of the  "definitive" incorporation of the "broad-spectrum" Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] is to become a decisive factor. In  the face of increasing "unification" of the activities of the  chairman of the HZDS and his most faithful followers, the  disintegration of this movement continues, and many politicians  from the opposition parties have long since counted on it. Some  of them connect their ambitions regarding the taking over of  political power with this disintegration; some of them promise  themselves primarily the augmentation and the strengthening of  their ranks by defectors from V. Meciar, who are part of the  stream having similar political orientations. Of course, they  also connect this with the subsequent increase in support on the  part of those citizens who, as they figure, will also shift over  to the camp of their supporters. Such ambitions, for example,  are not being concealed by the AD SR [Alliance of Slovak  Democrats], the Zalovo wing of the SDSS [Social Democratic Party  in Slovakia], and other political entities.    I believe that, even if such an "inclination" among possible  defectors from the HZDS were to come about, this would not  necessarily automatically result in a gain for these parties or  an improvement in their standings. It is not even clear whether  these renegades might not represent almost a burden for them. It  should be remembered, for example, that the press was very  critical of the politicians of the AD SR for having several  times changed their party shirts and for exerting harsh  criticism today of their former allies and friends, but mostly  it should be recalled that the attitude of the majority of our  citizenry with respect to such politicians is similarly critical  and even repudiative. And even the Slovak citizenry, much like  some of the Slovak politicians, is clearly and gradually  maturing politically.    A look at our most recent history, in which citizens  gradually, on a massive scale and very definitively, rejected  several political teams that failed to fulfill their  expectations, can be instructive. Currently, the citizenry is  beginning to ever more reject the government of the HZDS (and  part of the SNS [Slovak National Party]) and all that which is  somehow connected with it. Political stigmatization, which was  fanned and utilized by all of our post-November governments, has  become a firm part of our sociopolitical reality and has, as  always, first acted to benefit the holders of power and,  subsequently, worked to their disadvantage. For example, much  like some time ago, the political labeling of opponents acted to  the benefit of the HZDS (ranging from those favoring the VPN  [Public Against Violence] to being called members of the StB  [secret police], and ranging through being labeled as followers  of "clerical powers"); today, the majority of our citizens react  negatively to the label "Meciar follower" or "former Meciar  follower."    Clearly, all of our politicians are well aware of this  "stigmatization effect," but not all of them take it into  account equally. Some long ago closed the gates of their parties  against stigmatized politicians (stigmatized as a result of  political excesses and political collaboration) and some,  especially those who have no other choice, are willing to  continue accepting them. But it seems that those political  parties that are attempting to profile themselves as being  definitive or even choosy are experiencing a long-term rise.  This year will clearly show whether this is part of the  developmental trend moving from the image of a political scene  determined by "broad-spectrum movements," "broad streams," etc.,  toward a scene that is replete with clearly defined and rankable  political parties on the basis of European criteria. Slovakia  would truly deserve such.</p>

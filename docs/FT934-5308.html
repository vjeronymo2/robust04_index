			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Progress is patchy - William Keeling looks at obstacles to privatisation Along with its commitment to a free market, investors might have expected the Vietnamese government to undertake a programme to privatise state-owned enterprises. But after expressions of intent in 1991 progress toward privatisation has been piecemeal. Companies that investors might wish to buy are not for sale and many of those on offer have been withdrawn. The tale of two companies in Ho Chi Minh City - Saigon Brewery, Vietnam's dominant beer producer, and Legamex, a garment and footwear manufacturer - provide an insight into the operations of state industry and the obstacles to privatisation, or 'equitisation', as the government call it. Among the most striking aspects of economic liberalisation has been the energetic response of some state companies to greater competition. Production at Saigon Brewery, owned by the Ministry of Light Industry, has risen from 72m litres in 1991 to a forecast 110m litres this year, accounting for one-third of Vietnam's total beer production. 'It's the difference between a centralised economy and a market economy,' says Ngac Van Giau, the brewery's vice-director. It is also, he admits, the result of a Dollars 23m programme to refurbish the plant. A bottling line purchased from Germany and new fermentation equipment have reduced losses from 12 per cent of production to 1 per cent. The company financed the refurbishment from internal resources and is one of Vietnam's largest tax payers, Mr Giau says. Saigon Brewery expects to pay the state 542bn dong in taxes this year, up from 165bn dong in 1991. How profitable the company is remains unclear. Its accounting system carries the legacy of the command economy with the emphasis on turnover. Salaries are paid according to production, not profitability. Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a private sector economist, says the accounting method of state enterprises 'is all wrong. Depreciation has never been taken into account'. Nevertheless, most businessmen agree that Saigon Brewery would have to pour beer down the drain to lose money. The industry has, not surprisingly, drawn the attention of foreign investors but the government has limited entry to the sector, described by Nguyen Mai, vice-chairman of the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment (SCCI), as 'extremely profitable'. While some early applicants received SCCI approval, further investment in the beer industry must now be vetted by the prime minister's office. As for Saigon Brewery, it is not on the list of companies waiting to be privatised. As Mr Giau explains, privatisation only 'applies to businesses which are not profitable'. Legamex, on the other hand, is slated for privatisation and is touted as one of Vietnam's best managed state enterprises. Yet after two years of wearing the For Sale tag, the company remains in state hands and the prospects for privatisation are receding. In a sprightly piece of research in 1991, Credit Lyonnais Securities described Legamex's garment operations as a 'Win-Win' business. Since then, the company, which is owned by the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Light Industry, has suffered a serious setback with a tight export quota being placed on its principal product, jackets. In 1992, Legamex exported 1.7m jackets to Germany; this year its quota for the entire European Union has been set at 475,000 pieces. The company, which also has embroidery and leather goods divisions, has tried to switch production to shirts but rows of sewing machines lie dormant. 'When the government informed us of the quota, we were very upset,' says Nguyen Thi Son, Legamex chairman. The company, which had not anticipated the quota restrictions, found itself with excess stocks of materials and finished products. Mrs Son is optimistic that the company will be privatised but problems remain. The most immediate is negotiation over a Dollars 12m seven-year loan, taken in 1991, from International Investment Bank (IIB), a consortium of 12 banks from former eastern bloc countries. Mrs Son believes a repayment of 40 cents to the dollar could be negotiated. But Legamex is one of six state companies with IIB loans and the government wishes to negotiate collective repayment at 20 cents to the dollar, she says. Legamex's interest payments on the loan totalled 12bn dong last year, reducing profits before tax to just 2bn dong on turnover of 126bn dong. The company anticipates similar figures this year. Given the small profit, foreign investors 'are not interested in taking over the entire company. They're interested in taking over bits', leaving the loss making divisions in state ownership, says one European banker. But the biggest obstacle to privatisation may be political. A recent press campaign, backed by government labour unions, has accused Legamex executives of corruption and nepotism. Businessmen in Ho Chi Minh City say Mrs Son's enthusiasm for privatisation is proving unpopular with local government officials. 'Privatisation was never going to be easy in this country,' a banker explains. Opposition is in part ideological - some communist sentiment remains - but mostly springs from self-interest, he says. State employees in inefficient companies oppose privatisation for fear of losing their jobs. At better-run enterprises, managers and workers are benefiting from the profits - either through official profit-sharing schemes, or by means of unofficial payments. They feel privatisation would dilute their income. Few companies, therefore, are willing to leave the state's embrace.</p>

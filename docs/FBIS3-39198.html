			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Senate Ratifying Treaty With </F> Suriname"]    [Excerpt] The Hague -- Development Aid Minister Pronk  expects that the Netherlands and Suriname will soon settle their  disputes about the increase of development aid.    He told so in the Senate last night. The Senate ratified the  framework treaty, which strengthens the ties between the  Netherlands and Suriname in the fields of legal, military,  diplomatic, cultural, and aid policies.    However, Pronk demands from the Suriname Government that a  Structural Adjustment Program be implemented shortly. As far as  the verification procedures are concerned, the minister says  that they can be discussed with Suriname. Pronk also says that  the restoration of the balance of payments aid which was  suspended by the Netherlands in June last year without any prior  consultation, can only be considered if an international  financial institution supervises Suriname's progress with the  Adjustment Program. Pronk hopes that he can still reach an  agreement with Suriname on the increase of aid before the  elections. [passage omitted]</p>

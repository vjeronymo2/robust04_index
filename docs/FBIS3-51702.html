She added  that she simply went there to listen to opinions on his  candidacy. Minister Sanin pointed out that President Gaviria  will take the time necessary to make a decision on the issue.  She abstained from commenting on possible support from the  nations of the region for his candidacy.    "I did not go there to request votes, nor to count them, but  to make consultations. We enjoy broad support because our  president is admired, well-liked, and his international  leadership ability is recognized. Although this is not the  decisive factor, President Gaviria stays calm," she said.    Sanin added that she is totally at peace with herself. She  said that she is glad that she listened to opinions and is proud  that she worked to ensure Colombia's chance to reach the OAS  secretary generalship, which is the most important organization  in the region. "Any serious country would do the same through  its foreign ministry," she underscored. She added that she is  very optimistic about the results of her tour, but President  Gaviria has the last word.    Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Relations Minister Jose Raul  Mulino said yesterday, upon his arrival in Colombia, that his  country cannot support Gaviria's candidacy for the post of OAS  secretary general because it already pledged its vote to the  Costa Rican candidate. Mulino added that his government only has  words of thanks and admiration for the Colombian president,  whose foreign policies were praised.</p>

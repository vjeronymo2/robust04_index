			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended allowing 45 days for correction of deficiencies in the plan. One other comment recommended a 60-day period for reapproval of the plan. The time period allowed for submitting plan revisions has been changed from within 45 days of receipt of the notice. Revisions are to be resubmitted within the required time period specified in the written notice. Although the time period for resubmission will normally be 45 days, this time period could be lengthened by the Coast Guard when extensive revisions are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six comments addressed where the plans should be sent for review and approval. Four of the comments specifically stated that the review process should take place at Coast Guard Headquarters. The other two comments suggested that any single entity perform the review. The bases for their suggestions are for consistency in review, to avoid misinterpretation of the regulations, and to avoid the confusion and varying levels of quality that a multiple-authority review system would cause. The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments. Therefore, &sect;&sect;151.27 and 151.28 have been revised to reflect that all plans will be submitted to Commandant (G&hyph;MEP&hyph;6) at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. As a result of this decision, the Coast Guard has changed the final rule to require only one copy of the plan to be submitted to Headquarters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment noted that this section should be modified to clarify how operators can submit amendments to their existing OPA 90 VRP to satisfy these requirements. The provisions for amending existing vessel response plans are located in 33 CFR section 155.1070. One other comment recommended charging a fee of $55.00 for the review of response plans to recover the Federal Government's costs associated with the implementation of this rule. Imposition of a ``user fee'' is outside the scope of this rulemaking. It may be separately addressed in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Plan Review and Revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four comments addressed a specific time limit for plan review or revision. One of these comments noted that a time limit for submission of revisions or amendments should be in place. The Coast Guard finds that the requirements in &sect;151.28, that the review must occur within 1 month of the anniversary date of Coast Guard approval of the plan, establishes a time limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that the 5-year approval period for the plan seems excessive. It suggested that the regulations should require notification to the Coast Guard within 3 months of implementing any changes to the plan, but that the approval should continue indefinitely. The 5-year approval expiration date was selected to align with the VRP requirements. The Coast Guard has determined that an indefinite approval is not possible. The Coast Guard finds that the plan validity needs to be evaluated at least every 5 years. Therefore, the Coast Guard concludes that the 5-year plan approval expiration date will remain and a formal request must be made to the Coast Guard at that time for reapproval of the existing plan or approval of a new plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments opposed the requirement to submit an annual letter to the Coast Guard certifying that the review has been completed. Two comments supported the review, but viewed the letter as unnecessary. Further, one of the comments stated that the Coast Guard should only require the owner or operator to perform the annual review. They contended that this would minimize unnecessary paperwork. The other comment suggested that rather than just requiring a review and a letter to the Coast Guard, a requirement that the letter highlight alterations needed to the plan and discuss any spill incidents occurring within the past year should be added to this section of the regulation. Additionally, one comment stated that the annual review letter should be more specific and summarize spill incidents and identify the preventive measures taken. The Coast Guard has determined that receiving an annual letter certifying that the annual review has been completed helps keep the Coast Guard abreast of plan revisions on a yearly basis. The Coast Guard opposes requiring additional information because it might create an unnecessary burden for shipowners or operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

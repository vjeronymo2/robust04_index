			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, chief of the  Jordanian delegation to the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, has  said that today's meeting of the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli economic  committee aims at getting acquainted with the stands of the  Israeli side vis-a-vis the topics on the Jordanian agenda signed  on 14 September. In a telephone interview conducted by  AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-Tarawinah said: We will not concede any of our  rights. We want to make progress and achieve a qualitative step  forward in the talks in accordance with the agenda and the point  of reference for the peace process. The principles and  constants will remain unchanged, and we will continue to adhere  to the principle of comprehensive solution.    Dr. al-Tarawinah, who is also Jordan's ambassador in  Washington, noted that the achievement of or failure to achieve  progress in these talks depends on what the Israeli side will  present, particularly since the Jordanian stands are declared  and firm and we have Jordanian and Arab rights to which we  adhere.    The chief Jordanian delegate added: Jordan's stand vis-a-vis  the bilateral and multilateral talks has always been clear and  candid. We reduced the Jordanian participation in the peace  talks and our condition to return to the talks was to lift the  siege of al-'Aqabah. Now that this issue has ended and the  American side has announced its agreement on the Jordanian  proposals to this effect -- except for some administrative and  formal problems -- nothing now prevents the participation in and  return to these talks, especially since Jordan has not suspended  its participation in the multilateral talks but set conditions  for its return.    Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the return to the  Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks is also based on Jordan's  adherence to and linkage with the concept of comprehensive  solution, particularly since this includes comprehensive  Jordanian and Arab rights. Jordan has its own issues and rights  and now it is time to move toward the Jordanian facts,  constants, and pillars. These Jordanian rights are part of the  Arab rights and issues.    The joint tripartite committee, which will hold its first  meeting today, 6 June, comes after the last round [of bilateral  talks] which was held last February. The Jordanian delegation,  which is led Dr. al-Tarawinah, also includes Michel Marto,  deputy of the Central Bank of Jordan; Dr. Safwan Tuqan,  secretary general of the Planning Ministry; and Dr. Mundher  Haddadin, chief of the Jordanian delegation to the water  committee in the multilateral talks.</p>

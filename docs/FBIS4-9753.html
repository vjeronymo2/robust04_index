			<p>CSO     [Text] The standing committees of the Chamber of Deputies  were established definitively yesterday when the speaker of the  house, Carmelo Lauria, approved their makeup.    The speaker asserted that with the establishment of these  committees "Congress will start to work at full capacity and  must greatly improve its legislative efforts."    The formation of the working committees had been paralyzed  by  the political controversy that arose when their chairmen were to  be appointed. This controversy prompted the first political  crisis of the new Congress and created great confusion among the  public.    The following is a list of the committee chairmen and the  party to which they belong:    Domestic Policy: Enrique Ochoa Antich, Movement Toward  Socialism (MAS) Foreign Policy: German Monzon, Convergence  Defense: Ibrahim Sanchez, COPEI [Social Christian Party]  Economy: Gonzalo Perez Hernandez, National Integrity  Movement-Convergence Comptrollership: Paulina Gamus, Democratic  Action (AD) Finance: Gustavo Tarre Briceno, COPEI Agriculture:  Amilcar Aponte, AD Mass Media: Manuel Isidro Molina, MAS  Tourism: Ixora Rojas, AD Environment and Land Use: Cesar Perez  Vivas, COPEI Youth, Recreation, and Sports: Vladimir Petit,  COPEI Administration and Services: Aristides Hospedales, AD  Against the Improper Use of Drugs: Luis Emilio Rondon, AD Energy  and Mines: Ali Rodriguez, Cause R. Education: Pablo Gonzalez, AD  Culture: Jose Albornoz, Cause R. Science and Technology: Lelis  Paez, Cause R. Social Affairs: Victor Moreno, Cause R. Health:  Luis Parodi, COPEI Neighborhood Affairs: Alberto Salcedo, Cause  R. Regional Development: Emilio Lopez, COPEI Planning: Julio  Castillo, MAS    Lauria emphasized that this time the committees are more  pluralistic as their chairmen and deputy chairmen belong to  different political forces. Traditionally, both were from the  same party, which in practice meant that the deputy chairman was  merely the chairman's alternate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] French troops have launched their operation to  save the people threatened with massacre in Rwanda, from their  rear base on the border in Zairian territory. On the line,  right away, we have our special correspondents on the French  side and in the heart of the Rwandan capital, Kigali.  Furthermore, the only journalist on the spot there is the  France-2 journalist, Laurent Boussie. [passage omitted]    I am now going to talk to the only journalist still in  Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, Laurent Boussie. Laurent, you  are in the heart of the country, in Kigali, and this morning a  fearsome offensive is being carried out by the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front], the rebels, who clearly wish to take complete  control of the city very rapidly. Laurent?    [Boussie] Yes, Daniel. Last night there was a very big  offensive, a very big artillery barrage here in Kigali. The  artillery barrage ended at about 0700 or 0730 this morning and  the offensive appears to have resumed at about 1100.    At this time there is heavy fighting in the city. There is  very heavy fighting around the Red Cross hospital, where all of  the medical staff are sheltering. A shell even landed on the  room where the wounded undergo triage. We have no news at this  time of the number of people hurt, but it appears in fact -- and  it is rare for an operation to be taking place in the middle of  the day, for it to begin in the morning -- it appears that this  is perhaps not the final assault, but in any case it is a very  big offensive, only halted from time to time by the weariness of  the men and the lack of ammunition, because the logistic  channels for bringing in weapons are experiencing quite a lot of  difficulty.    [Announcer] Laurent Boussie, you are in the company of the  RPF forces, the RPF being the rebels who are opposed to French  intervention. Have they referred to the beginning of the  operation by the French forces?    [Boussie] This morning the RPF organized a demonstration --  there were about 2,500 people demonstrating against the French  presence -- at which President Mitterrand was called a traitor,  a killer, etc. So, you see, they are continuing to demonstrate.  They are continuing to maintain the pressure against this  French intervention, which they accuse of being aimed at aiding  their enemies. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

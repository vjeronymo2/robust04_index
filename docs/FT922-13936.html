			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Costain cuts payout as losses mount FALLING prices in UK housing and commercial property led to pre-tax losses last year of Pounds 69.2m at Costain Group, the construction and mining group. The stock market had been braced for severe losses and a failure to pay a final dividend. The share price closed 1p up at 66p yesterday. The maintained interim dividend of 4.75p becomes the total, after 12.25p the previous year. Last year's pre-tax loss follows a profit of Pounds 5.5m in 1990, a fraction of the peak Pounds 91.9m made in 1988. Turnover declined from Pounds 1.49bn to Pounds 1.32bn. One of the big minuses in last year's figures was a Pounds 32.5m exceptional write-down on UK housing land, leaving a value of Pounds 65m on the remaining bank. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the running total for housing write-downs was about Pounds 70m over the past three years. He said: 'This reflects our position in the south of England, where land prices have taken one hell of a knock.' He added that if house prices fell further this year, it would lead to more provisions. A related worry was the possibility of interest rates rising. The other big exceptional loss was Pounds 34.3m on the sale of the UK commercial property portfolio in December. However, the Pounds 101m disposal price helped to reduce debt to less than Pounds 200m. Earlier in the year, borrowings were cut by a Pounds 77m rights issue. By December 30, with working capital also reduced, net debt stood at Pounds 168m compared with Pounds 311m the previous year. Gearing was cut from 85 per cent to 53 per cent. Reorganisation costs, including cutting the UK workforce by 2,000 to 5,500, led to a further Pounds 6m of exceptional charges. Operating profits fell from Pounds 63m to Pounds 27.4m, including a Pounds 12m provision for losses on the Channel tunnel contract - in line with other partners such as BICC. Interest costs of Pounds 23m, down from Pounds 32.5m, were just covered, giving a profit before exceptional items of Pounds 4.4m, compared with Pounds 30.5m. Operating losses in housing and commercial property were Pounds 14.6m, whereas a Pounds 4m profit was made in 1990. The loss per share was 37.5p, compared with earnings of 1.5p.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / West blows hot and cold on Bosnia: There is a feeling of guilt behind the latest manoeuvrings IT WAS a week that began with huffing and ended with puffing about the rapidly deteriorating situation in the former Yugoslavia. After a hectic round of conferences that started with the European Community summit in Edinburgh last weekend and ended with the Nato Council in Brussels eight days later, it was still not clear precisely what measures the international community would take to end the bloody conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. What was again underlined is that nobody is talking of military intervention in the broadest sense. Not a single western country, least of all the US, is prepared to send ground troops to Bosnia to fight at the side of the Bosnian Moslems. The use of peacekeeping troops under the umbrella of the United Nations as a protection for aid convoys, and possibly in future as a shield for any safe havens that might be created for Moslems, is as far as anyone is prepared to go. The two measures discussed over and over by ministers were proposed adoption by the UN Security Council of a resolution to 'enforce' October's flight ban over Bosnia, probably involving only deployment of military aircraft, and the lifting of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnian Moslems. The second suggestion, advocated by Turkey and the group of Islamic countries, was given short shrift. If caution won the day, it was largely thanks to expert contributions by the two co-chairmen of the Yugoslavia peace conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and the military commanders of the UN Protection Force to the one-day conference on Bosnia in Geneva last Wednesday. The 'Cy and David show', as it has come to be called, 'brought some reality and good sense to the battle front,' according to one western delegate. Mr Vance's judgment that lifting the arms embargo would only encourage delivery of more sophisticated and more destructive weapons to all the warring parties and that it could lead to a widening of the conflict throughout the Balkan region, convinced most participants and no recommendation supporting such a move was made. It was the proposed Security Council resolution enforcing the 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia that caused all the arguments, though the issue had been stripped of most of its military relevance by factual reports presented by Gen Satish Nambiar, commander-in-chief of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, and Maj-Gen Philippe Morillon, commander of UN forces in Bosnia. While the UN had monitored more than 200 violations of the flight ban, these were mostly helicopter flights carrying personnel, and no combat missions of fixed-wing aircraft had been reported, they told the ministers. Why, then, all the fuss about the need for enforcement of a ban, violations of which have been militarily insignificant? The answer is that enforcing the air exclusion zone by attacking airfields and shooting down Bosnian Serb aircraft has acquired a symbolic importance for an international community desperate to show it is prepared to 'do something' while still unwilling to contemplate full military intervention. That feeling of guilt about the world's failure to stop the aggression and the appalling atrocities committed in Bosnia also explains the great emphasis placed by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, on the need to bring those responsible for humanitarian crimes to trial by an international war crimes tribunal. Some countries have detected a bitter irony in the fact that a nation like Britain, which has taken a leading role in so many wars over the past century, remains deeply reluctant to endorse, let alone to participate in even such a limited military air operation as the one now under consideration by the UN. They have contrasted the extreme concern shown by the government for the safety of the 2,400 troops of the Cheshire Regiment in Bosnia with the comparative insouciance exhibited by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher in despatching troops to fight in sparsely-inhabited islands in the South Atlantic. The conclusion that the British government's cautious attitude is not unconnected with its slim parliamentary majority and the fact that it has had enough troubles recently without adding a foreign war to the list, has been drawn by several diplomatic observers at last week's meetings. Yet it is equally clear that the validity of some of the cautionary arguments deployed by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has been acknowledged by many delegates, including Mr Eagleburger. Long before Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbian leader, sent his letter to prime minister John Major threatening retaliatory action against UN forces if military measures were used to enforce the air exclusion zone over Bosnia, Mr Hurd had repeatedly warned his colleagues that such a step could endanger the safety of UN troops and international aid workers. His contention that the whole humanitarian aid operation could be undermined, received eloquent confirmation from Mr Eagleburger, who said that humanitarian aid might have to be suspended 'hopefully for only a short period' if measures to enforce the 'no-fly' zone were implemented, presumably to ensure the safety of aid workers. What has emerged clearly during the talks of the past week is that there is no consensus even among France's western allies on the content of the enforcement resolution it intends to table in the Security Council next week, though Nato countries have undertaken to support any UN enforcement measures if the resolution is adopted. Nor is it a good augury that both Russia and China are reported to be considering the possibility of vetoing such a resolution. If that happened, it would end the exceptional post-cold war period of co-operation that has given the UN such a central role in international peacekeeping.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- Federal  Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian Democratic  Union) and Federico Pena, his U.S. counterpart, signed the new  air traffic agreement between the United States and Germany in  Frankfurt am Main today. The accord makes possible the agreed  cooperation between Lufthansa and the American airline United  Airlines, which will give the German airline considerably more  opportunities in the United States than previously. "With the  new agreement, charter and air freight traffic will from today  be almost totally liberalized," Wissmann stressed.    The agreement guarantees fair and just competition between  the companies themselves and with rivals from other countries,  Wissmann explained. With the agreement, the German Government  wants to assume a leading role in bringing about free-market  conditions in international air traffic worldwide. Every effort  will be made jointly to win over other states to the idea of a  new air traffic "open sky" order without restrictions. The U.S.  transportation secretary spoke of "general interest" in the  agreement. The agreement is not only in the interests of the  airlines, but it will also give the customer better services and  scope for travel, Pena stressed. [passage omitted]    According to Lufthansa, the most important part of the  cooperation is the joint flights, which begin on 1 June and for  which bookings have been taken under joint flight numbers since  9 May. These code-sharing rights allow Lufthansa, for example,  to offer flights to all U.S. airports, even if the passengers  change planes and have to complete the final part of the journey  on an American airline. In return, as of June United Airlines  can offer domestic German Lufthansa connections under their own  flight number. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Benetton-led move changes shape of Italian retailing The shape of the Italian stores market will change significantly as a result of IRI, the state holding company, awarding its GS-Autogrill group to a consortium headed by Benetton, the clothing group. The Italo-Swiss consortium, headed by Benetton, put in the winning bid for GS-Autogrill, the last part of the SME foodstuffs group to be privatised, late last Thursday. The deal marks the first large scale diversification by Benetton into a new area of business. It also signals the entry of a new foreign player, Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, into a sector whose development lags behind other EU countries. The winning consortium also includes Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, whose Luxottica spectacles group has been one of the most successful business ventures in northern Italy. Like the Benetton family, this represents a considerable diversification. The award will be ratified by a special IRI shareholders meeting on November 4. Until then the treasury, the sole shareholder, has indicated it would not reveal the terms of the deal. However, the bid by the Italo-Swiss consortium is believed to have valued GS-Autogrill at L2,100bn (Dollars 1.33bn), some L300bn above its market capitalisation. The bid was won against strong competition from a purely Italian consortium headed by Rinascente, the stores group controlled by the Agnelli family. In choosing the Italo-Swiss consortium IRI appeared to be swayed by a desire to bring in new blood. Originally, premier Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group, which has a large stores division through Standa, was interested. But analysts said Standa did not pursue a bid partly because of concern over raising a conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's ownership of Standa and his role as prime minister. GS-Autogrill is the last of the three divisions owned by SME, the foodstuffs group that has been privatised by IRI over the past 18 months. The other two were Italgel (frozen foods) and Cirio Bertoli De Rica (canned foods, oil, and milk). In 1993 GS-Autogrill made a L132bn net profit on turnover of L4,068bn. IRI controls 62.3 per cent of SME, and the offer was for 32 per cent. The winning consortium will be obliged to launch an offer for at least 20 per cent of the minority shares; IRI has guaranteed to sell the bulk of its remaining holding to the consortium. One of the terms of the award is understood to be a commitment to keep the stores and restaurant elements of GS-Autogrill together for five years. One of the attractions of the group has been to split the two.</p>

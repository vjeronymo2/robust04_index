			<p>BFN     [Text] The government delegation to the Cease-Fire  Commission [CCF] in Maputo today issued a protest against the  memorandum submitted by CCF chairman Colonel Segala to the  Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] regarding the  discrepancy in the number of government soldiers. The  government delegation says the memorandum is biased and does not  reflect the truth. The delegation regrets Col. Segala's not so  dignified attitude, in referring to the CSC matters that had not  been finalized by the CCF. The government protest notes that  under no circumstances can Col. Segala replace the sides, let  alone the CCF. The protest adds that the peace accord does not  provide for unilateral (?decisions) by the CCF chairman unless  he has at least secured the consensus of the sides.</p>

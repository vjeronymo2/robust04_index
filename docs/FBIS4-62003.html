			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Riga, May 11, BNS -- Latvia's Cabinet decided  Tuesday [10 May] to form a State Property Fund to calculate,  maintain and manage all state-owned property.    To ensure the efficiency of management, state-owned  enterprises will set up informative data bases, state immovable  property data bases and bases for unclaimed property.    The fund may give state property units to management of  other  legal persons, as well as to propose the creation of state  businesses and statestock companies to manage property units.    The fund will be headed by Cabinet-appointed secretary  general. The candidacy will be proposed by the finance minister.  The fund will also have a seven-member board, elected for an  office of three years.    Fund's employees are barred from other professional  appointments and participate in entrepreneurship.

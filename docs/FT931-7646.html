			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bramalea plans CDollars 2bn asset sale BRAMALEA, the troubled Edper-Hees property group, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy protection next month and complete a debt restructuring programme with a big sale of assets. This follows favourable votes by the last two of six creditor groups for the restructuring of the Canadian company. The group plans to sell CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) worth of commercial property in Canada and the US to reduce its debt by almost half. Control of the company will shift to the creditors. Trizec, another Edper-Hees property company, will retain about 20 per cent.</p>

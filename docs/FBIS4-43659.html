			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Bates: "EU Sceptics Reopen Tory Rift"] </F>   [Text] Euro-sceptic back-benchers were last night flexing  their muscles once again to end John Major's brief respite from  party criticism by pressuring him to veto the pro-federalist  Belgian prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, as new president of  the European Commission.    The Prime Minister faces being painted into a corner at this  week's European Union [EU] leaders' summit in Corfu, where the  choice will be made on Friday [24 June] or Saturday, and may  once more end up in a minority of one.    Britain backs former cabinet minister Sir Leon Brittan to  succeed Jacques Delors next January but Germany and France are  supporting Mr Dehaene, who is favourite to gain the post.    EU leaders are to decide on their favoured candidate at  Corfu  amid suggestions that it is time for one of the smaller member  states to have their candidate chosen, either Mr Dehaene or his  rival the Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, with Ireland's  former European Commissioner Peter Sutherland emerging as a  possible compromise candidate.    As backstage wrangling continued about the successor to Sir  Norman Fowler as Tory chairman, some vocal Euro-sceptics, such  as Sir Teddy Taylor, were also seizing the moment yesterday to  threaten restoration of internecine warfare on Europe over  increases in Britain's net contributions to the EU in two years.    The rises, agreed at the EU's Edinburgh summit under Mr  Major's presidency nearly two years ago, will see Britain's  contributions increase, in line with those of other countries,  from 1.7 billion pounds this year to an estimated 2.8 billion  pounds in 1995/6.    The Government has so far delayed the introduction of a  bill,  promised in last November's Queen's Speech, enabling an  increase, and it may now be put back until the autumn.    Although the sceptics conceded yesterday they cannot block  the legislation, they may yet disrupt its passage.    Yesterday, embittered former chancellor Norman Lamont,  sacked  by Mr Major a year ago, called on the Prime Minister to veto the  Dehaene candidacy. Implying vacillation by Mr Major, he said in  a BBC interview: "It is an absolutely crucial decision. We have  spent the last two years arguing against the proposals of  Jacques Delors. We do not want to have more of the same for the  next two years. We must make up our mind, stick to it and be  determined. Unless you take a firm position and stick to it you  never win anything."    Pro-European Tories see the Dehaene decision as not worth  the  veto. They pointed out that 10 years ago Lady Thatcher vetoed  Claude Cheysson and ended up with a candidate she liked even  less in Mr Delors.    Meanwhile, with manoeuvring still continuing over the party  chairmanship and former holders of the job Lord Parkinson and  Kenneth Baker still urging the appointment of Michael Heseltine  who does not want it, Lord Archer appeared to be moving up the  list. He won the backing of constituency activists in one  Sunday newspaper poll as a tribute to his indefatigable touring  of local associations.    No longer bothering to disclaim his ambition, he said: "I  have always been fascinated by that side of politics but I am  quite happy to serve the Conservative Party in any capacity the  Prime Minister says."    David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, the favourite for the  job, likewise suggested, though with noticeably less enthusiasm,  that he would accept any challenge Mr Major offered.</p>

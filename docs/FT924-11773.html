			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dow Chemical falls 35% despite advance in sales THE depressed state of the US chemicals industry was reflected in the third-quarter results of Dow Chemical and Monsanto. Both companies said the problems of operating in a sluggish US economy were compounded by the economic weakness in Europe. The industry's continuing woes were underscored by Mr Enrique Falla, Dow's executive vice-president, who said: 'The combination of a sluggish recovery in the US economy, a severe slowdown in Europe and weak industry fundamen tals globally have denied us the pricing flexibility to restore profit margins in basic chemi cals and plastics.' Dow Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals company, suffered a 35 per cent drop in net income in spite of a 6 per cent rise in sales. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 145m, or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.75bn, against earnings of Dollars 223m, or 82 cents, on sales of Dollars 4.5bn last year. Operating income rose 9 per cent to Dollars 446m in the quarter, but net income was hurt by increased financial expenses and a higher tax rate. Similarly Monsanto, the Missouri-based chemicals com pany, saw third-quarter net income drop in spite of higher sales. Net income tumbled 53.4 per cent to Dollars 62m, or 51 cents a share, from Dollars 116m, or 91 cents, last year, while sales grew 3 per cent to Dollars 1.88bn from Dollars 1.82bn. The company said the beneficial impact of a weak US dollar was not sufficient to counter effects of lower selling prices and weak European operations. Its revenue figures do not include Fischer Controls, which was divested in October and is now accounted for in discontinued operations. Operating income from the chemicals business fell to Dollars 43m from Dollars 77m, although sales rose to Dollars 923m from Dollars 895m. The Searle phar maceuticals business had operating income of Dollars 39m, against Dollars 38m on sales which rose to Dollars 405m from Dollars 362m. Income from the NutraSweet artificial sweetener business fell to Dollars 21m from Dollars 44m. Union Carbide, another big US chemicals group, posted third-quarter net income from continuing operations of Dollars 23m, or 17 cents, against a loss of Dollars 112m, or 88 cents a year ago. Last year's results included special charges of Dollars 114m. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.19bn. Mr Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman, said excess glycol capacity in the US and the far east was the biggest problem this year.</p>

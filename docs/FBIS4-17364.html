			<p>BFN     [Text] This year, the Russian government is planning to  accelerate agricultural reform and develop a procedure of  agricultural enterprises' bankruptcy, Russia's Vice Premier  Aleksandr Zaveryukha told Interfax.    He said that in the first quarter of 1994, agricultural  production decreased by 13 percent and that no signs of  stabilization were being felt. More than 30 percent of  collective and state farms, and joint-stock societies do not  earn enough to pay wages to the workers, said Zaveryukha.    He noted, however, that the government's attempts to  privatize loss-making collective farms according to the Nizhnyy  Novgorod or Moscow models, were resisted.    He confirmed the government's determination to observe the  voluntary principle of privatizing large state-run and  collective farms, and announced that the president and the prime  minister had categorically rejected the proposal by head of the  president's analytical center Petr Filippov on compulsory  privatization of state and collective farms.</p>

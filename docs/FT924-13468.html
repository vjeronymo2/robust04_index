			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (9): A magnet for suppliers - Eastern Europe GPT, the UK telecommunications systems manufacturer, will not say how much it makes out of its joint venture company in Moscow. But it is believed that the profits are good. GPT began in a small way in Moscow three years ago, installing pay-phones in the tourist sections of the city. The venture, called Comstar, was carried jointly with the Moscow Telephone Company. Now GPT has built a digital overlay network in the city and claims to be the only company which can provide access to the local phone network as well as good quality international lines. Comstar is also one of the first to sell western telephone systems in the CIS. The CIS and eastern Europe have been a honey pot attracting just about every leading telecoms company in the three years since the region began to open up. In all countries of the region, the state of the telecoms infrastructure is poor, and relatively few people or businesses even have a telephone: there are 15 phone lines per 100 population in the CIS, and even fewer in other east European countries. A modern telecom infrastructure is viewed as essential, in order to achieve the economic improvement that the region seeks. The cost of building that infrastructure will be several billion dollars, but political and economic uncertainty, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, means that many potential investors are proceeding cautiously. 'Everyone is making noises,' says Tony Cobb, deputy chairman of Comstar, but he is sceptical of the true number of companies willing to put in serious money. According to Mike Bissett, of the PA Consulting Group, foreign telephone companies embarking on joint ventures are mainly interested in how quickly they can achieve good revenue growth. Many western phone companies moved in quickly to install international gateway exchanges. International phone connections from eastern Europe and the CIS were particularly bad in the past. People complained of having to book calls, via the operator, several hours or even days in advance. As western companies started moving in, demand grew way out of proportion to the facilities available, and there was therefore a good business for anyone willing to invest in an exchange. 'In the short-term, if you want to make a quick return, 'international' is the way to do it. Our view is that that is short lived,' says Mr Cobb. He hopes to have 5,000 phone lines connected to Comstar by the end of this year, and 100,000 by the end of the decade. The rouble revenues are being re-invested in a factory to make telephone handsets, which will begin production at the beginning of next year. Cable and Wireless recently invested Pounds 4m in Sovam Teleport, an innovative venture between the US and Russia. Sovam has been sending data from Moscow to the outside world since 1984. It provides a satellite link to western databases and electronic mail services, and its customer list includes many of the world's news organisations as well as multinational companies such as Coca Cola, Du Pont and Barclays bank. Sovam claims to be profitable. The Pounds 4m will be used to expand Sovam's network into other CIS cities and improve its transmission facilities. The American phone company, AT&amp;T, has invested in several international exchange ventures, including an early one in Armenia. Most recently, it joined with PTT Telekom Netherlands to set up a venture called Utel with the Ukranian phone company. An international switch in the Ukrainian town of L'vov went live in June this year. Originally it had 30 lines to Holland and another 30 to the US, but the service has been so heavily used that the number of lines to Holland have been doubled. The long-term plan for Utel is to build a trunk network throughout the Ukraine. Thirteen exchanges will be installed, providing 6m new lines in the next two years. Other suppliers have moved in fast on mobile network opportunities. Mobile phone networks can be constructed relatively quickly because they do not require streets to be dug up. The investment is therefore much lower than for a wired network. The Baby Bell company, US West, has four mobile phone joint ventures: Hungary, Czechoslovakia (together with fellow Americans Bell Atlantic), Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Steve Andrews, president of US West Spectrum Enterprises, the Budapest network is going well. It has attracted 16,000 customers in two years of operation. The Moscow network has also grown fast, with 1,400 customers in less than six months. But St Petersburg subscribers have been slower to sign up with only 900 customers, although the network has been in operation for longer. Andrews attributes this to lower numbers of foreign business visitors. Sometimes, getting a venture going in eastern Europe is not as easy as it ought to be: PTT Telecom Netherlands says that it has been waiting for months for official registration of a new company in the Ukraine. The company is Ukraine Mobile Communications, a consortium with Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and Telecom Denmark. It has a licence to build a mobile phone network, but cannot even begin to install any equipment until the registration is complete. Eurotel, the US-West/Bell Atlantic venture, struck a different problem on its Prague network. It pitched the tariffs too high. The locals complained that they could not afford the prices, which were affordable for westerners. Eventually, Eurotel was forced to restructure the prices, and the venture is now gaining subscribers. James Hatt, regional director of Cable and Wireless, stressed that western businesses have to be highly selective: 'Every day, three or four so-called opportunities cross my desk. It has go to be more than an opportunity to go in and merely 'make a quick buck.' It must be one that allows us to expand as the economy stabilises and expands,' he says. Local contacts are vital if a venture is to succeed, he adds. Western companies need to get to know which people to target in the established bureaucracy. They also need patience, tact and understanding. For example, in the CIS they may win a licence from the regime in Moscow for a network somewhere in the outer regions of the country, but when they get out there, they may find they have to negotiate all over again with the local administration. 'I've seen other companies have projects die on them because they did not have the right level of political contacts,' says Mr Hatt.

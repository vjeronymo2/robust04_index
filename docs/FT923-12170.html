			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Expenditure priorities ON WEDNESDAY, the British cabinet will meet to discuss its strategy for the public spending round. It does so in inauspicious circumstances: the government has lost its previously sound fiscal position; it has little chance of balancing its budget in the medium term; and it will be unable to combine its current spending plans with continued membership of the ERM and lower taxes. In consequence, the Treasury will assail whatever looks the least bit vulnerable, while its charter-waving opponents in the spending ministries will put up an equally spirited defence. The short- to medium-term worries are not imaginary. As recently as 1988-89, the public sector's debt repayment was 3 per cent of gross domestic product. When disinflation started to bite, however, that debt repayment turned into a borrowing requirement likely to exceed 5 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 and 1993-94. The main reason for the slide into the red is that between 1990-91, when the PSBR was zero, and next year the government planned to increase public spending by 11.6 per cent in real terms. But over the same period real gross domestic product is, barring a sudden recovery, likely to fall. Public spending cannot grow faster than real GDP for long without parallel increases in taxes. With the election talk of recovery revealed as hyperbole, the government's thoughts naturally turn towards a tough spending round. But the round should be more than just tough, it should demonstrate a sense of priorities. Otherwise, the main outcome is likely to be the usual wasteful cuts in public investment. Individual responsibility In the first year of a new parliament, a government that also starts with a net ratio of public sector debt to GDP of only about 30 per cent need not panic. The scale of the actual and prospective increases in the PSBR underlines the case for a rethink of public spending. How else, after all, can cuts be made in a rational manner? But it is not the only reason for such a reconsideration. The question a government committed to individual responsibility and low taxation should ask is what it should be doing in the first place. The questioning should start from what it does now. Total government expenditure amounted to 42 per cent of GDP last year (excluding privatisation proceeds). Some 29 per cent of this was for social security, 15 per cent for health and personal social services, 13 per cent for education, 9 1/2 per cent for defence, 5 per cent for law and order and 4 per cent for transport. These six areas accounted for three quarters of total spending. Since debt interest added another 7 per cent, all other governmental activity amounted to less than a fifth of the total. Charter standards Is it necessary for the government to provide retirement pensions to all, independent of their individual wealth? Should state education be available free at the point of use to every parent, independent of their means? What about health? Is it possible to meet citizen-charter standards for these and other services without greater funding and, if so, should more of that funding not come from the users? How much of the road building programme can be funded through toll roads or financed directly through user charges? Given the inability of the Treasury to distinguish sensibly between capital and current spending, can other areas of capital spending be privatised or charged to users, if necessary through earmarked taxation? These questions are uncomfortable to ask. But any sensible programme for long term control of public spending has to start from them. This does not mean that there is no alternative, especially for a hard-pressed government. It consists of cutting anything that has no huge lobby behind it, particularly capital spending. It consists of pretending that government can do all it now promises to do - provide first rate education and health services, for example - without raising extra revenue. It consists, in effect, of spreading a grey blanket of underfunding and mediocrity over the services that are most important to the public. Aneurin Bevan called priorities the language of socialism. It is not. It is the language of good government. Time will soon tell whether Mr Major's government has the nerve to try to speak it.</p>

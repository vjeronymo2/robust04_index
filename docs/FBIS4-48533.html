			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   ANC's Development Plan Facing "Credibility Problem" -- The  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 May in a page 18  editorial criticizes the ANC's recent accessment of the cost of  the Reconstruction and Development Plan, RDP. "Minister without  Portfolio Jay Naidoo has reassured the nation that 'there is no  need for alarm bells to be ringing' now that the ANC economic  think-tank has found that the RDP will command a price tag of  between R[rand]80 billion and R90 billion estimate that was  doing the rounds ahead of the elections. We're reading Naidoo's  lips, but the message isn't convincing. Had the programme not  been a major cornerstone of the Government's economic strategy  (as President Mandela often emphasised) and had the before and  after projections not been as skewed as they are, the alarm  bells may have been muted. In the event, they are ringing in a  host of awkward questions, to which answers must be forthcoming  if the new Government is not to suffer a credibility crisis in  the early stages of its term of office."  BUSINESS DAY  <H8> </H8>     "Greater Clarity" Wanted Regarding RDP -- "South Africa can  no longer waste time looking at its economy through rose-tinted  spectacles," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on  19 May in a page 8 editorial. "Our national propensity to spend  beyond our means is clear from the estimates of budget overruns  that are the legacy of spending on the election and the  transition to majority government. Now we have new estimates  from the ANC's National Institute for Economic Policy that the  reconstruction and development programme is likely to cost more  than R80 billion over the next five years rather than the R39bn  we were led to believe before the election." The editorial  questions "what was to be gained by earlier insistence that the  lower figure was correct. Transperency seems to be one loser in  this particular exercise in public accounting." Turning to  another issue the new government must address, the editorial  states that "as we have pointed out before, South Africa's new  militarists are already trying to ensure that our military  budget is not pared. Yet unless it is, we are likely to find  that foreign lenders and aid providers deliver less than they  promised."  SOWETAN  <H8> </H8>     Need To Address Salaries of Public Servants -- "The new  Government will make a grave mistake early in its tenure if it  fails to respond adequately to concerns about the salaries and  perks of public servants," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 19 May in a page 8 editorial. "So far, there has  been a muted response from our new parliamentarians to the  recommendations of the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council]-appointed Melamet Committee which, among other things,  substantially increases Parliament's salary bill. Those who  have responded by saying they will donate a percentage of their  salary to party coffers, or President Nelson Mandela's intention  to donate part of his to a children's fund, miss the point. We  were hoping our new representatives, who have a history of  struggle and sacrifice for the common good, would not be  persuaded to board the `gravy train'." The new government needs  to set "new standards of honesty, propriety and thrift in public  life." The editorial continues by stating that although it is  easy to dismiss those economists who "still cling pathetically  to failed `trickle-down Reaganomics'," it not so easy to dismiss  them when they say that "our economy will not grow if public  spending is not brought under control and a bloated, `fat-cat'  civil service is not trimmed."</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Call to limit patent life of drugs currently costing the NHS Pounds 3bn a year - limited to 13 years instead of the 16 year period proposed by the European Commission. Lord Hesketh, minister for industry, acknowledged in the House of Lords last night that tough bargaining lay ahead in Brussels and that the issue - subject to a majority vote - was unlikely to be resolved before the end of the year. He argued that 13 years protection would strike a balance between giving protection to the UK industry and maintaining competition from generic products, and be closer to the practice in the US and Japan.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: More optimism on rate cut THE DOLLAR edged forward against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers appeared a little more optimistic about the prospect of an official interest rate cut by the Bundesbank today, writes James Blitz. There was no indication from the German central bank that it was thinking of reducing the interest rate floor, currently at 6.75 per cent. But German commercial banks appeared optimistic yesterday that there would be an easing, and did not bid for funds aggressively at the established repo rate of 6.80 per cent in the weekly money market operation. This had an impact on the currency markets, where one London dealer talked of 'mild position-squaring' by dealers. The dollar closed at DM1.6190 from a previous DM1.6105. The dollar strengthened more sharply against the yen, as dealers continued to ponder whether Japan would introduce a substantial fiscal stimulus later this year as part of a deal with the US. The US unit rose to Y105.65 from Y104.00. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6145 and Y105.53. Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, thinks the dollar will not fall far this week, whatever the Bundesbank does. He believes that no change in rates would lead to only modest profit-taking on the downside. A cut of 25 or 50 basis points would push the dollar up modestly. But Mr Cocker is one of the growing number of economists who think the dollar is heading for a more substantial fall in the next three months, possibly to as low as DM1.35. In his view, there is little chance of the Federal Reserve tightening policy before the end of the year or of a significant German easing. But more importantly, fund managers are still heavily overweight in dollars. 'When we get to the DM1.56 or DM1.55 level, fund managers will seriously take a look at their dollar weightings,' he said. In the European crosses, sterling again dominated events, moving up sharply in the wake of a particularly encouraging monthly monetary report from the UK Treasury. The Treasury remained bullish about prospects for growth, saying that recent figures pointed to 'very encouraging trends'. This helped the pound to rise a pfennig to a close of DM2.4950. The performance of other European currencies was mixed. The Belgian franc slipped sharply against the D-Mark at one stage amid new reports of the country's formidable economic problems. The Belgian franc fell to a low of BFr21.7500 from a previous BFr21.6300. Some economists spoke of the prospects of the BFr22 level being broken soon. The French franc was less troubled, closing at FFr3.521 from a previous FFr3.519. The Danish krone was unaffected by a cut in the country's key interest rate of  1/2 percentage point. This was another example of how European central banks do not harm their currencies when they ease policy.</p>

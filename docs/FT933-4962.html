			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Heretical thoughts on currencies: America The blowing apart of the European exchange rate mechanism last month was the second failure of a fixed, but theoretically adjustable, exchange rate system in 25 years. In the immediate postwar decades the US was the proud anchor of a global version of the ERM known as the Bretton Woods system. It broke down for painfully familiar reasons. The US failed to keep inflation under control in the late 1960s, thus undermining the existing set of exchange rate parities. The strains were magnified by the growing mobility of international capital - small by today's standards but still a destabilising influence. As both the US and Germany have failed to provide the stability required of anchor nations, and as no other anchors are in sight, should the world's monetary authorities accept that floating rates are here to stay? Most US economists would say Yes. With Dollars 900bn of foreign exchange transactions occurring daily, they believe governments cannot hope to do more than influence the pace of currency adjustments through shrewdly timed interventions, such as the US move last month to support the dollar. Free market economists are comfortable with floating rates because they regard the exchange rate as a price: the price of one money in terms of others. They see the case for flexible rates as part and parcel of the general argument for flexible prices. Since governments have no means of discovering what constitutes a correct or 'equilibrium' exchange rate, they should not attempt to dictate to markets. Price rigging inevitably creates distortions, whether the market is for fish, coalminers or the pound sterling. This argument is actually less strong than it appears. The essence of market mechanisms is that they are tailored to the different circumstances of particular economic agents. All real prices are the prices of particular commodities and services. Aggregate price indices - such as the consumer price index - are statistical constructs with little economic meaning. Consider what happens when the exchange rate is devalued by, say, 5 per cent. At a stroke all domestic prices are reduced by this amount in terms of foreign currencies. The economic circumstances of every exporter are miraculously improved. The gains are reaped by efficient and inefficient alike. This is more like a government decree abruptly changing all prices than a true market mechanism. Compare this with what happens with fixed exchange rates - when the value of one money in terms of another is held steady. Since currency movements have an economic impact only by changing the ratio of domestic to foreign prices, all the benefits from devaluation (or revaluation) can still be reaped by changes in domestic prices. If domestic prices fall by 5 per cent, they will fall by 5 per cent in foreign currency terms without any change in the exchange rate. The difference, of course, is that not all prices would fall by the same amount. If trading conditions abroad were tough, efficient companies would reduce costs more rapidly than the less efficient, deservedly gaining market share in the process. The impact of these cost changes would then filter unevenly through the whole domestic economy. When free market economists hail the virtues of flexible exchange rates, they are implicitly accepting the Keynesian dogma that domestic prices (and wages) are irretrievably sticky. They need to wave the macro wand of the exchange rate only because the micro economy is inflexible. Yet since the efficiency of a market system depends on the flexibility of prices and wages, this is a dangerous concession. Why should the public always be deemed incapable of accepting the fact that flexible prices are good for everybody in the long term, even if the need for occasional falls in individual prices (or wage rates) requires a temporary sacrifice by some groups? In the 19th century falling prices was regarded as perfectly normal, and not as a harbinger of doom; if productivity is rising they are not inconsistent with rising real wages and profits. Flexible rates are very much a second best solution. They rarely bring lasting benefits: the dollar has been devalued 60 per cent against the D-Mark and 70 per cent against the yen since 1968, without a conspicuous improvement in the US trade performance. Yet the wild gyrations of flexible exchange rates impose significant costs, because they undermine the ability of producers of real goods and services to plan for the long term. It is no accident that protectionist pressures began to intensify after the collapse of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s. Creating zones of currency stability will never be easy. But the success of the 19th century Gold Standard suggests that fixed rates are compatible with the kind of economic strains experienced today. Capital was highly mobile then and big economic shifts occurred, such as the rise of Germany as a manufacturing power. But the credibility of the Victorian commitment to low inflation, irrevocably fixed exchange rates and flexible domestic prices and wages were indispensable props. The fact that we have to rely on the blunt instrument of floating rates today should be seen as a mark of failure, a sign that the commitment to market principles is still very partial in most countries.</p>

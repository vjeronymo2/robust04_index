			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Muted cheers for the single market: Attempts to unify European securities Banks and securities firms in the UK were clearly relieved yesterday following a breakthrough in negotiations between EC governments which could lead to the creation of a single European securities market. Most acknowledged that agreement on the draft Capital Adequacy Directive, which lays down the amount of capital needed by EC securities firms and the trading operations of banks, is a significant step towards a desirable goal. Moreover, many of the proposals which would have damaged the London market have been dropped. However, some market participants remained circumspect. 'It is too soon to proclaim victory,' said the legal director at a leading London securities firm. 'The whole project hangs on the details and how the directive is implemented.' The agreement among governments yesterday covered only the general terms of the CAD. The final document is still subject to political approval by finance ministers when they meet on June 29. The general agreement still leaves several important areas undecided. For example, there is no agreement on the absolute minimum amount of capital which a recognised investment firm should carry. To some in the market the lack of a detailed agreement was good news - they had feared the commission would hurry through detailed proposals. 'It is a lot better than it might have been,' said Mr Paul Tillett, deputy secretary of the British Bankers Association. 'The best news of all is that more drafting will take place. In a directive like this the details are all-important.' Even once the details are agreed, the ratification and implementation of the directive will be linked to agreement on the draft Investment Services Directive, which should give securities firms a 'single passport' to conduct business in all EC centres. The ISD has been stalled for months and disagreements between national governments appear to be intractable. This means that the capital adequacy requirements may not come into force for some time. However, EC finance ministers have agreed a basic framework. Securities firms and the securities trading operations of banks will be able to boost core equity capital by raising short-term subordinated loans. This additional layer of capital is not available to banks in their non-trading operations under existing EC rules. Yesterday's agreement recognises as capital subordinated debt up to 250 per cent of core equity capital. There will be no inflexible upper limit on the size of large securities exposures. In early drafts, some governments had wanted a 25 per cent limit on securities exposures. This would have stopped firms undertaking large exposures by underwriting block trades, for example. Instead, the directive will allow a 10-day underwriting window in which normal capital requirements do not apply. Capital requirements will then gradually start to apply according to an agreed formula. The biggest victory for the UK government, and the London securities market, is an agreement that all stock borrowing and repurchase agreements will fall under the CAD, rather than tougher banking regulations. Under earlier drafts, stock borrowed by a securities firm or bank from a pension fund or a company would be treated as a loan rather than a trading position. Tougher capital requirements would have applied, increasing the cost of stock borrowing and potentially damaging the liquidity of the London market, where stock borrowing and repurchase are most common. The precise effects of the CAD will depend on the type of securities business being undertaken by a firm or bank. Although the UK won some important concessions, some sectors of the London market could still suffer; for example, underwriting firms in the London-based Eurobond market, which have traditionally taken on very large exposures sometimes over long periods. The EC knew of the potential impact of the CAD on the London market. Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner responsible for financial services, said: 'I have been well aware of the concern expressed by some in the City of London and also in other financial centres in the community about the potential pitfalls in this area. I'm glad that agreement has now been reached on a set of proposals which in no way prevent the continuation of present trading activity in the community or anywhere else.' However, some London bankers said the CAD would still probably require them to maintain higher levels of capital for most types of business than under current national rules. In other European financial centres, reaction was equally cool. The consensus in Paris was that the new regulations would make very little difference to trading in France, where the existing capital requirements on securities dealing are already comparatively high. While the main features of the CAD now appear to be fixed, the directive will be reviewed within three years to ensure that it is consistent with similar rules being drafted by other international regulators; the Basle committee of central bank regulators, and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. Foreign bankers said the directive could provide a model for these other international regulators to follow. 'It appears to be a sensible compromise between the interests of banks and and the interests of securities firms. It is certainly an advance over the system of regulation which applies in the US,' said one senior US banker in London. Meanwhile, UK government officials were keen to portray the agreement as a significant step forward, containing several measures to protect the interest of the London market. Today, bankers and securities market practitioners will attend detailed Treasury briefings, but with a sense of hope rather than dread.

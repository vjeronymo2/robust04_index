			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (19): A good range of accommodation - Angela Wigglesworth discovers that the island also has an extraordinary number of restaurants / Where to stay and dine out IN the 1960s, when British Rail gave its employees free transport, they flocked in their thousands to holiday in Guernsey. These were bucket-and-spade families with young children, and guest houses and self-catering establishments flourished. Today, the island caters for different visitors, most of them more than 45 years old, who want more sophisticated facilities and come for what the island has not got - theme parks, star-name entertainment and muggings - as much as for what it has: fine beaches, leisurely life-style and friendly people. There is a good range of accommodation with four five-crown hotels. Guernsey's crown rating is one higher than its equivalent AA or RAC star rating. 'We look for quality rather than just a tick list,' says Mr Mich Agnelli, the senior inspector of hotels. The island has an extraordinary number of restaurants - 44 of them in St Peter Port alone. Table d'hote four-course menus are priced from about Pounds 9 to Pounds 15. One reason for this may be because all pubs (along with garages) are closed on Sundays and a restaurant is the only place to have a drink. The flagship for the large hotels is undoubtedly the island's first and only purpose-built five-crown hotel, the St Pierre Park (Tel: 0481 728282). Set in 45 acres of parkland overlooking a lake, it has 135 bedrooms, six suites, popular restaurants (the Victor Hugo and the more informal Cafe Renoir), indoor heated pool, well-equipped Health Suite, gymnasium, tennis courts and a Tony Jacklin-designed nine-hole golf course. There are conference rooms for 20-200 people. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds 130 to Pounds 250 for a double or twin-bedded room. A smaller but excellent family hotel is La Favorita (Tel: 0481 35666) which has four crowns and is run by Mr Simon Wood, who was brought up on Herm, and his wife, Helen. Located in a wooded valley with views over the bay, it retains the atmosphere of the country house it once was. It has a heated pool. It is particularly good for Sunday lunches and guests relax with their Sunday newspapers well into the afternoon. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds 32, half board from Pounds 38. Package holidays are also available. The four-crown La Fregate Hotel (Tel: 0481 724624), once an 18th-century manor house, is a comfortable and friendly hotel with 13 well-equipped bedrooms overlooking St Peter Port harbour. The town centre is a five minutes' walk away, through its garden. The food is superb. A double room costs Pounds 90; breakfast from Pounds 4.50. An even smaller hotel, the three-crown eight-bedroom Midhurst House (Tel: 0481 724391) offers unbeatable value. All the prettily-furnished bedrooms are en suite and the owner-chef makes his own bread and ice cream. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds 20; half board from Pounds 28. For something completely different, the four-crown White House Hotel (Tel: 0481 37711) on Herm offers a real away-from-it-all experience. The island's only hotel, it is set in lovely gardens close to the harbour. Much-praised food, swimming pool and tennis courts. Half board Pounds 50 a head. La Grande Mare Hotel and Country Club (Tel: 0481 56576) has five crowns, Les Routiers and RAC awards, and Guernsey's Restaurant of the Year for 1992. Bedrooms, studios, suites and apartments, with a choice of four-poster or single beds with hydraulic tilt action. Set in 100 acres with solar-heated pool, croquet lawn, golf course, childrens' play area. A double room costs Pounds 134 with half board. Old Government House (Tel: 0481 724921) has five crowns. In the heart of St Peter Port, it was once the official Governor's residence. There are 72 en suite bedrooms with modern facilities and old-style comfort. Dancing at weekends, adjoining night club, heated swimming pool. Bed and breakfast from Pounds 39. The Hotel Bella Luce (Tel: 0481 38764) has four crowns. It is a converted old manor house, a stone's throw from Renoir's Moulin Huet Bay on the south of the island. Excellent restaurant, heated swimming pool, sauna, solarium and croquet lawn. Bed and breakfast from Pounds 30; half board from Pounds 39. Moore's Hotel (Tel: 0481 724452). Four-crown. Historic granite-built town house in St Peter Port with 48 rooms; conservatory restaurant (five-course table d'hote and a la carte menu); library bar complete with books; patisserie (light meals, Austrian cakes and herbal teas a speciality).

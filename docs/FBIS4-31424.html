			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Central Balkan Republic of Macedonia"] </F>   [Text] Despite statements by [U.S. Special Envoy] Nimetz  on bringing no proposal on the name, A1 Television cites  unofficial circles on speculations with an alleged proposal by  the Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias that Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] be referred to as The  Central Balkan State of Macedonia. Sources suggest Papoulias  has sent this proposal to the Macedonian authorities through the  envoy Nimetz, and go on claiming that PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] is all ready to accept the name of  Macedonia, and the Greek Government is more inclined to the  latest proposal than to the prefix "North" or "New" Macedonia.</p>

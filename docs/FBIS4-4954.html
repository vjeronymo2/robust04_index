			<p>BFN     [Text] Amid growing criticism of the confusing government  policy on foreign affairs and national security, an  interministry body on policy coordination in the area will be  soon formed, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said  yesterday.    The presidential office reached the conclusion there is a  need for a coordinating body which will hold meetings on a  regular basis as cacophonous views, especially on the North  Korean nuclear issue, are being aired by ranking officials of  the National Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, the  Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and other  security-related agencies, confusing the people.    Chongwadae has conducted indepth studies on whether to  strengthen the function of the presidential secretary for  foreign affairs and national security or create a new policy  coordinating council.    The conclusion was that it preferred the formation of a  coordinating body to the beefing up the role of the senior  presidential aide.    The policy coordinating body will be launched this week and  meet every week to check and analyze the security situation on  and around the Korean peninsula so as to tune the policy the  government will pursue.    A ranking Chongwadae official said yesterday, "We are  studying whether the policy coordinating body will have the  chiefs of government agencies dealing with foreign affairs and  national security."    He added, "The body will not be the same as the National  Security Council of the United States in character. It will be  only aimed at discussing and adjusting policies on diplomacy and  national security."    Currently, there are some similar conferences, including a  meeting of security-related Cabinet members presided over by  President Kim Yong-sam, a high-level strategy conference chaired  by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and a unification-related Cabinet  ministers' meeting presided over by Deputy Premier-National  Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok.    The Chongwadae official said, "Since the Chief Executive  makes the final decisions on diplomatic and security policy, the  coordinating body will act to assist the President."    The body will consist of ministers of the NUB, Foreign  Ministry, NSP director and ranking officials from the  presidential office.</p>

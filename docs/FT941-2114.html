			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (1): Offshore industry expands strongly - Jersey is putting behind it the awkward period at the end of the 1980s when the economy overheated and curbs had to be placed on business expansion / Introduction Yes, they do have some bananas in Jersey. At least, the UK-listed fruit group, Geest, last year set up its worldwide trading headquarters in the island, one of the first substantial companies to take advantage of new rules for so-called international business companies. Besides soliciting global traders, Jersey has also begun to promote a nascent offshore insurance industry and once again is more actively marketing itself to international banks, more than 70 of which are already represented. The offshore funds industry, meanwhile, has been expanding strongly during the recent bullish phase for global securities markets. Jersey is thus putting well behind it the awkward period at the end of the 1980s when the economy overheated and curbs had to be placed on business expansion, especially through employment restrictions under the Control of Undertakings law. The island earned a reputation for being closed for new business. That was never entirely true, but the limited resources of the labour and property markets had to be focused on the established banking, funds and trusts sectors and the finance industry was unable to develop in other directions. Finally, Jersey ran into the effects of the UK recession, especially on tourism, and 1991 and 1992 saw a rare dip in the island's economy, with gross domestic product falling some 6.5 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn over the two years. Meanwhile, the number of people in full-time private sector jobs declined by some 2,500 to 35,800 between June 1991 and June 1993. A good part of the ensuing unemployment problem was transferred to the UK mainland as perhaps 2,000 transient workers, many of them in construction, returned home. Although no figures are yet available for 1993, the economy has clearly moved off the bottom. 'We certainly saw the improvement coming through in the second half of 1993,' says Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States, the island's government, and Jersey's top civil servant. 'There is now a much more confident feel.' The island's equivalent of a finance minister is Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the powerful finance and economics committee. He points out the short-term and long-term reasons why Jersey is now able to seek more vigorous expansion. 'There is now some slack in the economy, and a very high level of skills is available,' he says. Just as important, however, is the evidence of sharply-rising productivity in the banking industry, an international rather than just a Jersey phenomenon. 'The indications are that the finance industry will employ fewer people over the years,' he says. Offshore finance is now reckoned to generate 50-51 per cent of Jersey's income. Tourism was last estimated at 26 per cent in 1992, and has probably fallen further. Much of the balance of income represents the investment receipts of wealthy residents. Prospects for tourism in 1994 are a little better, thanks to the recovery in the mainland economy. Senator Horsfall emphasises that the strategy of the States is to continue to promote tourism: 'We want to keep the second pillar strong,' he says. The position of the offshore finance industry, still only about 25 years old, is regarded as secure despite growing competition, but it is now so dominant as a wealth generator that it is recognised that the risks should be prudently spread. 'We've got a few gaps,' says Senator Horsfall. 'It's now quite clear that at this time some diversification is welcome.' Accordingly, local firms have been given the go-ahead to exploit the insurance law which was introduced in 1983 but which was effectively put on ice for some years because of labour shortages. The first few captive and reinsurance companies (two of each so far) have been set up, and there is a Jersey Captive Insurance Association, but Jersey remains a very long way behind its neighbour Guernsey in the insurance business. International business companies represent an attempt to move beyond brass plate entities towards corporate HQ units attracted by low local taxes and good communications. Geest has moved from the Bahamas to Jersey partly because of the convenience of a location in the European time zone. Another current legislative initiative concerns limited partnerships, which are seen as important to attract certain types of investment vehicles to the island. Meanwhile, the established banking industry is being more vigorously promoted, with Jersey dignitaries undertaking a programme of visits to European centres such as Paris and Frankfurt. Four new banking licences are at present in the final stages of negotiation. Jersey seeks to promote itself as a clean and well-regulated financial centre. 'We are not regarded as a thorn in the side of either the UK or Europe,' insists Senator Horsfall. 'It can be argued that we are of significant benefit to our neighbours.'</p>

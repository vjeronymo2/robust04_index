			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Greenalls to close subsidiary Greenalls Group, the pubs, drinks and hotel operator, is closing its Cambrian Soft Drinks subsidiary. The decision will result in a Pounds 4.3m write down of assets and Pounds 5.5m in redundancy and other costs and the loss of more than 90 jobs. Shaw Soft Drinks (Midlands) made an offer for Cambrian, Mr Sudarghara Dusanj, its managing director, said. Greenalls said, however, Shaw had failed to come up with a fully financed offer. Greenalls said it had tried to sell the company but closing Cambrian was ultimately the best decision for shareholders.</p>

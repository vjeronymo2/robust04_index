			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Cardoso wins backing of Brazil's largest political party Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is set to take office as Brazilian president on January 1, yesterday won the backing of the country's largest political party, the left-of-centre Democratic Movement party (PMDB), writes Angus Foster in Braslia. The PMDB's support, which was formally pledged during a meeting with the party president, Mr Luiz Henrique, should help Mr Cardoso to build a big enough coalition in the Congress due to take office next month to make several constitutional changes next year aimed at modernising the national economy. The PMDB holds about 125 seats in the 514-member Congress. If these are added to the 210 seats held by the alliance which elected Mr Cardoso, he looks able to count on the necessary three-fifths support needed to change the constitution. According to most analysts, changes are urgently needed in the tax and social security systems in order to keep the government's budget in balance and to underpin Brazil's latest anti-inflation currency, the Real.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Toshiba and NEC link with US chip group TWO of Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturers are teaming up with a US company to develop the next generation microprocessor to serve as the heart of the most powerful desktop computers. NEC and Toshiba - Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturers, and keen competitors - are joining forces with MIPS Technologies, a designer and supplier of reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor technology, to develop an advanced microprocessor based on MIPS' technology. The alliance highlights a growing tendency in the semiconductor industry to share across national borders the spiralling costs and huge resources that are needed to develop advanced semiconductors. The three companies will jointly fund research and development, and collaborate on process development. Other design experts also are expected to take part the development project. MIPS hopes the new microprocessors will go on sale in 1994. The US group will be responsible for the architecture of the new microprocessors, while NEC and Toshiba will be responsible for other aspects of development and implementation, and for volume production. The move also reflects NEC's and Toshiba's recognition of the importance of open architectures in future semiconductor technology. The three plan to spend Dollars 150m during the programme, but NEC estimates that its investment over the next few years will amount to about Y10bn (Dollars 90m). The alliance will compete directly with five other groups that have rallied around other Risc chips, with each hoping to become the world standard. They are IBM and Motorola, which have joined forces around the PowerBook; Digital Equipment and supporters of its Alpha chip; Sun Microsystems and its backers; Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi; and Intel.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VICTIM OF POLITICS -- OR OF BAD ART?  </P> <P> I appreciated both Parachini's and Sylvie Drake's articles. I'd like to add  another aspect of the LATC, surprisingly overlooked by both writers.  </P> <P> That is LATC's Theatre as a Learning Tool, which in five years has brought  50,000 students from high schools all over Los Angeles County to see Theatre  Center productions during school time.  </P> <P> Theatre as a Learning Tool provides study guides and seminars to teachers prior  to the plays, helping teachers integrate theater and literature with their  language arts programs.  </P> <P> It is an invaluable experience for Los Angeles teachers and students and is  another reason why LATC should be preserved.  </P> <P> BARBARA CRANE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

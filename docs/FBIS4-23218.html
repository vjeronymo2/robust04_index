			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Commentary column] </F>   [Text] The entire current political scene is symbolized by  the position of Finance Minister Derek Keys, with one of the  country's most dogmatic communists, Alec Erwin, as his deputy.  This shows very distinctly what Mr. Mandela thinks of the  National Party, and also what he thinks of the whole foreign  financial world whose perception of the new South Africa has  risen and dropped in accordance with reports the political  future of Derek Keys. Every report that hinted that Keys was  not going to be reappointed to the cabinet led to a drop in the  price of stocks; each assurance that he would be part of the  cabinet had the reverse effect.    Mandela has reappointed Keys minister of finance, but at the  same time shackled his hands and feet. Erwin will want about 90  million rands over five years for the ANC's Reconstruction and  Development Program [RDP], an entirely unproductive so-called  investment in people, but in actual fact a bonus for ANC  supporters as reward for their political support.    It is an African application of the American principle of  spoils [preceding word in English] after every presidential  election -- an America political tradition for a century and a  half. "To the victor belong the spoils," [quoted passage in  English] President Andrew Jackson said. He dismissed all civil  servants and place his own supporters in their positions.    Mandela has applied this even more literally; he regards the  state treasury as his "spoils." Out of tax money, the ANC will  help itself to 1.8 billion rands -- no real productive  investment -- under the hundreds of little headings of the RDP  program. The white man will just have to pay, and the  "deprived" will stand and wait with open hands. Erwin will  "propose" and Keys will sign on the dotted line. Keys will  have to be content with the shackles, or else he will have to  leave, whether Zurich and London like it or not.</p>

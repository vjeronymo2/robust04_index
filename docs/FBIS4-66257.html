			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Geng (2621 1649) of Institute of </F> International Economic Relations of the Shoudu Iron and Steel  Research and Development Company: "ROK's Import and Export  Policy Following Its Entry into GATT and Its Inspiration to Us"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] It can be realized that ROK's  foreign trade policy is mainly to encourage exports, while  relaxing imports; and to turn trade deficits into trade surplus  in the course of "maximizing imports and exports." In the past,  China had, over a protracted period of time, implemented an  excessively protective foreign trade policy which has become an  obstacle for its re-entry into GATT. As for imports, the number  of mandatory plans have been duly reduced with the scope of  planned management narrowing. However, due to the lack of a  mechanism to guide imports with the industrial policy,  shortcomings such as weak macroeconomic control, unfair  competition and delayed legislation on foreign trade have  cropped up. As for exports, the role of market regulation  remains insignificant. Moreover, competitions are usually  unfair. In domestic trade, commodity prices are being driven up,  while in foreign trade, goods are exported at a much lower  price. All this has harmed the overall interests of the state.  The enterprises which handle exports have monopolized the export  business. In addition, export products are divided into  different grades. This prevents the enterprises from improving  their production quality and enhancing their competitiveness. As  for the customs duties, protective measures are over-emphasized,  while not enough efforts are made to help enterprises become  more competitive. Right now, China's average tariff rate is 22  percent, while that of the industrialized nations is 4 to 5  percent, and that of developing countries is 13 to 14 percent.  Moreover, the structure of China's tariff rates is not so  rational. It lacks flexibility in regulating imports, and falls  far short of the GATT requirements. China's highly protective  policy fails to draw a clear-cut line between the protection of  an "infant industry" and the protection of a backward industry  with low economic efficiency. It cannot help some industries  extricate themselves from their predicament of high energy and  production costs and low economic efficiency. It serves to  increase the scale of capital-intensive industries, and makes  the highly competitive labor-intensive and technology-intensive  industries suffer. It crushes the incentive of the enterprises  to lower their production costs and improve the quality of their  products. As a result, the enterprises lack enthusiasm to seek  technological progress and the ability to compete with others on  the world market. In short, this policy has made China's  industry to develop production without taking into consideration  the production costs and economic results, and suffer from an  inherent shortage before it competes with others on the  international market. We must change our practice of protecting  our own products in an overall manner and suppressing  competition; place emphasis on protecting our infant industry;  introduce a competition mechanism; and use the tariff and  foreign exchange rates as an economic lever and a means of  regulation; and improve the relevant legal system. It is  necessary to thoroughly change the pattern of controlling  imports and exports with administrative measures; make full use  of the market mechanism in carrying out activities in foreign  trade; permit more industrial enterprises directly engage in  import and export business and compete with others on the world  market; and establish China's own multinational corporations.    In formulating its enterprise policy, the ROK government  gives the enterprises all kinds of preferential treatment and  relaxes restrictions placed on them. It helps enterprises  become export-oriented and allows them to wholeheartedly compete  with others on the world market. Since the implementation of its  reform program, China has raised the status of its enterprises.  The change of the management mechanism of the enterprises has  become a priority item on the government agenda. As for the  foreign trade policy, only a limited number of large and  medium-sized enterprises are authorized to do foreign trade,  although the power to handle foreign trade is being delegated to  the lower levels. As a result, the great majority of China's  enterprises are separated from the world market, while some  enterprises specialized in handling foreign trade have  monopolized the business in foreign trade. Therefore, China's  foreign trade is monopolized and divided to a great extent.  However, due to trade restrictions, it is also difficult to lift  all restrictions in doing foreign trade. The existence of this  kind of "partition" puts China at a disadvantage in export  competition and also creates friction between industry and  trade. It also violates the GATT provisions regarding "state-run  trade enterprises." All these not only hamper the process of  China's re-entry into GATT, but also hinder the development of  enterprises, weaken their competitiveness and actually undermine  their vitality in competing with others on the world market.  China's state of affairs is different from that of the ROK.  However, ROK's successful experience also gives us an  inspiration. After we re-enter the GATT, our enterprises and  their foreign counterparts will be placed on the same starting  line. Therefore, we should give our enterprises greater power to  manage their own business and narrow the gap between our  enterprises and foreign enterprise in terms of operating  environment. The government must establish a set of all-round  preferential policy, encourage enterprises to develop foreign  trade and compete with others on an equal footing according to  GATT provisions. Generally speaking, the degree of  industrialization of a nation is mainly determined by its major  enterprises. China's large and medium-sized enterprises with the  state-run enterprises as the core constitute the main force  which bears the financial burden of the state. To lift  restrictions on these enterprises and let them directly  participate in international competition will undoubtedly  increase China's competitiveness, give the medium-sized and  small enterprises an impetus to become export-oriented and help  China's enterprises to become more internationalized.</p>

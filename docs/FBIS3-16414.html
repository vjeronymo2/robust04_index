He was born in Orenburg in 1945. He graduated from Orenburg  Higher Missile Defense Command School. He has had 12 postings  during his service. The last one was in the city of Bryansk.  In February 1994 he was elected chairman of the Committee for  Security and Defense Questions of the Russian Federal Assembly's  upper house.    [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, until recently you were a regular  officer. Tell me, how do people become politicians? For what  reasons did your general's uniform suddenly become "too tight"?    [Shirshov] My current position is in a certain sense a  surprise to me personally, but at the same time it was thought  out and, I would say, deliberate.    A deputy's work is something I am familiar with. When I was  still serving I was a deputy at various levels. You probably  know that at that time certain deputies' duties came, so to  speak, "with the job." I mainly worked in committees and  commissions on socialist legality, social protection for  servicemen, and servicemen's problems.    These were the facts which obviously determined my future.  In March 1990 (by that time I had already been twice elected a  Bryansk City Soviet deputy) I was offered the chairmanship. I  will say frankly that I had many doubts. I liked service life,  things were not going badly.... In short, it is always  difficult to change one's life. Especially as my chances of  becoming a general would go out of the window if I took up this  offer.    But at the last city session, at which the question of the  city soviet chairman was being decided, all the candidates voted  in my favor. So I headed Bryansk City Soviet and I carried out  these duties right up until the soviets' disbandment. I wore  only military uniform for a whole three years. Initially this  surprised many people. Then my general's tunic stopped  "hurting" people's eyes. Incidentally, I took it off on 4  October last year.    [Pelts] As a result of your election to the Federal  Assembly's upper house your potential has increased  considerably. As chairman of a key committee, what would you  like to do first of all?    [Shirshin] Above all I want to stress that we are already  engaged in practical work. The subcommittee on security is  currently working on six draft laws which will be submitted to  the house for discussion in the near future. In addition,  organizational work is being completed -- the committee is  defining the scope of its activity, "settling in" in terms of  personnel, and establishing the necessary contacts with other  committees of both the upper and lower houses of the Federal  Assembly.    What am I personally working on? Drafting a constitutional  amendment on the use of the Armed Forces inside the country. I  believe that it should be clearly written into our constitution  that the use of the Army in combat inside the state to resolve  political questions is prohibited. It is still too early to  talk about the final version of the text of this amendment, but  the point, I think, is clear. The Army should be used to  protect the state's interests and security only when there is a  threat from outside. All internal problems must be solved by  other power structures.    I am sure that I am not original in this conviction and,  importantly, I am not alone. Most reasonable and judicious  politicians have a similar viewpoint. Furthermore, servicemen  themselves are openly stating this. I believe that the adoption  of this amendment will be one of the first steps of our  Committee To Implement the Right to Legislative Initiative.    [Pelts] You said that the committee's structural  organization is being completed. But I have noticed that  compared with other committees yours is virtually the  smallest....    [Shirshov] You are right. As of today our committee has  only 16 deputies. Is that a lot or not many? Here I would  recall Aleksandr Suvorov's saying about winning not by weight of  numbers but by skill. From this viewpoint I believe that the  committee's composition is totally satisfactory. We have people  capable of, so to speak, literally getting to grips with all the  most important areas of work. For example, for the problems of  the military-industrial complex (and this is a whole range of  questions) we have Petr Vasilyevich Romanov. For questions on  the Armed Forces we have Ruslan Sultanovich Aushev plus your  obedient servant. What else? For intelligence, security, and  counterintelligence we have my deputy, Petr Grigoryevich Premyak  (a captain first rank, incidentally). In short, all the  committee members are experienced, knowledgeable people who are  professionals in their own field.    [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, currently much is being said about  the need for a review of the package of "military laws" adopted  by what was then the Russian Supreme Soviet. What is your  attitude to this idea?    [Shirshov] The situation is changing, and views are changing  too. There is nothing terrible about that. If some laws need a  little more work, I am all for that. It is another matter if we  are talking about reducing the rights reflected in the "military  package" of laws. The legislative process is objectively not  keeping pace with our current difficult life. I am convinced  that people must not be put in an even more difficult position.    [Pelts] But the explanations of those who think otherwise  are also logical. They say that there is simply no money to  implement adopted laws....    [Shirshov] I agree, such a problem does exist. But here too  we can and must find a solution. For example, the military  budget again. I believe that it must be formulated with  specific tasks in mind. This is the strategic approach. We all  know that most important, priority areas exist in  military-organizational development. That means financing for  these areas must also be given priority. By financing  everything en masse we will inevitably "lose" investments in the  most complex bureaucratic labyrinths.    [Pelts] Incidentally, many of our readers are reporting this  problem. For example, funds for pay are apparently being  allocated but the payee gets them only after a delay of several  months. Do you intend to look into this?    [Shirshov] Undoubtedly. And in the very near future. I am  convinced that in this situation the reasons for this phenomenon  must be found without fail. It is due, I think, to an official  who either did not make a timely decision or made it to the  detriment of the same servicemen. I want to give my assurance  that we will check up without fail on where the money is  "going," why it is being held back, and who is possibly making a  fortune from it.    [Pelts] How do you intend to collaborate with the State  Duma's "defense" committee?    [Shirshin] Why "intend"? We are already collaborating. I  recently met with Aleksandr Piskunov. We talked about many  problems concerning our collaboration. In addition, in the  future we are planning to consider many draft documents jointly.  I am convinced that close contacts are useful both for working  out a common viewpoint and for raising the quality and  efficiency of our work.    Incidentally, I will add that we are interested in contacts  with a group of Russian Defense Ministry experts and other power  structures. Ideally I see a group of experts under our  committee from all Armed Forces branches. But even this will  not apparently be enough. Because our terms of reference  include questions which simply cannot be tackled without careful  and comprehensive expert study.    [Pelts] For example, such questions as the ratification of  the recently signed treaty with Georgia....    [Shirshin] I do not propose to rush into final  assessments. But in my view the interests of a whole group of  territories were not studied fully during that visit. And, as  we know, you cannot clap hands with only one hand. It is a very  subtle and delicate problem. I will stress again that I am now  expressing my personal viewpoint -- before signing this "Big  Treaty," as it is being called, Georgia should have resolved its  own internal problems itself. Moreover, without our  participation. But we will wait for the official reaction of  both the upper and lower houses of the Federal Assembly. I  think that these will come soon.    [Pelts] The last question is of a personal nature. What do  you do with your spare time? What is your hobby?    [Shirshin] It is trite to repeat that I have virtually no  spare time. But if I do get some, I enjoy fishing and hunting.  I really love working on the land -- I have my own  six-hundredths of a hectare. True, I have no time to get out  there. But generally I love nature. And I love work done by my  own hands.</p>

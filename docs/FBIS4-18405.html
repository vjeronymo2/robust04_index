			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Submarines for South Korea Crisis </F> Area"]    [Text] German submarines are to dive under the South  Korean flag. Despite the escalating crisis between North and  South Korea, the Federal Government is sticking to the deal it  decided this year.    Bonn has guaranteed 696.36 million marks for three  submarines, which will probably be built at Nordseewrke in Emden  and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG in Kiel. The Federal  Government has accepted a basic promise of coverage for another  52.3 million marks, Economics State Secretary Johann Eekhoff  announced. Two years ago South Korea was taken off the "H  country list," which lists all risk countries to which armament  goods are not to be exported.    The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has announced that it will  put South Korea back on this list of risk countries if it wins  the Bundestag elections. South Korea was taken off the list  following pressure from industrial circles. The latest  developments in the Far East show, however, how wrong this  decision was, said Elke Leonhard-Schmid, foreign trade  spokeswoman of the SPD Bundestag group.</p>

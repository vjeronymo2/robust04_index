			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHURCH'S VIEWS  </P> <P> Can it be that the Catholic Church has its left foot in its mouth and the right  foot doesn't know? View on June 6 makes one wonder. The reporting of two rites  of passage -- the Latino quinceanera and high society's coming out -- reflects  opposing church attitudes.  </P> <P> We read that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles has issued new guidelines for  quinceaneras to simplify a tradition that has ". . . become too secular, too  social and too costly" ("Is the Party Over?" Page 1).  </P> <P> On another page of the same issue, we read that in a ballroom of the Beverly  Hilton Hotel there was "no shortage of pomp" as this year's designer-clad  (Social Services Auxiliary) debutantes were presented to the Archbishop of Los  Angeles ("On View").  </P> <P> If there is an award for ambivalence, I hereby nominate the Catholic Church.  </P> <P> LEA PETRICK  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING OF AGE;  </P> <P> CORY KRUSEMAN DISCOVERS RACING SUCCESS AT 18  </P> <P> While most high school seniors were readying for graduation and parties a  couple of weeks ago, Buena High's Cory Kruseman was racing stock cars and  three-quarter midgets at Ventura Raceway, Ascot and Oildale, a track near  Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Kruseman, 18, a former junior varsity quarterback, decided to forgo football  and the normal teen-age life to pursue his burning desire to be behind the  wheel of a powerful racing machine -- any kind of powerful racing machine.  </P> <P> Kruseman has actually been racing since age 11, starting on the Go-Kart and  motocross circuits around the Southland. He has been around race tracks from  the time he began to walk.  </P> <P> Kruseman's introduction to racing came on the three-quarter midget circuit  through his father, the late Ron "Krazy" Kruseman, who was killed during a 1984  TQ (three-quarter midget) race at El Centro.  </P> <P> "I've hung around TQs all my life. I was the little guy always hanging around,  helping out and getting tools and things for anyone, but I lost interest for  about a year after my dad was killed," Cory Kruseman said.  </P> <P> "I got motivated again because racing is where my friends are, and I can do  what I want to do."  </P> <P> Kruseman always wanted to pursue his father's dream in a TQ car. He began  chasing the goal for real in January -- saving money, trying to sell his 1969  El Camino, and borrowing $6,500 from his mother, Renee Kruseman.  </P> <P> That gave him just enough money to purchase a used TQ from Bill Floyd of  Oxnard, who no longer races in the division but is still active racing  Mini-Stocks at Ventura. Floyd and Kruseman now go head-to-head in that  division, thanks to Don Adams of the Auto Dienst, a car-service center in  Oxnard.  </P> <P> "I've known his mom for several years and I have seen him drive Go-Karts a lot  and I think he has a lot of natural talent," Adams said. "I prepared a stock  car this year and I needed a driver, so I asked him if he would like to drive a  stock car."  </P> <P> The youthful Kruseman thought he was getting only a one- or two-week tryout  until Adams found a permanent driver. But Adams told him after the third week  that the No. 73 red-and-white Pinto 2000 Mini-Stock was his for the season.  </P> <P> "This was something I always wanted, to set a goal and try to conquer it,"  Kruseman said. "I'm trying to form my ladder to the Indy 500, and I hope my  racing doesn't just become a step stool."  </P> <P> Comments from some interested observers indicate that Kruseman could very well  be climbing that ladder.  </P> <P> "All young drivers create excitement, but he's not intimidated by the old guys  and he's got a lot of energy that makes him a good little racer," Ventura  Raceway promoter Jim Naylor said.  </P> <P> Said Adams: "He made an impression in his first TQ race at Oildale in June. The  drivers and track officials were impressed by his abilities and they told me  the rookie flag won't be staying on his car for very long."  </P> <P> Kruseman has been improving weekly at Ventura. Currently 12th in the Ventura  Mini-Stock standings with 420 points, Kruseman registered the first main-event  victory of his career two weeks ago. He won his first trophy dash the same  night and added his second main-event win last Friday night.  </P> <P> "I kinda lucked into the win," Kruseman said of the first victory. "I usually  don't run in the figure 8 race, but I was having some car trouble and we ran in  the figure 8 to see if the bugs were out of it and I ended up getting the win."  </P> <P> While the dream moves closer and closer to reality every time Kruseman steers  onto the dirt and asphalt ovals, he credits the desire and encouragement to  succeed to his mother.  </P> <P> "It kind of bugs my mom at times and she has to be by herself when I'm racing,"  Kruseman said. "It's hard for her, especially since one of our best friends,  Jeff Bagley, was killed in a Sprint car at Ascot last month. It has bothered  her a lot, but at the same time she accepts my racing and she supports me  100%."  </P> <P> Also lending support to Kruseman is his mother's boyfriend and Sprint car  driver, Harlan Willis of Ventura. Kruseman said Willis is teaching him how to  set up the cars for different tracks and is working with him on his racing  psychology.  </P> <P> "I've got a lot of experience in TQs and Sprints and I try to help him have the  right attitudes on the track," Willis said. "I try to keep him from being  overly aggressive and from driving over his head."  </P> <P> The one-fifth-mile dirt oval at Ventura has opened the door for Kruseman and he  has a soft spot in his heart for the track.  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't know it, but Ventura is a real nice track," Kruseman  said. "I remember when it was a little mudhole, but it turned into a great  track and hopefully it can be better than Ascot someday. It's a fast track, so  I hope they might run more TQs here in the future.  </P> <P> "But I'll drive anything on this track in a race."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIMBING EVEREST  </P> <P> As a member of a French expedition to ascend the unclimbed northeast ridge of  Everest, I read with delight your editorial "Because It Is There" (June 18). It  romanticizes an activity that draws scant attention by comparison to other  sports such as basketball or boxing.  </P> <P> Climbing Everest is the unphilosophical abstraction to life itself. The climber  senses, feels and eventually learns to know this as he struggles for the  summit.  </P> <P> Our expedition, although small and privately organized, will celebrate the  bicentennial of the Bill of Rights (Sept. 25, 1989) and the Declaration of  Human Rights (Aug. 26, 1989) by placing a copy of each document on the summit.  </P> <P> P.S. This, my second unsponsored attempt, has left me broke.  </P> <P> THEO MAYER  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

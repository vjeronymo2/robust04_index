			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand will accelerate the repatriation of the  remaining 25,000 Hmongs and Laotians at the country's last  Indochinese refugee camp at Nakhon Phanom so the camp can be  closed by the end of this year.    Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the  National Security Council [NSC], told a press conference  yesterday that the Thai government had no policy of allowing the  settlement of any refugees and that it would try to reduce the  number of border camps, with the last one holding Indochinese  refugees, at Ban Na Pho in Nakhon Phanom province, to go by the  end of this year.    Refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border were closed early  last year when hundreds of thousands of Khmer refugees were sent  home after the UN-sponsored peace settlement in the war-torn  nation.    However, border camps still exist on the western frontier  with Burma where several tens of thousands of refugees are  taking shelter as a result of four decades of civil war between  the Burmese Army and various anti-Rangoon ethnic minorities.    Laos, Thailand and the UNHCR agreed in June 1991 to  repatriate all Laotian refugees within three years. But so far  only 8,619 have been sent home under the tripartite effort,  leaving another 25,000 stranded in Thailand due to difficulties  on the part of Laos and the UNHCR, Khachatphai said.    He said he had urged Laos and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to find new approaches to  expedite the repatriation process. Of the 25,000 refugees,  22,000 are highland Hmong.    Many difficulties, such as a lack of repatriation funds on  the part of the UNHCR, and the lack of basic infrastructure and  suitable relocation sites in Laos, have slowed the process,  according to the NSC chief.    Khachatphai has tried to encourage the repatriation process  by pointing to the easing of ideological conflicts in Laos. He  said Vientiane, apart from its repeated guarantee of returnees'  safety against government reprisals, has also stated that it  wants the returnees to help develop the landlocked nation.    He said the UNHCR would provide assistance to the returnees  as well as help them resettle in their preferred community.    This morning a group of over 400 Hmong refugees, the largest  such group to be returned so far this year, will be repatriated  overland to Laos via the newly opened Thai-Lao Bridge, he added.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO DROPS FULLERTON  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College defeated Fullerton, 88-70, Saturday in an Orange Empire  Conference game that was stopped with 25 seconds left because of a player  injury.  </P> <P> While reaching for a loose ball, Jevon Hunter, a Rancho Santiago reserve,  became caught between two Fullerton players in the scramble. He fell to the  ground holding the back of his neck. He had feeling in his hands and feet when  he was taken from the gym.  </P> <P> Hunter was taken to St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton for X-rays and further  examination, which revealed a bruised neck. According to his mother, Ella  Hunter, the injury was not serious and Hunter was up and walking after the  tests.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago led at the half, 50-37, but Fullerton went on a 6-0 run to  start the second half and closed to 50-43 with 18:16 left.  </P> <P> After a Rancho Santiago timeout, the Dons scored on three consecutive baskets  by Matt Lien and led, 56-43. Fullerton could get no closer than 10 points the  rest of the way.  </P> <P> Corie Blount, a freshman forward, led Rancho Santiago with 20 points and Lien,  a sophomore center, had 19. Blount had seven rebounds and Lien six.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago shot 74% in the first half and 66.7% in the game from the  floor. Alvin Loftis was eight of 11 and had 16 points. Lien was nine of 12 and  Blount seven of 12.  </P> <P> With the victory, Rancho Santiago (26-2 overall, 9-1 in conference), trails  conference leader Cypress by only a game with two regular-season games  remaining.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett was pleased with the victory, but not at the  expense of a player. "It was a win, sure," Pagett said. "But it sure puts the  whole thing in perspective."  </P> <P> Fullerton tried to counter with sophomore forward Rashone Lewis, who had a  game-high 30 points. Lewis was 11 of 19 from the field, including four dunks,  and made eight of 12 free throws. Lewis is averaging 26.5 points a game in his  last six games and has a 22.5 average on the season.  </P> <P> Kenny Cross, who added 13, was the only other Hornet in double figures.  Fullerton dropped to 11-17, 2-8.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago plays host to Cypress at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> In other Orange Empire Conference games:  </P> <P> Golden West 101, Saddleback 88 -- Tom Dever, playing for the injured Craig  Rice, scored a game-high 26 points for host Golden West (20-10, 7-4). Terrell  Malone and Matt Thompson scored 17 each for Saddleback (8-18, 1-9).  </P> <P> Riverside 70, Orange Coast 58 -- Alan Schlines scored 18 for visiting Orange  Coast (13-12, 2-8). Greg Stienstra scored 20 for Riverside (16-14, 5-6).  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that the Amex's clean cross proposal was prompted by the competition that exists between the Amex and the regional exchanges for order flow and, in particular, for block business. The Commission also recognizes that the Amex's current priority rules may restrict the ability of Amex members to execute agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Under the current rules, a member who tries to execute a block-sized agency cross on the Amex faces the possibility that another member will break up the cross at the cross price. As a result, the member may take block-sized orders in Amex-listed securities to a regional stock exchange for execution. The relatively smaller number of limit orders on the books of the regional stock exchange specialists and the virtual absence of a trading crowd at the regional exchanges helps to ensure that member firms will be able to execute their cross transactions on the regional exchanges with little or no interference. Indeed, the regional exchanges compete aggressively with the Amex for block transactions. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  In addition, blocks go to the regional exchanges because of the low probability that a block will be broken up on the regional exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The clean cross proposal should facilitate the ability of Amex members to execute block agency cross transactions on the Amex by giving such orders priority over orders at or within the prevailing quotation. At the same time, the proposal preserves the auction market principle of price improvement by permitting the cross transaction to be broken up at a better price. The proposal also preserves the principle of priority by requiring that a member who breaks up a cross by providing a better price must first satisfy all existing market interest having priority at that better price before trading with any part of the cross. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that approval of the clean cross proposal could disadvantage orders on the book, or in the trading crowd, at the same price as the cross transaction. This is the only aspect of the proposal that really represents a departure from existing auction market principles. Thus, under the proposal, a clean cross could be executed while a public investor's limit order on the book remains unexecuted. For example, if a public customer left a limit order on the specialist's book at 10 a.m., bidding for 500 shares of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> XYZ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 40, a so-called clean cross could be executed at 10:10 at a price of 40 without satisfying the public customer order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that the Amex proposal may not be the ideal means to address the current situation, in which a block transaction can be effected on one of the regional stock exchanges or in the third market and completely avoid the Amex's limit order book. A preferable approach would be to establish a means of intermarket price protection for all limit orders in all market centers. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  However, with no means of intermarket price protection for public limit order, and given Commission approval of the NYSE's identical clean cross proposal, <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  as well as certain regional exchange proposals designed to minimize interference with cross transactions, <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  it could be unfair to preclude the Amex from adapting to the present competitive environment by facilitating the execution of agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Thus, the Commission believes that it is not unreasonable or inconsistent with the Act for the Amex to react to competitive pressures for block business by permitting large agency crosses to occur at or within the bid or offer price. The proposed rule change should further competition among exchanges and other competing market centers and increase opportunities for the more efficient execution of block-sized agency cross transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission originally attempted to address the underlying issues of limit order protection and competition among the exchanges through an integrated national market system rule. Specifically, the Commission proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 under the Act in 1979 to require that all limit orders that are collected in a particular market center receive intermarket price protection against executions at inferior prices. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15770 (April 26, 1979), 44 FR 26692 (addressing the practice of transporting block orders from one market to another to avoid limit orders in the former market). Due to the lack of interest from the relevant markets and potential difficulties in implementing a system for intermarket price protection, the Commission withdrew proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31344 (October 21, 1992), 57 FR 48581 (October 27, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31343 (October 21, 1992), 57 FR 48645 (October 27, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;39) (``NYSE Clean Cross Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33708 (March 3, 1994), 59 FR 11339 (March 10, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;05); 33391 (December 28, 1993), 59 FR 336 (January 4, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;11); and 27205 (August 31, 1989), 54 FR 37180 (September 7, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;89&hyph;17). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN)--Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt  made it clear at a meeting with leading German steel industry  representatives today in Bonn that the German steel industry  cannot count on further government assistance. The budget  situation left no scope for this. Rexrodt and the steel  managers agreed that further capacity reductions "are possible  only within the framework of an agreed upon, Europe-wide  program." Moreover, close attention will have to be paid to the  proper use of the subsidies for the steel industry in all EU  countries, Rexrodt said. The EU subsidies could not be used to  acquire new shares of the market. The crisis meeting was called  by Rexrodt. The steel sector was represented by the executive  boards of the steel concerns and German Steel Federation  President Ruprecht Vondran.</p>

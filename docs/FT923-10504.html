			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Japanese retailer to absorb affiliate DAIEI, the rapidly expanding Japanese retailer, will absorb a troubled property affiliate, Nippon Dream Kanko, which reported consolidated losses of Y450m (Dollars 3.52m) last year following the sharp fall in land prices. Mr Isao Nakauchi, the Daiei chairman famed for aggressive acquisitions, said his company would acquire Nippon Dream Kanko in a 'spirit of equality' for a price expected to be set in October. However, Daiei's rapid expansion has come as retail demand and property prices have fallen. The takeover of Nippon Dream is a sign that Daiei is under pressure. Daiei recently agreed to acquire 34 per cent of Recruit, the business information and property group, and has built holdings in several other Japanese retailers. Over the past few months, Daiei has shuffled shares around its affiliates to raise funds for the Recruit acquisition and reduce its own debt burden, but the complexity of the group structure has made unclear the true state of its financial position. Nippon Dream, in which Daiei now holds 28 per cent, runs pachinko parlours, the Japanese version of pinball, and other leisure operations, as well as owning a large tract of land in Osaka hit by falling property prices. In the past, such land holdings were valuable as collateral, but Japanese banks have become wary of their exposure to the weakening property market.</p>

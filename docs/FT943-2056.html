			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Nurses defy government with 8.3% pay claim: Pay review body urged not to recommend national award Nurses' representatives will this week press for a pay rise of 8.3 per cent. The claim will set them on a collision course with the government, which, it emerged yesterday, has urged the National Health Service pay review body not to recommend any national pay increase. The government wants any pay awards to Britain's 500,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors to be made locally by individual trusts. The claim for nurses and midwives comes from the Royal College of Nursing, regarded as one of the most moderate public sector unions. The RCN, which believes its members' pay has slipped behind that of non-manual workers, warned last month that it intended to use the 4.7 per cent offered to MPs as a yardstick for its own pay claim. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, recently confirmed that total pay bills in the public sector would be frozen for the second year running. Any increases would have to be funded through improved efficiency. Pay review bodies, which make recommendations to the prime minister, cover several large groups of public sector workers including teachers, nurses, doctors and the armed forces. Teachers' unions have already asked their pay review body for an increase of about 4 per cent. Most nurses are covered by the awards recommended by the pay review body. National Health Service trusts are allowed to make their own awards to new staff but few have yet done so. Last week the trusts, in their evidence to the profession's review body, said nurses and midwives should be put on performance-related pay determined by local managements. Last year nurses were awarded 3 per cent for 1994-95. The previous year the award was 1.5 per cent, in line with that of all public-sector workers. The government's current plans were revealed in a leaked document of its evidence to the pay review body. It concludes: 'We would urge the pay review body not to recommend an across the board increase - but instead to give a strong steer to the continuing development and implementation of local agreements.' Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the move would further 'destabilise' the NHS. RCN officials were tonight 'horrified and outraged' at the evidence put forward by the government. One said: 'It is absolutely appalling if the government does not allow the pay review body to make a recommendation. It is being pushed on to the sidelines and we will fight very strongly to preserve it.'</p>

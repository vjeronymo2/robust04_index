			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: On reflection Come back Wynne Godley, all is forgiven. Yesterday marked the start of the rehabilitation of the left-leaning Cambridge don best known for his gloomy views about the UK economy and the need for import controls. A government-funded study into the biggest forecasting errors by government and private-sector economists in recent years says that 'more attention should have been paid' to the warnings of Godley, who predicted a long and severe recession before virtually anyone else. Given the exclusion of the 65-year-old Godley from the inner circles of policymaking during the 1980s - he lost his government funding in 1982 largely because of his non-Thatcherite views - the irony is delicious. It was not lost on Godley yesterday on sabbatical from Cambridge at the Jerome Levy Institute in New York. 'Over the past few years, I have had a strong sense of not existing. It's been like walking past a mirror and seeing nothing,' says Godley. One could almost hear the maverick making merry with his oboe at the welcome news.</p>

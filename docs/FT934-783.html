			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Israelis protest against killing of settlers: Talks on Palestinian self-rule seek to end stalemate as Arab-Jewish violence mounts Thousands of Israelis demonstrated across the country last night after the killing of two Jewish settlers by Arab gunmen as Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators continued intense efforts in France to break a deadlock over Palestinian self-rule. Protesters chanted anti-government slogans and accused Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, of betraying the Jewish people and sacrificing the security of settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The demonstrations, calling on the government not to arm incoming Palestinian policemen, came after extremist Palestinian gunmen shot dead two Jews in a drive-by shooting near Ramallah, in the West Bank. Yesterday's killings brought the death toll since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in September to 20 Israeli and 44 Palestinians. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Mr Nissim Zvili, a senior Labour party official, in Tunis and told him that the attack showed both sides that time was not in their favour. Both Israel and the PLO fear that Arab-Jewish violence will escalate in the vacuum created by the continuing stalemate in talks to implement Palestinian self-government in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho. In Versailles, the two negotiating teams led by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister and Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member held difficult meetings throughout the day to try and break the deadlock which centres on who should control border crossings. Both sides were struggling to find a compromise which would guarantee Israeli security concerns while at the same time giving the Palestinians some concessions towards at least symbolic sovereignty. After his meeting with Mr Arafat, Mr Zvili said the PLO chairman had said he understood Israeli security worries 'but we should understand the political and psychological problems of the Palestinian people'. In a sign of an apparent softening of the PLO demands for full control over the borders Mr Suleiman Najjab, a PLO executive committee member, said: 'Yes, Israel may keep external security in its hands but not at the expense of Palestinian sovereignty.' Israel Radio said Mr Arafat told Mr Zvili he had instructed his negotiating team 'to sit and discuss until white smoke comes out of the room'. The Yesha Council, the organisation which represents Jewish settlers in occupied Arab lands and opposes the peace agreement, said yesterday's attack would not prevent more people moving into settlements in the occupied territories.</p>

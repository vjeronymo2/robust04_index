			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The watersheds of the six creeks upstream (west) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharge zone span about 684 square kilometers (264 square miles).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This area is referred to as the contributing zone and includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of Travis, Hays, and Blanco counties. The recharge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing zones make up the total area that provides water to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquifer, which equals about 917 square kilometers (354 square miles)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on streamflow studies, Onion Creek and Barton Creek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute the greatest percentages of total recharge to the aquifer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (34 percent and 28 percent, respectively). Williamson, Slaughter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bear, and Little Bear creeks each contribute 12 percent or less to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total recharge. Owing to the amount of recharge contributed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Creek and its proximity to Barton Springs, this creek has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater impact on the water quality at the springs than any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharge source in the Barton Springs segment (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential of the Edwards Aquifer to rapidly transmit large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes of water with little filtration makes it highly susceptible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pollution (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986). The Edwards Aquifer is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``karst'' aquifer, characterized by subsurface features such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caves, sinkholes, and other conduits. The aquifer is made up of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limestones that have high localized permeability and porosity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dissolution of calcium carbonate along faults and fractures in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bedrock forms solution channels similar to an underground network of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipes. Because these subsurface ``pipes'' are not uniformly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed, groundwater movement in the aquifer is highly variable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being rapid in areas where the ``pipes'' are large and extensive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slow where permeability and porosity are low. Transmissivity (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate at which groundwater is transmitted through the aquifer) values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Barton Springs segment have been estimated at 0.3 to 4,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> square meters (3 to 47,000 square feet) per day and tend to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as one moves northward toward the springs (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Karst aquifers are also more prone to pollution than other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquifers because few materials (such as sand, gravel, and organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter) are present to filter out pollutants (U.S. Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection Agency (EPA) 1990). Furthermore, waters entering from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surface receive little filtration from the typically thin soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlying the aquifer (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986). As a result, increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban development over the area supplying recharge waters to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs segment can threaten water quality within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquifer. The Texas Water Commission (TWC) has identified the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Edwards Aquifer as being one of the most sensitive aquifers in Texas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to groundwater pollution (TWC 1989; Margaret Hart, TWC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Barton Springs salamander has been a Category 2 candidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species on the Service's candidate notices of review since December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454; September 18, 1985&hyph;50 FR 37958; January 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989&hyph;54 FR 554; and November 21, 1991&hyph;56 FR 58804), meaning that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information then available indicated that a proposal to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened status was possibly appropriate, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then available to support such a proposal. Through publication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the candidate notices, the Service requests any additional status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that may be available. On January 22, 1992, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a petition from Dr. Mark Kirkpatrick and Ms. Barbara Mahler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to list the Barton Springs salamander. The Service evaluated this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition and on November 25, 1992, determined that the petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented information on threats indicating that the requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action may be warranted. A notice of that finding was published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 11, 1992 (57 FR 58779). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service continued its status review of the species and solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information regarding the status of the salamander. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice requested that comments be submitted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 11, 1993, the Service sent out numerous notification letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that it recognized additional time may be needed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting that pertinent information be submitted by February 10,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993. This proposed rule constitutes the final finding on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned action for the Barton Springs salamander.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service received 205 letters from individuals and agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing information and comments on the petition and the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding. Of the letters received, 104 were form letters stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposition to listing, 80 were other letters opposing listing, 14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported listing, and 7 were neutral. Some of the letters provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional new, substantive information, which was considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making a final determination on the petition. Major comments of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar nature or point are grouped into a number of general issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are presented and discussed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested that the Service delay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or preclude listing the Barton Springs salamander because too little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is known about the salamander's biology, including factors such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its range, population size and status, dietary needs, predators,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longevity, reproductive success, and sensitivity to contaminants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other water quality constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The known range of the Barton Springs salamander is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the most recent information available, including status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys conducted by the University of Texas at Austin and TPWD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to section 6 of the Act, and through personal communication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with biologists who conducted surveys at other springs in central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas. No new information was provided to contradict the finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the salamander is endemic to the immediate vicinity of Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs. Regarding other aspects of the species' biology, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its population status, the Act requires a species to be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened if one or more of the five factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section 4(a)(1) causes it to qualify under the Act's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition. Absolute population number may not be as significant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether a species is endangered or threatened as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge that the species' entire range is threatened and cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preserved (see Factor A, ``The present or threatened destruction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range,'' and Factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D, ``The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms''). Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are still biological questions regarding the Barton Springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander, the Service believes that the available scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is sufficient for status determination and strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supports the need to designate the salamander as an endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. The data that support this conclusion are presented and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of this rule, particularly under Factor A (loss of habitat).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available information on the sensitivity of the salamander and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prey base (amphipods) to water quality deterioration is discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Factors A and E (``Other natural or manmade factors affecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its continued existence''). Once a species becomes listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened or endangered, section 4(f) of the Act directs the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service to develop and implement a recovery plan for that species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recovery is the process by which the decline of a listed species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrested or reversed, and threats to its survival are eliminated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutralized, so that its long-term survival in nature can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensured. Further research is very often an essential component of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery plans. The Service envisions that conducting research on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the salamander's biology and other factors, such as those mentioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this comment, will be an important part of the recovery process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this species (see Available Conservation Measures).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

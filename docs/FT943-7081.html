			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Observer: Not in my backyard They seem to be acting up in the colonies again. Some free spirit has decided to organise a Monarchy and Australia Conference at the Australian High Commission next month and not invite anyone from Buckingham Palace, though it is but a short carriage-ride away. The conference will concentrate on such weighty themes as 'Monarchy to Republic: into the symbolic void', 'How I gave up the Monarchy and came to love the Commonwealth', and 'Rank desire: the imperial underbelly of the order of Australia'. Professor David Cannadine, that well-known royal basher, heads a cast of speakers which includes Tom Nairn on 'The Chances for a Scottish Republic', and the ubiquitous Marina Warner on 'From Britannia to Lady Di'. Admittedly, not all of them have a Republican bent and there will no doubt be a few nods of approval to Sir Robert Menzies, who loyally served the monarchy as Australian prime minister for 16 years. The old boy once told the Queen that in his country 'every man, woman and child who even sees you as a passing glimpse will remember it with joy. In the words of the 17th century poet: 'I did but see her passing by. But yet I love her till I die.' ' He must be turning in his grave at the news that the Sir Robert Menzies Centre for Australian Studies at the University of London is sponsoring the event.</p>

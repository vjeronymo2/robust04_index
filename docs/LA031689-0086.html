			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEN JOHNSON STEROID INQUIRY;  </P> <P> ISSAJENKO DOES NOT RULE OUT SABOTAGE  </P> <P> Despite suggestions to the contrary Wednesday by Ben Johnson's attorney,  Canadian sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko reiterated her previous testimony  that Johnson was aware he had used anabolic steroids and other banned  substances.  </P> <P> But she said that Johnson's positive test for a steroid, stanozolol, after he  had won the 100 meters in the 1988 Olympic Games still confuses her because she  does not believe that he used that particular drug within a year of competing  in Seoul. Doctors say that stanozolol normally clears the system within two  weeks.  </P> <P> Although she previously had told the Canadian government's commission of  inquiry into drug use by athletes that she no longer believes Johnson was  sabotaged, she testified Wednesday that she thinks it was scientifically  possible for Waldemar Matuszewski, the Canadian Olympic track team's physical  therapist, to have purposely rubbed stanozolol into Johnson's system during a  massage in Seoul.  </P> <P> The Polish-born Matuszewski, known as Magic Hands to the athletes he treated,  worked extensively with Johnson, Issajenko and other athletes coached by  Charlie Francis for more than two years before the 1988 Olympics.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Ed Futerman, Johnson's attorney, Issajenko said that  Francis, who testified last week that he could not rule out Matuszewski as a  possible saboteur, suggested a possible motive in a telephone conversation with  her husband, Tony Issajenko, a few days after returning from Seoul last  October.  </P> <P> "My husband said Charlie felt it was most likely Waldemar because he had a  tendency to bother Charlie and the other athletes for money from time to time,"  she said.  </P> <P> Elaborating later in response to a question by Futerman about whether Johnson  trusted Matuszewski, Issajenko recalled a meeting among Francis' athletes at a  training camp last summer in Verona, Italy. She said that Matuszewski had  wanted 5% to 10% of the athletes' earnings. They rejected his demand.  </P> <P> "We all agreed we didn't like that characteristic in Waldemar," she said. "If  we gave 10% to everyone who felt he deserved something, we wouldn't have had  any money left."  </P> <P> Matuszewski will not comment until he is called by the commission to testify,  his attorney said.  </P> <P> Futerman was the 10th attorney Issajenko faced Wednesday, her third and final  full day of testimony. She will return to the witness stand briefly today,  followed by her husband, a former sprinter who also was coached by Francis.  </P> <P> The most dramatic moment Wednesday occurred not during testimony but when  Issajenko's rival of almost a decade, Canadian sprinter Angela Bailey, entered  the hearing room and sat down near the back. During a brief pause, Issajenko  and Bailey stared at each other, not averting their eyes until the questioning  resumed.  </P> <P> Afterward, outside the hearing room, Bailey said that she will ask the  commission for an opportunity to testify. Often a runner-up to Issajenko in the  100 and 200 meters at the Canadian national championships, Bailey publicly  accused Issajenko of drug use on several occasions. Issajenko testified that  she began using steroids in 1979.  </P> <P> "I'm tired of hearing from dirty athletes," Bailey said.  </P> <P> She said that she told the Canadian national coach, Gerard Mach, and other  officials about her suspicions in 1983.  </P> <P> "They told me to keep my mouth shut," she said.  </P> <P> Earlier Wednesday, Issajenko said that she had received death threats from  unidentified telephone callers who did not want her to testify about Johnson's  drug use.  </P> <P> In Seoul, she had told reporters that Johnson did not use drugs.  </P> <P> "When an athlete is caught, that's the standard procedure," she said. "You  deny, you deny, you deny. If the inquiry hadn't been called, we'd be denying to  this day. But once the inquiry was called, I knew we'd have to come out with  the truth. It was over."  </P> <P> Asked during cross-examination by Futerman whether it was possible that Johnson  did not know that he was using steroids, she said, "No, sir."  </P> <P> "OK," he said. "That's your opinion."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- At its session in Frankfurt  on Thursday [14 April], the Central Bank Council of the German  Bundesbank cut the prime rate by 0.25 percentage points. As of  Friday, the discount rate will be reduced from 5.25 percent to  5.0 percent, and the Lombard rate from 6.75 to 6.5 percent.    With its decision, the Central Bank Councils has "responded  to the fact that the prospects for another decrease in the rate  of price increases have improved." In addition, the Bundesbank  assumes that the growth in the money supply will continue to  slow down following the distortions at the turn of the year that  were the result of special factors.    On Thursday, the Bundesbank also announced that in the 1993  fiscal year, the Bundesbank achieved 18.83 billion German marks  [DM] in net earnings, of which DM18.6 billion were transferred  to the accounts of the Federal Government.</p>

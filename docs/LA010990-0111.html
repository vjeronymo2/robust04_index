			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER JOINS ROCK'S HAGAR IN BAJA HOLIDAY  </P> <P> It's unlikely that many in the New Year's Eve crowd at Miguel's Cantina in Cabo  San Lucas recognized the bearded reveler who shared margaritas that night with  heavy-metal icon Sammy Hagar. But if they had, odds are that they would have  been surprised.  </P> <P> "This is really the only vacation I've had" in the last year, freshman Rep.  Dana Rohrabacher said Monday of his five-day sojourn in Baja California with  the lead singer of Van Halen, perhaps the premier heavy-metal rock band in  America. "It really was great."  </P> <P> An unabashed New Wave Republican, Rohrabacher, 42, made a name for himself  during his first year in Congress as a champion of such button-down causes as  Sen. Jesse Helms' attack on federal funding of what he calls indecent artwork  and the preservation of special tax status for employee stock ownership plans.  </P> <P> But there is another side to Rohrabacher, whose 42nd Congressional District  includes northwestern Orange County. And he is not afraid to discuss it.  </P> <P> "Sammy is a good guy, he's really terrific," Rohrabacher said. "Besides loving  America and hating communists, what we really have in common is that we love  tequila."  </P> <P> Which is what Rohrabacher, Hagar and "a gang of us" enjoyed at Miguel's on New  Year's Eve, albeit in cocktail form.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said: "They lock the doors at 11:30 . . . so nobody could come in  -- or go out. You were there. Everybody had a really great time."  </P> <P> Hagar, Rohrabacher said, has a been a good friend -- and a political  contributor -- for several years. They met when Rohrabacher was working as a  speech writer for former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> "A friend of mine called me when I was at the White House," the congressman  said, "and we were talking about the entertainment industry and how far left it  was, and is.  </P> <P> "And he said, 'Well, you know there are a couple of good guys like Sammy Hagar.  . . . He's a rock 'n' roller who loves America and hates commies. . . . In  fact, he had 20,000 kids at a rock concert chanting something obscene about the  communists.'  </P> <P> "And I said, 'Really? This is the kind of guy I should meet.' "  </P> <P> So the speech writer invited the California-based rock star to lunch at the  White House. They talked music and politics, and a White House official who  joined them for lunch persuaded Hagar to record several anti-drug messages, the  congressman said.  </P> <P> "He's anti-drug," Rohrabacher said. "And I'll tell you, for a heavy-metal  guitar player, that is very courageous."  </P> <P> He added, "Since that time, we've become pretty good friends."  </P> <P> So Rohrabacher was not surprised when Hagar invited him to Cabo for the New  Year's holiday. He ended up renting a condo near Hagar's.  </P> <P> The congressman, in fact, drove down from Los Angeles County in Hagar's  just-repaired Ford Bronco, spending five days on Baja's tortuous roads.  </P> <P> "As you might imagine, the car had a great stereo system," he said.  </P></p>

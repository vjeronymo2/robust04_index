			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Large British firms improve liquidity in first quarter Britain's large industrial and commercial companies improved their short-term liquidity positions in the first quarter of this year as they used the proceeds of share and bond issues to build up current financial assets and repay bank borrowings, Peter Norman writes. Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that the overall liquidity ratio of large UK companies increased to 144 per cent at the end of March from 133 per cent at the end of December and 107 per cent at the end of March 1993. The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It is based on a survey of 350 of Britain's biggest companies and gives an indication of the short-term financial strength of the large-company sector. Non-manufacturing companies, including oil companies, were especially flush with liquid assets: their liquidity ratio jumped to 175 per cent at the end of March from 159 per cent at the end of last year and 129 per cent at the end of March last year.</p>

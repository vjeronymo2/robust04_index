			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Upgrade will extend life of NZ smelter Comalco and its Japanese partner Sumitomo are to invest NZDollars 400m (Pounds 155m) in upgrading the Bluff aluminium smelter to extend its life well into the next century. Mr Kerry McDonald, chief executive of Comalco NZ, said that the modernisation programme was essential; without it the smelter, New Zealand's biggest producer of manufactured exports, would have had to be closed, possibly within five years. The upgrade is linked with the granting of controversial new concessional electricity supply agreements to the year 2012 with the government-owned Electricorp. The low tariff has drawn criticism from other manufactuers and consumers. Mr McDonald said that the agreement removed a major area of uncertainty and laid the foundations for the future development and operation of the smelter. He said recent output performance justified the investment. Studies showed the upgrade, which will improve the smelter's technical capability and competitiveness, would contribute net benefits of NZDollars 500m to the economy. Production will rise from 270,000 to 313,000 tonnes a year and further improvements will be allowed for. The third potline will be given additional cells, which will use electricity more efficiently. About NZDollars 100m will be spent on upgrading the air discharge systems to reduce gaseous fluoride and particle emissions. The work is expected to be completed in 1996.  ----------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium           -5,800  to  2,648,425 Aluminium alloy       -200  to  30,420 Copper              -3,475  to  357,375 Lead                +1,075  to  360,650 Nickel                +168  to  132,102 Zinc                +175+3  to  1,192,325 Tin                   -120  to  30,020  -----------------------------------------------</p>

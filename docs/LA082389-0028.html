			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EAST DIVISION-LEADING CUBS CONTINUE SLUMP AS REDS WIN, 7-2  </P> <P> Hardly any sports enthusiast suffers more than a Chicago Cub fan. For nearly  half a century Cub fans have known frustration much more than success.  </P> <P> Even in the years when the Cubs have had good teams, they have let the fans  down.  </P> <P> This year the Cubs have been a delightful surprise. They have been leading the  National League East much of the season.  </P> <P> Is it just another case of false optimism?  </P> <P> Perhaps so.  </P> <P> A defensive and pitching collapse has put the Cubs in their worst slump of the  season.  </P> <P> An error by third baseman Vance Law spoiled the major league debut of Joe  Kraemer Tuesday at Chicago and helped the Cincinnati Reds romp to a 7-2  victory. It was the Cubs' fifth loss in a row.  </P> <P> It was a scoreless game with the Reds batting in the second. There were two  outs and the bases loaded. Pitcher Tom Browning hit a routine grounder and Law  booted it to allow the first run to score. Seldom used Dave Collins followed  with a two-run single and Kraemer never recovered. Neither did the Cubs.  </P> <P> With Browning, one of the hottest pitchers in the league, looking strong,  Cincinnati controlled the game. Browning (13-10), who gave up nine hits, won  his sixth in a row.  </P> <P> "My heart was pounding a million miles a second while I was warming up,"  Kraemer said. "I guess I'm going to have to work on bearing down to get that  third out next time I pitch."  </P> <P> Another error finished Kraemer with two out in the fourth. He gave up seven  hits and six runs in his 3 2/3 innings, but only two runs were earned.  </P> <P> Collins, who had three hits, drove in three runs and scored a run, was playing  because acting manager Tommy Helms played a hunch. Reds' Manager Pete Rose was  absent because his wife gave birth to their second child.  </P> <P> "Dave is a better right-handed hitter and we're so banged up we had to get a  body out there," Helms said.  </P> <P> In the close Eastern division race, three teams are within three games of the  Cubs.  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, New York 0 -- Kevin Mitchell became the first Giant in 20  years to hit 40 home runs, but that wasn't the big story at New York.  </P> <P> Bob Knepper, released last month by Houston and signed by the Giants out of  desperation because of a injury-riddled pitching staff, threw a four-hitter.  </P> <P> Knepper (6-11) pitched his first complete game this season. It was his 30th  shutout and sixth against the Mets.  </P> <P> The Giants had only a 1-0 lead against luckless Frank Viola (1-3) when Robby  Thompson and Will Clark beat out bunts in the sixth inning Mitchell hit a drive  deep into the left-field bleachers. He became only the fourth National Leaguer  to hit 40 home runs in the 80s. Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson also  did it.  </P> <P> In 1969 Willie McCovey hit 45 for the Giants.  </P> <P> St. Louis 10, Atlanta 5 -- Tommy Gregg hit a pinch-hit home run with one out in  the eighth inning at Atlanta to spoil Ted Power's bid for a no-hitter at  Atlanta.  </P> <P> After an error prolonged the inning, Dale Murphy hit a three-run home run and  Power was gone. But, the right-hander who started in the Dodger organization,  had a 10-0 cushion going into the eighth, so he improved to 5-5.  </P> <P> It was the seventh consecutive solid effort for Power, 34, who gave up seven  runs to San Francisco in 1 1/3 innings in his first start July 17. In his last  seven starts he is 4-1. He has pitched 49 2/3 innings, giving up only nine  earned runs.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, with Tony Pena getting three hits and driving in five runs,  moved to within three games of first place.  </P> <P> Paul Assenmacher tied a major league record by striking out four Cardinals in  the fifth inning. The reliever is the 20th to achieve that feat. After two  strikeouts, Assenmacher also struck out Pena, but the third strike was a wild  pitch, a run scoring and Pena reaching first. He then struck out Power.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Houston 1 -- John Smiley is about the only thing the Pirates have  to smile about these days. Smiley (10-7) pitched a six-hitter at Pittsburgh and  dropped the Astros 2 1/2 games behind the Giants in the West.  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla went three for four, including a two-run home run, as the Pirates  ended the Astros' four-game winning streak and beat them for only the third  time in 10 games.  </P> <P> Glenn Davis hit his 31st homer in the ninth to spoil Smiley's shutout.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, San Diego 2 -- Ken Howell gave up only one hit in seven innings  at Philadelphia and Dickie Thon's run-scoring single sparked a three-run  seventh to give him his 10th victory.  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst injured a groin and left after three innings.

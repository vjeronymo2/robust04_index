			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova, Yekaterina Zapodinskaya report in the </F> "Chubays Versus Luzhkov" column: "The Vice Premier Has Made  Good on His Threat"]    [Text] Yesterday the secretariat of Acting General  Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko began consideration of a letter  from Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays over gross violations of the  privatization law by the Moscow mayor and government. This  development opens a way to resolving the conflict between  Chubays and Luzhkov within a legal framework. However, the  length of the examination (not less than a month, according to  prosecution officials), as voucher privatization is drawing to a  close (1 July), reduces the practical value of its results for  the victims.    According to an official source in the General Prosecutor's  Office, Chubays' letter will shortly be given for study to  Deputy General Prosecutor Sabir Kekhlerov, who oversees in  particular the preparation of arbitration suits in court. The  source also said that in all likelihood, consideration of the  "Luzhkov case" will continue for more than a month (one month  under the law) because "a huge number of documents" and even  verbal instructions from the mayor will have to be analyzed. As  a result, on each unlawful decision by the Moscow authorities  with respect to privatization, suits are to be prepared on  annulling all illegal deals.    By going to court, therefore, Chubays made good on his  recent  threat to take measures to countermand a number of Luzhkov's  recent resolutions limiting the conduct of voucher privatization  in Moscow. Regardless of decisions by the General Prosecutor's  Office, Chubays' move can even now yield some political  dividends.    First, the chairman of the State Property Management  Committee has received an opportunity to distance himself  officially from the "catastrophic" (according to Chubays)  consequences of privatization in Moscow which, he believes, will  lead to "a major social explosion on 30 June."    Second, Chubays has relieved himself of the energy-consuming  occupation of the chronic theoretical dispute with efficient  economic manager Luzhkov about the harm and usefulness of  voucher privatization for the people and Russia.    Third, by taking such a step, the head of the State Property  Management Committee has reminded that voucher privatization has  a legal basis (in contrast to the "special" Moscow privatization  program) while his (Chubays') department is responsible only for  the quality of its execution.    All this also responds to Chubays' objectives to demonstrate  to President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin that  he is in full control of the privatization process. This is  especially pertinent since the completion of the final round of  privatization stimulates the activity of the vice premier's  opponents who call for his resignation.    Judging by Luzhkov's recent statements, he is ready for  retaliatory action with respect to Chubays, the author of the  privatization "fraud" (according to Luzhkov). In particular the  mayor has expressed his readiness "with great pleasure" to  arrive at the prosecutor's office together with Chubays where he  intends to explain that "property must be sold, not wasted away,  as is now happening with Chubays-style privatization."    Presumably at today's press conference Yuriy Luzhkov will  acquaint journalists in some detail with his countermeasures.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT DO ARABS WANT?;  </P> <P> APPEASEMENT: MILITANTS KINDLE THE PAN-ARAB DREAM, BUT THEIR AGGRESSIVE FASCISM  POSESA PERMANENT REGIONAL THREAT.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein, in contrast to most other leaders in the contemporary world,  has a grand design, and he has not made a secret of it: He wants to unite the  Arab countries under his leadership and to replace the Soviet Union as the  second superpower. He stated his aim in a number of speeches before the  invasion of Kuwait, at a time when few people outside Iraq paid much attention.  The next five years will be difficult, he said, but given the decline of the  Soviet Union and America's inability to act decisively, the old pan-Arab target  might at long last be achieved.  </P> <P> Hussein's second article of faith is equally simple: Given the essential  weakness of the Arab world, except for its oil weapon, the aim can be reached  only through unorthodox means -- that is, unconventional weapons. Iraq's GNP  would grow sixfold or more if the oil fields within 50 miles of its borders  were incorporated.  </P> <P> Attempts to unite the Arab-speaking world under one leader are not new. This  has been the basic tenet of the Baath Party, founded more than 50 years ago by  Hussein's mentors. It was the main article of faith of Gamal Abdul Nasser, who  had far more charisma and popular support than the Iraqi leader.  </P> <P> If the majority of Arabs want to join forces and establish a single state,  opposition on the part of outsiders would be unjustified. Nor do Washington and  Moscow have a permanent monopoly as far as superpower status is concerned. The  history of mankind is a sequence of the rise and decline of great powers.  </P> <P> But what do the Arabs want? We do not know, for the winds of democratic change  have bypassed the Arab East. There is not one Arab government -- with the  partial exception of Egypt -- that has been popularly elected. The most  militant pan-Arabists also happen to be closest to a modern version of  aggressive fascism, oppressing their own peoples and permanently threatening  their neighbors, Arabs and non-Arabs.  </P> <P> This may change. For now, aggressive dictatorship is the basic fact of  political life in the Middle East. So is the possession of the means of mass  destruction. The combination can be deadly.  </P> <P> It could have been foreseen that the proliferation of nuclear and other  unconventional weapons would sooner or later lead to a situation such as that  now unfolding in the Persian Gulf. The world was a safer place when nuclear  arms were the preserve of a few great powers. Even now it is unthinkable that a  country like Brazil (or India or Israel) would use nuclear devices as an  instrument of war or political pressure -- except when attacked and if national  existence were at stake. Saddam Hussein has made it known that his approach is  different. There is no reason to dismiss it as mere "Arab rhetoric," as some  have done.  </P> <P> But why should the United States take the lead facing this danger? After all,  Iraq will not attack America (or Russia). In principle, the problem should be  dealt with by the Arab world and the United Nations. Unfortunately, the Arab  world is hopelessly divided, incapable of dealing with any problem. As for the  United Nations, it simply does not have the authority and power to deal with a  problem of this kind. It might acquire such power after the first nuclear war,  but hardly before. Could it be that those recommending an Arab or U.N. solution  are voting -- by default -- for nuclear war in the Middle East?  </P> <P> The United States has taken upon itself the ungrateful task of confronting  Hussein because it is the only major power that has the military might and  possibly the political will to do so. Others, if not preoccupied with their own  affairs, have become accustomed to the idea that it is prudent to let America  deal, single-handedly if necessary, with critical situations. But this era is  nearing its end; American power is insufficient to deal with the threats of the  new age of proliferation. Today the problem is Saddam Hussein; tomorrow it  might be an aggressor in another part of the globe.  </P> <P> It is not at all certain whether American resolve is sufficient to deal with  Iraq. The natural inclination of every democracy is toward peace, not war,  except in the case of a clear, present and immediate danger. A land war with  the sole aim of liberating Kuwait makes no military sense. Why sacrifice the  life of a single American for a faraway country about which so little is known  and in which vital American interests are only marginally involved? Why take  the lead if the rest of the world is showing little enthusiasm for any action  that would remove the threat and the means of aggression? There is a high  probability that in the next war the Middle East will go up in flames -- and  not just figuratively. But there is no certainty. Perhaps something totally  unexpected will happen. Perhaps Hussein will be sufficiently frightened not to  engage in further aggression.  </P> <P> Common sense rebels against violent action. The voice of common sense was  Neville Chamberlain who, like all educated Englishmen of his time, knew his  Shakespeare. When he returned from Munich in 1938, he quoted Henry IV: "Out of  this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety." The quotation was right,  but he was mistaken about the flower. Perhaps we shall be luckier, but we  should not count on it.  </P></p>

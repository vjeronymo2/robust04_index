			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Ugly face of naked power They are all the same, these politicians. They only want one thing. Power. We are vouchsafed few details about what they're going to do with it, just that they yearn to be in charge. The demotic question to keep in mind when one of them addresses you - 'why is this lying bastard lying to me?' - is really no question at all. It answers itself - 'because he, or she, wants to have his, or her, wicked way with my vote'. If it had been asked and answered in April 1992, when the Tories produced their now notorious false prospectus on taxation, Mr Neil Kinnock might be UK prime minister today. Think of that. Mr John Smith, Mr Kinnock's successor, shows every sign that he does think about it, and that he will never forget the lesson. At the next election, Labour apparently plans to tell the smallest amount of truth it can possibly get away with. It will say next to nothing about what the party proposes to do if it wins, and less about what its unstated plans might cost. Tough. It would make no odds if Mr Smith was more forthcoming. The differences between the parties are not earth-shattering. The Conservatives, who have enjoyed office for 14 years, seek to extend their empire of patronage whenever they can. Survival apart, they have practically nothing else on their minds. Labour, scenting victory, plots against its natural allies, the Liberal Democrats, so that the latter do not stand in the way of an overall majority. Unduly excited by the government's present nadir of unpopularity, the people's party dreams of absolute power, to be granted by the voters with the generous addition of a blank cheque. Lib Dem successes would blur this fantasy. Winner-takes-all would lose its charm if there were one-and-a-half winners, or a tiresome list of specific promises to deliver. When it comes to the broad thrust of policy, there is not much of a choice. The Tories have perfected the trickle-up theory of economic management, shifting income and wealth from poor to rich. Labour might be expected to redress the balance by a whisker or so, but not much more because that would be inconsistent with Mr Smith's strategy of repositioning it as the party of 'ordinary people' rather than 'the poor'. The Tories are attempting to obliterate all centres of power save Whitehall, which they regard as their natural fiefdom. Labour, which dominates Scotland and often wins local elections, would partially reverse the process. The leaders of both parties are contenders for first prize in the elective dictatorship stakes. They are job-seekers before anything else. Further evidence of the naked ambition of our politicians came this week. On Tuesday, the police and magistrates court bill ran into more trouble in the House of Lords. Thank heavens. The bill would pack local police authorities with Tory puppets nominated by the government. This is getting to be a habit. There must be a Ministry of Strings somewhere. In the bill's original form the home secretary would have had the power to appoint the chairmen, but that was too much for Lord Whitelaw, who scuppered it. He was, however, prevailed upon to support the government's amendments to the bill, which would give the minister power to appoint sufficient members of the authorities to get the chairmanships sewn up in another way. It would all have been done with the deceptive phraseology of amendment 27, which would enable the government to appoint people 'from a list of persons compiled in accordance with an order made by the secretary of state'. What weasels our parliamentary draughtsmen are] In a debate that should become a set-piece for students of the history of liberty in Britain, Lord McIntosh, for Labour, exposed the sham. If a list was compiled in accordance with the home secretary's or-der, and then the home secretary made the appointment from that list, he had the whole responsibility in his hands. Other speakers pointed out the partisan nature of the proposal, which would nationalise the British police. It came out of the ministerial head. No royal commission sat, no select committee voted, nobody outside the Conservative party dreamed it up. None of the 360 organisations that expressed an opinion backed the government. Lord Rippon cited the liberal economist FA Hayek in support of the contention that 'you cannot have real, effective democracy without real, effective local government'. This should be engraved on the hearts of our Conservative, supposedly Hayekian, cabinet ministers. Outnumbered on its own side, the government withdrew its amendments; it will doubtless apply further devilish cunning in an effort to secure its original intent. Labour's perception that it may be destined to rule again in solitary glory was also revealed this week. The death of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan will mean a by-election in the southern constituency of Eastleigh. In the natural course of events, this would be won by the Lib Dems. In 1992, they captured 28 per cent of the vote against Labour's 21 per cent. Following the pattern of recent by-elections, and assuming a comparatively low swing against the government, tactical voting would put almost any Lib Dem candidate in the Commons. Assume, however, that the voters are led in a different direction. Forget about the advantage accruing to the Lib Dems because they start ahead of Labour. Recall that Labour did better, and the Lib Dems worse, in 1992 than 1987. Then a projection of opinion poll figures for all three parties puts Labour in. Mr Smith has decided to go for broke. If he succeeds, he will have demonstrated his party can win down south. The Lib Dems, most of whose policies Labour has already borrowed, would become redundant. The gamble is huge: splitting the anti-Tory vote could give the Conservatives a much-needed victory. Bewitched by the prospect of sweeping all before him, the Labour leader is clearly prepared to risk that. Can it be that in the eyes of Mrs Margaret Beckett, his steely deputy, even a Tory victory would be better than a Lib Dem advance, provided only that Labour moved from third to second place? Never mind what they say, these gamblers at the high table of power, watch what they do. We have to accept their governance when they win, but oh what a joy it is to see them, any of them, go down.</p>

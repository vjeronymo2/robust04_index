			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Providing housing for special needs populations such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeless persons, abused or battered persons, persons with AIDS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentally or physically disabled persons, or persons with substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse problems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Providing housing in rural areas or areas targeted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local, state or federal governments for community development or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revitalization through the development of affordable housing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic investment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Providing housing with special services to meet the needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of low- or moderate-income households including, but not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, child care, job training, medical care, substance abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, independent living skill training, and rental household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and homeowner household counseling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> District Bank priority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for projects that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council and adopted by the Bank's board of directors that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address a housing need in the Bank's district and are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the purposes of this part. The Bank shall describe in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP implementation plan how the points for the priority or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities will be distributed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Economic mobility priority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for projects that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide housing for low- or moderate-income households that move  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighborhoods, mixed-income buildings or owner-occupied housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developments in which at least 50 percent of the households have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes above the median income for the area, as published by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Targeting_20-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application can receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum of 20 points for this category. The Bank shall award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an application based on the extent to which the project has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of units reserved for households at certain income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other objectives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The five other objectives categories are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as set forth in the following paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section. The Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define more specifically each of the five other objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfying each category. For each category, the Bank shall award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application(s) that best achieve(s) the objective, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a declining scale basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AHP subsidy per unit_10-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall award points to applications based on the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-subsidized unit. Projects should be scored relative to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate group. This scoring criterion may not include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percentage of the project's total development cost that is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be financed with the AHP subsidy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicant participation_5-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can receive a maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall award points to applications based on the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project involves participation by applicants other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such participation can be financial or non-financial, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the project, applicant involvement on the boards of nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsors, and applicant provision of technical assistance to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit sponsors for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Community involvement_10-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall award points to applications based on the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is demonstrated support for the project by local community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as through the commitment by such organizations and individuals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Community stability_10-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award points to applications based on the extent to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committing to a greater long-term period pursuant to &sect;960.5;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or being integrally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or stabilization is not identified as a special needs category by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank pursuant to &sect;960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or moderate-income households, or if such displacement will occur,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of such displacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Innovation_5-point category.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application can receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank shall award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.11  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Modifications of approved AHP applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application before completion and occupancy of the project must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and approval.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Moody's cuts GM's credit ratings GENERAL Motors, the embattled US carmaker, suffered an embarrassing and potentially costly financial blow yesterday when Moody's Investors Service, the credit information agency, lowered its ratings of the company's debt. The downgrade, which will tend to raise GM's borrowing costs, will be felt particularly hard by General Motors Acceptance Corporation, GM's huge financial services arm. It relies on the short-term commercial paper market as an important source of cheap funds, which it then uses to offer financing on GM vehicle sales. Its commercial paper rating has fallen from Prime-1, the very top rating, to Prime-2, which will push up the interest rates GMAC has to pay to sell its paper and may make it harder to place the securities. A dramatic reshuffle of GM's top management at the start of this month was prompted in part by boardroom concern that the two leading credit information agencies - Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors - might be about to lower the company's ratings. Standard &amp; Poors is still considering its position. The upheaval included the resignation under pressure of Mr Robert Stempel, GM's chairman, and the formation of a much younger management team led by Mr Jack Smith, the new chief executive. Moody's downgrade also includes GM's senior debt, which is lowered from Single A-2 status to Baa1 and its preference stock, which falls from Single A-3 to Baa3. GM is being forced to cut production at its Belgian car assembly plant in Antwerp in the face of 'declining prospects' for new car sales in western Europe, writes Kevin Done. GM said it would eliminate 13 production days during the first four months of 1993 at the Antwerp plant, which can produce 407,000 cars a year.</p>

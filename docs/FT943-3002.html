			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Fears over Cuban influx The Cayman Islands is facing a crisis over the British colony's inability to deal with almost 1,000 Cuban refugees, and there are fears that the territory's stability could be harmed by refugees' reaction to a plan to repatriate them, according to government officials, Canute James reports from Kingston. Britain has sent hundreds of camp beds to the islands, where the administration is awaiting security assistance from the US to deal with the refugees. The leader of a Cuban-American group is asking the British government to prevent the repatriation of Cubans by the Caymanian authorities.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / French try to hook fish-eaters France launched a FFr10m (Pounds 1.14m) campaign to persuade consumers to eat more fish, a concession to fishermen who staged a violent strike earlier this month. The campaign is partly funded by the European Union. Radio advertisements depict French fishermen as unsung heroes, bringing home the fish after a night at sea. EU and other trading partners have accused France of bending international trade rules by imposing lengthy border checks, stringent veterinary controls and minimum prices on imported fish.</p>

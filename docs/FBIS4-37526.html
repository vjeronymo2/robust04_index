			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libyan Opposition Meeting in </F> Washington; Reports of Civil Disobedience in Bani Walid"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The National Assembly  of the (opposition) National Front for the Salvation of Libya  will hold a meeting in Washington before the end of July.    Muhammad Fa'iz Jibril, the Front's representative in Cairo,  has emphasized that the meeting will discuss several proposals  to tackle conditions in Libya in the light of the reports  submitted by the Front's representatives inside and outside  Libya.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Jibril pointed out that  the Front will discuss the situation in the event that the  international sanctions imposed on Libya are intensified as a  result of the Libyan leadership's refusal to hand over the two  Libyan Lockerbie suspects.    The Libyan oppositionist said that the internal situation  will head the agenda of the Front's National Assembly. He  pointed to the continuation of popular tension in the city of  Bani Walid, stronghold of the "Warfallah" tribe, a pillar of  President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's regime.    Jibril said that Bani Walid has long been experiencing a  state of undeclared civil disobedience in the wake of the  accusations al-Qadhdhafi leveled at a number of officers (55  officers) belonging to the Warfallah tribe, namely that they  worked to recruit elements to work for the United States.    He added that Bani Walid is currently under a tight security  siege for fear of the state of civil disobedience spreading to  other areas.</p>

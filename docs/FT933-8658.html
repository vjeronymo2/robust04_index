			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Early new-car registrations jump 11.6% REGISTRATIONS of new cars in the first 10 days of August jumped by 11.6 per cent to 249,153 from 223,283 in the same period last year. The beginning of August is the busiest period of the year for the retail motor industry and a key test of the state of new-car demand. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday that forecasts for a year-on-year increase in sales for the whole of August to 'at least 400,000' from 374,000 were 'realistic'. Vauxhall, the second-placed carmaker in the UK market, said that it expected an 11 per cent increase in total August sales to 415,000. Ford, the market leader, was less optimistic and forecast sales of between 400,000 and 405,000. Mr Geoffrey Pelling, SMMT deputy chief executive, said the 11.6 per cent rise in the first 10 days 'clearly indicates that market recovery is continuing'. New-car sales have been higher year-on-year in 13 of the past 16 months, and registrations in the first seven months of the year rose by 9.1 per cent to 874,411. The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where sales are growing, albeit from a very depressed level. Sales in the first 10 days of August were well below the record level of 307,237 achieved in the same period in 1989, which showed 'how severely UK sales have suffered since then', said Mr Pelling. 'It would be dangerous to assume that car manufacturers in the UK will remain impervious to the effects of the Continental recession,' he added. Vauxhall announced last week that it would have to continue short-time working at its Luton and Ellesmere Port plants during August. During the first 10 days of August, which account for about 60 per cent of the sales for the full month, the biggest gains were achieved by Renault and Citroen, the French carmakers, and by Vauxhall. Renault and Citroen increased their sales volumes by more than a third, while Vauxhall increased its sales by 19 per cent to capture 16.8 per cent of the market compared with 15.7 per cent a year ago. Ford suffered a further erosion of its market share which fell to 21.3 per cent from 22.7 per cent a year ago as strong sales of its Mondeo were offset by falling demand for its Escort and Fiesta ranges. Volkswagen is also suffering from falling sales and was forced to take action this week to lower its list prices to stem the decline. Ford's share has been steadily eroded in recent years, falling from 28.8 per cent in 1987 to 22.2 per cent last year, its lowest share since 1975. By contrast Vauxhall's share has risen from 13.5 per cent in 1987 to a record 16.7 per cent last year. In the first seven months of the year Ford gained 21.7 per cent of the new-car market compared with the 17.3 per cent held by Vauxhall.</p>

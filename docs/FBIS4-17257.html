			<p>BFN     [Text] After Wednesday's extraordinary session, a complex  situation arose in the Saeima. At today's scheduled news  conference, Saeima Associate Chairman Aivars Berkis gave the  following account of the session:    [Begin Berkis recording] I have not seen such a dramatic  situation since the August coup of 1991 as that experienced by  the Latvian Parliament last night. The extraordinary session  was convened at the request of deputies of the radical right,  For the Fatherland and Freedom and the Latvian National  Independence Movement [LNNK], in order to block the signing of  any of the agreements initialled on 15 March with Russia, and to  form a new delegation for the talks. Only 26 deputies, however,  voted for this bill, for the individual paragraphs; there was no  (?vote) for it as a whole.    Thereafter, with the deputies of the Fatherland and Freedom  and the LNNK, together with Equal Rights deputies and Popular  Harmony Party deputies not taking part in the vote, the version  favored by the state president and supported by the Latvian Way  and Peasants' Union factions -- wanting the signing of the first  three draft agreements and favoring clarification of the  agreement on retired military personnel and its corresponding  with the norms of international law -- was also rejected.    Therefore, on an issue of great importance to Latvia, its  security and future, the Saeima was at the same time both  against signing the agreements and against not signing the  agreements. In such a situation the state president was  entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima, which would  mean a referendum, new elections, and a whole string of  unforeseeable complications. Or else the simpler way out -- to  raise the question of confidence in the government on its  handling of foreign and security policy. Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs proposed such a vote of confidence. In my opinion this  was an (?impetuous) decision, because most of the deputies in  the governing coalition were not at the plenary session.  However, the result was positive: Of the 87 present, 51  supported the government's course.    I believe that if all those deputies loyal to the government  had been present, then (?69) of the votes would have been in the  government's favor (?against 30), which would be more than in  the autumn, when the Saeima voted for the then newly formed  government of Valdis Birkavs. In my opinion this vote is  sufficient proof that the state president, together with the  prime minister, can continue its dialogue with Russia. [end  recording]    So, today, in the Saeima, the government received a vote of  confidence. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article, under the rubric "Returning to What Has Been </F> Printed": "Don't Be Surprised if Chernobyl Repeats Itself"]    [Text] In connection with an appeal made by workers  from the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" production repair  enterprise [PRP] to the president and government of the Russian  Federation [RF] (see RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 22 February 1994), the  "Rosenergoatom" concern, at the instruction of the Russian  Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], has informed our editors of  the following:    Minatom and the "Rosenergoatom" concern are  seriously concerned about the situation that has come about in  the country's nuclear power complex.    As of 23 February 1994, the indebtedness to Russia's  nuclear power stations for electrical energy supplied by the  "YeES Rossiya" RAO (Russian joint-stock company) and the  territorial energy systems totaled 409,812 million rubles [R].    This has led to the indebtedness of the nuclear power  stations to their suppliers of fuel and material resources, to  contractors, and to the budget of R341,183 million and has also  led to rebuilding, modernizing, and technical re-equipping work  on nuclear power stations being scaled back, which has had a  negative effect on ensuring their safety.    There are delays of many months in the payment of  wages, and programs for the socioeconomic development of  collectives are not being implemented.    Taking into account the complex financial situation of  the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" PRP, the "Rosenergoatom"  concern has been systematically rendering the enterprise  assistance.    At the initiative of Minatom and the "Rosenergoatom"  concern, the RF government has made several decisions aimed at  stabilizing the financial situation in the nuclear power  complex; however, these have not improved the situation  substantially. In the first two months of 1994, nuclear power  stations were paid for only 25 percent of the electrical energy  they supplied.    At the present time, the "Rosenergoatom" concern, along  with the "YeES Rossiya" RAO, is striving to reduce indebtedness  by means of the mutual cancellation of debts, the introduction  of bill of exchange circulation, the payment of debts in the  form of goods, and so on.    [Signed] Concern President Ye. N. Pozdyshev    With this letter, the concern's president, whom RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA editors thank for his attention to their publication,  also sent six pages of appendixes. Especially interesting is  appendix No. 3, "A List of Government Decisions on the Issue of  Financial Provision for Nuclear Power Work." The list contains  12 decisions, and only one of them is marked: "Implemented."    What about the rest? Ominous formulations: "To ensure the  immediate implementation, . . ." "Take immediate exhaustive  measures. Report. Deadline 10 days," "Within a week's time,  finish putting together and distributing financial funds. . . .  Report to Russian government on implementation by 10 December."  If, God forbid, a new Chernobyl ever comes crashing down,  someone is going to use these notes to compose an entire story  of how people tried to avert disaster. In conclusion, we will  mention two documents.    Here is an instruction from the chairman of the RF  government's Council of Ministers, V. S. Chernomyrdin, No.  VCh-P14-41316, of 4 December 1993, to B. G. Fedorov, V. V.  Gerashchenko, O. N. Soskovets, and Ye. T. Gaydar on a working  memo from the first deputy head of the department of industry,  O. S. Pushkareva, of 3 December 1993, no. P14-11-1133, "On the  Emergency Situation in Russian Nuclear Power."    On the document is Fedorov's instruction to Gerashchenko:  "Situation critical. I ask you to submit within three  days' time proposals for stabilizing the financial situation in  nuclear power."    Here is an instruction from the first deputy chairman of the  RF government, O. N. Soskovets, of 22 January 1994, no.  OS-P14-01786, on the subject of a letter from the Russian State  Committee on Emergency Situations about the critical situation  in nuclear power.    It is addressed to Minatom (to S. K. Dubinin), the Bank of  Russia (V. I. Solovov), the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy  (Mintopenergo) (V. N. Kostyukin), and "YeES Rossiya" RAO (A. F.  Dyakov). The words are more than alarming: "Multiple  instructions from the government of the Russian Federation on  this issue . . . have been systematically ignored, which is  having a substantial effect on the safety of nuclear power  stations. I ask you, in conjunction with Minatom and other  interested organizations, to examine without delay the issues  involved in the financial stabilization of nuclear power  stations and to take effective measures."    The note on both documents reads: NOT IMPLEMENTED.</p>

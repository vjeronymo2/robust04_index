			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIMINAL INDICTMENT OF EXXON IN ALASKA OIL SPILL IS UPHELD  </P> <P> A federal judge on Friday upheld the government's indictment of Exxon and  rejected a plea to throw out criminal charges stemming from last year's massive  Exxon Valdez oil spill.  </P> <P> "I deny all motions to dismiss," U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland said  after a two-hour hearing in which Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. sought to  have the charges against them thrown out.  </P> <P> The ruling, to be followed by a written opinion later, was welcomed by Justice  Department lawyers, who are prosecuting the two Exxon companies for the  nation's worst oil spill.  </P> <P> "The indictment is proper and fairly puts the defendants on notice of what they  have to defend against," Holland said in a brief statement. Exxon lawyers at  the hearing voiced disappointment over their defeat but said there would be no  appeal.  </P> <P> The trial has been set for April 10, more than two years after the tanker Exxon  Valdez rammed into Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and spilled 11 million  gallons of oil into pristine waters, fouling rich fishing grounds and wildlife  habitat.  </P></p>

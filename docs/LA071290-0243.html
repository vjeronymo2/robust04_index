			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: GARDEN GROVE'S FRIENDLY HENRY'S  </P> <P> The bartender at Henry's Restaurant is an Indian biker named Stroker. The  waitress is Faye and the owner is Rae. There's no one named Henry; the place  was named after the previous owner's poodle. A memorial plaque to Uncle Walty  is embedded in the bar. Uncle Walty was a regular who always sat at the same  corner stool. When he died, his friends missed him so much that they took up a  collection to mark his spot: "Walter L. Whitlock, 1917-1984."  </P> <P> That's the kind of place Henry's is.  </P> <P> Henry's is on a side street just off Garden Grove Boulevard, where it shares a  building with Dave &amp; Jim's Brake Shop and the All State Construction Co.  Stroker's Harley is usually parked out front.  </P> <P> The clientele is off-duty cops, construction workers, bikers, letter carriers  from the nearby post office -- a devoted, tightknit group. The same faces pop  up repeatedly in a collection of fading Polaroids tacked to a bulletin board  near the jukebox, where they document nearly a decade of Super Bowl Sundays and  personal milestones celebrated at Henry's, like birthdays and retirements.  </P> <P> A combination cafe and beer bar, it's many things to many people, depending on  the time of day. For some, it's the perfect place for an early breakfast,  complete with loads of homemade hash browns. Regulars fetch their own coffee in  mugs kept behind the bar just for them.  </P> <P> The faithful return at lunchtime for Rae's blue-plate specials (most of them  have the menu memorized). The most popular items are the beef dip sandwich and  the corned beef on rye. Both come with homemade fries (the potato is very big  here).  </P> <P> Sound a little heavy on the cholesterol? Not to worry. Last year, Faye and Rae  held a yard sale in the parking lot to raise money for a customer's heart  transplant.  </P> <P> On weekdays the kitchen closes at 5 p.m., just as the bar crowd starts filing  in for a cold one after work. It's a friendly place. Newcomers will feel  welcome, especially during the raucous pool and dart tournaments held to  benefit local charities or friends in need.  </P> <P>  Henry's Restaurant, 10549 Stanford Ave., Garden Grove. Opens at 6 a.m. Mondays  through Saturdays and closes between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., depending on the  crowd. Kitchen closes at 5 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on Saturdays. (714)  537-9884.  </P> <P> JANICE L. JONES  </P></p>

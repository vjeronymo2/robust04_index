			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: Sack it to 'em A ticklish problem for Norway's Santas. Once the European Economic Area trade pact between the EC and Efta is implemented, how will Norway's 1,472 Jule Nisser, as they are called locally, wriggle out of EC regulations for Santa costumes and maintain their Norwegian identity? At present, the Norwegian version sports rather boring black trousers, white shirt, red stocking cap, and, of all things, a mask. But they are rather attached to the apparel, and, despite the chill northern winds, would hate to be seen disappearing down a chimney in the cuddly red fleece suits and black patent belts of their Anglo-American counterparts. At their annual gathering this week, the Yuletide folk heard of a second, still chillier, prospect, namely that EC equal opportunity legislation will force them to allow women a turn with the gift sack.</p>

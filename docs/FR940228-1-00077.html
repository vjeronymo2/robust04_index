			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification for institutions that seek a renewal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the general standards of financial responsibility under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial and administrative resources to participate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement where an approved third party controls the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete award year for which figures are available; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities that may be identified during the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an institution during the last complete award year for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures are available provides the most accurate indication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that could meet this proposed standard has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established a track record for meeting its financial obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the institution during the last complete award year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which figures are available because the institution would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that has not been considered financially responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under proposed &sect;668.15 at any time within the past five years, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the institution is not considered financially responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the following reasons (as delineated in &sect;668.15(c)(2)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a final decision of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

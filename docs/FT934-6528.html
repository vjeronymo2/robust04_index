			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Powerful position for Hopewell - A flotation offering exposure to Chinese electricity Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure conglomerate controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday brought its electric power assets to the Hong Kong stock market in a capital raising initially worth nearly HKDollars 11bn (USDollars 1.4bn). The deal offers investors the chance to participate in China's expanding electricity industry. For Hopewell, it means a profit of nearly HKDollars 1.2bn on its investments in electric power, and the transfer of about HKDollars 390m of debt from its balance sheet to that of Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the subsidiary to be floated. Today, Hopewell offers Hong Kong investors 93.6m CEPA shares at HKDollars 12.50 each. The company's financial advisers, Peregrine Capital and Wardley, said yesterday that 381.4m shares at HKDollars 12.50 each had been placed with international investors. In total, Hopewell will raise some HKDollars 6bn through the flotation and placements. In the words of one of CEPA's advisers, the float is 'not the most straightforward of offerings'. Hopewell has subscribed to 475m shares in CEPA at HKDollars 10 a share, and is selling these to investors at HKDollars 12.50 each. Hopewell will also subscribe to 800m shares at HKDollars 10 each. Half of this is payable now and the remainder in two equal instalments on successive anniversaries of CEPA's December 6 listing. On full payment of the partly paid shares, Hopewell's interest will rise to 62.8 per cent. CEPA comes to market with one of the most demanding valuations ever seen in the colony. The offer price represents a prospective price to earnings ratio of about 40 times forecast 1994 earnings of HKDollars 208m, and a 32.4 per cent premium over net tangible assets of HKDollars 9.44 a share. However, analysts said the small size of the public offering combined with demand for CEPA shares should ensure that its shares perform well initially. In the longer term, the company's fortunes will depend on the extent to which Mr Wu can replicate past successes in building and operating power stations in China and the Philippines. Indeed, CEPA is almost a pure 'concept' stock and a gamble not only on Mr Wu's business skills but on China's future. As Mr Eamonn McManus, director of corporate finance at Wardley, one of the company's financial advisers, said yesterday: 'People are investing in an energy fund; they are buying Gordon Wu's expertise and track record.' Valuing the company is difficult and highly subjective, said Mr Archie Hart, director of research at Crosby Securities, a local brokerage. 'The value of this company is in a lot of deals yet to be made. What is the real value of this company? I don't know.' The balance investors have to strike is between China and, more broadly, Asia's demand for electric power and the likelihood that 'letters of intent' and 'preliminary discussions' which CEPA has with provincial mainland authorities will materialise into contracts. China's demand for power and its desire to develop rapidly its generating capacity is a matter of record. Annual electricity consumption per head was just 562kW in 1991, against 4,418kW in Hong Kong and 11,333kW in the US. China wants to add between 10,000 and 15,000 megawatts of capacity each year until the end of the century. CEPA believes it is well placed to build some of this extra capacity. According to its prospectus, CEPA has a 'preliminary agreement' to install 1,320MW of power generating capacity in Guangxi province; 'letters of intent' to install 6,600MW of power in Jiangsu, Henan and Shandong provinces; and has had 'preliminary discussions' with two localities to install up to 3,900MW of capacity. Mr Stewart Elliot, CEPA chief executive, indicated yesterday that up to 14 other deals on the Chinese mainland were being discussed when he said that CEPA has 20 letters of intent from various provinces. But he agreed that investors were buying CEPA on the basis of its future prospects. He said, however, there was 'absolutely no doubt' in his mind that the projects referred to in the company's prospectus would materialise. After the CEPA float, 'negotiations to formal contracts will come very shortly,' Mr Elliot said. Hopewell has demonstrated its ability to build large power stations below budget and ahead of schedule. Currently under construction are Shajiao-C in Guangdong - a 3x600MW coal-fired station - and Pagbilao in the Philippines, which is a 2x367.5MW unit. Together with other projects in the Philippines and China, these constitute the company's assets. When they are constructed, CEPA will have generating capacity of 4,000MW, making it one-and-a-half times the size of Hongkong Electric and two-thirds the size of China Light &amp; Power. Mr Elliot says the company's strategic aim is to become the 'principal independent supplier of power in Asia for the foreseeable future.' Part of this entails becoming a retailer of off-the-shelf power stations. CEPA, Mr Elliot claims, is close to achieving what every first world power utility would like to do: standardise its product. Savings from standardisation would amount to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the cost of generation equipment, he said.</p>

EPA also intends to enter into cooperative agreements with federally-recognized Indian governing bodies to provide financial assistance for the development of similar accreditation and certification programs. The notice describes eligible activities, application procedures and requirements, and funding criteria. EPA anticipates that a minimum of $11,200,000 will be available during federal fiscal year 1994 (FY94) for awards to eligible recipients. There are no matching share requirements for this assistance. Subject to future budget limitations, EPA plans to provide this support on a continuing multi-year or program basis. All cooperative agreements will be administered by the appropriate EPA regional office. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number assigned to this new program is 66.707. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to be considered for funding during the FY94 award cycle, all applications must be received by the appropriate EPA regional office on or before May 1, 1994.

Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551.

To achieve authorization under Title IV of TSCA, programs must: (1) Be as protective of human health and the environment as the federal program established under TSCA section 402 or 406, or both, and (2) provide adequate enforcement. For states and territories that fail to obtain authorization within 2 years following promulgation of TSCA section 402 or 406 regulations, EPA must, by such date, administer and enforce a program for TSCA section 402 or 406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Title IV of TSCA, EPA encourages states and territories to develop accreditation and certification programs for lead-based paint activities. EPA therefore recommends that eligible parties seek funding through the TSCA section 404(g) assistance program, which is now being implemented to help achieve these ends. EPA further recommends that eligible parties plan to utilize this grant support in a way that complements any related financial assistance they may receive from other federal sources, most notably funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). EPA will, however, seek to ensure that all federally-funded lead activities are undertaken in a coordinated fashion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that forthcoming regulations mandated under sections 402 and 404 of TSCA will address the eligibility of federally-recognized Indian governing bodies to receive assistance under TSCA section 404(g). Until such time as these regulations are published, EPA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with Indian governing bodies pursuant to section 10(a) of TSCA for the development of programs similar to those funded under TSCA section 404(g). As a result, unless otherwise indicated, when used in this notice the term ``states'' includes Indian governing bodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will work with prospective applicants to develop cooperative agreements which promote a variety of objectives deemed critical to the success of its national lead program. These include: (1) Permitting flexible approaches to reducing lead hazards, (2) developing a nationwide pool of qualified lead abatement professionals, (3) encouraging pollution prevention in lead-based paint activities, (4) promoting environmental justice in the reduction of lead exposures and the prevention of lead poisoning, (5) fostering the establishment of comprehensive and integrated lead management programs by states, territories and Indian governing bodies, and (6) promoting reciprocity among authorized programs in the training and certification of lead abatement professionals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All states are eligible to apply for and receive assistance under section 404(g) of TSCA. The term ``state,'' for purposes of eligibility, refers broadly to any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Canal Zone, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States. Federally-recognized Indian governing bodies are eligible to apply for and receive assistance under section 10(a) of TSCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``TSCA Title IV State Lead Grants Program'' is a financial assistance program administered by EPA under authority of TSCA section 404(g). EPA plans to award all funds to Indian governing bodies under authority of TSCA section 10(a) during the first-year award cycle (FY94). Each of EPA's 10 regional administrators will be delegated the authority to enter into cooperative agreements with eligible states and Indian governing bodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Activities to be Funded Under Cooperative Agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that when TSCA Title IV was enacted on October 28, 1992, states had widely varying capabilities for addressing lead hazards. Individual states will eventually fall within one of three broad categories of program development: (1) States without lead programs, (2) states with programs that are likely to qualify for authorization under TSCA section 402 that may need assistance in carrying out these programs, and (3) states with lead programs that will require modification before qualifying for authorization. Each state's need for assistance will vary, in part, according to the level of lead program development the state has attained. The type of program activity a given state seeks to pursue may also vary in a corresponding manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA generally supports all state activities aimed at developing or carrying out authorized state lead programs, the Agency does recognize certain priorities. Because few states currently have programs which parallel the forthcoming TSCA sections 402 and 406 standards, EPA's highest priority will be to support the development of new state programs. A second priority will be to support the continued implementation of existing state programs which are working toward timely authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although these priorities do not constitute the Agency's criteria for award determinations, EPA will consider these items in its cooperative agreement negotiations with applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has established three general funding categories that reflect the different status, or levels, of state lead program development. These are: (1) Level One - Develop New State Programs, (2) Level Two - Carry Out Authorized State Programs, and (3) Level Three - Carry Out Existing State Programs Which Do Not Yet Qualify For Authorization Under Title IV. Because the regulations required under TSCA sections 402 and 404 which would define the criteria for obtaining program authorization have not yet been promulgated, however, activities in only two of the three funding categories, Level One and Level Three, will be eligible for funding consideration during the FY94 award cycle. Activities in Level Two can only be considered after the TSCA sections 402/404 regulations have taken effect. Numerous examples of activities considered to be eligible for funding are described in a separate EPA publication entitled ``Fiscal 1994 TSCA Title IV Cooperative Agreement Guidance'' (January 1994) (the ``grant guidance''). Copies of the grant guidance may be obtained through any of EPA's 10 regional offices at the addresses listed under Unit VI of this notice. It is important to note, however, that the examples presented in the guidance are not exhaustive, and applicants are not limited in their proposals to the listed tasks. Individual state program innovations are eligible and encouraged, so long as the proposed tasks relate to the purposes set forth in TSCA section 404(g) and fit within the Level One or Three funding category. These two funding categories are not mutually exclusive, and it is permissible for a state's work plan to combine elements from each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Selection Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the FY94 award cycle, EPA expects a minimum of $11,200,000 to be available for distribution to eligible applicants. The Agency will use a two-tiered system to allocate these funds. This system is aimed at achieving the broadest possible state participation, while at the same time, targeting areas with the greatest potential lead hazard and risk. It accomplishes this by providing for a tier-one distribution of ``base funding,'' followed by a tier-two distribution of ``formula funding,'' where additional funds are distributed based upon the relative lead burden estimated to exist within a state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each state (excluding territories and federally-recognized Indian governing bodies) that submits a qualifying proposal will be entitled to a base funding allotment of $100,000. In addition, base funding of up to $50,000 will be reserved for each of the five ``territories'' (used generically in this context) that have been administratively assigned to an EPA regional office and that have historically participated in EPA toxics cooperative agreement programs. These ``base'' territories include the U.S. Virgin Islands (Region 2), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Region 2), the District of Columbia (Region 3), Guam (Region 9) and American Samoa (Region 9). The two remaining ``non-base'' territories, the Canal Zone and the Northern Mariana Islands, are also eligible to apply for funding up to $50,000 apiece, but are not considered in determining the base funding allotments. Base allotments are primarily intended to ensure that those states and base territories wishing to pursue authorization under TSCA section 404 will be guaranteed a minimum level of funding for this purpose. The maximum amount of base funding set-aside in FY94 will be $5,250,000. Any unsubscribed base funding will be added to the formula funds pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once base funding allotments have been reserved for all eligible applicants, remaining funds will be treated as ``formula funds.'' Before applying the lead burden formula, however, EPA will subtract from the formula account an amount not to exceed $50,000 for each Indian governing body and non-base territory not otherwise factored into the base funding apportionment. EPA cannot reliably predict the level of participation from Indian governing bodies and non-base territories; therefore, where these eligible parties do apply for funds, they will be assigned to an appropriate regional office for administrative oversight, and that regional office will become responsible for determining the appropriate level of funding. These parties, however, will not receive a formula ranking, and will not be eligible to compete for additional formula allocations based upon lead burden calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a third step, states and base territories with funding requirements exceeding their base allotments will then be apportioned additional sums based upon their relative lead burden. In calculating lead burden for the formula rankings, EPA used readily available data derived from the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, together with other data from HUD. The formula uses four factors to generate an estimate of the potential lead problem, or ``lead burden,'' in each state. Two of these factors, the number of housing units with lead-based paint and the number of children under age 7, express the potential magnitude of the lead problem. The remaining two factors, the fraction of young children in poverty and the fraction of low-income housing units with lead-based paint, express the potential severity of the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining formula rankings, each state and base territory is scored independently for each factor, and the four individual factor scores for the state or base territory are then summed to obtain an overall score for that state or base territory (a combined factor score). The combined factor scores of all states and base territories applying for formula funds (or amounts in excess of their base allotment) are then summed, and the percentage of the total sum represented by the individual state's or base territory's score is then identified. When the total formula funding available is then multiplied by the percentage score of an individual state or territory, the state's or base territory's ceiling formula allotment can be obtained. For example, assume that: (1) All 50 states but none of the base territories apply for formula allotments, (2) state X has a percentage score of 2 percent, and (3) a total of $4,000,000 in formula funding is available. In determining how much money to allot to state X, EPA would multiply $4,000,000 by .02. The product, $80,000, represents the maximum additional funding that could be awarded to state X to supplement its base allocation. State X would then qualify for up to $180,000 in total funding for the fiscal year ($100,000 in base funding + $80,000 in formula funding).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the maximum, or ceiling, formula allotments will fluctuate inversely with the number of applicants. The greater the number of applicants, the lower the ceiling will tend to be, and vice versa. Formula allotments will be determined only after the annual application deadline has passed and EPA has full knowledge of the total amount of funds requested. If one or more states or base territories request formula fund amounts below their ceiling allotments, residual formula funds will be available. Where this situation develops, if there are still other states or base territories with unfunded needs, the formula will be run again. This procedure can be repeated until all formula funds have been fully allotted. The FY94 combined factor scores for each state and base territory, derived from the census data, are presented in the grant guidance along with a technical appendix (Appendix A) which explains the formula methodology in greater detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Submission Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be considered for funding, each application must include, at a minimum, the following forms and certifications which are contained in EPA's ``Application Kit for Assistance'': (1) Standard Form 424 (Application for Federal Assistance), (2) EPA Form 5700&hyph;48 (Procurement Certification), (3) Drug-Free Workplace Certification, (4) Debarment and Suspension Certification, (5) Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, and (6) a return mailing address. In addition to these standard forms, each application must also include a work program, a detailed line-item budget with sufficient information to clearly justify costs, a list of work products or deliverables, and a schedule for their completion. Work programs are to be negotiated between applicants and their EPA regional offices to ensure that both EPA and state priorities can be addressed. In addition, every application from a state, territory or Indian governing body must clearly demonstrate how the proposed activities will lead to that state's pursuit of authorization. Finally, any applicant proposing the collection of environmentally related measurements or data generation must adequately address the requirements of 40 CFR 31.45 relating to quality assurance/quality control. These requirements are more specifically outlined in the ``Guidance Document for the Preparation of Quality Assurance Project Plans'' (May 1993) published by EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. This document, as well as the application kits referred to above, may be obtained from EPA's regional offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Application Procedures and Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications must be submitted to the appropriate EPA regional office in duplicate; one copy to the regional lead program branch and the other to the regional grants management branch. Early consultations are recommended between prospective applicants and their EPA regional offices. Because TSCA Title IV cooperative agreements will be administered at the regional level, these consultations can be critical to the ultimate success of a state's project or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For more information about this financial assistance program, or for technical assistance in preparing an application for funding, interested parties should contact the Regional Primary Lead Contact person in the appropriate EPA regional office.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marcela Feraru, Tiberiu Braescu, Mihai Valentin Neagu, and </F> Andra Aurora Manta article: "Virgil Magureanu Announced that He  Will Dismiss His Deputy, Dumitru Cristea, on Grounds of Immoral  Behavior"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Former Chief of the Counterespionage Division </H5> of the Romanian Intelligence Service Has Been Accused of  Concealing Documents    The hearing of Virgil Magureanu, director of the SRI  [Romanian Intelligence Service], by the authorized Parliamentary  Commission took place yesterday. He was summoned to answer  questions regarding accusations of espionage against certain  public personalities as well as with changes at the SRI  leadership. Although the Steering College of the respective  institution was also summoned, Virgil Magureanu was accompanied  only by the head of the Counterespionage Directorate.    The most spectacular case, that is, the case of the former  presidential counselor, Marin Pancea, was clarified with two  precise answers: He is neither a French spy nor working for the  KGB. Asked whether he was not interested in Pancea's commercial  relations, which would have made him a suspect, Virgil Magureanu  said that SRI did not react to this issue. The SRI director  promised to disclose next week where all the information  published in the press originated from.    In connection with other personalities who were accused of  espionage such as Adrian Nastase [executive president of the  ruling party Social Democracy Party of Romania], Adrian Severin  [vice president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation  Front)], Ion Talpes [head of the Foreign Intelligence Service],  and others, the answer was the same, namely, he promised to  disclose those things later. In any event, "there is no proof  that those persons were spies." Nevertheless, the SRI director  promised "we will also see some spies" without mentioning who  they are, how they were discovered, and what has happened to  them.  <H5>  Major General Dumitru Cristea, Deputy Chief of the SRI, Will </H5> Be Removed From Office on Grounds of Immoral Behavior    Referring to the issue of demotions at the level of the SRI  leadership, Virgil Magureanu said that his deputy, Major General  Dumitru Cristea, will be removed from his position because of  immoral and scandalous behavior. In his capacity as rector of  the Higher Institute for Information Studies, he had sexual  relations with female students and the father of one of the  girls complained about it to the Parliamentary Commission. The  Commission came into possession of a recorded cassette that  contained the declarations made to the Commission expert by the  respective student. In her statement, the student tells the  entire story in detail. Out of decency, we decided to refrain  from disclosing those details. However, the representatives of  the commission assessed the behavior of the SRI deputy chief as  "offensively immoral."    The president of the Parliamentary Commission Vasile Vacaru  also has a recording in which Dumitru Cristea admits all the  allegations, even if he withdrew those statements later.    In this situation, Major General Dumitru Cristea was  summoned  for a hearing to the Parliamentary Commission in Charge of  Supervising Romanian Intelligence Service activity.  <H5>  SRI Has No Clear Picture About Documents That Were Concealed </H5> by Gheorghe Diaconescu and That Contain Intelligence Data    In connection with the dismissal of the head of the  Counterintelligence Service, Gheorghe Diaconescu, Virgil  Magureanu informed the commission that Diaconescu concealed  documents that contained intelligence data. The SRI still has  no clear picture of the nature of the respective documents or of  the reasons why they were hidden. A response is still expected  from the Prosecutor's Office.  <H5>  Virgil Magureanu, Director of the Romanian Intelligence </H5> Service Promised Not To Carry Out Any More Changes Without  Previously Discussing the Matter With the Parliamentary  Commission. The SRI Director Denied All Cases of Espionage  Referred to in the Press.    During the hearing, the SRI director mentioned that the  institution, whose chief he is, to this very day, does not have  accurate data that would confirm cases of espionage, as  published in the press. His statement was confirmed also by the  head of the Counterespionage Division of the SRI, who was  present at the hearing. Nevertheless, Virgil Magureanu said  that the SRI is investigating those cases that were brought up  by the press and will present a report to the Parliamentary  Commission.    The Commission asked the SRI director not to carry out any  more changes in the structure of that institution without  previously discussing it with members of parliament. In  conclusion, Virgil Magureanu promised that he will bring before  the commission all those dignitaries who are going to be  replaced, as well as those by whom they are going to be replaced.</p>

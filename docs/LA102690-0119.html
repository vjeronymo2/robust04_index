			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASE AGAINST BRANDO ERODES;  </P> <P> TRIAL: THE PROSECUTION REFUSES TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT IN MURDER CASE -- SO  FAR. BUT THE INABILITY TO SUBPOENA CHEYENNE BRANDO IS REGARDED AS A MAJOR  HURDLE.  </P> <P> The murder case against Marlon Brando's son, Christian -- once described by  authorities as airtight -- has been unravelled significantly by the  prosecution's inability to subpoena a key witness and introduce as evidence a  taped interrogation of the suspect.  </P> <P> With the trial scheduled to begin Nov. 5, the district attorney's office is  holding fast to its position of refusing to negotiate a settlement with young  Brando in the high-profile case. But there are growing signs of concern among  prosecutors about proving a murder charge.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old welder, Brando's eldest son, is charged with murdering Dag  Drollet, his sister's lover, last May in the actor's hilltop compound on  Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> The defense has tried a plea bargain reducing the charge to voluntary  manslaughter. But the case appears inexorably headed for trial. Santa Monica  Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas has ordered in 255 prospective jurors. Each  who is not excused for hardship -- the trial is expected to last several months  -- will be asked to fill out a long questionnaire before being interviewed  about what they know of the case, their view of the defendant's movie star  father and their personal use of alcohol and drugs, among other things.  </P> <P> The problem haunting the prosecution is what most participants concede is  bumbled police work, which has rendered the defendant's taped statements  inadmissible and allowed his sister to travel home to Tahiti, beyond the reach  of U.S. law.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, however, have said that a plea bargain might be misconstrued by  the public as favoritism toward a Hollywood legend, thus complicating efforts  to resolve the case without a trial.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner was ill Thursday and could not be reached for comment on  his position on a possible plea bargain. However, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg  Thompson said through a spokesman that while prosecutors are "ethically bound  to discuss disposition of the case" with the defense, "our present efforts are  focused on getting our key witness, Cheyenne, back to Los Angeles to testify."  </P> <P> If that effort fails, prosecutors said they might be more amenable to a plea  bargain. But by then, the defense may prefer to take its chances by going to  trial.  </P> <P> "It's gamesmanship," grinned Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Clark.  </P> <P> If prosecutors decide to go to trial, they must make a host of other strategic  decisions: Should they call Marlon Brando as a witness before the defense does?  Can they force Christian Brando to take the stand by keeping out testimony from  a policeman who might support his "accident" defense? Can they establish  through other witnesses that Brando threatened Drollet previously? Would  Brando's girlfriend be an asset or a liability as a witness?  </P> <P> Cheyenne Brando was the last person to see Drollet alive, other than the  defendant. She took a flight to Tahiti last June after telling police that the  shooting was "not an accident. It was a murder, in case you don't know it." She  has since told authorities in Tahiti that her father and her brother's  girlfriend also were involved -- and even suggested to a French judge that he  view "The Godfather" to understand the story. But none of her statements is  admissible unless defense attorneys can cross-examine her.  </P> <P> Authorities here made no move to prevent her from leaving the country, they  said, because Marlon Brando assured them that she would remain in Los Angeles  for the birth of Drollet's and her child. Once home in Tahiti, she was charged  by the French government as an accomplice in the death of Drollet, a French  citizen, and forbidden to leave.  </P> <P> After being rebuffed by state or federal courts, prosecutors have now requested  that the U.S. State Department ask the French for help. Without her,  prosecutors say privately, they have little chance of proving even murder in  the second degree.  </P> <P> "When you get into the area of murder, you're looking at (the defendant's)  state of mind," said Clark. "Cheyenne is the key, and we're not optimistic  about getting her back."  </P> <P> Another setback involves a statement Christian Brando gave police. Prosecutors  intended to use it to prove that the shooting was premeditated. In it, Brando  said he had stopped off at his girlfriend's apartment to retrieve the  .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol used in the shooting minutes later.  </P> <P> However, because the police detective conducting the interview did not properly  advise him of his Miranda rights, the entire statement has been ruled  inadmissible.  </P> <P> Should the case go to trial, it is certain to produce a legal spectacle, even  though Marlon Brando will be barred because he is expected to be a witness.  </P> <P> Already, pretrial hearings have attracted paparazzi from around the world. The  crush of spectators has led to reserved seating for reporters and roped-off  areas for cameras at Santa Monica's small courthouse. The magnet? Appearances  by Marlon Brando, once reclusive but now made garrulous by his son's legal  predicament.  </P> <P> Not all spectators are Brando fans. A contingent from Tahiti, including the  victim's parents, has attended some pretrial hearings and plans to attend in  hopes of seeing the killer punished.  </P> <P> Jacques Drollet, Dag's outspoken father, told The Times in a telephone  interview that he is incensed his son is being portrayed as a woman-beater and  Cheyenne Brando as his unfortunate victim.  </P> <P> "We are aware that the closer we get to the trial, the more desperate Marlon  Brando will feel and the more dirt and mud he will shovel on my son and his  family.  </P> <P> "He told police that Dag had never beaten Cheyenne; he knows Dag is a very  gentle young man. But maybe he had to sing another song or change the words for  the benefit of his case." (The elder Brando now contends he has proof that his  daughter was beaten, a crucial part of the defense.)  </P> <P> "Brando is an actor and even in his private life he is always acting. He can  cry and lie like a horse can run. But this is Mr. Marlon Brando in his worst  role, his worst scenario. I think he is making the whole case his own case."  </P> <P> Drollet said that although Cheyenne has been hospitalized twice in Papeete for  drug detoxification, she appears to be in fine fettle:  </P> <P> "She is now out having a good time. She is roaming about in Papeete, the main  town of Tahiti, where she has been seen shopping with her mother, Tarita, and  her infant son, Tookie," Drollet said. "She is also going out to the beaches  and the nightclubs with her new Italian boyfriend."  </P> <P> Drollet expressed hope that the case would go to trial. "The procedure for  murder shouldn't be stopped along the way -- the American and French justice  system must go to the end of the road."  </P></p>

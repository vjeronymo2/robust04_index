			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NONE HURT AS CAR BOMBING AT MALL DELAYS HUNDREDS  </P> <P> A car bomb went off in a Sherman Oaks Galleria parking structure Tuesday,  causing no injuries and little damage but delaying hundreds of holiday shoppers  for hours while police checked surrounding cars for explosive devices.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officers cordoned off the first floor of the seven-level  parking structure while they probed the incident, in which a white Jeep  Cherokee received minor damage about 4 p.m. Police said the driver was not  injured.  </P> <P> Immediately after the bombing, shoppers heading for their cars were met by  security guards and police who instructed them to return to the stores.  </P> <P> Fran Benitez of North Hollywood, who was shopping with her two children, said  she went to a department store's television display to watch a Lakers game  after being turned back from the parking structure. At 7:30 p.m., she found she  still could not return to her car.  </P> <P> "I'm hungry. We're tired. The Lakers lost," she said. "What else is there for  us to do? We're shopped out. I don't want to go back in there."  </P> <P> The Jeep was parked in a lot reserved for employees of the stores and for  workers in an adjacent office complex, where the car's driver works. Police  initially roped off more than 50 spaces in the employee lot and more than 100  surrounding spaces used by shoppers. Stores in the Galleria remained open  during the investigation.  </P> <P> "We had a car bombing involving an improvised explosive device," said Detective  Ken Bourne. "We have no definite suspect or motive at this time."  </P> <P> The driver, Angela Buono, described by police as a San Fernando Valley resident  in her 20s, said she jumped from the vehicle when she heard strange noises and  saw smoke while backing the Jeep out of a parking space.  </P> <P> Shopper Greg Manns said his arms were already filled with merchandise when  police directed him back into the Galleria. Manns said he spent another $300  during his return to the shops.  </P> <P> "If this was a ploy by the mall, it worked," he said. "I'm extremely  frustrated. I'm trying to be as patient as I can, but we're all bummed out."  </P> <P> Tom Basile, who works for a finance company in the Galleria's office complex,  said his car was just two vehicles away from the Cherokee. He said officers  kept him from inspecting his car for several hours.  </P> <P> "Might as well finish my Christmas shopping," he said. "I'm going up to May Co.  and I'll worry about my car later."  </P> <P> Another office complex employee, Phyllis Grogan, opted to sit next to a  security guard until police allowed her to return to her car. "I'm done  shopping for this year, so all there is to do is wait," she said.  </P> <P> At 5:30 p.m. police began allowing some shoppers to return to their cars. By 8  p.m. the damaged Jeep had been towed from the parking structure, although  officers kept the employee lot cordoned off while they used flashlights to  search for evidence.  </P> <P> Bourne said damage to the Jeep was confined to the underside and engine areas.  Cars on either side were slightly damaged by debris and one had a flat tire, he  said.  </P> <P> "It was not a large device," he said. "It appears to be minor damage."  </P> <P> Bourne is assigned to the Police Department's criminal conspiracy unit, which  handles bombings. He refused to elaborate on the type of device, how it was  attached or its explosive potential.  </P> <P> "All that's under investigation," he said.  </P></p>

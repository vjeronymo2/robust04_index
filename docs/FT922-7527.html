			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Ministers want O&amp;Y creditors' answers on rail cash THE government indicated yes-terday that it wanted an answer soon from creditor banks of Canary Wharf, the east London office development created by Olympia &amp; York, on whether they will meet the Pounds 400m contribution to the cost of the Jubilee Line extension. It also emerged yesterday that the banks may yet decide to put the development into liquidation after they have received further financial information this week. Ministers said yesterday that the government was willing to negotiate quickly a deal to relocate civil servants from Whitehall if banks decided to keep Canary Wharf out of receivership. One cabinet minister closely involved with negotiations said the government's position could be summed up in the phrase: 'We are not going to subsidise Canary Wharf, but we do want to support it'. Much depends on the rent the government has to pay to take space at the development. Canary Wharf is offering at Pounds 15 a square foot about 500,000 sq ft of space. However, a rival office developer is believed to be offering the government space at Pounds 13. Bankers will meet environment department officials this week to discuss a possible move to Canary Wharf. Meanwhile, a leading bank creditor to Canary Wharf said: 'We are keeping all our options open, including liquidation'. The 11 bank lenders hope to receive financial information by mid-week which should help them to decide between four options. The banker said these options range from keeping the Pounds 3bn office development as a going concern, putting it into administration under UK insolvency procedures, putting it into receivership or liquidating it completely. The bankers have until the end of May, when its Pounds 21m loan to Canary Wharf runs out, to decide. The decision will depend on whether the banks believe they can ever make a profit out of the project. If they decided the outlook was too bleak, they would opt for liquidation. The banker said he could not predict which of the four paths the banks would choose. Over the weekend, all but one of the banks voted to keep it as a going concern for at least another few days, until they have received all relevant financial information. This is in spite of Canary Wharf's parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, filing for protection from its creditors under Canadian and US insolvency law. The remaining bank is expected to give its approval, the banker said. If Canary Wharf is kept afloat, the bankers would probably want to appoint a new manager for the project. They have discussed the suitability of Sir Peter Levene, the former head of procurement at the Ministry of Defence, for the post. 'He has an impressive record,' the banker said. Meanwhile, ministers said London Regional Transport could not keep in place the Pounds 1.5m a month project team working on the Jubilee Line extension beyond July if there was no definite go-ahead for the project. With the Treasury adamant that it would not increase public funding for the line, the transport department would also be under pressure within the next few months to decide whether the Pounds 1.5bn in public money already committed might be better spent on other projects. So suggestions from O&amp;Y and some of its banks that there could be a one or two-year delay to work on the Jubilee Line extension were impracticable. Meanwhile in O&amp;Y's court filing under the Companies Creditors Arrangements Act, the Canadian parent company estimated the market value of its assets at CDollars 14.9bn (Pounds 6.85bn), about the same as its debts. The company values its equity in Canary Wharf at CDollars 3.8bn, based on appraisals on Jan 31. Its US property investments are estimated to be worth CDollars 5bn. The Canadian property holdings are valued at CDollars 3bn. US lenders, Page 21</p>

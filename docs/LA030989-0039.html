			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: SECRET IS OUT -- PET OWNERS ARE ABUSED  </P> <P> One of America's best-kept secrets is pet-owner abuse -- meaning the battering  of owners by their pets. Nobody talks about it, but more and more people are  showing up in hospital emergency rooms black and blue all over, and sometimes  even with broken arms and fractured ribs. Inevitably, their injuries have been  caused by "man's best friend," as these pets are called in the TV commercials.  </P> <P> There are no statistics available on how many battered pet owners there are in  this country because these crimes are rarely reported.  </P> <P> I recently made a hospital visit to a pet owner named Mary R. to hear her  story. She was willing to speak for this column on the condition that we didn't  show her face and that we disguised her voice.  </P> <P> "How long have you been battered by your pet?" I asked her.  </P> <P> She bit her lip, "For seven years. When he was a Doberman puppy, he was so  lovable, but as he grew older he kept sneaking up from behind and knocking me  down."  </P> <P> "Why do you think he did it?"  </P> <P> "He came from a long line of dogs who beat up their owners. It could very  easily have been genetic."  </P> <P> "How did you break your ribs?" I wanted to know.  </P> <P> Mary R. wiped away a tear. "I was walking Buster on a leash when he saw a  squirrel and bolted for it. My mistake was to hold on. He dragged me for almost  20 feet and my ribs cracked when I hit a rock garden dedicated to the Daughters  of the American Revolution."  </P> <P> "It sounds like a typical battered pet-owner case."  </P> <P> "What made it even worse was that after he stopped chasing the squirrel, he  came back to where I lay bleeding and pretended to passers-by that nothing had  happened."  </P> <P> "Why did you let him back in the house?"  </P> <P> She answered, "He's not like that all the time. Some days he can be as sweet as  Haagen-Dazs ice cream, and I guess I put up with the battering just to have  those moments."  </P> <P> "Have you told anyone else that your Doberman beats up on you?"  </P> <P> "I'm afraid to. Buster has a terrible temper and I don't know what he would do  if he overheard me complaining about him on the phone."  </P> <P> "Does he knock you down in front of your children?"  </P> <P> "All the time. Once I was trying to adjust the TV set in the living room and he  pushed me right through the screen."  </P> <P> "How else does he abuse you?" I asked Mary R.  </P> <P> This time she cried as she spoke, "He licks my face when I am trying to put on  makeup."  </P> <P> "Perhaps if he won't go, you should leave him," I suggested.  </P> <P> "Where could I hide?"  </P> <P> I felt it was time to have a serious talk with Mary R. "Pet-owner abuse is  practiced all over this country. It has existed for a long time, but people  never talked about it. For centuries pets tripped up their owners and bit their  ankles -- yet no one dared call the police. Then a few owners started to speak  out and now there are support groups to help someone in need. You have a sick  dog, and you have to stop making excuses for him. Otherwise, you will wind up  in the broken bone department of this hospital every other week."  </P> <P> Mary R. said, "I don't know whether it's worse to be pounded by a pet or to  live alone."  </P> <P> "I can't answer that," I confessed. "We know that Buster will never change and  so you must. Does your pet mistreat your husband as well?"  </P> <P> "No, he left home two months ago after telling me to choose between him and the  dog."  </P> <P> "And you chose the dog?"  </P> <P> "I had to. He's my best friend."  </P></p>

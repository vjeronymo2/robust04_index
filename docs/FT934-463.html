			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Port bargains in detail Vintage Character Churchill's Finest Vintage Character, Pounds 9.80, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Windrush Wines of Cirencester, and Eaton Elliott of Alderley Edge. Seriously concentrated wine which shows every sign of being capable of getting even better with its deep colour and very firm structure. A cheaper, not 'Finest' version is also in circulation. Sainsbury's Pounds 5.95 Croft makes this bargain. Another solid wine, simpler than Churchill's. LBV Tesco LBV, 1986, Pounds 6.69. A bargain in this bumptious peppery port bottled by Smith Woodhouse, from the Symington stable also responsible for Dow, Graham and Warre. Graham's LBV 1986, Pounds 9.45 and up. Unanimous enthusiasm for this lively, spicy wine; mellow but with a punch. Rather fruitier than the 1987 at the moment. Graham LBV 1987, Pounds 9.95 and up. Very deep colour, well balanced, lively and ready. The 1986 is just Pounds 8.89 from Morrison's supermarkets in northern England. The many other stockists, who are generally moving from the 1986 to the 1987, include: Safeway; Thresher; Waitrose; Averys of Bristol; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester; Andrew Weir of Luton and Caves de Bacchus of Leicester. Niepoort LBV 1987 Pounds 9.75 Bibendum, London NW1. A bottle of perfumed, ripe black cherries which would benefit from longer in bottle. Other Ports Offley Boa Vista, 1982 vintage, Pounds 9.99, Majestic. From a special parcel of fine bargain ports (including many a fine vintage port), this is a snip, and by no means an apology for the style. Lovely perfume with chocolate and prune flavours. Drink now, or better still, keep. Dow's Crusted, bottled 1987, Pounds 9.95. Waitrose (Pounds 10.45 Safeway) The next best thing to vintage. Powerful. Sainsbury's 10-year-old Tawny, Pounds 9.95. A perfectly acceptable light, smooth, fully mature, wood-aged port. Delicate with a slightly harsh finish. A keen price from Quinta do Noval. Niepoort Senior Fine Old Tawny, Pounds 9.75, Bibendum, London NW1. Distinctive, vigorous wine. Giles found it unattractively reminiscent of dill pickles.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Bellway The recent flurry of evidence hinting at a housing market recovery is rapidly developing into a storm. Yesterday, Bellway echoed the experience of other housebuilders by revealing a 50 per cent increase in reservations since the start of the year. Low interest rates and cheap and steady house prices finally appear to have stimulated the market, particularly for first-time buyers. Doubts must remain about whether the upturn in activity can be sustained. Unemployment is still growing and negative equity constrains demand. While Bellway was happy enough to call the turn, its cautious management was only prepared to back its hunch with other people's money. Its Pounds 33.6m cash call certainly looks cheeky. With cash of around Pounds 15m in the bank from its last rights issue, Bellway could easily have geared up with bank borrowings. Nevertheless, such opportunism highlights the relative strength of nimble second tier housebuilders. Bigger competitors, such as Tarmac, are too financially constrained to fund much expansion. Investors, who have bid up the construction sector by 20 per cent in the past three months, may worry about increasing their exposure by backing the string of rights issues which will doubtless follow. Or they may see plenty more room for recovery. The 80-odd construction stocks still have a combined market value of less than Pounds 4bn. That is about the same as Argyll or National Power.</p>

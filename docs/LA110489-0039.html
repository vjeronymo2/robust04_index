			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: SIBLING RIVALRY PAYS OFF  </P> <P> Kevin Dillon says he doesn't really mind being thought of as Matt Dillon's  younger brother.  </P> <P> "I expected it from the start," says the 23-year-old actor with an air of  laid-back good grace. "I'm proud to be Matt's brother. I think he's a great  actor."  </P> <P> Besides, "Wanting to get out from under that makes me fight to work even  harder."  </P> <P> Dillon's fight to work ("I'm still an auditioner") has put him squarely in  front of the public in recent weeks, with the back-to-back film releases "War  Party" and "Immediate Family" -- in addition to his role as a sympathetic  friend in "When He's Not a Stranger," a date-rape TV movie airing Monday night  at 9 on CBS.  </P> <P> He is especially proud of "Immediate Family," in which he plays the teen father  of Mary Stuart Masterson's baby, scrutinizing potential adoptive parents Glenn  Close and James Woods.  </P> <P> "I have friends who've been in situations like that -- getting a girl pregnant  -- so I used some of what these guys went through. It's a very tough thing,"  says Dillon, who won critical praise for his performance.  </P> <P> Making the movie also taught the single actor that "I myself am not ready for  fatherhood. Some day, but not now.  </P> <P> "It's just the way they cry all the time," he complains with a laugh. "He  ruined some of my best takes, that baby!" STACY JENEL SMITH  </P></p>

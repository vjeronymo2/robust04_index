			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Pakistan appoints caretaker premier as Sharif quits MR MOEEN QURESHI, a former vice-president of the World Bank, was last night sworn in as Pakistan's caretaker premier after the army arranged a deal which brought Mr Nawaz Sharif's resignation as prime minister. Mr Sharif had announced earlier in the evening that he would step down. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who has been locked in a power struggle with Mr Sharif for the last six months of the latter's 32 months in office, followed suit shortly after appointing Mr Qureshi and dissolving the national assembly. Elections for the lower house of parliament have been set for October 6. Caretaker governments are expected to be set up in Pakistan's four provinces, where elections are scheduled for October 9. Mr Wasim Sajjad, the Senate chairman, took over as acting president in the run-up to presidential elections. In an effort to ensure their impartiality, members of the interim government would almost certainly promise not to contest the election, senior government officials said. As well as international experience, Mr Qureshi has the advantage of having no overt affiliation with any political group, the officials added. His World Bank credentials are also seen as positive for Pakistan's quest for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) loan from the International Monetary Fund this year. Under the accord arranged by General Abdul Waheed, the army chief of staff, Mr Khan is to retain his privileges for the four months until his scheduled retirement. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, has agreed to the deal, which meets her demand for fresh elections. Mr Sharif had sought to mend fences with Ms Bhutto but was apparently unwilling to give ground. There was virtually no progress on withdrawing the corruption charges against Ms Bhutto, which were filed when her government was sacked in August 1990, and are unlikely ever to be proved in court.</p>

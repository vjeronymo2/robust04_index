			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Brazilian markets hit by Collor allegations BRAZIL'S financial markets took fright yesterday as pressure grew on President Fernando Collor to resign after allegations of corruption, extortion and cocaine. The allegations were made by the president's younger brother, Pedro, in an extensive videotaped interview with the leading news magazine Veja. Amid calls for a congressional inquiry and his impeachment, the president began legal action against his brother to 'defend his honour'. The country's stock markets fell sharply as investors' fears mounted, the main share index dropping 7.4 per cent. A broker in Sao Paulo described trading as 'awful', adding: 'The impact of the news published by Veja over the weekend was terrible.' Brazil's central bank stepped in to contain falls in the cruizeiro. The situation is especially embarrassing just a week before Mr Collor is due to open the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The crisis in Brazil's First Family began with a series of attacks by Mr Pedro Collor on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the president's campaign treasurer and friend. Pedro's revelation that he had compiled a video elaborating alleged frauds by Mr Farias, which he intended to hand to the police, caused stock markets to fall almost 10 per cent in real terms last week. The row has split the Collor clan and after failing to silence her youngest son, Dona Leda, the family matriarch, last week dismissed him from running the Collor media empire, claiming that he was mentally unstable. A furious Pedro is undergoing psychiatric tests to prove his sanity and has stepped up his attacks. Pedro's latest allegations are directed at his presidential brother, whom he accuses of a range of alleged frauds, trying to seduce his wife, and inducing him to snort cocaine. 'Fernando was a heavy consumer of cocaine,' he alleges. A police investigation was opened into Mr Farias yesterday on the president's orders. A statement issued by the presidency said Mr Collor was prepared to testify in court to the inquiry. Although Pedro has yet to present any evidence to back his allegations, there is no doubt of the damage they are causing to the government. Mr Luis Inacio da Silva, leader of the Workers party and Mr Collor's rival for the presidency in the 1989 polls, said: 'If even half the allegations are true, the president should apologise to the Brazilian people and resign.'

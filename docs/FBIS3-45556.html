Security  Council, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday [13  January].    But the official indicated that the matter will be a long  process.    "The reform of the Security Council is a relatively  complicated issue which includes ratifying the U.N. Charter, and  several procedural problems," spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a  weekly briefing.    "Solving these problems is not a question of one or two  countries expressing their opinion, but needs the full and ample  deliberation of all the delegates to the United Nations. Only  then can we strive for a method acceptable to everyone," he said.    Wu did not elaborate on China's position in the matter, only  saying that China understands the two countries' hope "of making  greater contributions to peace and development in the world."    During a two-day visit to Beijing last weekend, Japanese  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata briefed Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen on the establishment of a working group for the  reform of the Security Council.    At that time the Chinese side made no response, a Japanese  Foreign Ministry official said.</p>

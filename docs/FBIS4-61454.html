			<p>BFN     [Text] Military cooperation with Russia is the strategic  policy of the Kazakh Armed Forces, Kazakh Defense Minister  Sagadat Nurmagambetov stated at a press conference in Alma-Ata  [Almaty] dedicated to the second anniversary of the Kazakh Army.    Nurmagambetov stressed that the most difficult period of  renewal of the Kazakh Armed Forces was over. The Army has been  equipped with personnel, uniform and technical means.  Nurmagambetov pointed out that Kazakhstan was the last among  the CIS states to place the troops stationed on its own  territory under its jurisdiction.    Nurmagambetov said that earlier Kazakhstan had stood for a  single CIS or Russian-Kazakh Army. He emphasized that several  agreements on implementation of the treaty on military  cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan would be signed in  late May during the Russian governmental delegation's visit to  Alma-Ata.    Nurmagambetov announced that an agreement on Russia's  lending  the Sary-Shagan anti-missile training ground in Central  Kazakhstan was being worked on. He said Kazakhstan conditioned  the lending with education of Kazakh military specialists in  Russia. He stressed that Sary-Shagan would not be a Russian  military base since there would be no Russian troops.    No establishment of any military bases in Kazakhstan was  expected, Nurmagambetov stated. The strategic armed forces  stationed in Kazakhstan will be withdrawn from it by 2000. The  withdrawal has already begun, he added.    Nurmagambetov underlined that Kazakhstan had modern military  equipment of the Soviet model and did not have to purchase more  of it. The equipment is served in Kazakhstan on a plant for the  repairing of defense equipment. In future Kazakhstan will buy  military equipment only from Russia, Nurmagambetov said.</p>

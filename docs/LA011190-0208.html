			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV WARNS LITHUANIANS;  </P> <P> SAYS OWN FATE RELIES ON REPLY  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev flew to Lithuania today and urged its restive people to  remain within the Soviet Union, warning that their drive for independence could  lead to national tragedy and that his personal fate hinges on their choice.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader addressed a crowd of several hundred in Vilnius as at least  200,000 people began massing for a demonstration in the Lithuanian capital to  demand the restoration of the Baltic republic's prewar independence.  </P> <P> His comments were aimed at cooling pro-independence passions as he embarked on  a crucial mission to persuade Lithuanian Communists to reverse a decision to  split from the federal Communist Party.  </P> <P> "We have been tied together for these 50 years, whether we like it or not,"  Gorbachev said, walking through a crowd of several hundred after laying a  wreath at a monument to V. I. Lenin. "And all the more so, we have not lived in  a federation. We have lived in a unitary state with its own realities."  </P> <P> One person called out to Gorbachev: "People must decide their own fate!"  </P> <P> "Nothing will be decided without you," Gorbachev responded as he slowly made  his way back to his limousine. "We will decide everything together."  </P> <P> But he added: "Remember, if someone succeeds in pitting us against each other  in a clash, there will be a tragedy. We should not allow this."  </P> <P> Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania along with the two other Baltic states, Latvia  and Estonia, in 1940 under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> Harry Subacius, a spokesman for the Sajudis political movement pressing for  Lithuanian independence, said in a telephone interview to Moscow that several  hundred thousand people gathered in Cathedral Square for an evening rally.  </P> <P> The gathering began with 15 minutes of silence. Many people held candles, red,  green and gold Lithuanian flags, and the red-and-white banner of neighboring  Latvia, Subacius said.  </P> <P> After 1 hour and 15 minutes, bells in the Roman Catholic Cathedral and  elsewhere began ringing through the city of 544,000.  </P> <P> Vytautus Landsbergis, head of Sajudis, referred to Gorbachev as "head of a  great neighbor state," emphasizing the view that Lithuania is an independent  land, Subacius said.  </P> <P> As the rally was going on, Gorbachev was meeting elsewhere with Communist Party  members, according to an unofficial schedule.  </P> <P> As never before in his nearly five years in power, Gorbachev put his personal  prestige on the line in coming to Lithuania, exposing himself to a population  that openly disagrees with him. At times, he adopted a pleading tone as he  spoke to the people earlier in the day.  </P> <P> "We have embarked on this path and I am the one who chose it," he said. "My  personal fate is linked to this choice."  </P> <P> If Gorbachev fails to bring the Lithuanians back to the fold, Communist Parties  in the 14 other republics could feel encouraged to break with Moscow.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader said the rights of all minorities in the Soviet Union must be  respected, or it could endanger the unity of the country's more than 100 ethnic  groups.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In a Century League game:  </P> <P> Villa Park 29, Canyon 22 -- Officials flagged Canyon High School for 17  penalties amounting to 168 yards as Villa Park won at El Modena High.  </P> <P> With a 14-0 lead at halftime, Villa Park (5-3, 2-1 in the league) took the  second-half kickoff and went 71 yards in nine plays, scoring on Don Bladow's  15-yard run.  </P> <P> Villa Park scored less than three minutes later on Ellis Williams' three-yard  run, his second touchdown of the game. Williams gained 85 yards in 20 carries.  </P> <P> Trailing 27-0, Canyon tried to get its offense moving by employing the  "Polecat" formation. This sent nine players close to the sideline, leaving  running back Jeff Brunswig to snap the ball to quarterback Darren Lish seven  yards behind the line of scrimmage.  </P> <P> It helped spark the Comanches, who rallied for 22 fourth-quarter points, mostly  against Villa Park reserves. Brunswig led Canyon with 115 yards and a touchdown  in 12 carries. MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

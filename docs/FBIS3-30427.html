Following their talks behind closed doors that lasted for  half an hour, Zhirinovskiy told a TANJUG journalist: ``His  holiness blessed us, and we invited him to come to Moscow where  a congress of Slav nations is to be held on 4 April.    "We spoke of Russia's return to the right path of the  Orthodox religion," Zhirinovskiy said stressing that the Russian  and Serbian Orthodox churches should direct all their efforts to  the spiritual renaissance of their nations.    "We shall invest efforts that the state make amends for  everything that the Russian and the Serbian churches have lost  over the past years. It would be better if the youths that have  gone astray experience their purification through spiritual  education than through prisons and emigration," Zhirinovskiy  said.    Zhirinovskiy stressed that he was moved in particular by a  plea made yesterday by a little girl from Herzegovina who told  him: "Vladimir, save my dad who is on the front, don't let NATO  kill my dad."    "Such moving things brought us here," he said.    Asked if he would meet Serbian President Milosevic,  Zhirinovskiy said: "Maybe."    Even though it had been announced that only Zhirinovskiy and  his two associates would pay a visit, numerous members of the  Association of Serb-Russian Friendship also came to the  Patriarchate, including the leader of the Party of Serb Unity,  Zeljko Raznjatovic, and the chairman of the Serb National  Renewal, Mirko Jovic.</p>

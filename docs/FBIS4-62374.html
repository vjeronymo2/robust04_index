			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- Former parliament speaker  Ruslan Khasbulatov is back in Moscow from his native Chechnya  and has returned to work as the head of a desk at the Academy of  National Economy where he used to teach before his political  career began.    In an interview with the hard-line opposition "ZAVTRA"  newspaper published on Friday, the former speaker, who was  released from jail in February under the State Duma-proclaimed  political amnesty, said he is not going to participate in  opposition rallies and demonstrations and his political activity  would manifest itself only in articles and interviews. "I am  not a rally regular, I am not used to participating in  demonstrations and shouting out slogans", he stressed.    Speaking about his arch rival Boris Yeltsin, Khasbulatov  said  that only "a fascist regime" could have pounded the  parliamentary building with tanks, but stressed at the same time  that he is sure that a big of top [as received] politicians  wants to reform Russia on a democratic basis.    "Only a fascist regime could have surrounded the parliament  with barbed wire, sent people armed to the teeth against  lawmakers and their defenders, shot in [as received] women and  children", he said and added "I nevertheless believed and still  believe that a big group of policy-makers in this country  strives to reform it on democratic grounds".    Khasbulatov praised his ally and former vice-president  Aleksandr Rutskoy as "a politician with a great future, as a man  who the people may trust".    During the October revolt Rutskoy behaved as a "dynamic and  courageous" man, but his entourage failed him, according to  Khasbulatov. "If Rutskoy with his understanding of issues in  position of acting president was surrounded by competent  specialists, the events could have gone in another way", he said.    Speaking about himself, Khasbulatov said that no  "destructive" changes had occurred with him after he suffered a  defeat in the October revolt and was imprisoned. "I left the  prison just as I entered it", he said.</p>

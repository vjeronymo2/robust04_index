			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga June 19 TASS -- A possibility of the  dismantling of two unfinished buildings in Skrunda, where it was  planned to locate a new reception and transmission centre of the  radar station, is being discussed by American and Latvian  specialists. On Monday they will be joined by Swedish  specialists, and consultations will continue until June 22.    Latvia wishes to start the dismantling of the complex as  soon  as possible. Its construction was started in 1976 and stopped  in 1990. Production forms and records for those two buildings,  which have a height of seven and 18 floors, have already been  turned over to Latvia, as envisaged by bilateral agreements,  signed in Moscow on April 30. The Latvian Government announced  a contest among firms. It is going to place the order with the  firm which undertakes to dismantle the buildings quicker than  others with minimal expenditures. Americans promised to finance  the project. It is not clear, however, how much money will be  needed and in exactly what way the buildings will be dismantled.  The problem is being discussed with the participation of  officials from the U.S. Department of Defence.    The agreements signed in the Kremlin have not yet been  ratified by parliaments of the two countries. Latvian Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs was asked: "If the legislators do not  support the agreements, how will it affect the dismantling  process?" He said that the facility already belonged to  Latvia, irrespective of the future of the treaty. Under the  agreements, the old radar will function for another four years.</p>

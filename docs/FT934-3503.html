			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ameritech service appeal Ameritech, the Chicago-based local telephone company, yesterday took the first step to becoming the first Baby Bell regional telecommunications group to enter the long-distance calling market. It has asked the US Justice Department for permission to offer a long-distance service, initially on a test basis. The seven Baby Bells are currently banned from the long-distance market under the terms of the 1982 anti-trust court case which spun them off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Regulators feared they would use their monopoly power in the local market to compete unfairly in the long-distance arena. However, technological factors and a pro-competition regulatory environment are gradually whittling away at the local monopoly.</p>

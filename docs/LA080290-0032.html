			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES OK BILL ASSISTING AIDS PATIENTS  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators announced an agreement Wednesday on new AIDS  legislation that for the first time would provide significant federal  assistance for the clinical care of AIDS patients.  </P> <P> The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990, named after  the late Indiana teen-ager who crusaded against AIDS discrimination after he  contracted the disease through treatment for hemophilia, is expected to quickly  pass the House and Senate. The House may vote on the bill as early as Friday.  </P> <P> The legislation authorizes the government to spend up to $875 million in the  fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 on four new AIDS programs that would help  states, cities and private health care facilities diagnose and treat those who  have the disease.  </P> <P> In contrast, most of the $1.7 billion that the Bush Administration is seeking  for AIDS spending in the next fiscal year would be set aside for research and  education. The Ryan White measure would provide funding over and above the  Administration request.  </P> <P> "Cities and states are struggling to keep their health systems from collapsing  and they deserve federal aid," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a member  of the conference committee and co-author of the Senate version of the bill.  </P> <P> "This is the first time that the federal government is directing money toward  the whole range of services that go along with the care that is going to be  needed," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a member of the conference  committee and author of the legislation passed by the House.  </P> <P> "The most significant issue for the future of this epidemic is treatment," said  Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and  Education Fund, the nation's largest gay rights organization.  </P> <P> "Even the most promising developments in the laboratory will have no  significance if our health care systems can't deliver them to the people most  in need," Stoddard said. "This bill at least begins to address that problem."  </P> <P> Both the House and Senate earlier had approved by wide margins different  versions of the AIDS relief measure, despite Administration opposition. Waxman  said he believes that President Bush will sign the legislation because of the  overwhelming support it has received in Congress.  </P> <P> A White House official, who asked not to be identified, agreed that a veto is  unlikely. However, the official said that Congress will be hard pressed to find  all the money needed to pay for the programs authorized by the Ryan White  legislation.  </P> <P> The "disaster relief" portion of the bill would provide up to $275 million in  aid to those cities that have been hardest hit by the 10-year AIDS epidemic. As  of June 30, more than 139,760 Americans had developed AIDS, and 85,430 had  died.  </P> <P> To qualify for federal aid, a community would have to be in a metropolitan area  with more than 2,000 reported cases of AIDS, or an incidence of at least 25  AIDS cases per 10,000 people. West Coast cities that would be expected to  receive grants under the program are Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.  </P> <P> A second program would authorize another $275 million in grants to states,  using a formula based on the number of reported cases over the previous two  years.  </P> <P> In addition, $305 million would be set aside for grants to states or private  clinics to provide early intervention services, including testing for the human  immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, patient counseling and prescription of  drugs that have been shown to delay the onset of the disease.  </P> <P> The legislation also would authorize $20 million for a special research project  to benefit children with AIDS.  </P></p>

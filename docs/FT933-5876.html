			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No U-turn on nuclear fuel storage Sir, John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), is incorrect to claim (Letters, August 21) that Friends of the Earth has made a 'staggering U-turn' by suggesting that BNFL should offer to store its customers' used nuclear fuel, either at Sellafield or abroad, instead of reprocessing it in Thorp. We made this proposal at the 1977 Windscale inquiry and have consistently advocated it ever since. Contrary to BNFL's unsubstantiated claims, storage is a safer and viable alternative to reprocessing. Indeed, Scottish Nuclear will save around Pounds 45m a year by storing its spent fuel in a purpose-built store at its Torness reactor instead of sending it to Thorp for reprocessing. If the economic case for Thorp is as 'robust' as Mr Guinness claims, BNFL should have nothing to fear from independent scrutiny of its arguments. BNFL's continued refusal to publish the Touche Ross economic assessment of Thorp only serves to demonstrate that BNFL fears the flawed logic of reprocessing will be exposed by its publication. Consequently, BNFL is in no position to argue that there is no alternative to opening Thorp. Patrick Green, nuclear campaigner, Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood Street, London NI 7JQ</p>

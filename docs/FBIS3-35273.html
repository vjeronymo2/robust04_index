			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 22 Feb 1994, JANA--U.S. President Clinton  said that the Great Jamahiriyah constituted an unusual and  exceptional threat to the national security and foreign policy  of the United States.    This was said in the report that Clinton presented to the  U.S. Congress recently, in which he reviewed the state of  emergency that the United States announced toward the  Jamahiriyah as of 1986.    The JANA political editor commented on this, saying that  what  is a cause for amazement in Clinton's statement is that it came  from the largest nuclear state in the world against Libya, a  peaceful state facing unjust mandatory sanctions for which the  U.S. Government itself is the first to be held responsible and  that has practiced various pressures through threats and  attraction [as received] in order to impose such measures at the  UN Security Council.    The editor wondered what the Great Jamahiriyah had done to  constitute the danger that the U.S. President mentioned, apart  from the fact that it has refused to be a lackey and dependent  and has drawn for itself an independent political path based on  getting friendly with those that befriend it and hostile toward  those that are hostile toward it. It has also rejected  infringement upon its sovereignty and its Arab nation. In this  framework, it becomes clear that the primary reason behind the  report of the U.S. President at this moment is the stance of the  Great Jamahiriyah, which has exposed the so-called Gaza and  Jericho agreement and the plan to sell Palestine and impose  unconditional surrender on the Arabs.    When the U.S. President says that Libya constitutes a danger  for U.S. interests, by these interests he means the Israelis,  because the U.S. wants Israel to be the most powerful and the  Arabs to surrender and submit to their will.    The editor stressed that the U.S. Government must prove this  serious accusation before the UN Security Council, which must  investigate it. The U.S. Government must prove how Libya  constitutes a danger to the United States.    JANA has learned that the secretariat of the General  People's  Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation will  submit the text of the report that was presented by U.S.  President Clinton to the Congress to the Secretariat of the  General People's Congress so that it is distributed to the Basic  People's Congresses so that every member is well informed of the  contents of that report and the serious dimensions and meanings  it contains.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CANADA'S TRADE SURPLUS SHRINKS  </P> <P> A robust currency and weakening U.S. economic growth shrank Canada's  merchandise trade surplus last year to its lowest level in a decade, a federal  agency said today.  </P> <P> Canada's exports grew 1.2% in 1989 while imports climbed a more brisk 5.3% for  a net trade surplus of $4.7 billion ($3.9 billion U.S.).  </P> <P> That was less than half the $9.8 billion ($8.1 billion U.S.) surplus reported  in 1988 when the Conservative government signed the free trade agreement with  the United States, promising it would be a boon to business. The pact removed  remaining tariffs on goods between the nations over 10 years.  </P> <P> International Trade Minister John Crosbie has been under attack from opposition  parties, which opposed free trade, for Canada's deteriorating trade position.  </P> <P> A higher Canadian dollar made exports less attractive abroad last year while  slashing the cost of such basic imports as clothing.  </P></p>

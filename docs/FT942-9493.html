			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Gunshots and 20 checkpoints on hazardous road to Aden: Eric Watkins' epic journey from Sanaa ends in frustration Sitting in the dark with two armed guards at my back, I was beginning to wonder whether my efforts to reach Aden had been worthwhile. I had travelled nearly 600 miles in two days from Sanaa, the capital in northern Yemen, bluffing my way through more than 20 military checkpoints, and two sets of front lines in the civil war between northern and southern Yemeni forces. Then, with the Gulf of Aden in view, I was nabbed by northern military forces who accused me of espionage. In the company of a French journalist, I had headed south. Northern troops, we had heard, were rapidly approaching Aden and were soon likely to enter the city. From the south, however, we had heard nothing. Communications between north and south had been cut and Aden Radio was off the air. As we wound through back roads to avoid the first military checkpoint, our guide told us to invent a story to get us through later checkpoints. Our first test came quickly. A few miles up the road, an armed soldier flagged us down. He demanded to know who we were. 'Oil men,' our guide, Mahmoud, said. 'They don't speak Arabic.' The story held up mile after mile. But the strain had got to Mahmoud who declined to go on with us. Resting in the lobby of a hotel in Mareb, north of Aden, I was soon joined by officials, who had brought along AK-47s. 'Good afternoon,' said one, extending his hand. 'I'm the chief of police here and this is the head of the petroleum board. Are you the BBC journalist?' 'No, I'm with the Financial Times.' I explained that we had heard northern broadcasts claiming that southern jets had bombed the oilfields at Mareb. 'Oh no,' he said, 'that has never happened. Last week one jet buzzed the town and soldiers fired at it. But the jet dropped no bombs.' After producing my press pass and a copy of the Yemeni press law, and answering 'not at all' to the question 'are you doing anything illegal?', we got approving nods. 'Well,' the police officer said, 'just take care. There is plenty of trouble on the road.' He was not wrong. A couple of miles along the road, two young tribesmen tried to wave us down. Our driver sped on past them. Looking back, I saw one of the tribesmen raise his rifle, aim, and fire. He missed us. He shot again and missed. Our journey had so far revealed few signs of war, apart from the occasional military patrol and the odd tank here and there, half-camouflaged in the golden sands. But people along the way assured us the desert was full of soldiers and urged us along our way. Located some 300 miles to the south-east of Sanaa, Ataq is a dreary little town, a motley collection of concrete buildings. But it had an airport and had become important over the past two years as a transit point for the eastern oil fields. Ataq's strategic importance had been underlined by unconfirmed reports of a major battle there just days before. Ataq was clearly in the hands of southern forces. Armed soldiers at the checkpoint entering town examined our papers thoroughly, climbed into our vehicle, and ordered us to drive to central security headquarters. Within minutes, the chief told us there had been no battle at Ataq. Four northern jets had tried to bomb the airport, but they had missed. One aircraft was shot down. The chief agreed to our travel plans and gladly provided us with an an official pass showing our names and professions, and an itinerary. The next morning, we waited an hour on the main road before getting a ride. A local man was cashing in on the war by charging exorbitant rates to taxi people around. We piled into the car, followed by half a dozen other people. Coming round a bend, we were stopped by military police. Their leader spotted a young lad and ordered him out of the car. 'You're a soldier and belong with us,' he bellowed, pulling the boy from his seat. The lad was frightened. He was in tears. He was begging to be released. The officer held on to him and waved us through. Farther along the commander of a southern brigade said we were free to travel, but he advised against it. 'The northerners occupy the road below,' he said. We pressed on, the road now becoming clogged with southern tanks and heavy trucks coming towards us. They were, perhaps, in a tactical retreat, moving in an orderly procession to join their comrades behind us. We soon reached the battlefield, the road littered with charred and abandoned vehicles. A northern brigade, we were told, had defeated the southerners and secured the area. By early afternoon we had progressed well, moving along in a series of lifts in handy vehicles. Just a few miles more and we would be overlooking Shuqra, a small town on the Gulf of Aden. And there, we hoped, we could hire a small boat to take us the remaining 60 miles into Aden. But our luck failed. A northern military patrol sped past in the opposite direction. We thought nothing of it. Minutes later it sped back to stop us. An officer jumped out and came to the side of our latest pick-up truck. The searches and interrogations lasted nearly eight hours. A young officer began by going through our bags. Hours later they were still worried about the absence of film in our cameras. They insisted we had taken photos along the way and had handed the films to southern forces for onward transmission to Aden. Two armed guards were told to watch us. In the distance, flashes of light intermittently illuminated the sky, followed by ominous rumblings. After accepting that we had no offending films, in the early hours of the morning, they drove us back northward in a pick-up truck with six armed guards and a heavy machine gun. They asked for references in Sanaa, and I though of giving them the home number of the president, General Ali Abdullah Saleh. But that seemed a bit too much. Would the name of the president's personal advisor be enough? It was. They released us with apologies for the inconvenience. There was no inconvenience, we said, apart from the theft of some of our equipment and the failure to get to Aden.</p>

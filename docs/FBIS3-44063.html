			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulundi Jan 22 SAPA--A contributing factor in the  attacks of journalists was the perception that they were partial  and took sides, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi said on Saturday [22 January].    In a memorandum presented to the media workers of South  African in Ulundi, Chief Buthelezi said in fact many IFP, Pan  Africanist Congress and Azanian People's Organisation supporters  saw journalists as taking the side of the African National  Congress [ANC]. "Since the unbanning of the ANC, hundreds of  IFP leaders and supporters have been decimated by Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intent on  wiping our organisation from the face of the earth. But instead  of there being widespread coverage of this genocide, there has  been deathly silence on the part of the press. Where coverage  has been given to IFP killings, there has been little coverage  of the true identity of their killers or the military precision  in which they have been conducted," he said.    Chief Buthelezi said the whole issue of the violence that  had  cost many thousands of lives had literally been swept under the  carpet.    He accused the media of having supported the ANC, the  government and the ANC's Patriotic Front when they said the IFP  was obstructive when its negotiator wanted the issue of violence  to be dealt with as a priority issue at the start of the  multiparty talks in April last year. "This issue, as I have  stated, is largely under-reported. Members of the IFP have been  the main victims of this violence, and yet we are deliberately  being portrayed as its main perpetrators. Added to this failure  to report on these killings is of course the selective reporting  of massacres involving supporters of either side. One just has  to think of Boipatong. While there was widespread coverage of  this heinous deed and rightfully so, the massacres of IFP people  involving equally large numbers in Natal and Zonkezizwe in the  Transvaal received little or no coverage," he said.    Chief Buthelezi said since the IFP walked out of the  multi-party talks they have been attacked and ridiculed by the  press and very seldom had the reasons of the action been spelt  out to the public. He further said with the public only being  fed which the ANC and the government allowed, it was not  surprising to "us that we in the Freedom Alliance [FA] have come  to be seen as spoilers".    Chief Buthelezi said the extent to which the FA had backed  down was clear from their preparedness to reduce their original  16 points to four.    He also said without the government and the ANC acceding to  the minimum demands the FA felt it was unreasonable for  observers to expect them to fight the election. Despite the  lack of progress in resolving these issue, the IFP along with  the FA, were continuing to meet the government in the hope of  achieving a breakthrough, he said.</p>

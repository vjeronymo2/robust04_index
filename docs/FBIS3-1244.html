Launching  its manifesto in Johannesburg today, the party said only an  organization firmly against the capitalist system could do away  with these conditions. This report from Arlene Wainstein:    [Begin recording] [Wainstein] Support socialism, down with  capitalism. This is how the Workers' List Party introduced its  manifesto this afternoon. The party says it hopes its brand of  democratic socialism will soon spread throughout the world.    [Workers' List spokesman Salim Vally] What we've had in this  country has been capitalism and that has failed dismally. We  are not talking about the so-called socialism of the East, of  the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Democracy means that the  people who create the wealth must also be the people who make  the decisions, people who must decide whether to build casinos  or decide whether to build schools.    [Wainstein] The party has collected some 10,000 supporters'  signatures in under a week, now it's planning a national  campaign based on jobs for all and the right to work.    [Workers' List spokesman Ambrose Solomon] Such a right to  work must be included for people who are unemployed at this  stage and it must be a guarantee, it must become law, and we  believe that there must be a strong campaign against  retrenchments, and people who retrench ... [changes thought]  bosses that are retrenching people must be blacklisted and  fought. [end recording]</p>

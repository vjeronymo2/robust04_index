			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses switch into reverse in late trading EARLY improvement on the Danish Maastricht vote was eroded yesterday as bourses reviewed unexpectedly high money supply growth in Germany, and the absence of interest rate cuts at the Bundesbank meeting. The Eurotrack index produced an intraday switch into reverse, the trend apparently confirmed by a weak start on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was in optimistic mood and a broadly-based rally took the Comit index up 14.30 or 2.6 per cent to a 21 month high of 558.49. A half point fall in Italy's minimum repurchase rate to 10.50 per cent, the lowest since November 1991, was seen as setting the stage for a discount rate cut of at least half a percentage point, possibly after the government approves a L13 trillion package of deficit cuts in the next few days. Mr Marco Ortelli of Akros Sim in Milan noted strong foreign demand, particularly for the telecommunications sector. At the same time, domestic funds were reluctant to sell since the Comit's breach of the 550 level opened the way for a technical rally to around 580, he said. Fiat remained volatile, fixing L373 or 5.9 per cent higher at L6,700 but easing to L6,600. Generali added L1,155 or 3 per cent to L38,650 before L38,550 after-hours and Mediobanca was L799 or 4.8 per cent higher at L17,199 as foreign funds increased their weighting of the Italian market. Olivetti rose L61 or 4.5 per cent to L1,410 before L1,420 on the kerb in continued response to Monday's rights issue, while Parmalat added L676 or 4.3 per cent to L16,437 on further consideration of its rights issue terms. ZURICH edged forward to a third consecutive record close, ahead of today's Ascension Day holiday which marks the start of a long weekend away for many investors. The SMI index added 0.1 to 2,227.0, continuing to take a lead from the strong dollar. The market began firmly, as positions were squared ahead of tomorrow's expiry of futures and options on Soffex, but prices eased back from their best levels later. Holderbank bearers added SFr17 to SFr656 in active trade ahead of presentations to analysts next Monday and amid optimism at the outlook for first quarter results. Winterthur certificates shed SFr7 to SFr614 on further consideration of plans to swap its certificates into registered shares after splitting registered shares and bearers on a five for one basis. The registered shares shed SFr40 to SFr3,060. FRANKFURT's financials reflected its fiscal disappointments, Allianz falling DM23 to DM2,099, Deutsche Bank by DM5.50 to DM691 and Dresdner DM5 to DM369 as the DAX index closed 11.07 lower at 1,617.41. Turnover declined from DM5.7bn to DM5.1bn. Deutsche Bank lost ground although it reported full group operating profits up about 20 per cent in the first four months of 1993, compared to one third of last year's total, and mooted a higher dividend this year. Elsewhere there was activity, mostly bearish, in consumer stocks where Douglas, the upmarket retailer of perfumes and toiletries, fell DM17.50 to DM480 and Escada, the fashion group, dropped DM18 to DM220 after reporting a first half loss. Mr Adrian Hopkinson of NatWest Securities thought that Douglas might reflect difficulties reported in luxury products at Wella yesterday. Ironically, Wella rose DM17 to DM719 as it forecast another drop in raw material costs this year, after a fall of 7 per cent helped margins in 1992. AMSTERDAM fell back sharply in reaction to the German M3 data, a weak opening on Wall Street and options activity. The CBS Tendency index lost 2.1 or 2 per cent to 104.2. Unilever and Heineken were among the day's biggest losers, both falling Fl 2.60 to Fl 190.60 and Fl 178.80 respectively. Heineken has been falling recently partly on speculation about possible losses at the Spanish brewer in which it holds a 50 per cent stake. PARIS, on the last day of the account, saw high turnover which was swelled by a number of block trades crossing the market during the session. The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's high of 1,853, finished down 9.62 at 1,836.78 in turnover of some FFr4.8bn. One of the day's biggest losers was Michelin, down FFr5.60 or 3.8 per cent at FFr141.50, while BSN managed a modest FFr1 rise to FFr864 following Tuesday's fall after it announced plans to cut prices on some of its products. MADRID hit another downgrade in its erratic, post-devaluation career, the general index closing 1.70 lower at 255.19. STOCKHOLM added options-related selling in Astra A, down SKr12 to SKr730 after an initial jump of of SKr18 to SKr760, as the Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.7 to 1,076.5. COPENHAGEN lost much of its early gains as the detail of tax reform plans took over from the Maastricht vote. The KFX index closed 0.22 up at 87.09 in turnover of DKr1.1bn. HELSINKI was stronger after a threatened strike in the country's export sector was called off. The HEX index gained 32.5 or 2.7 per cent to 1,217.2 in turnover of FM230m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 19                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1154.22    1154.27    1154.36    1152.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1220.09    1218.68    1217.84    1216.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1152.28    1149.55    1148.78    1147.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.91    1211.61    1213.10    1212.27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 18    May 17    May 14    May 13    May 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1152.98   1146.07   1148.21   1155.16   1148.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1217.75   1214.06   1212.97   1219.59   1215.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1155.65; 200 - 1221.05 Low/day: 100 - 1147.60  200 - 1211.59.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy has described as a farce and  deception the rumors about preparations for a coup d'etat in  connection with the appearance in the press of an anonymous  document with a possible scenario of such an action. According  to him, the situation is being especially dramatized in order to  divert people's attention. He stated this during a visit to an  agricultural fair on the territory of the All-Russian Exhibition  Center, our correspondent Marina Chernukha reports. At the same  time Aleksandr Rutskoy remarked that anything could be expected  in the present situation, but he declared that, God forbid, he  should again go through events like those of October 1993.  Aleksandr Rutskoy is convinced that the situation in the  country can be put right; what this needs is to ensure the  control of the state, to determine the priorities of the  development of the economy, to create stimuli for their  realization, and to observe the laws.</p>

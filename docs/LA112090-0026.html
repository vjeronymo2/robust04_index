			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON IRAQ CRISIS  </P> <P> As a perennial Buchanan-basher I never dreamed I would be writing this letter  in his favor.  </P> <P> But I am delighted! Not with his every word of course, but with his general  conclusions.  </P> <P> In our last two wars in Korea and Vietnam, we wasted thousands of lives first  and then we sat down and talked for thousands of hours. Why don't we reverse  the procedure for this one? Let us talk with the "madman" for as long as it  takes, even while he's in Kuwait. I don't think the future dead will mind the  delay a bit.  </P> <P> Talk is cheap; it's our children's lives that are expensive.  </P> <P> BURTON HENRY, Temecula  </P></p>

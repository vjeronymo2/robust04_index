			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Anti-dumping biter bit 'THE US government is using legitimate trade policy instruments and exploiting them to harass foreign competitors and divert world trade flows, unduly blaming imports for what are primarily domestic problems.' Thus did a spokeswoman for the European Community react to the US Commerce Department's tentative determination that steel imports from 12 countries, including six EC members, are being unfairly subsidised. But wait just a moment. Can this be the very EC that last month imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of seamless steel tubes from eastern Europe? Indeed, it can. Nor were those duties nugatory. In the case of Czechoslovak steel, for example, the duty rate was 30.4 per cent. If anything, the US action looks more defensible than the EC's. Subsidies do distort a market economy, which is why action against 'state aids' has been so important to the EC. The measurement of subsidies can always be questioned. The US finding against British Steel, for example, is surprising. But the principle of countervailing subsidies does look reasonably sound. This does not mean that the US is any less guilty of abusing actions against 'unfair imports' than the EC. Countervailing duties are merely another string to its bow. The US steel industry has itself brought anti-dumping cases against 19 countries, preliminary decisions on which are expected in January 1993. Both the EC and the US find anti-dumping a convenient route towards targeted protection. The calculations of dumping or subsidisation are technical and their details are secret. Best of all, it is difficult for anyone to defend 'unfair imports'. But such explanations for the popularity of actions against allegedly unfair imports do not make them less worrying. On the contrary, the combination of political acceptability with ease of manipulation is their principal danger. There are three specific concerns. First, it is too easy to use anti-dumping as a covert tool of industrial policy. Many believe that this is precisely what the EC has done in the case of its duties against imports of electronic goods from Japan and other east Asian countries. Second, most anti-dumping actions have a weak economic justification. The economic case arises where dumping is predatory. Yet there have been many cases where anti-dumping action has been used not to prevent predatory pricing by foreigners, but to support cartel pricing by domestic firms. Third, the measurement of dumping (and subsidisation) too often seems entirely arbitrary. The preliminary US decisions against steel imports from the EC have just one advantage: they demonstrate that what is sauce for the EC goose is sauce for the US gander. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be subsumed within a global approach to competition. If these US actions bring that idea further up the agenda, they will not have been entirely damaging.</p>

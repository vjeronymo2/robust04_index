			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: FOR TV, CRIME IS DRUG OF CHOICE  </P> <P> Crime continues to pay -- if not always for perpetrators, at least for the  television industry.  </P> <P> From local newscasts to grimy tabloid series to prime-time docudramas, crime  stories have become a drug on which TV gets high. TV snorts crime the way an  addict snorts white powder, ensuring that every sensational case will  ultimately find its way to TV, and vice versa.  </P> <P> No surprise, then, that Sunday's 9-11 p.m. time slot pits California's "Night  Stalker" against Oregon's Mother Who Shot Her Three Children.  </P> <P> Creatively it's no contest. Given the enormous profile and hair-trigger  timeliness of its subject, NBC's "Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker"  (Channels 4, 36 and 39) may turn the most heads. But ABC's two-part "Small  Sacrifices" (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is the one to watch -- simply because  it's overwhelmingly superior both as entertainment and as an expose of the  sociopathic mind. Part 2 of this stunning crime story airs at 9 p.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> At the conclusion of NBC's movie, recently convicted "Night Stalker" Richard  Ramirez remains a creature of the shadows, nearly as obscured from public view  as he was when he carried out the serial killings that have brought him a death  sentence.  </P> <P> On one level you appreciate a sober and relatively straightforward  serial-murder biography like "Manhunt," which seems infinitely more honest than  last season's "Hillside Strangler" movie on NBC. If TV is indeed to be the  nation's ultimate criminal archive, however, then we should demand something  more of these stories than mere regurgitation of the public record. TV  newscasts and newspapers did that in closely following the "Night Stalker"  story as it unfolded. So beyond ratings, what's the point of the movie?  </P> <P> Something more -- much, much more -- is exactly what "Small Sacrifices" does  give us in presenting a fascinating criminal character study without altering  basic facts.  </P> <P> Guided by Ann Rule's mesmerizing book of the same title, director David Greene  and scriptwriter Joyce Eliason have shaped "Small Sacrifices" into a  heartbreaking, transfixing, harrowing psychological thriller that's less  whodunit than whydunit as it strips back the layers of a disturbingly bizarre  crime.  </P> <P> It begins on the night of May 19, 1983, when Diane Downs (Farrah Fawcett)  arrives at a Springfield, Ore., hospital with her three critically wounded  children, claiming they were shot on the road by a bushy-haired stranger who  had demanded her car. She too has been wounded, in the arm.  </P> <P> Almost from the beginning, the pieces don't fit, and Diane Downs and the  shootings (two of the children survive, but her toddler son is paralyzed and  her eldest daughter is physically and emotionally maimed) fuse into a single  mystery. It seems obvious that Downs herself did the shooting -- that beneath  her professed concern for her children and sometimes demure exterior lurks a  calculating destroyer, a demon incapable of true love or compassion. As one  detective observes: "She's weird, the woman is really weird."  </P> <P> Lethally weird, as Asst. Dist. Atty. Frank Joziak (John Shea) and Detective  Doug Welch (Gordon Clapp) learn during the tortuous process of looking for the  murder weapon and building a case against Downs as she taunts authorities and  bewilders them with her erratic behavior.  </P> <P> "Small Sacrifices" features gleaming performances by Fawcett, Shea and Emily  Perkins as the eldest daughter, Karen (not her real name).  </P> <P> Even when she's soft, there's a revealing hardness in the eyes of Fawcett's  nerve-jangling Diane, a narcissistic, manipulative, dominant personality.  Fawcett superbly captures the enigma: Diane is at once drawn toward and  contemptuous of men. She needs to have a baby in her belly, yet feels nothing  for her children. She seems so vulnerable, yet seconds later is utterly  vicious. Although she is brilliant, there are curious gaps in her intelligence,  blind spots that narrow her perceptions and ultimately betray her.  </P> <P> Shea's relentless, methodical Joziak (Fred Hugi is his real name) is  meticulously measured, outwardly stolid, yet inwardly seething, so emotionally  swept up in the case and paternalistic toward Karen that he becomes, in effect,  her surrogate father.  </P> <P> Perkins is breathtaking -- and beautifully directed by Greene in scenes where  the traumatized Karen probes her mind's inner regions to confront the horrible  reality of her mother's actions. Her testimony in court is devastating.  </P> <P> Occasional minor shadings of truth for dramatic effect fleetingly move "Small  Sacrifices" onto far-fetched turf, and the story dramatically slows at the  beginning of Part 2. But then it's on to knockout courtroom sequences that have  you on the edge of your seat.  </P> <P> Even from her prison cell, the real Downs has continued to blame the  "bushy-haired stranger," a view forcefully espoused in her own book on the  subject. Her two surviving children were ultimately adopted by Hugi and his  wife. Although he's portrayed as heroic, Hugi has publicly denounced the TV  story as being "fictional" and damaging to the children.  </P> <P> That came as a surprise to Rule, because the TV version is generally faithful  to her book, which Hugi never criticized, the author said by phone from her  Seattle home. She added that she was pleased with ABC's treatment.  </P> <P> However, the question of the TV program's potential impact on the children  cannot be easily dismissed. Once victimized by their mother, are they now being  victimized a second time by television in behalf of rating points?  </P> <P> Rule said she understands the concern. "It's valid, but the book and the  miniseries portray (Karen) as the hero. I'm sure the children have accepted  what has happened and have talked about it with their friends. After all, this  is not new."  </P> <P> Still, the uneasiness lingers.  </P> <P> In contrast, little more than emptiness lingers after "Manhunt," which views  the "Night Stalker" case through the eyes of Los Angeles County Sheriff's  detectives Frank Salerno (Richard Jordan) and Gil Carrillo (A Martinez).  Meanwhile, there is a parallel investigation by a TV reporter (Lisa Eilbacher),  a composite character who faces a moral and ethical dilemma over whether to  report information that could compromise the police investigation.  </P> <P> Bruce Seth Green directs suspensefully, and although Joe Gunn's script somewhat  awkwardly weaves Salerno's and Carrillo's personal lives into the story, it  seems free of the hyperbole that typifies so many crime docudramas.  (Ironically, this movie parenthetically credits Salerno and Carrillo with  achievements in the "Hillside Strangler" investigation that were credited to  another detective in that earlier NBC movie on the infamous strangler murders.)  </P> <P> All right, the "Night Stalker" is pursued, caught, tried and convicted. When  the story ends, however, you have learned essentially nothing, and you feel  nothing except the same compassion for the victims and hatred for Ramirez  (Gregory Norman Cruz) that you felt before the movie. So again, what is the  point?  </P></p>

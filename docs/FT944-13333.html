			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Ukraine close to winning aid from western donors Ukraine was last night close to securing financial aid from western donors and debt relief from its Russian and Turkmen energy suppliers at a Group of Seven-organised conference in Winnipeg. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said Russia, which is owed Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for oil and gas exports to Ukraine, was prepared to join the Paris club of official creditors and reschedule Dollars 625m of payments due in the fourth quarter of this year. Ukraine is seeking Dollars 900m for the fourth quarter to carry out the economic stabilisation agreement reached recently with the IMF, according to Mr Roman Shpek, the Ukrainian economy minister. In an attempt to ensure such assistance, the Ukrainian national bank passed a decree on Tuesday to unify the exchange rate, one of the measures urged on Ukraine by its international creditors. This will leave the value of the karbovanets, the temporary national currency, to be determined by the market and not, as hitherto, by the hard-currency priority committee. The government this week also announced bold price and export liberalisation measures which will cut subsidies on food, rents and energy, and remove bureaucratic limits on a range of export products. Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma, heading the Ukrainian delegation, told western donors the reform programme hinges on immediate western aid and a successful debt rescheduling agreement to cover its Dollars 600m fourth-quarter balance-of-payments deficit. 'We badly need help to get through the next two months and restructure our accounts. We are staking everything on the visit to Canada,' Mr Oleh Rybachuk, international department head at the National Bank, said before the conference began. Ukraine asked Russia and Turkmenistan, who are owed over Dollars 3bn for oil and gas exports, to conclude a rescheduling agreement. About Dollars 340m of the Dollars 600m financing gap for the fourth quarter is attributable to energy imports unmatched by exports. Russia, which faces its own debt renegotiation problems, was reluctant to reschedule; Mr Alexander Shohkin, Russian minister for economic affairs, earlier suggested Russia would prefer to exchange debt for former Soviet assets, including land, in the Ukraine. Before the conference, the European Union also dragged its feet, demanding repayment of past arrears of Dollars 100m and action to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which EU members still consider a big hazard but which the Ukrainians need to reduce their dependence on imported energy. The US committed Dollars 70m which it said it would raise to Dollars 100m if the EU came up with similarly-sized balance-of-payments aid. Canada pledged Dollars 25m. Ukraine, with a population of 53m, has a total foreign debt of around Dollars 7bn. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

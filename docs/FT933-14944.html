			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Agency's work may split 12 ways THE WORK of Companies House, the government's corporate information agency, may be divided up between as many as 12 private-sector businesses under proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry. Responsibility for fining companies which do not file accounts on time and for selling the information they provide would be split between a series of competing registrars. The plan has been drawn up by SRU, the management consultancy hired by the DTI last October to consider a range of options, from no change through to full privatisation. The plan suggests that companies should be able to file their accounts to a private-sector registrar of their choice. A central index owned by all the registrars would collect the information. It is likely that the power to prosecute companies which fail to file accounts, and some other important registration decisions, would remain under the control of a much smaller government unit. A memorandum circulating in Companies House from Mr David Durham, chief executive and registrar, says that no decision has been taken on the future of the agency and that various options remain open. Mr Kieron Hill, regional officer for Wales for the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, said: 'We want to protect our members' jobs and feel the proposals are slanted towards privatisation and a move away from headquarters in Cardiff. 'But we are also concerned that the users of Companies House services will be subject to the whims of private-sector registrars who may neglect compliance and legal obligations.' SRU is canvassing the views of Companies House staff, Chambers of Commerce and companies likely to be affected by the proposals.</p>

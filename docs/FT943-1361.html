			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar lingers The dollar trickled down to the low end of its narrow trading range against both the yen and the D-Mark yesterday as the markets were transfixed by upcoming events, writes Motoko Rich. Divided market sentiment about whether the US Federal reserve will raise interest rates next week left dealers largely on the sidelines in a quiet day of trading. Against the D-Mark, the dollar closed in London at DM1.5443, down from DM1.5488. Against the yen, it finished at Y97.7050, down from Y98.0750. The D-Mark was sluggish on the European crosses. It was moved only slightly by cost of living figures in two German states which suggested national statistics may subdue inflation worries. Sterling was helped by better than expected national accounts. Against the dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5788 up from Dollars 1.5762. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM2.438, down from DM2.4411. The markets hovered as speculation about the possibility of a rate hike at next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, prevented significant movement on the dollar. Trade talks between the US and Japan have not yet yielded results and most analysts are expecting compromise in at least some areas, such as the auto sector. In the meantime, analysts believe the dollar will only flirt with its technical resistance level of Y97.50. The release of September cost of living indices in two German states led analysts to soften their inflation fears, which they said would help the D-Mark in the long term. In North Rhine-Westphalia the index rose by 1 per cent and in Baden-Wuerttemberg, it dropped by 1 per cent. 'The overall picture, if these figures are good indicators of the national figures, looks slightly better than expected,' said Mr Rob Hayward, economist at Bank of America. 'There is a chance that inflation could actually come down in Germany in September.' The D-Mark fell against the lira as rumours of a possible compromise between the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Italy's trade union over a pension reform package circulated in the market. Against the lira, the D-Mark closed in London at L1009, down from L1011. Sterling was boosted by a surprisingly good second quarter GDP figure and a lower than expected current account deficit. Analysts said these contributed to a continuing bullish outlook for the pound. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said: 'The question which remains, however, is, will sterling weaken if the interest rate rises that our currently priced into the futures markets don't occur?' The December short sterling contract traded 38,000 lots to settle at 93.19, up from 93.18, and thus discounting a three month interest rate of 6.81 per cent. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m. It provided assistance totalling Pounds 919m. Overnight rates traded between 3 1/2 and 5 per cent.</p>

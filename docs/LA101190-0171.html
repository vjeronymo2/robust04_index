			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRECKERS RIPPED INTO HISTORIC THEATER BY ACCIDENT, OWNER OF COMPLEX SAYS  </P> <P> It was merely a mistake when demolition workers illegally hacked down a section  of the historic Whittier Theatre complex, said an attorney for Peter Doerkin,  owner of the property.  </P> <P> Eleven workers took down support beams and sections of roof for about seven  hours late last month before being discovered and stopped by residents and city  officials.  </P> <P> "The demolition contractor had a permit to demolish another theater building in  the city of Whittier," attorney Charles Cummings said. "The crews went to the  wrong place. They made a mistake. They went there without our knowledge,  consent or approval."  </P> <P> Demolition contractor Cleveland Wrecking is also the firm hired to level a  non-historic theater near a mall more than two miles to the east.  </P> <P> The explanation did not satisfy City Council member Helen McKenna-Rahder, who  had ordered workers off the site with the help of City Manager Thomas G. Mauk.  </P> <P> "They had the key to the fence and the whole bit," she said. "There was no  demolition permit or anything. We are pursuing a better explanation."  </P> <P> In June, the state Office of Historic Preservation prohibited the 61-year-old  theater's demolition. The developer intends to challenge the state in court,  Cummings said.  </P></p>

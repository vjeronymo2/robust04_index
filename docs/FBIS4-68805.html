			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Ivanov: "An Oblast Politician of a Russian </F> Scope"]    [Text] An old enemy of Boris Yeltsin--the chairman of  the Kemerovo Legislative Assembly, Aman Tuleyev--has once again  exhibited his obstinate nature by refusing to sign the agreement  on civil accord. He explained his refusal by a mistrust of the  document's initiators and, specifically, of the government  which, in his words, is wallowing in corruption.    Aman Tuleyev is one of the more talented opposition  politicians. A Kazakh by nationality, he has succeeded in  becoming a public leader of his oblast. A communist by  conviction, he has succeeded in persuading the local miners to  change over from being firm Yeltsin supporters to being  confirmed oppositionists.    Aman Tuleyev began as an "oblast politician." In 1990 he  became a people's deputy of Russia, and then headed up the  Kemerovo oblsovet [oblast soviet] and ispolkom [executive  committee]. But already after a year he announced his candidacy  for the office of president of Russia and finished in fourth  place (after Yeltsin, Ryzhkov and Zhirinovskiy), receiving  around seven percent of the vote. Of course, in the course of  the pre-electoral campaign he showed himself to be a talented  orator who knows how to speak vividly and at length about the  misfortunes of the people. But a significant role was played  also by a group of talented image makers, who molded Tuleyev  into a great politician (we might add, the people who conducted  his pre-electoral campaign were later invited to work in the  president's administration).    In the days of the August events of 1991, Tuleyev met with  Gennadiy Yanayev. The content of their conversation is unknown,  but the mere fact that the talk occurred was reason enough for  President Yeltsin to dismiss the obstinate politician from his  duties as chairman of the Kemerovo ispolkom. The documents  confirming Tuleyev's contacts with the GKChP [State Committee  for Extraordinary Situation] were forwarded to the investigative  committee, and he himself was forced to file an application to  leave the position of chairman of the oblast soviet.    At this critical moment it became clear that Tuleyev was not  alone in Kemerovo. Well-established ties between the local trade  unions and the directorate became apparent. Tuleyev was also  supported by the industrialists in the Supreme Soviet (his  membership in the "Industrial Union" faction helped). The oblast  soviet did not accept the resignation of its chairman, and  Tuleyev withdrew his application.    Tuleyev's active contacts with the "irreconcilable  opposition" began in 1992. Moreover, it would be more precise to  say that the "irreconcilables" strived to establish contacts  with the chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet. However,  sharply criticizing the authorities and expressing his complete  solidarity with the demands of the opposition, Tuleyev himself  crossed out his signature under the constituent announcement of  the Front for National Salvation.    In September-October of 1992, Tuleyev, being a realist,  understood that the Supreme Soviet had little chance of  withstanding the struggle with the president. He proposed that  the participants of the 10th Congress move to Kemerovo. However,  this advice was not taken, and shortly before the tragic  dissolution Tuleyev himself left for Kemerovo to "work locally."    Obviously, Tuleyev has not been able to institute the  "Kemerovo Soviet Republic." The oblast soviet was disbanded, and  a secret attempt was made on Tuleyev's life: The attacker fired  two shots into the closed door of his apartment. The politician  got off with a mild scare, the guilty parties were never found,  but these events marked the beginning of new growth of Tuleyev's  popularity. In December he was elected to the Federation  Council, in March--to the oblast legislative assembly, and both  times he was victorious by an impressive margin.    Today Tuleyev feels confident in Kemerovo. Many members of  his command have been elected to the oblast parliament, while  his differences with Governor Mikhail Kislyuk have completely  faded into the past (it was Kislyuk who nominated Tuleyev to the  position of speaker). And since the old contacts with the  directorate and the trade unions have been retained, and the  miners have long ago stopped supporting Yeltsin, we may say for  sure: The Kemerovo "president" is not frightened by the  President of Russia.</p>

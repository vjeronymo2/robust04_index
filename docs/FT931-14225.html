			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / A separation of powers: IBM is reducing its reliance on mainframe computers and creating autonomous business units in an attempt to reverse its decline International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer and a symbol of US technological prowess, is today expected to report the biggest annual loss in US corporate history. Wall Street is forecasting total losses for 1992 to be about Dollars 4.7bn, after taking into account pre-tax charges of Dollars 11.4bn to pay for continuing cuts in the company's workforce and the consolidation of manufacturing operations. It will be the second consecutive year that 'Big Blue' has reported a loss and the US financial community has delivered a damning verdict on the company's performance. IBM's stock was yesterday trading at less than Dollars 50 a share, down from more than Dollars 100 as recently as July. Last week, the company's AAA credit rating was downgraded to AA minus by Standard &amp; Poor's. Today's results will add to the gloom surrounding IBM. But of even greater significance to investors in the company, its customers and its rivals and allies in the international information technology industry will be the company's fate over the next five years or so. Can IBM survive as the leading company in the world's information technology industry or is it doomed to a protracted decline? Until recently, such a question would have seemed unthinkable. Few companies have had such power to set standards, influence trends and exert leadership in an industry as IBM has for the past 30 years. Now only one thing is certain. The company must change radically if it is to regain its strength and profitability. The corporate structure on which IBM was built is increasingly obsolete. The markets it has dominated have been reshaped by advances in semiconductor technology that have reduced sharply the cost of computers and the gross profit margins of computer manufacturers. This trend has been under way for several years, but as IBM's chairman John Akers told US analysts before the turn of the year, the rate of change is accelerating: 'Advances in technology are placing more function, more power and more memory in ever-smaller semiconductor chips, while proprietary technologies are declining in value as industry-standard building blocks become the norm.' Many computing tasks that once ran on mainframe computers - the large centralised systems which have traditionally been IBM's main product - can now be carried out on networks of smaller, less expensive machines. This has played to the strengths of a new generation of Silicon Valley competitors which have lower costs and more flexible production and which have responded more quickly to changing market demands. This is the primary cause of the current downturn at IBM. It has been exacerbated by weak global economic conditions which have depressed demand for its products. Faced with a choice between a multi-million dollar investment in an IBM mainframe and less expensive computer networks, information systems managers within companies are increasingly choosing the latter option. 'Today, information systems managers are afraid to expose themselves within an organisation by paying the high price of IBM mainframe computer power,' says Mr John Jones Jr, an analyst at Salomon Bros in San Francisco. His comment is a startling revision of the old adage that nobody was ever fired for buying IBM. Mr Jones estimates that IBM's mainframe revenues declined by almost 15 per cent last year to Dollars 9.3bn from Dollars 10.9bn in 1991. Sales of related products - such as data storage systems and printers as well as software and services which, combined, represent about one-third of turnover  -have also suffered. IBM was built to sell mainframes. It has the structure, the sales and support operations, the manufacturing and research and development goals, and the high overheads of a mainframe computer company. Yet mainframes seem unlikely to provide IBM with significant opportunities for growth. IBM's dilemma is vividly illustrated by an analysis of the company's biggest market, Europe, carried out by OTR Pedder, a Brussels consultancy. It shows (see chart) that in 1974, when IBM was enjoying its greatest success, mainframes comprised almost 80 per cent of the hardware market by value. Today, the corresponding figure is only 20 per cent. From nothing in 1976, personal computers and workstations have grown to more than 60 per cent of the market by value. The challenge facing IBM, therefore, is to make a transition from a company heavily dependent on high-margin mainframe sales to a smaller, more flexible organisation with a stronger presence in faster-growing areas of the computer market such as personal computers, workstations, networking systems, consumer products and computing services. IBM has already taken steps to reduce costs. It has shed about 100,000 employees and reduced manufacturing capacity by 40 per cent since 1986. A further 25,000 jobs, or 8 per cent of the workforce, will go this year. Research and development spending, the seed corn of success in the computer business, will be cut from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 8bn this year. These measures have made an impact. Revenue per employee, a measure of efficiency, is now Dollars 213,000, more than its competitors Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. But most industry analysts believe further reorganisation is necessary. Mr Mark Stahlman, author of a soon-to-be published study, Why IBM Failed, remains critical: 'For all its restructurings over the last few years, IBM has consistently chosen to nibble the bullet instead of bite it.' The company may now be ready to cut deep into previously sacrosanct territory. Mr Akers's pre-Christmas announcement that most of the 25,000 jobs to go this year will be in sectors supporting the mainframe business was regarded as a watershed by many within IBM. The cornerstone of his strategy, however, launched at the end of 1991, is to decentralise management and turn IBM from a monolith into a 'federation of increasingly autonomous and independent business units' that are more flexible and able to compete more effectively in their own segments of the computer market. Known as the 'Baby Blues', the first of these fledglings have been the IBM PC Company, formed last September to take over all the company's personal computer operations; Adstar, formerly IBM's data storage division; and Pennant Systems, IBM's high-speed printer operation. So far, the results seem promising. Last November the IBM PC Company achieved the highest monthly volume of PC shipments in IBM's history. It earned revenues of about Dollars 9bn in 1992 - making it the world's largest personal computer company - and is expected to be profitable this year. Adstar, the data storage business, has established itself as an important supplier in the industry. It is the leader in the rapidly growing market for high capacity 3.5-inch disc drives, which store computer data, and achieved an estimated Dollars 800m in sales to outside customers in 1992. Pennant Systems, with revenues of Dollars 2bn, is expected to show a small profit for last year. There are criticisms, however, that IBM is not moving fast enough to give autonomy to other segments of the business. Mr Stahlman maintains, for example, that in workstations (high performance desktop computers) - the fastest growing segment of the computer hardware business - IBM's product development and manufacturing operation is hampered by an inability to create its own strategic relationships in a highly competitive market. Increased autonomy for IBM's operations is of particular importance in the service sector, an area that represents one of the company's best opportunities to return to profitability. Sales of computing services - including consulting work, software, project and facilities management, and systems integration - are growing at about 25 per cent a year compared with less than 5 per cent for hardware. IBM is expanding its services operations, establishing new business units worldwide and pricing its services aggressively to attract business. Already, more than 40 per cent of IBM's revenues come from software and services: 'In four or five years, IBM may no longer be a dominant force in hardware products but it will be a computer services powerhouse,' says Mr John Logan, vice-president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston consulting and market research group. IBM's ambitions in computing services have produced a hostile response from competitors. Mr Keith Burgess, managing partner for Andersen Consulting in the UK, says: 'I find it a desperately cynical suggestion that any hardware manufacturer or software house can enter the upper echelons of the consulting business just like that. . . .The skills of the line manager are not the skills to effect the step changes in performance that are the hallmark of the effective consultant.' Impartiality in recommending equipment is another potential problem. In the US, IBM has formed a subsidiary, Integrated Systems Solutions Company (ISSC), to create a buffer between its sales and consulting operations. Since ISSC was formed in May 1991, it has won some impressive contracts, including a 10-year, Dollars 3bn deal to manage McDonnell Douglas's IT operations. Beyond restructuring its operations to address existing markets more effectively and shifting resources into the service sector, IBM is pursuing new business opportunities: It is beginning to focus on consumer electronics where the convergence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies is widely expected to create the next 'blockbuster' electronics product. Mr David Robinson, president of consultancy CSC Index, points to the potential of a device small enough to fit the pocket, cheap enough for the mass consumer market and powerful enough to transmit voice, data and images over communications networks. IBM demonstrated a prototype of such a device at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. The 16-ounce 'personal communicator' combines PC power, and electronic mail with cellular telephone and fax capability. 'Whether or not this technology becomes an actual product is not really the issue,' says Jack Kuehler, IBM president. 'The device is only the 'razor'. Our intent - and our core business - is to provide the 'blades' of online services, communications, visual content and information entry.' Technology alliances are another element of IBM's recovery strategy. Among the most significant is its partnership with Apple Computer. In a joint venture called Taligent the two companies are developing personal computer software that analysts believe may challenge Microsoft's dominance of the PC software market. 'IBM handed the PC industry to Microsoft on a silver platter when it adopted Microsoft's DOS operating system in 1981. Now it is fighting to regain control,' says Mr Jones of Salomon Bros. IBM is also expanding its sales of technology and components to other companies in the industry. In particular, its semiconductor division is seeking external sales rather than producing chips solely for internal consumption as it has done until recently. As the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer it has the resources and the technology to become a significant competitor in this market. Implementation of these strategies implies the emergence of a different corporate structure. But few within the company or the industry see an alternative to Mr Akers's plans. Most also agree that success will depend to a large extent on the degree of autonomy afforded the new businesses and operations. 'IBM's willingness to let go of the reins and allow subsidiary businesses to develop according to their own internal logic is still the great question facing the company,' write Mr Charles Ferguson and Mr Charles Morris, authors of Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a Post-IBM World, to be published next month. They blame IBM's problems on its tendency to impose 'mainframe style management' on businesses where it is inappropriate. Recovery will also require patience. 'IBM is like an aircraft carrier that takes five or 10 miles to turn around in an age of speedboats,' says Regis McKenna, a respected computer industry consultant and author of Who's Afraid of Big Blue, an account of the success of Silicon Valley companies in their contest with IBM. 'Companies such as Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer grew up in a competitive environment. IBM grew up in the 1950s, when it could control the market environment,' he says. 'Now it has to learn to become interdependent with the market. It will take a long time, at least five years, to turn IBM around,' Mr McKenna predicts.</p>

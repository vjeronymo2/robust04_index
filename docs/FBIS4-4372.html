			<p>BFN     [Text] In the High Court today, the appeal of Michael Peter  Fay was dismissed. Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that he was  satisfied that the district judge had taken into consideration  all the relevant facts. Michael Fay had appealed against the  sentence of four-month jail and six strokes of the cane for two  counts of vandalism.    The chief justice said he had duly considered the  psychiatric  report and the background of the accused. He said he could not  accept that the pre-sentencing report, which could call for  probation, should have been made. This has been suggested by  the Queen's Counsel, Mr. Michael Sherrard. Twenty charges had  been taken into consideration, in which 16 were for acts of  vandalism. The chief justice said he considered that Michael Fay  had committed the acts of vandalism deliberately and willfully,  which amounted to a calculated cause of criminal conduct over 10  days.</p>

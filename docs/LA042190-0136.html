			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIZZITELLO GETS 33 YEARS IN JAIL;  </P> <P> COURTS: THE REPUTED MOB UNDER-BOSS'S PRISON TERM STEMS FROM THE 1987 SHOOTING  OF THE FINANCIER OF A TOPLESS BAR WHO WAS LEFT BLINDED BY THE ATTACK.  </P> <P> Michael Anthony Rizzitello, a reputed under-boss in the Milano organized crime  family in Los Angeles, was sentenced to 33 years in prison Friday for shooting  and blinding a Santa Ana topless-bar financier.  </P> <P> C. William Carroll, shot three times in the back of the head while in a Costa  Mesa parking garage three years ago, told Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn  Jr. before the sentencing: "I can't see justice done, but I can hear it. I  would like to hear it today."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello, 62, tried to kill Carroll, 58, because  he saw him as a roadblock in the racketeer's attempt to take over the  now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> Just after midnight on May 1, 1987, Carroll rode in a car to the parking garage  with Rizzitello and Joseph Angelo Grosso, who is already serving a 26-year  prison term for his part in the shooting. Rizzitello, seated in the back,  grabbed Carroll from behind and fired as Grosso held Carroll down to prevent  his escape.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told the judge that it was "a miracle  that this was not a completed execution. There's no doubt that when the  Legislature set up this kind of sentence for this crime, it was with someone  like (Rizzitello) in mind."  </P> <P> Flynn sentenced Rizzitello to 25 years to life in prison for conspiracy to  commit first-degree murder. He then added three years for great bodily injury  to Carroll, two years for use of a firearm, and three more because Rizzitello  was a convicted felon with a firearm.  </P> <P> Rizzitello, who did not testify during trial, made no comment at the  sentencing. His attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, said he would immediately file  an appeal.  </P> <P> "This case is not over," the defense lawyer said. "I truly believe that Mr.  Rizzitello is innocent."  </P> <P> Rizzitello has a long history of racketeering-related arrests and convictions.  In 1980, he was one of five people convicted in a major federal organized crime  case in Los Angeles for which he served five years behind bars. But he also had  been acquitted in three major cases since -- two involving fraud charges and  one involving a possible attempt to kill a government witness.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials applauded Rizzitello's conviction and sentencing as a  major strike against organized crime in Southern California.  </P> <P> "The (Milano) crime family in many ways has proven to be small and ineffective;  but within that family, Rizzitello was the one who was clearly capable of  carrying out violent threats," said Loren W. DuChesne, chief of investigation  for the Orange County district attorney's office. "This is very significant for  law enforcement; we're very pleased."  </P> <P> On the night of the shooting, Carroll was found in a pool of blood in the  parking garage near the Orange County Performing Arts Center. One of three  bullets from a .38-caliber handgun severed an optic nerve, destroying his  eyesight. Another bullet remains in his head.  </P> <P> For 18 months, Carroll refused to tell police who shot him. He agreed to  cooperate only after a bank fraud case pending against him was reduced by  prosecutors to a misdemeanor so he could avoid jail.  </P> <P> During Rizzitello's trial, Carroll testified that he had refused to name his  assailants while the fraud case was pending for fear that Rizzitello would have  him killed if he ended up serving any time in Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> With Carroll out of the way, Rizzitello received $5,000 a week from the Mustang  Club's profits after threatening manager Gene Lesher that he would be next if  he didn't cooperate, according to Lesher's testimony. Lesher said he made the  payments through George (Big George) Yudzevich, the club's bouncer, who worked  for Rizzitello.  </P> <P> Yudzevich was later found shot to death in an Irvine industrial park. His  murder is still under investigation. Also pending is an investigation into the  murder of the original manager at the Mustang, Jimmy Lee Casino, who was gunned  down at his Buena Park home on Jan. 1, 1987.  </P> <P> When Grosso, 46, testified at Rizzitello's trial, he admitted he was in the car  when Carroll was shot and that Rizzitello was the gunman. But he denied any  involvement.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both Rizzitello and Grosso argued to jurors that Carroll was  responsible for both the Casino and Yudzevich murders.  </P> <P> Carroll said at Grosso's sentencing hearing in December that having his  character maligned in public was a heavy price to pay for justice.  </P> <P> On Friday, Carroll told Judge Flynn that he has a deep sympathy for all victims  of crime.  </P> <P> "I agree with the right of a fair trial, but I feel for victims who have to go  through this kind of thing," Carroll said.  </P> <P> Carroll denies any involvement in either the Casino or Yudzevich murders. And  despite defense claims that Carroll was a primary police suspect in the Casino  murder, law enforcement officials insist that has never been true.  </P> <P> It was Carroll who gave Casino more than $200,000 in several payments in the  early 1980s to get the Mustang bar in operation. Because Casino was about to  default on the loan at the time he was killed, Carroll essentially took over as  the primary operator of the club.  </P> <P> It was soon after the Casino killing that Grosso, who hung out at the club and  sometimes drove Carroll around, got him together with Rizzitello. Carroll and  Rizzitello had known each other in prison at Chino nearly 18 years earlier.  Rizzitello was serving an armed robbery sentence and Carroll was serving a  short term for fraud.  </P> <P> Carroll said after Friday's sentencing that he agreed to renew the old  acquaintance, but had no idea it might lead to trouble.  </P> <P> Rizzitello eventually got Carroll to loan him $10,000 for a lingerie business  that he ran. But Carroll balked at other ventures Rizzitello suggested.  </P> <P> Rizzitello lawyer Brooklier argued to jurors that his client had no motive for  shooting Carroll, because Carroll's own testimony showed Rizzitello did not ask  him for part of the Mustang Club's profits.  </P> <P> But prosecutors say that Rizzitello concluded before getting to that stage that  Carroll would not be cooperative.  </P> <P> Carroll said Friday that the shooting was a complete surprise, because he and  Rizzitello had not exchanged harsh words.  </P> <P> "It was strictly an ambush," Carroll said.  </P> <P> Carroll said Rizzitello told him just before firing the gun: "This is for not  letting us eat."  </P> <P> Lesher testified that when he met with Rizzitello later, the racketeer told  him: "Bill Carroll wanted to dine alone . . . you're involved."  </P> <P> Carroll said he did "a lot of soul-searching" before deciding to tell  authorities who shot him. Partly, he said, it was because Rizzitello made  threats through others to kill him and others in his family if he talked.  </P> <P> Carroll said he also was offered $100,000 from someone over the telephone if he  would not testify against Rizzitello. Carroll said he tape-recorded the call  and turned the tape over to distict attorney investigators.  </P> <P> Although Rizzitello did not testify at his trial, through his attorney,  Brooklier, he has denied shooting Carroll.  </P> <P> Brooklier contends that Carroll named Rizzitello as the gunman only because he  made a deal with prosecutors that would keep him out of jail on his bank fraud  charge. Prosecutor Evans has called that argument "ridiculous."  </P></p>

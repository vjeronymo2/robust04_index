			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Personal View: Why UK suffers from lack of investment As the UK economy embarks on its second year of 'recovery', a critical issue is how much potential slack there is in the system. Giles Keating (Letters: 'No evidence of narrowing output gap', February 16) correctly points out that the total rise in employment last year was more than accounted for by an increase in part-timers and self-employed and, therefore, 'the total number of hours of labour services used by the economy hasn't risen much during the recovery and may well have continued to fall'. In itself, 'this is not evidence of a narrowing output gap', but a full answer to the question requires an appreciation of what is happening to the utilisation of plant and machinery, as well as labour. The CBI industrial trends survey suggests the overall position is hotting up in manufacturing. The proportion of companies reporting their present level of output as 'below capacity' has fallen from 73 per cent to 57 per cent over the last year. The CBI research shows that, when companies respond to this question, they take account of labour and plant capacity. If labour is not a problem, yet companies report an increase in capacity utilisation, the implication is that the position with respect to plant capacity is tighter than appears from the overall measure. This picture is confirmed by responses to another question in the survey: 'What factors are likely to limit your output over the next four months?' Responses to the 'skilled labour' and 'other labour' categories have remained flat at a very low level over the last year. Response to the 'plant capacity' category has more than doubled and is back to its 1970s cyclical peak. The survey shows that, prior to the 1980s, a shortage of labour was the effective constraint on the economy. Now the problem is available plant and machinery, at least at current investment rates. This picture is for manufacturing alone, which accounts for only one-quarter of national output. But if there are some fundamental, economy-wide reasons why manufacturing is 'underinvesting' in this way, other areas of the economy may be similarly afflicted. An important explanation of why UK companies may be underinvesting was highlighted by Professor Dimson and Professor Marsh (Management: 'Unhappy returns', February 9). They suggest companies have yet to adjust to the worldwide fall in cost of debt and equity capital. As a result, managements are demanding an excessive return from new investment projects and 'there is a real danger that these companies will underinvest'. Dimson and Marsh suggest that a company's true overall cost of capital is now in the region of 11-12 per cent (after tax), compared with the more common assumption used by companies of about 20 per cent. The critical issue is the appropriate risk premium to apply to the risk-free rate of return required by the market. The risk-free rate can be approximated by the yield to maturity on government debt. The conventional way of measuring the risk premium is simply to take the extent to which equities have outperformed government bonds over some historic period. On this basis, Dimson and Marsh produce 8 per cent for the risk premium, or 6-7 per cent adjusting for the fact that a company's shares are more risky than its underlying assets. However, the historic outperformance of equities will only be a good indicator of what the market requires from them if investors more or less correctly anticipated events. The biggest mistake the market has made in recent history has been to underestimate inflation. Hence, the total real return on long-dated gilts issued in the 1960s was zero or less. Equities, on the other hand, provide more of a hedge against inflation through their ability to increase dividends. Unanticipated inflation has generally pushed the outperformance of equities compared with gilts above that required or expected by the market. In this case, the actual equity risk premium demanded by the market is probably a lot less than the historic outperformance of equities and, therefore, conventional practice will lead companies to assume too high a cost of capital. Indeed, the only way to make sense of current equity ratings is to assume a risk premium more like 2-4 per cent, in which case the true cost of capital is more like 8-9 per cent, less than half the common assumption. The widespread overstatement of the cost of capital in business is reason enough to explain why the UK economy generally - not just in manufacturing - suffers from a lack of investment and is in grave danger of being left with a high level of 'capital-shortage' unemployment.

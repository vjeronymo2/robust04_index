			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Washington in a corner over trade sanctions ALL THE formulas concocted, plans rejected, trips taken and words spoken since the EC and US began battling over oilseeds subsidies in the 1980s have been to no avail. In pushing hard and insistently for an EC reduction of its massive subsidies, the US has now backed itself into a corner with no other route to take than its unilateral 'withdrawal of concessions' - otherwise known as sanctions - on Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) worth of EC white wines, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten. Many officials believe that with no other course to follow provoking a real crisis may be the only way of forcing deeply divided EC countries to work together to offer a satisfactory compromise. 'We regret that we were forced to take this action,' said Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. 'For five years the EC has refused to provide the US what it is clearly owed under international trading rules. The credibility and effectiveness of the Gatt are at stake here.' The course the US is following is difficult for the legalistic Mrs Hills. Since the Uruguay Round got under way, US trade officials have committed themselves to act under multilateral rules, wherever they apply in trade disputes, and to work to improve the Gatt dispute settlement process. The US has acted unilaterally against China - which is not a member of the Gatt - and on intellectual property rights, which is not covered by trade rules. But wherever possible, it has sought to negotiate; in fact Mrs Hills has yet to go beyond the threat of imposing trade sanctions. In Mrs Hills view, the US has played by the rules, won two panel decisions, delayed for compensation talks, twice tried to fix a level of damages through arbitration and been blocked by the EC. And it has embarked on an exhaustive set of negotiations to find a solution within the proposed Uruguay Round reform of agriculture trade. On Wednesday the US asked the Gatt council for authorisation to withdraw tariff concessions given earlier, in essence asking for permission to impose sanctions. The EC blocked the request. This left the US without clear rules to follow. To delay action further, would expose the Gatt as a toothless tiger and a useless court of final appeals. All hope of agreement ended, in fact, because of a lack of trust. The US could not believe in proposed EC formulas for limiting oilseeds production. With so many economic problems of its own the US felt it could not accept a fudged accord which did not produce the expected results. The action came two days after the election, leaving Mrs Hills less than three months in office. She did not approach President-elect Bill Clinton or anyone on his staff because, as she explained yesterday, no one had yet been appointed whom she could consult.</p>

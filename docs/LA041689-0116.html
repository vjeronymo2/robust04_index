			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT GIVES IN L.A.? JUST ABOUT ANYTHING  </P> <P> Shopping for a gift for the city that has everything?  </P> <P> How about samurai warrior headgear? Or a bowie knife? Or a genuine Australian  boomerang.  </P> <P> Those are among the thousands of items that have been given to the city of Los  Angeles over the years. And, if all goes as planned, many of the gifts will be  exhibited in a City Hall museum, built as part of the building's restoration.  </P> <P> Some of the gifts already are on display, such as an entire tea room given by  Los Angeles' sister city of Nagoya, Japan, and set up in a park in Hollywood. A  bell from South Korea sits atop a bluff overlooking Los Angeles Harbor.  </P> <P> "The Netherlands sent us hundreds of thousands of tulips, which were planted by  the Recreation and Parks Department all over the city," said Bee Canterbury  Lavery, the city's chief of protocol. The mayor's mansion was a gift from Getty  Oil Co.  </P> <P> Many other gifts, however, are stuffed away in closets in the office of Mayor  Tom Bradley, who usually accepts them on behalf of the city. City officials  have no idea how many are stashed away there -- and often don't know now who  gave them.  </P> <P> Some gifts are practical and readily used. The Fire Department, for instance,  welcomes discarded airplane fuselages, which it sets afire and uses for  training.  </P> <P> And, of course, the city welcomes gifts of cash, such as the $3.24 million  donated by the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation for rebuilding the Hollywood Library,  destroyed by fire. And undoubtedly the most generous gift was a piece of  property -- the 3,015 acres donated by Col. Griffith J. Griffith in 1896 for  use as a park.  </P> <P> But not everything offered is accepted. The Library Department gets calls from  people proposing to give back issues of National Geographic "every time  somebody cleans out a garage," but it declines because it has plenty of the  magazines, spokesman Robert Reagan said.  </P> <P> The city gives gifts too.  </P> <P> The standard one that Bradley presents to visiting dignitaries is, of course, a  key to the city. "We even have a lock that it unlocks," Lavery said. The part  of the key that fits into the lock contains a miniature reproduction of City  Hall.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from "The Seven O'Clock </F> News" newscast]    [Text] At the assemblies convoked by Cuban labor unions due  to the need to reorder financially the country and to increase  efficiency, workers have insisted on the need to unearth the  causes of the insensibility of a group of enterprises.    During the regular period of sessions of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, it was established that  only 31 percent of Cuban state enterprises are profitable and  that subsidies totaled 4.6 billion pesos--that is, 73 percent  more than in 1989--during 1993.    Despite the fact that external factors are negatively  affecting the island, it is a fact that efficiency must increase  at all levels, and financial discipline must improve.    The subsidies to which some unprofitable enterprises became  accustomed have an unfavorable effect on labor productivity and  labor discipline [words indistinct], because in Cuba there is a  very flexible labor legislation that does not contemplate  different remunerations concerning each individual's  contribution for a same profession. Things will change this  year, at least as far as subsidies are concerned, if we observe  the statements made by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who  explained recently that to grant subsidies, the financial  situation of organizations and enterprises will be examined.  The entities showing deficits will be forced more than ever to  collect their accounts receivable, prior to requesting subsidies  from the state budget.    Up until last September the business sector had 2.8 billion  pesos in accounts receivable, a factor that results in  difficulties and the ensuing diversion of resources.  Authorities and Cuban unions are certain the irregularities in  the collections and payments [words indistinct] enterprises  generate discipline and [words indistinct]. As part of the  people's democracy inherent to the indigenous social product,  the unions will decide once more, however, [words indistinct]  this time, it consists of overseeing in situ how the payments  imbalance among enterprises are resolved.    Cuban workers [words indistinct] the battle of all society  to  reduce and eradicate unprofitability of a group of entities  [words indistinct].</p>

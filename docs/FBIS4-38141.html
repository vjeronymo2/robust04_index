Likud Chairman Binyamin  Netanyahu told our correspondent that if the prime minister is  serious in his intent not to permit the division of Jerusalem,  then he must prevent 'Arafat from coming to the city and he must  also close Orient House. Netanyahu believes that 'Arafat will  not come to Jerusalem to pray but to divide the town and set up  there a capital for the Palestinian state he plans and that  Yitzhaq Rabin is assisting him in his endeavor.</p>

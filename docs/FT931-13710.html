			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major to focus on business regulation MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday announced plans for a cabinet seminar aimed at forcing ministers and their permanent secretaries to produce plans to cut the burden of unnecessary regulations on business, Ivo Dawnay writes. The seminar, due to be held on February 2, is intended to follow up the prime minister's public commitment at the Conservative party conference in Brighton last year to ease bureaucratic constraints on enterprise. A Downing Street official said particular stress would be put on the need to halt the common practice of adding UK regulations to European Community directives issued from Brussels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chamber of Deputies, whose 18th session is to  resume on Thursday, today adopted a law on postal services and  telecommunications. It postponed the adoption of amendments to  the law on the sale of apartments under tenancy agreements until  there has been a revision of the use of all so-called army  apartments. The chamber decided to call an extraordinary session  in July, at which an answer will be formulated on whether the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate should be extended. It  was suggested that the state president be invited to this  session.    The decision to convene a session in July was adopted  following a debate on a resolution condemning the genocide in  the form of large-scale terror and violence being perpetrated by  the occupying Serbian authorities as they deny water supplies to  Biograd, Zadar, and its environs.    The resolution -- which will be sent to the parliaments of  European countries and those of the members of the UN Security  Council, the UN secretary general, and the International War  Crimes Tribunal -- will remind the international public of the  genocide perpetrated against the Croatian people, and inform it  about the situation in Biograd and its environs as they cannot  get water from an area belonging to Biograd, although it is  under exclusive UNPROFOR control.    UNPROFOR's indecisiveness and its soft approach to the  Serbian terrorists is ever more irritating for the 30,000 people  of Biograd and its 10,000 refugees, who have for three years now  been suffering an unbearable shortage of water. Hence, the  resolution stresses, there is a possibility of the local  population demonstrating openly their dissatisfaction at  UNPROFOR's inefficiency. The assembly demands that the Croatian  Government adopt energetic steps to curb further Serbian  terrorism against the people of Biograd, Zadar, and its  environs, and that it demand the consistent implementation of  all UN Security Council resolutions and the Zagreb agreement.</p>

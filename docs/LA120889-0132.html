			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> THIS IS THE WEEK THAT WASN'T FOR THE RELEASE OF BIG MOVIES  </P> <P> No news is bad news for video fans looking for another big-movie release this  week. There isn't one. It's the lull between "Batman" and "Ghostbusters II"  (already out) and "When Harry Met Sally . . .," "Star Trek V," "Road House" and  "Great Balls of Fire" (all released next week).  </P> <P> This week's slim pickings:  </P> <P> "Listen to Me" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). This 1989 drama's cast may  attract you -- Kirk Cameron, Jami Gertz, Roy Scheider, Amanda Peterson and  Anthony Zerbe -- even if the reviews were generally poor and the plot is less  than irresistible. It's all about two members of a college debate team getting  ready for the big match against Harvard. Yes, it's a very slow week.  </P> <P> "How to Get Ahead in Advertising" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R). We've had talking  horses, talking mules and talking cars before, so why not a talking pimple? The  pimple pops up on the shoulder of an anxiety-ridden advertising hotshot in this  heavy-handed black comedy starring Richard E. Grant and directed by Bruce  Robinson (both from "Withnail and I").  </P> <P> "84 Charlie Mopic" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). Even though lost in the shuffle  of higher-budgeted Vietnam War movies, this 1989 drama about a six-man  reconnaissance team that's being filmed by a documentary crew received some  good reviews. The cast (Richard Brooks, Christopher Burgard, Nicholas Cascone,  Jonathan Emerson and Glenn Morshower), though mostly unknowns, also was praised  by critics. Patrick Duncan directed.  </P> <P> "A Sinful Life" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). The L.A. Groundlings play "Just Like  the Pom Pom Girls" was turned into this interesting 1989 failure -- a wacky,  quirky comedy about the lengths a single, unemployed mother named Claire Vin  Blanc (played by Anita Morris) will go to keep her baby (named Baby) from being  placed in a foster home.  </P> <P> "The Ann Jillian Story" (J2, $79.95). TV movie starring Jillian in her own  filmography, tracing her career through her battle with breast cancer.  </P> <P> "Ghost Writer" (Prism, $79.95, PG). Obscure 1989 comedy about a free-lance  writer who "ghost writes" the life story of a movie star who's, you guessed it,  a ghost. Not to be confused with a 1984 PBS adaptation of a Philip Roth story  by the same name.  </P> <P> COMING ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" on Feb. 1 for $24.95 (VHS and Beta),  $29.95 (laserdisc) and $39.95 (Super-VHS). 1989's second-biggest theatrical hit  (after "Batman," of course) will be Paramount's first release ever in  Super-VHS.  </P> <P> "Lethal Weapon II" on Feb. 8. Warner will offer the hit sequel for $24.98 (VHS,  Beta, laserdisc) and $29.98 (8mm).  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> "Anne of Avonlea" (Walt Disney, $29.95 for the double-cassette package) is the  likable TV sequel to the great Canadian-series version of the classic girl's  story "Anne of Green Gables." As in the first series, Megan Follows stars as  Anne -- this time grown up and becoming a teacher. This 224-minute second  series was shown on both PBS and the Disney Channel.  </P> <P> "Kathy Smith's Ultimate Stomach and Thighs Workout" is a 90-minute exercise  tape out on Media for $19.95.  </P> <P> There's more new music video than you can shake a microphone stand at,  including: "Bon Jovi: New Jersey -- the Videos" (PMV, $19.95, 60 minutes),  "Depeche Mode 101" (Warner Reprise, $19.98, 117 minutes), "Bobby Brown: His  Prerogative" (MCA, $19.95, 60 minutes), Laurie Anderson's "Home of the Brave"  (Warner Reprise, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Reba McEntire: Reba" (MCA, $14.95, 30  minutes), "Kenny G Live in Concert" (6 West, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Ice-T:  Ice-Berg" (Warner Reprise, $16.98, 90 minutes), "Jody Watley: Video Classics,  Vol. 1" (MCA, $16.95, 45 minutes), "Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe" (6 West,  $14.98, 30 minutes) and "New Edition: Past and Present" (MCA, $19.95, 59  minutes).TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

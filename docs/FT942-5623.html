			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel in the grip of a financial vice Eurotunnel's rights shares closed at 43p on their first day of trading yesterday, as the company's shares continued to rise following the resolution last week of its second debt crisis. However, while the share price suggested renewed confidence on the long-term future, the rights document emphasises the financial vice in which Eurotunnel has found itself. The document lists the conditions attached to the company's latest Pounds 693m tranche of senior debt and the high price it has had to pay for its Pounds 50m top-up loan. The signing up of some Pounds 700m of debt was a pre-requisite to the launch of last week's Pounds 858m rights issue, and about two thirds of the original 220 banks failed to participate. The loans are due to fund the company through to projected profitability in 1998, and repayment is due between 2000 and 2006. Eurotunnel has predicted a first dividend in 2003, but according to the document, this will be contingent upon it achieving its refinancing projections between 2001 and 2008. The banks have attached tight conditions on the loans, which are based upon their own conservative projections, or banking cases, rather than Eurotunnel's. In addition, the company needs to demonstrate that net cash flow up to February 2006, plus the balance of certain Eurotunnel accounts, is one and a half times the amount of senior debt payable up to that date. If the figure falls below 1.2 times for more than 90 days, the company will be in default. Eurotunnel is confident that it has a comfortable Pounds 470m financial cushion, based on the agreed refinancing. This includes the Pounds 50m top-up loan from Morgan Grenfell and Warburg, which will cost 4 per cent over lenders' cost of funds, in addition to sizeable arrangement fees. Under existing agreements, it can also borrow a further Pounds 325m (at current exchange rates). If the company actually needs the money, however, it is likely to be in breach of those agreements.</p>

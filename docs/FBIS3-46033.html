The foreign minister made the statement at a symposium on  the  prospect of developing Sino-Russian border trade in Russia's far  east city of Blagoveshchensk, ITAR-TASS reported.    Kozyrev said that last year, exclusive border trade volume  between Russia and China amounted to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,  and 2.5 million people crossed Sino-Russian border from both  directions the same year.    At present, he said, the trade and cooperation between the  border areas of the two countries should enter a higher stage of  establishing joint ventures for production. Meanwhile, new  transit ports should be opened along the border, he added.    The minister then crossed into China's Hei He City of  Heilongjiang Province, where he met with government leaders of  Heilongjiang and Hei He City, and discussed with them border  trade. Kozyrev also visited a free economic zone in Hei He City.    He is due to arrive in Beijing today for an official visit  to  China.</p>

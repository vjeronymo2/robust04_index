			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, March 7 (XINHUA) -- British Prime Minister  John Major said in an angry tone today that he neither had  intention of quitting as prime minister, nor was expected to be  challenged as conservative party leader.    In an interview with BBC Radio, Major strongly rejected  charges that he was a weak leader and indicated that he refused  to accept much of the criticism.    "I was elected to remain prime minister of this country at  least until the next election, and beyond it if I win the next  election. I have never run away from a challenge in my life and  I'm surely not doing so now," he claimed.    He recalled that last year, when his Tory Party was in  turmoil over the Maastricht Treaty, he heard week after week  that he was too weak and that his leadership was about to be  challenged.    But "it didn't materialise. It's an extremely good story for  a small number of journalists and a small number of people to  pursue week after week, but it isn't real," he said.    Major had this interview following a week of media  speculation that Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine,  who was defeated by Major in 1990 contest to replace Margaret  Thatcher, would seek the leadership again if the "indecisive"  John Major stumbles.    On March 4, a Mori poll for THE TIMES newspaper showed that  Major's public rating remains at the lowest level since the  image of party leaders was last examined in July last year.    And his personal rating was even lower than his predecessor  Margaret Thatcher in the darkest days before she was forced to  resign in 1990.    However, Michael Heseltine hurried to distance himself  yesterday from the media speculation that he was poised to  launch a bid for Tory leadership.    According to press reports here today, the trade and  industry  secretary pledged loyalty to Major because Major "has steered us  through a very difficult period."    He was quoted as saying that he believed that Major would  lead the conservatives to win the next election and as a loyal  member of the current cabinet, he would help major to win the  next election.    Meanwhile, British Home Secretary Michael Howard also openly  dismissed the above-said media speculation.    Howard insisted that John Major would not hand over to "an  older man," the DAILY MAIL said today.    The home secretary hinted strongly that the Tories were  likely to skip a generation when the time came to pick Major's  successor and could choose from lots of young rising stars, such  as Treasury Chief Secretary Michael Portillo, who is 40 now.</p>

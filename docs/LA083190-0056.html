			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 CANYONS LABELED OK FOR USE AS TRASH SITES;  </P> <P> LANDFILLS: A COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT ENDORSES AREAS IN THE SAN  FERNANDO AND SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS.  </P> <P> Four mountain canyons ringing the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys are  environmentally suitable for use as landfills, according to a county report to  be released today that suggests that at least three of them eventually will  have to become dumps to solve Los Angeles County's waste disposal problems.  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report appears to set the stage for increasingly  heated conflicts over the future of the rustic land, pitting dump proponents  against parkland supporters.  </P> <P> County sanitation officials have long touted the sites as potential dumps and  have been trying to acquire property in the canyons -- Towsley, Elsmere, Blind  and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan.  </P> <P> But the report is their first declaration that the sites are geologically  suitable for landfills, and that they could be developed without serious risk  to ground water supplies.  </P> <P> Most other environmental problems -- such as noise, odor, dust and traffic --  could be avoided or reduced by careful operation of landfills, according to the  report.  </P> <P> It concedes that some problems, such as loss of wildlife habitat, are  unavoidable.  </P> <P> The draft study, which has been in the works for nearly a year and a half, was  sponsored by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which disposes of  trash for 78 cities, and by the county Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials face neighborhood opposition and serious political  obstacles to turning the canyons into dumps. Elsmere Canyon is partially within  the Angeles National Forest and the other three are part of county-designated  Significant Ecological Areas -- lands containing rare plants or valuable  habitat.  </P> <P> Moreover, mountain parks and trails already exist or are planned in Towsley,  Blind and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan.  </P> <P> In addition, the Mission-Rustic-Sullivan site provisionally has been put off  limits to landfill development. A complex agreement reached earlier this year  between Los Angeles city and county officials prohibits a dump at the site if a  landfill is opened in Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> BKK Corp., a private waste disposal firm, is seeking approval for the Elsmere  dump, with the understanding that the county and city will buy out its interest  and operate the landfill once permits are obtained.  </P> <P> Two of the sites are within the Santa Clarita Valley: Elsmere, just north of  Sylmar and east of the city of Santa Clarita; and Towsley, just west of the  Golden State Freeway and south of the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park.  </P> <P> Blind Canyon is in the Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, two miles north  of the Simi Valley Freeway. Mission, Sullivan and Rustic -- three canyons  considered as a single dump site -- are above Brentwood, immediately south of  Mulholland Drive and west of the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The lengthy environmental report does not rank the sites in order of  suitability. However, it cites a need over 50 years for about 550 million more  tons of publicly owned landfill capacity.  </P> <P> Don Nellor, chief of planning and engineering for the solid waste management  department of the Sanitation Districts, acknowledged Thursday that developing  at least three of the four canyons would meet that goal.  </P> <P> Officials said more specific plans for new landfills will be contained in the  final version of the report, to be issued after public hearings and a 60-day  comment period.  </P> <P> The report says new landfills are only a part of an "integrated" solid waste  strategy needed to avert an "impending disposal crisis in Los Angeles County."  </P> <P> The strategy also requires that existing landfills be expanded and waste  reduction and recycling programs be aggressively pursued. In the short run,  these two elements will be more crucial, the report says, because developing a  new landfill takes five to seven years.  </P> <P> The report shows "we have to use the combination of solutions to avoid a  serious and health-endangering trash crisis in the county," said Steve Maguin,  chief of solid waste management for the Sanitation Districts.  </P> <P> "Like the rest of the world, we're simply throwing away far more trash than the  land can absorb," he said. "No solution will work unless all of us practice  waste diversion."  </P> <P> Under a state law that took effect in January, cities and counties must cut  landfill disposal at least 25% by 1995, and 50% by the year 2000, by some  combination of recycling and eliminating waste.  </P> <P> The draft report assumes these deadlines will be met, although it says it is  uncertain how this can be done.  </P> <P> Even if the deadlines are met, the report says, new landfills and landfill  expansions will be required to meet the needs of a county population growing  about 1% per year.  </P> <P> Currently, 10 big landfills and 2 waste-to-energy plants take the county's  trash output of more than 48,000 tons per day. Seven of those landfills have  room to expand -- including Sunshine and Lopez canyons in the San Fernando  Valley, Chiquita Canyon in the Santa Clarita Valley and Scholl Canyon in  Glendale -- but most face expiration of their permits within the next few  years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Beginning today, the public has 60 days to comment on the draft of an  environmental impact report that outlines the possible measures to handle the  growing amount of solid waste generated in Los Angeles County each day. Public  hearings will be held in October throughout the county. After the hearings,  sanitation officials will make recommendations on, among other things,  landfills and recycling when the final impact report is submitted to the board  of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts and the Board of Supervisors.  Copies of the report are available at selected county libraries. Copies of the  40-page summary are available at the Sanitation Districts, 1955 Workman Mill  Road, Whittier 90607-4998.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE LANDFILL REPORT  </P> <P> Sites deemed environmentally suitable  </P> <P> TOWSLEY CANYON  </P> <P> Capacity: 225 million tons  </P> <P> Life span: 44 years  </P> <P> Size of landfill: 760 acres  </P> <P> Total project size: 5,700 acres  </P> <P> BLIND CANYON  </P> <P> Capacity: 130 million tons  </P> <P> Life span: 25 years  </P> <P> Size of landfill: 530 acres  </P> <P> Total project size: 5,100 acres  </P> <P> MISSION-RUSTIC-SULLIVAN CANYONS  </P> <P> Capacity: 125 million tons  </P> <P> Life span: 20 years  </P> <P> Size of landfill: 1,005 acres  </P> <P> Total project size: 3,325 acres  </P> <P> ELSMERE CANYON  </P> <P> Capacity: 225 million tons  </P> <P> Life span: 50 years  </P> <P> Size of landfill: 800 acres  </P> <P> Total project size: 2,000 acres  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Considerations  </P> <P> Towsley Canyon: The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has purchased 145 acres  of parkland in the canyon and hopes to obtain more. Supervisor Mike Antonovich  and Santa Clarita oppose a dump in Towsley.  </P> <P> Blind Canyon: Entertainer Bob Hope has tentatively agreed to sell the canyon to  the conservancy for a park. The canyon straddles Ventura and Los Angeles  counties and would require approval from both counties to become a landfill.  </P> <P> Elsmere Canyon: Located partly in Angeles National Forest, the canyon is just  outside Santa Clarita, which opposes the dump. But an Elsmere landfill has the  backing of the Los Angeles City Council and county Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Mission-Rustic-Sullivan Canyons: Also sought by the conservancy for a park. The  Los Angeles City Council and county Board of Supervisors say they will not  allow a landfill there if a dump can be opened in Elsmere Canyon.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SURRENDER OF NORIEGA;  </P> <P> SURRENDER SETS OFF JOYFUL PARTY IN STREETS OF CAPITAL;  </P> <P> REACTION: 'IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER!' RESIDENTS SHOUT. HORN-HONKING, POT-CLANGING  CELEBRATION ERUPTS IN PANAMA CITY.  </P> <P> Hundreds of laughing, cheering Panamanians poured into the streets of Panama  City on Wednesday night, celebrating the news that former strongman Manuel A.  Noriega had handed himself over to the United States.  </P> <P> "We are relieved to be rid of this criminal.  </P> <P> The important thing was that he should leave our national territory. It's a  great moment," President Guillermo Endara said. "We have to feel happy. God has  blessed us in these last few days."  </P> <P> Sheer jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents just moments after  radio and television announced that the former strongman had abandoned his  Vatican embassy sanctuary after a 10-day siege.  </P> <P> Panamanian television broke into its normal programming to broadcast a news  flash that Noriega had turned himself in.  </P> <P> Ignoring the approaching 11 p.m. curfew imposed after thousands of American  troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to overthrow Noriega and install a new  government, residents of the capital set off fireworks and opened bottles to  toast Noriega's departure.  </P> <P> "Is it official? Is he really gone?" many disbelievers asked reporters.  </P> <P> Panamanians spilled into the streets, laughing, banging pots and pans and  applauding. Hundreds converged on Avenida Balboa, where the Vatican mission was  framed in a burst of fireworks.  </P> <P> "It's over! It's over!" people shouted, some screaming themselves hoarse.  </P> <P> "Thank God. Panama can now feel like a free country. I feel free now," said  20-year-old Moises Rios.  </P></p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television The Olympics is approaching its climax and British interest today will focus on the 10,000 metres final (8.30 this evening) when Liz McColgan will attempt to repeat her gold medal triumph of four years ago at Tokyo. Anyone wearying of the television commentators might try the more relaxed, off-beat approach of Radio 5's Olympics coverage, with Wogan in particularly good form in the afternoon spot. Alan Whicker's group of well-heeled tourists, who are jetting their way round the world in The Ultimate Package] (ITV at 8.00), move this week from Ayers Rock, the aboriginal shrine in central Australia, to an even more remote place of religious significance, Easter Island. But whereas the Rock was all champagne and sunsets, the natives of Easter Island are as defiant as their mysterious statues. A welcome return for Dear Diary (Radio 4 at 10.00am). This is a simple idea  -extracts from diarists of the past writing around this day - which works wonderfully. We eavesdrop on a peregrination around Birmingham in 1837 and a doctor in Hiroshima on his earth-shattering day in 1945.</p>

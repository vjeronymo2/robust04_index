			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / IBM halts shipments of 'flawed chip' computers International Business Machines has halted shipments of computers containing the Pentium microprocessor made by Intel, the world's leading supplier. The move follows growing customer concern about a flaw in the chip that can lead to miscalculations in some mathematical applications. Intel's share price dropped yesterday after the decision, closing in New York at Dollars 60 3/8 , down from Dollars 62 3/4 on Friday. IBM is one of Intel's largest customers. Its action has strained relations with the company - which revealed last month there were problems with the microprocessor. Intel complained yesterday that IBM had refused to provide details of its analysis of Pentium errors and gave no notice of its decision. The microprocessor fault has proved embarrassing for Intel, which has 90 per cent of the world microprocessor market. It is running an Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m) worldwide campaign to persuade personal computer users to buy Pentium-based machines. Other PC makers using the Pentium microprocessor include Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway and Packard Bell. They have offered to replace faulty chips, but IBM is alone in halting shipments. However, other manufacturers may now feel obliged to follow IBM's lead. IBM stressed it had no desire to exacerbate Intel's embarrassment or to gain competitive advantage. 'IBM is not encouraging customers to switch to different products,' it said. 'Our decision to halt shipments is based solely on customer interests.' Intel has argued that most computer users would never experience the fault which, it said, was likely to occur only once every 27,000 years. The only people likely to be affected, it said, were technologists such as aircraft designers carrying out large computations. IBM, however, said that its scientists had found that the risk of errors may be higher. 'A user could face either significantly more errors, or no errors at all. If an error occurs . . . it may have no effect or it may have catastrophic effects.' Customers using common spreadsheet programs could encounter errors once every 24 days. For a customer with 500 Pentium-based PCs, this could result in as many as 20 mistakes a day. Intel said it believed IBM's action was 'unwarranted' and added that it did not expect to take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings because of any repercussions from the flaw.

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Serb assault on Bosnian enclave Serb forces from Bosnia and Croatia yesterday launched an assault against mainly Moslem army positions in the north-western Bosnian enclave of Bihac. The attacks - which came as the international community appears ready to reward Serbia for its month-long blockade of Bosnia Serbs - suggest that, despite the shift in Belgrade's position, Serb forces in Bosnia and Croatia are determined to continue fighting. Serb forces fired surface-to-air missiles at two Nato combat aircraft sent to investigate the fighting at Bihac, but UN officials said the jets were not hit. UN officials in Zagreb said they were concerned that the fighting in Bihac, which they described as a limited incursion, could develop into an all-out attack on the enclave. Western observers said the attacks were significant as they involved Serb rebels from both Bosnia and Croatia, two distinct groups which do not always co-operate. There were further signs of a thaw in the west's policy toward Serbia proper. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said he welcomed a decision by the five members of the international contact group on Bosnia to ask the UN Security Council to discuss easing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. Western officials said earlier in the week that Serbia, in a further effort to placate the contact group, had agreed in principle to allow non-military western observers to monitor Serbia's embargo of the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL TODAY;  </P> <P> CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE VS. NORTHERN ARIZONA  </P> <P> At Northern Arizona's Walkup Skydome: 3 p.m.  </P> <P> The Matadors appear to have an arsenal of offensive weapons. The question is:  Can the offensive line protect quarterback Sherdrick Bonner and tailback Albert  Fann long enough to allow them to launch an attack? Bonner, a senior, passed  for 1,817 yards last season and he has a plethora of fast and experienced  receivers as targets. Then there is Fann (6-foot-2, 215 pounds), a senior who  is considered a top candidate for the Harlon Hill Trophy, which annually is  presented to the top player in NCAA Division II. Fann has accounted for 5,446  yards in rushing, receiving and kick returns in his Northridge career, and,  with 3,172 rushing yards, he is only 400 shy of Mike Kane's school record.  Rodney Menzel (6-3, 250), CSUN's left guard, is the only starter returning on  the offensive line, which Coach Bob Burt describes as "talented but as yet  untested." On defense, Mario Hull (6-4, 225), Ken Wallace (6-3, 240), Ken  Vaughn (6-2, 238) and Terrell Taylor (6-2, 220) form what should be the best  crew of linebackers in many years. Tackle Tom Berry (6-4, 255) and free safety  Clayton Bamberg (6-2, 205) also are defensive standouts back from last season's  6-5 team. Northern Arizona, 3-8 last season, has a new coach -- former UCLA  assistant Steve Axman. Axman was the quarterback coach at Maryland last season,  so look for John Bonds (6-4, 200), a transfer from Arizona State, to throw.  </P> <P> And look for Julian Howard (5-11, 170), a sophomore, to catch -- he grabbed 31  passes for 615 yards and three touchdowns last season. Tailback Anthony  Simmons, who gained 95 yards in 31 carries in a reserve role last year, could  lead the ground attack. The Lumberjacks' starting fullback is Quinn Fauria  (6-0, 205), a former Crespi High standout. A crowd of more than 8,000 is  expected at Walkup Skydome. The game will be broadcast locally on KGIL  (1260-AM), beginning with a 15-minute pregame show at 2:45 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 WHITE ANC MEMBERS GET 18 TO 25 YEARS FOR TERRORISM  </P> <P> A magistrate sentenced three white members of the outlawed African National  Congress to jail terms of 18 to 25 years Friday for terrorism in connection  with three bombings and the largest cache of illegal weapons ever seized in  South Africa.  </P> <P> "Those who commit violence must be punished. This is inescapable," Pretoria  Regional Magistrate W. J. van den Bergh said in sentencing South Africans  Damian de Lange, 32; and Iain Hugh Robertson, 36, to 25 and 20 years  respectively, and British citizen Susan Donelly, 24, to 18 years.  </P> <P> Robertson, a former schoolteacher, was restrained by police as he shouted "Long  live the ANC!" after being sentenced, and supporters in a packed public gallery  showered the three with yellow daisies.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid organizations condemned the length of the sentences as a blow to  hopes for racial reconciliation.  </P> <P> The three were among a five-member ANC cell discovered May 8, 1988, during a  raid on a farmhouse in the town of Broederstroom near Pretoria, police said.  The fourth member evaded arrest while the fifth is thought to have turned  state's witness and did not appear at the trial.  </P> <P> Police said a cache of arms found during the raid was the largest consignment  of illegal weapons ever seized and included a ground-to-air missile, automatic  weapons and hand grenades.  </P> <P> De Lange, a former journalist with the defunct liberal newspaper Rand Daily  Mail, and Robertson were convicted of 11 charges of terrorism. Donelly, also a  former schoolteacher, was found guilty of 10 charges.  </P> <P> All three pleaded guilty on June 12 to three bomb attacks, including an  unsuccessful attempt to blow up a bus carrying soldiers. None of the attacks  caused any injuries.  </P> <P> In a separate action Friday, the government lifted restrictions on the  political activity of veteran ANC member Govan Mbeki, allowing him to speak  publicly for the first time in nearly two years.  </P> <P> Mbeki, 79, former national secretary of the ANC, was released from prison on  Nov. 5, 1987, after serving 23 years of a life sentence on charges of plotting  with Nelson Mandela to topple the minority white government.  </P> <P> He had been under 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. house arrest in his Port Elizabeth home and  had been banned from speaking with the press.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "O.P.": "Toward a European Industry Charter"] </F>   [Text] On the occasion of the Eurosatory land-based weapons  show, some 12 national trade associations of European arms  manufacturers, in particular land-based weapons manufacturers,  are due to sign a charter tomorrow. The document, initially  conceived in April 1993, is expected to be signed by France's  GICAT (Association of Land-Based Weapons Manufacturers) and its  European counterparts: Germany's BDI, Great Britain's DMA,  Spain's AFARMADE, Belgium's BDIG, Portugal's MID, Denmark's DI,  Norway's NHO, Sweden's NIF, and Turkey's SASAD. The Netherlands  Government's position is not known yet, while the Greeks have  reportedly chosen not to sign the document.    The move, initiated by the French, is a first. It is  indicative of the determination of manufacturers to start a  campaign, geared toward politicians, in favor of a "Buy  European" clause.    The document to be submitted on Tuesday [21 June] will be  short (two pages), but it will list some 10 commitments and  wishes by these European defense associations. Above all, they  call for a "an overall buy European" clause. Next comes the  determination to see politicians acknowledge "the vital role of  research and development," as is being done in America at a time  when European defense budgets are dropping. The charter calls  for "European countries to harmonize their needs" and "control  procedures"; it asks for "active political, diplomatic, and  financial support" as well as the "preservation of Europe's  defense industry's vital interests." The document also calls  for "balanced transatlantic trade relations." In other words,  in the future, the Americans should buy as many weapons from the  Europeans as they sell to them. Great Britain, for instance,  often chose to buy American rather than European. This issue  currently is attracting a lot of attention since London is soon  to make a choice between American and European manufacturers for  two kinds of equipment. First of all, for 90 assault  helicopters, which represents a 15-billion-franc contract. In  the running are McDonnell-Douglas' "Apache," which would be  produced under license by Westland (a British firm not  unfamiliar with such practices), and Eurocopter's "Tigre"  (Eurocopter is a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and Deutsche  Aerospace). London's second choice is for a military transport  aircraft. Here, it can either purchase Lockheed's C-130J, or  take part (through British Aerospace) in the development of the  "Future Large Aircraft" together with other European  manufacturers.    This call for transatlantic reciprocity is a sneer at  Switzerland's and Finland's decision to choose  McDonnell-Douglas' F- 18 combat aircraft over the Mirage 2000-5  of France's Dassault Aviation. Another alternative also springs  to mind: Sweden is currently looking at two air-to-air  missiles, one U.S.-made, the "AMRAAM" (recently chosen by  Denmark) and Matra's "Mica." The charter is an ambitious  platform, but without political support, it may never amount to  anything much.</p>

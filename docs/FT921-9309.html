			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Need for more copper mines foreseen COPPER MARKET growth would require another 1.4m short tons (2,000 lb) of new mining capacity by the year 2000 - equivalent to nine new world-class mines  -according to Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, the US integrated metals group. He suggested at the annual meeting of the American Mining Congress, the US industry's main trade association, that 'by the middle of this decade the issues confronting this country and our industry may well be availability and access to new copper reserves'. Mr Osborne's forecast was one of the most optimistic to emerge recently from the copper producers. It contrasted markedly with one from Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, who said in December that there should be enough copper at all stages of its production to satisfy prospective demand. On mine capacity, Mr Crowson said that 'fears over shortages are not only unfounded but positively misplaced'. Mr Osborne suggested that Mr Crowson was taking a less optimistic view than he of the future role of copper in communications. 'Earlier fears of massive (market) losses to fibre optics have not materialised,' he pointed out. AT &amp; T, the US communications group, recently said 2.5m miles of copper wire and cable would be installed in the US in 1992 compared with 141,000 miles of optical fibre. 'Growth in both fibre optic and copper communication links is creating new demand for copper in devices at either end. In 1991 some 286,000 tons of copper was used in all forms in telecommunications in the US.' Mr Osborne said he agreed with suggestions that, instead of being replaced in telecommunications, 'a more likely scenario is one in which copper 'handshakes' with other technologies in economic solutions that meet the realities of business and consumer demands.' Mr Osborne pointed out that US copper producers were now among the lowest-cost in the world but warned that, if they were to continue to play an important role in the US, they must have access to public lands to explore for new reserves and must have a mining law that provided the security of tenure needed to justify investment in new copper properties. His forecast of mine capacity was based on the assumption that total world copper consumption, including that in the former communist bloc, would grow by 2.4 per cent annually to 2,000, increasing 1991's estimated consumption of 11.9m short tons to 14.7m. Copper prices would range between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 2,400 a tonne this year, suggested Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, senior trader at the Sumitomo Corporation, in a paper prepared for the American Metal Market 1992 Copper Forum.  -------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close)  -------------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium     +2,000   to   1,072,150 Copper        -2,525   to     307,700 Lead            +800   to     131,650 Nickel            +6   to      18,750 Zinc            +225   to     175,150 Tin              -45   to      12,965  --------------------------------------------</p>

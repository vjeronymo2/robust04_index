RS92&hyph;49, et al. South Georgia states that the filing reports on (1) South Georgia's progress in implementing intraday nominations, and (2) the operation of its penalty waiver provision during the first year of operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Georgia states that on November 8, 1994, it also made a transportation tariff filing in a separate docket which would implement intra-day nomination procedures effective December 5, 1994. South Georgia's report also discusses the systemwide penalty waivers granted during its first year and concludes that the waiver provision operated effectively to avoid penalizing shippers who were trying to take appropriate actions, but incurred penalties as a result of late information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Georgia states that copies of the filing will be served on parties to Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;49, et al., and all shippers and interested states commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions and protests should be filed on or before December 6, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linwood A.

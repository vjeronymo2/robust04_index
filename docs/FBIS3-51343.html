			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 13 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Christian  Democratic Deputy Marco Vinicio Villar Anleu on 12 January was  elected president of the Guatemalan National Congress to replace  fellow Christian Democrat Jose Fernando Lobo Dubon.    Villar Anleu, who represents the northern Quiche Department  and is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, won the  support of 70 of the 91 deputies who attended the regular  evening session of Congress.    The Guatemalan Christian Democracy [DCG], the Solidarity  Action Movement [MAS], dissidents of the Union of the National  Center [UNC], the Guatemalan Republican Front [FRG], and  minority parties supported Villar's slate, made up of three vice  presidents and eight secretaries.    DCG Secretary Alfonso Cabrera and Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla  Vega, who returned to his seat on 12 January after losing an eye  in an attack in May 1993, headed the negotiations to draw up  Villar's slate.    Villar, who was head of the DCG bloc last year, ran against  the slate headed by Carlos Perez Castaneda and made up of UCN  and FRG candidates, which received the remaining 21 votes.    Neither the 12 deputies of the National Vanguard Party (PAN)  who had resigned nor their alternates attended the regular  session headed by Lobo Dubon.    Villar will be sworn in on 14 January by Lobo Dubon, who  acknowledged Villar's victory on 12 January at a solemn session.  One of Villar's first tasks will be to listen to the government  report that President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will present on 15  January.    This directorate will not complete its one-year term as  established by the Constitution because if the yes vote wins in  the 30 January referendum, Guatemalans will elect a new Congress  this year.    The Congress Directorate is composed as follows:    President: Marco Vinicio Villar (DCG)    First Vice President: Jorge Alberto Monroy (formerly of UCN)    Second Vice President: Marco Tulio Merida (MAS)    Third Vice President: Juan Francisco Alfaro (formerly of  UCN)    First Secretary: Clodoveo Dominguez (DCG)    Second Secretary: Eduardo Mendez Pinelo (formerly of UCN)    Third Secretary: Francisco Reyes Ixcamey (formerly of  FRG)    Fourth Secretary: Rafael Oliveros Ramirez (MAS)    Fifth Secretary: Edna de Ruano (formerly of UCN)    Sixth Secretary: Felipe Franco Trujillo (MAS)    Seventh Secretary: Pedro Gomez Chavez (formerly of UCN)    Eighth Secretary: Jose Aguirre Quinteros (PID)  [Democratic    Institutional Party]</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Conservative MP drops press action MR Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP, last night withdrew his referral to the Press Complaints Commission of a story in The Independent that his wife Virginia, the health secretary, had given birth to their son three months before they were married. This follows an expression of regret by the editor of The Independent, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, that the paper had named the Bottomleys' son.</p>

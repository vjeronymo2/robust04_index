			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling report: "Waigel: No Additional Tax </F> Increases in 1995"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government has stressed that it  does not plan any tax increases for 1995 in addition to the  7.5-percent solidarity surcharge that has been adopted. At the  same time a conflict emerged on Saturday [2 April] between the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and  the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the possibility  of tax reductions as of 1996.    Referring to accusations by the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] that the Federal Government is considering tax  increases as of 1995, Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) told  WELT AM SONNTAG: "The tax increases that the citizens will be  facing in 1995, including the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge,  have been stipulated by law."    At about 44 percent of the national product, the burden of  taxes and fees will "reach a climax" in 1995. Efforts must be  made to "reduce this burden over the medium term, so that the  willingness for achievement and investment power are not  weakened." The date will mainly depend on progress concerning  the consolidation of the budget.    Waigel warned the coalition partner FDP: "However, those who  believe that taxes can be reduced as early as in 1996 are  throwing dust in people's eyes." "There will not be anything to  distribute in 1996 either." The consolidation task will not be  completed by then.    Last week Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) announced  a reduction of the top tax rates as of 1996. To promote the  economy, the top rates of the income and corporate tax are to be  cut to below 45 percent in a three-stage reform.    The CSU chairman sharply criticized the SPD's tax plans. The  plan, announced by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, to introduce a  10-percent unification surcharge for singles earning up to  50,000 German marks [DM] and for couples earning up to DM100,000  is "not thought out at all." The unification surcharge that  Scharping wants to levy for an unlimited period does not ensure  a "fair distribution of burdens."    Already at this point, the existing tax progression  represents a larger burden for the high-income earners. Thus,  one-fourth of all taxpayers "carries over 70 percent of the tax  burden at an available income of approximately 51 percent." A  single person with a gross salary of DM6,000 per month, for  example, would have to pay a solidarity surcharge that is twice  as high as that of a person earning DM4,000 per month as of 1995.    Waigel accused the SPD of a "loss of memory." When the  solidarity pact was adopted in the spring of 1993, it agreed to  the introduction of the solidarity surcharge, but now it is  trying to confuse people with its tax proposals. It remains to  be seen what the SPD wants to adopt as the "tolerable tax  limit." If it realizes the current plans, "DM6-7.5 billion are  still missing in the budget."    "The SPD is cheating people if it promises them a relief as  a  result of the unification surcharge," Waigel stressed. With its  plans, it is increasing the state's indebtedness, for which "all  must pay." The SPD continues to be Germany's debt party.    Moreover, it is not certain whether Scharping "will be able  to control the contradictory tax forces within his party."  Waigel pointed out that, as recently as this week, leading  officials of the SPD's left wing called for a "gradual and  predictable increase" in gasoline prices over the next 15 years.  SPD official Horst Peter demanded an increase in the gasoline  tax by 30 pfennig per year per liter.    Waigel categorically rejected SPD plans for spot checks of  bank accounts to control interest taxation: "Spot checks would  undermine the banker's discretion." Capital is "as shy as  deer." The SPD statements about controls are "increasing the  flight of capital and endangering investments and jobs in  Germany."    The CSU chairman demanded that capital must be able to "move  freely in Europe and the world." However, there should not be a  distortion of competition among the financial markets. Thus,  Bonn will intensively use its presidency in the European Union  as of 1 July "to ensure the harmonization of interest taxation  not only in Europe but also within the OECD."    Referring to the ruling by the Constitutional Court,  according to which the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum  must be stipulated in the tax law by 1 January 1996, Waigel did  not rule out that this ruling "may only be realized in several  stages." This is no violation of the Karlsruhe verdict. Waigel  mentioned the income tax committee that he established and which  is to present its proposals on this issue. By the way, the "tax  exemption of the subsistence minimum is ensured even at this  point." The SPD financial spokesman Joachim Poss called on the  Federal Government to "immediately present its plans concerning  the Karlsruhe ruling."    Waigel stressed that, even in the election year 1994, the  draft of the 1995 budget "will be presented to the cabinet at  the beginning of July, as usual." Thus, the voters will know as  early as in the summer what the government's budget plans are.  The consolidation of the budget "will be continued with the  same force. There will be no election baits."    According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the SPD's  chances for the Bundestag elections have "dramatically declined"  after the most recent quarrel about the SPD's government  program. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping "has made an enormous  blunder" with his proposal for the unification surcharge, Hoyer  told the news agency DDP. This also applies to the inheritance  and property tax, which the SPD wants to increase. Thus, the  SPD has lost its credibility as a party of the economy.    Hoyer described the SPD tax program as a "catalogue of  horrors" -- particularly because there seems to be no readiness  "to improve the state finances through spending cuts."</p>

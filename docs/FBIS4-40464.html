			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports about the outflow of nuclear materials from  Russia have the sole goal of proving that the presence of  nuclear weapons in Russia is dangerous to the world community  and that Russia should be relieved of this burden, Russia's  First Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy Lev Ryabev told INTERFAX.    These reports also reflect the ongoing struggle for the  markets of nuclear expertise, he said. Some western countries  have concentrated their attention on the traditionally Russian  markets and are trying to discredit Russian science and  industrial and nuclear potential.    He said that out of the 10 cases of theft of nuclear  materials over the past 18 months, nine involved depleted  uranium-238 which cannot be used for making a nuclear bomb.    He announced that highly enriched uranium-235 was stolen  only  once at the research center Luch in a Moscow suburb, when one  staff member managed to steal about one and a half kilograms of  this material.    "But even this amount is insufficient for making a bomb,"  said Ryabev. No other instances of theft of nuclear materials  which can be used in nuclear weapons have been registered, he  said.</p>

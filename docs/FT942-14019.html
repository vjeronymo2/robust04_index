			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Man Ray photograph sells for Dollars 354,500 'Noire et blanche', a photographic print by Man Ray depicting Kiki of Montparnasse fondling an African mask, sold for Dollars 354,500 (Pounds 239,527), double its top estimate and a record for the artist, at Christie's in New York on Wednesday night. It was the second highest price paid at auction for a photograph. Alfred Stieglitz's image of the hands of his wife, the artist Georgia O'Keefe, made Dollars 398,500 at Christie's last year. The Man Ray photograph was part of a sale of just 81 lots of works by the leading photographers. It totalled Dollars 2m and was an attempt by Christie's to market photographs by modern masters in the same way as top rank Impressionist and Modern paintings. The best items went well above forecast; the less interesting failed to sell. There were auction records for Edward Weston, Lewis Hine, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson. 'Clouds', an image captured by Weston in Mexico in 1926, sold for Dollars 156,500. It was de-commissioned from the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, to raise funds for more purchases of photographs: the Getty has another copy of the print. A portrait by Stieglitz of the nude torso of Georgia O'Keefe went for Dollars 145,000, and 'Mechanic and Steam Pump' by Hine for Dollars 90,500.</p>

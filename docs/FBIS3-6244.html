			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Machinery orders from the  private sector increased in January from December, marking the  third straight month of increases and reaffirming that orders  have hit bottom, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday  [15 March].    January orders rose 1.9 percent from December to 912.7  billion yen, following a 5.3 percent increase in December and a  23.0 percent jump in November.    The January figure also marks a 0.4 percent rise from a year  earlier, the first year-on-year increase in 22 months, the  agency said in its monthly report.    The data exclude orders for ships and from electric power  companies, which are often volatile.    An EPA official in a briefing for reporters said the January  results support the agency's view that the downward trend in  private machinery orders has come to an end.    The official also said the latest figures have increased the  likelihood that the agency will meet its target of an 8.1  percent increase in private orders for the first quarter of 1994.    The official said, however, that results from January alone  are insufficient for making an accurate prediction.    Private machinery orders, omitting volatile factors, are a  leading indicator for near-term corporate spending on plants and  equipment.    Including orders for ships and from electric power firms,  January private-sector orders totaled 1,102.9 billion yen, down  4.5 percent from December and a 4.1 percent decrease from a year  before.    Orders from manufacturers accounted for 377.9 billion yen of  the total, and orders from nonmanufacturers, excluding those for  ships and from power firms, came to 541.6 billion yen.    Orders placed by the public sector jumped 23.9 percent from  the previous month to 387.3 billion yen, and orders from  foreigners increased 31.7 percent to 542.6 billion yen.    The agency official said public-sector orders received a  boost from the second supplementary budget enacted last year for  the current 1993 fiscal year, ending in April. The budget  increased orders for items such as garbage-disposal facilities  and telecommunications equipment.    An agency hearing found that many makers expect orders from  the government to remain strong at least through the end of  March, the official said.    The January jump for foreign orders is "too good to be  true,"  the official said. In the last few months foreign orders  increased only modestly, with a 0.4 percent rise in December and  0.2 percent rise in November.    The yen's decline against the U.S. dollar in January cannot  fully explain the jump, the official said.    Overall, January machinery orders amounted to 2,165.4  billion  yen, up 4.8 percent from December and 3.3 percent from a year  earlier.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major must choose TO GOVERN is to choose. After the simultaneous collapse of both his foreign and his economic policies, Mr Major could have chosen to resign. He has not. Now he needs to make other choices: first, he should ask for Mr Norman Lamont's resignation; second, he should demand a new economic policy from Mr Lamont's successor; and third, he should pass the Maastricht treaty through the House of Commons. Mr Lamont must go. This is not because he is personally responsible for the disaster that befell the government's ERM policy. The responsibility is far more widely shared, not least by Mr Major. It is also not because everything he said about never devaluing the pound was brutally belied by events. Finance ministers in his situation must speak confidently, while hoping that their words are not swiftly disproved. The case for resignation is, first, that Mr Lamont was on the watch at the time the ERM policy hit the reef. The case for resignation is, second, that he has discredited himself by what he has said since sterling's departure from the ERM. The case for resignation is, third, that Mr Lamont cannot credibly articulate the new policy that the UK now needs. Mr Lamont has said that 'we will have a British monetary policy tailored to the needs of the British economy'. How can a chancellor who has confessed that his past policy was not in the country's interests stay in the job? He has also damaged the long term interests of the country by the all too public debate between himself and Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president. Mr Lamont is simply not the man to articulate a new economic policy with conviction. What he is saying - with his list of monetary indicators and his promises to tighten control over public spending - is 'trust me'. But why should the country trust him? No early re-entry New measures need a new man. The new chancellor will discover that he does have one advantage. Judged by the Labour party conference, the opposition offers not a new policy, but support for the old one, combined with constant complaints about its inescapable consequences for interest rates and manufacturing industry. It should be possible for a new chancellor to be more coherent than that. What should be the basis of a new policy? First, an early return to the ERM is undesirable. This is partly because the other members are loath to have sterling back in. More importantly, the interest rate consequences of rejoining the ERM are quite unknown, but past experience suggests they are likely to be destabilising. Until the turmoil of German unification has begun to work itself out, the government should stick to a promise to seek re-entry 'when the time is ripe'. To show the government is not turning away from its European engagement, ratification of the Maastricht treaty should be pursued with vigour. New policy framework Nevertheless, the government should postpone attempts to return to the ERM only if it establishes a policy framework, with institutions to match, that give it some hope of doing better for itself. There is an opportunity for combining recovery with low inflation. It is only if that opportunity is exploited that the UK will be able to contribute successfully to the development of the European Community. The difficult policy questions now are how far and how fast should interest rates be lowered and how far and how fast should fiscal policy be tightened. Neither can be answered with conviction. The economy is in uncharted waters. The authorities must feel their way, which is precisely why institutional arrangements for policy analysis and formulation must be improved. But the principles that should underpin those answers are clear. These are, first, that the UK needs another consumer-led boom like a hole in the head. It needs a slow and steady recovery, led by exports. Monetary and fiscal policies must serve that end. Secondly, a devaluation cannot bring enduring benefits if it does not lead to a sustained lowering of wages in relation to the prices of tradable goods and services. The end of the ERM policy was a humiliating disaster. But it has a silver lining. The government can choose once more. What it must demonstrate is that it has the maturity to choose wisely.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in demand The takeover battle in the US between QVC Network and Viacom for US entertainment group Paramount turned the spotlight on Thorn EMI in the UK. The shares advanced 9 to 988p, as Hoare Govett recommended the stock. The broker believes the stock should be a beneficiary from a revaluation of companies with lucrative copyright. Thorn is one of the world's largest music publishers. Dealers said it was the sentiment from the battle for Paramount that was responsible for an advance in Rank Organisation of 9 to 791p. The combination of a stock overhang and reports that UBS had advised investors to 'take profits' depressed Reuters shares, which fell 30 to 1519p. Business services company Hays Group improved 5 to 255p after reporting a 20 per cent jump in full-year profits. Shares in scientific and industrial equipment supplier Philip Harris tumbled 50 to 154p after the company stunned the market with a profits warning. It said profits this year were unlikely to match last year's levels, blaming weakness in both international and UK markets. Favourable comment that followed improved results at Morgan Crucible helped the shares add another 3 at 326p. Pharmaceutical stocks were out of favour ahead of today's announcement of the US administration's health care reform proposals. Glaxo receded 12 to 630p on trade of 7.2m, while Zeneca eased 3 to 713p. However, two-way business helped Wellcome reverse an earlier decline to finish 2 ahead on balance at 712p. Industrial chemicals group Yule Catto fell 18 to 259p after announcing a one-for-six rights issue at 215p to raise Pounds 29.7m, in order to finance its purchase of a 50 per cent stake in German company Synthomer Chemie and reduce short-term borrowings. Yule's half-time profits slipped to Pounds 9.3m from Pounds 10.2m, although the company was upbeat about prospects for the second half. A statement on the transmission business of the Scottish electricity companies from Offer, the electricity industry regulator, helped all UK electricity stocks as the market welcomed both its reference to a 6 per cent rate of return and its indication that the body will attempt to encourage lower cost producers. The statement was expected to be positive for Scottish stocks, but coming ahead of Offer's planned review of the distribution business of all UK electricity companies this spread the warm glow south as the market expects the regulator to adopt consistent criteria. Eastern Electricity, the second lowest cost operator, which has one of the lowest rates of return, moved ahead 14 to 567p. East Midland Electricity advanced 12 to 548p, while Midlands closed 10 higher at 587p, a rise matched by Norweb, which finished at 605p. London Electricity appreciated 15 to 574p. Racal Electronics relinquished 4 to 228p as selling against its sister company Chubb hurt the stock. The disappointing figures from Tesco hit sentiment in the rest of the food retailing sector. J. Sainsbury, a strong performer on Monday following a broker's recommendation, shed 7 to 449p. Wm Morrison Supermarkets, which reports interim figures tomorrow, eased 3 to 124p, while Iceland ended 4 lighter at 212p. In the drinks sector, nervous trading in Guinness ahead of tomorrow's figures left the stock 6 cheaper at 460p. Bargain hunting, together with vague bid talk, lifted Bass 6 to 479p. Reports after the market close that Saudi Arabia had ordered around 200 Piranha light armoured vehicles were today expected to benefit GKN, which builds the vehicles. In trading yesterday a stock shortage left the shares 5 firmer at 495p. Banking stocks went for a frustrating series of random walks that left the market struggling to explain the few features in a reasonably strong sector which was buoyed by the overnight interest rate cut in Japan. Schroders, the international merchant and investment banking group, yesterday won the distinction of having the biggest fall on the FT-SE 100 Index it so recently joined, the shares closing 55 down at 1265p. The stock is not very liquid and the fall came on top of negligible volume. An analyst pointed out that new entrants to the Footsie often suffer a falling share price as dealers sell on the event. Royal Bank of Scotland moved ahead 7 to 311p on fairly aggressive buying. The bank's financial year ends soon and the market is looking for the clearer to turn out a good set of figures. Analysts noted a marked differentiation between RBS, Abbey National (up 5 at 409p), National Westminster (6 ahead at 500p) and Lloyds, which slipped 5 to 552p. Abbey National, depressed by a weak outlook for building societies, and NatWest have underperformed the sector in recent weeks, with yesterday's adjustment seen as an element of catch-up. The main feature in the oil group was BP, which bounced 6 to 301p on the back of a buy recommendation from a US firm of stockbrokers. The sector was lacklustre in spite of an overnight rise in the price of crude, with traders apprehensive about next Saturday's Opec meeting. The worries held back the price of shares in Monument Oil and Gas, the small oil and gas company, which yesterday announced a third successful well in its Argentinian discovery. The stock finished a half-penny firmer at 51 1/2 p. A squeeze boosted Smiths Industries, finally 4 to the good at 372p.</p>

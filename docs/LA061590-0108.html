			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: WEBB PUNISHES PATRICK HENRY, MONTE VISTA  </P> <P> San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall Webb placed the baseball teams of  Patrick Henry and Monte Vista high schools on probation and banned Patrick  Henry's Luke Lowrey from baseball for the 1991 season Thursday after  investigating a fight following the teams' May 26 section semifinal playoff  game.  </P> <P> Webb, who determined that both teams violated the ethics code adopted by the  section before the 1990 season, levied several sanctions against them.  </P> <P> Webb said he determined that Lowrey, a junior first baseman, started a melee  when he punched an opposing player while the teams shook hands after Monte  Vista's 9-7 victory. Patrick Henry was declared ineligible for the 1991 section  playoffs and will have to forgo three non-league games and all regular-season  tournament play, Webb said. Lowrey's ban will not extend to other sports -- he  is Patrick Henry's starting quarterback -- but he will be on probation in them,  Webb said.  </P> <P> Monte Vista will lose two non-league games and be allowed to play in two  tournaments instead of the normal three.  </P> <P> Both coaches said they were upset at Webb's decision and that they would  appeal.  </P> <P> "I think (Lowrey) was provoked," Patrick Henry Coach Bob Imlay said. "I'm being  prosecuted unfairly. I'm going to fight back."  </P> <P> Said Rob Phillips, who has since resigned as Monte Vista's coach in order to  enter private business: "Patrick Henry should get 100% of the blame. We're  getting penalized for defending ourselves." DANA HADDAD  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Lawson presses for OECD job Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor, was in Washington yesterday, meeting Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and Ms Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for international economic affairs, in pursuit of his candidacy to be the next director general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. His mission is to try to prise loose crucial US backing for Mr Don Johnston, the former Canadian minister. Other contenders are Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the incumbent, who is seeking a third five-year term, and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry official. The next regular meeting of OECD ministers early next month in Paris is charged with the task of achieving a consensus on the succession, though Lord Lawson thinks this remains unlikely unless the US changes its mind. Support appears evenly divided between the former chancellor, Mr Johnston and Mr Paye, with Mr Schomerus trailing. Lord Lawson wishes to give the OECD a higher profile in international economic affairs, an argument that might appeal to the US. He sees the organisation as a key ingredient in the international policy-making network, along with the Group of Seven and the nascent World Trade Organisation.</p>

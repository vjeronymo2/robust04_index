			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1330 GMT on 30 December carries an interview with First  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar by Arkadiy Bererov. The  place and date are not given.    Gaydar begins by reviewing the performance of the economy  over the past year, noting that despite the various political  problems a number of tasks in the first stage of reform were  solved, albeit slowly, by the end of 1993. The volume of  subsidies for agricultural production has been sharply reduced  of late, and a single customs tariff will be enforced from 1  January. A new system of financing and boosting investments has  been prepared, which will comprise the gradual redistribution of  budget allocations to support enterprises and social programs as  well as family benefits, pension reform, and gradual preparation  for introducing benefits for the less well-off sections of the  population. Small business will be encouraged. "In short, we  are trying to put together a foundation that will ensure stable  economic growth," Gaydar notes. He goes on to say that there  should be "a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation in 1994  to about 5-7 percent by the end of the year." It will be a year  of "a gradual fading away of the slump in production, which may  be basically eliminated some time around the end of the fourth  quarter, and the creation of preconditions for stable growth in  1995." But, Gaydar says, one must naturally be apprehensive  after the political damage incurred in trying to solve  anti-inflation tasks in the recent period, and this must be  avoided in the coming year.    Gaydar goes on to say that unemployment has not risen in the  Baltic republics either because a similar set of  employment-protection measures is in effect both there and in  Russia. "I will, therefore, say that provided there is a  sensible scenario of monetary policy, I do not envisage a sudden  incredible rise in unemployment -- not in 1994 at least. It  will rise gradually."    Regarding inflation, Gaydar describes as soft and consistent  a policy that aims at bringing inflation down from 12 percent  this December to 5-7 percent in the last quarter of 1994, the  goal of which is to gradually remove financial disproportions  and create prerequisites for stopping price rises.</p>

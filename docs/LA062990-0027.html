			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: CANCER RISKS  </P> <P> Question: If a woman has a genital herpes infection, does that mean she is more  likely to get genital cancer?  </P> <P> Answer: Infection with the herpes simplex virus does appear to be associated  with the development of genital cancer in women; however, this does not  necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two  events. Some authorities attribute the development of genital cancer in these  women to the risk of frequent sexual activity.  </P></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers expected to keep brake on diamond sales De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, gave a clear hint yesterday that it might have given the market indigestion while chalking up record first-half sales of USDollars 2.58bn. It described the performance - 1.5 per cent higher than in the same months last year - as 'encouraging' but said it cut supplies to the market in the second quarter because of 'a build-up of stocks in the (diamond) cutting centres and continued concerns in respect of cutting-centre profitability'. 'There was good demand for some of the larger sizes but evidence of over-production in certain categories of small stones. So sights (sales) were reined in in the second quarter.' Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'There is no question that demand for diamonds is recovering. But De Beers has been pushing the market too hard. From all parts of the trade we hear complaints about there being too many diamonds and too many diamonds of the wrong sort. There are not enough stones from which the trade can make a profit.' Like some other analysts, he suggested that De Beers would continue to restrict supplies so that its second half sales would be well below those in the first six months. The 1994 full-year total therefore would be not much different from last year's Dollars 4.366bn. De Beers' profits from diamonds would remain low, he added, and its total earnings would consequently 'not be that buoyant'. De Beers yesterday acknowledged that its big customers, who cut and polish gem diamonds, were complaining that their profit margins had been squeezed so hard during the past two years that they were now practically non-existent. The CSO is to meet a delegation to discuss these problems. A spokesman pointed out that the long recession had also been painful for De Beers, which had cut production, made 25 per cent of employees at its diamond mines redundant, cut the dividend to shareholders and was having to finance stocks that had risen to Dollars 4bn. The international promotional budget had also been lifted from Dollars 150m to more than Dollars 170m. The group increased rough diamond prices by 1.5 per cent in February last year, the first rise since 1990. Producers were also asked to cut deliveries from previously-agreed levels and De Beers made it clear yesterday that deliveries would remain unchanged at 85 per cent. De Beers said that in the first half demand for retail diamond jewellery remained stable in the US but was weak in Japan, which vies with the States as the biggest diamond retail market. Demand in other east Asian markets was high but it was weak in Europe. There were signs, however, that the economies of both Japan and Europe had 'bottomed out'.</p>

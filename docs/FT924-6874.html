			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Truck sales show further rise SALES of new commercial vehicles rose 5.3 per cent to 15,465 last month, confirming signs in the summer of the beginning of a slow recovery in one of the sectors hit hardest by the recession. Sales in the first 10 months, at 173,111, were nevertheless 5.9 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year before. But they have risen year-on-year in three of the past five months, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has reported. Sales of new trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have risen year-on-year for four consecutive months to October after falling continuously for 33 months from the final quarter of 1989. The decline earlier in the year means that for the first 10 months UK truck sales were still 4.4 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year before. Any recovery is coming from a very low base. Since 1989, commercial vehicle sales have suffered a sharp fall into recession. Truck sales have plunged 60 per cent in three years, dropping to a level not seen since the early 1950s. The first signs of a weak recovery appeared in the heavy truck segment (above 15 tonnes), which was also the first to succumb to the recession. Sales of heavy truck in the first 10 months, at 13,813, are running 0.6 per cent higher than last year. In the overall truck market, Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of the Dutch commercial vehicle maker DAF, appears to be consolidating the narrow lead it established last year ahead of the Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson, the specialist heavy-truck maker. In the first 10 months, Leyland DAF increased its sales volume by 1 per cent compared with an overall decline in the sector of 4.4 per cent and a fall in Iveco group sales of 4.6 per cent. In the first 10 months Leyland DAF captured a 25 per cent share of the truck market compared with the Iveco group's 23.8 per cent. Renault and MAN are the main losers in the UK truck market this year, with declines in sales of 30.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-OCTOBER 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume   Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units)  Change (%) Jan-Oct 92  Jan-Oct 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 173,111    -5.9       100.0        100.0 Imports                        62,536    -4.3        36.1         35.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                          54,145    -6.7       100.0        100.0 Imports                        12,347   +19.1        22.8         17.9 Ford                           24,534    -3.9        45.3         44.0 Vauxhall (General Motors)      17,126    +4.4        31.6         28.3 Rover (British Aerospace)       3,727   -42.8         6.9         11.2 Peugeot incl.

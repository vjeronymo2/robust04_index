			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Catwalk style for kids - Avril Groom searches the clothes racks for fashion gifts for youngsters The gap between what children want to wear and how their elders would like them to dress is bigger than you think. Searching recently for some civilised clothing to tempt an 11-year-old, whose idea of chic is an outsize man's T-shirt and black jeans artistically holed at the knee, I suggested the casual but classic combination of a denim shirt and chinos. 'Yuk]' came the outraged reply, with a look of deeply affronted dignity, 'That's what dad wears.' Now, in the interests of family unity, what you do not need on Christmas morning is a reaction like that from your little darling when he/she opens a parcel from grannie or great-aunt, especially if said elderly relative is there beaming fondly. So, if grannie likes to indulge your children with clothes, a little prior consultation is a good idea. The world's most wonderful smocked silk dress is a disaster if it is banished to the back of the wardrobe by a disdainful child. Babies are easy to cater for. The only person likely to complain at the gift of a white satin, hand-embroidered romper suit is the mother, as she visualises it splattered with pureed apple. The traditional source of such delights is The White House, but another name to look for is Heather Brown whose hand-embroidered and smocked, washable styles are available at Fortnum and Mason, Pollyanna of Fulham Road and New Arrivals of Banchory. Little girls are normally delighted with any full-skirted party frock but where you would prefer it in sober navy taffeta or dark tartan they like sugar-almond pink. This objection is easily overcome, however, with a stiff net under petticoat and a skirt full enough to 'twirl'. A tiny matching bag and hair band are other inducements - Young England, Trotters and Bambino have dresses with matching sets. The smocked silk dress is still a winner and Daks' new children's range includes a white-collared style in dark or neutral checks that is beautifully made and not over-glitzy. Small boys look sweet in cords, smart shorts and Fair Isle jumpers but over four they find velvet knickerbockers, Peter Pan collars and bow-ties pretty hard to take. Any grannie coming up with the Little Lord Fauntleroy look probably deserves rebellion. But traditional style is reasserting itself in the market and pragmatic parents, who do not wish a small fortune to be spent on something that will be shortly outgrown, could suggest Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, BhS and Children's World as sources of tasteful, good-looking childrenswear with unguessable price tags. Laura Ashley, who regard traditional style as their forte, also have a particularly good Christmas range. Older children are more tricky. The strictures of school uniform create a healthy disregard for formality on high days and holidays. Boys seem to reject anything other than denim, though a navy blazer is one classic acceptable to most, anything from Burberry's sharply-cut version to Marks and Spencers' soft moufflon style, about Pounds 50. A fun alternative is a waistcoat - plain, velvet or damasked. These also find favour with girls, who respond surprisingly early to adult trends. A waistcoat over a long white shirt, big, bright knits with leggings, and velvet (especially black) are ideas that have gone straight from the catwalk to the under-tens. Velvet is your best weapon in persuading an older girl to wear a traditional party frock - she will think it immensely sophisticated. Harrods has crushed velvet waistcoats, long flutey skirts and organza shirts among their more traditional offerings. At chainstore level, BhS has fetching velvet or cotton embroidered or beaded waistcoats and long, silk skirts. Debenhams can supply boys with dark, washed-silk shirts. The best small present for a girl this year is, without doubt, a squashy velvet hat. This will be accepted with gratitude and worn everywhere. And that is the greatest compliment a grandparent could possibly receive.</p>

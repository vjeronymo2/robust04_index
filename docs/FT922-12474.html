			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Capital restructuring and warning from Surrey Group SURREY Group, the USM-quoted company with interests in betting and gambling, issued its second consecutive annual profits warning and announced plans for a capital restructuring which would help pay debts owed to a director. The group, which came to the market in 1989 and launched a Pounds 2.5m rights issue to pay debt less than a year later, warned that results for the year to March 31 might be below expectations due to 'extremely difficult trading conditions'. Surrey also said it planned to issue 16.3m new shares at 1p each. To comply with company law, the existing 5p shares - which have been trading at about 3 1/4 p - will have to be split. Surrey proposes to create one ordinary share of 1p, which will carry all voting and dividend rights, and a deferred share of 4p which will, in effect, be worthless. Some 12m of the new 16.3m shares - about 8.8 per cent of the company's current share capital - would be offered to Mr R Fatah, a director, at 3p, in lieu of repaying Pounds 360,000 of a Pounds 500,000 loan following the purchase of 12 betting shops from Coral Racing in February. Three other individuals would inject Pounds 129,000 by purchasing the outstanding 4.3m shares - about 3.2 per cent of the current equity - at 3p. The proposals will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May 8.</p>

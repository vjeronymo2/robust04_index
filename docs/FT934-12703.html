			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Inflation rates in Germany INFLATION in two key west German states edged upwards in the month to mid-October, although year-on-year price increases appeared to be steadying, according to preliminary figures published yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Prices in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, rose 0.2 per cent in the review period and were 3.7 per cent up on the year, compared with 3.8 per cent in September. Wealthy Baden-Wurttemberg reported a 0.3 per cent month-on-month rise for an annual rate of 4.1 per cent, unchanged from September. Yesterday's numbers showed that rents and services - up around 6 per cent in both regions - are still providing most impetus to price rises, while insurance costs have also risen markedly. North Rhine-Westphalia's statistics office said local inflation for the first 10 months of the year was 4 per cent. Latest estimates from the Bundesbank suggest the west German rate will be below 4 per cent before the end of the year.</p>

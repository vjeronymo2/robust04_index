			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Midlands light rail authority invites tenders FOUR private-sector consortia have been invited to tender for a Pounds 100m contract to design, build and operate a light-rail transport system in Birmingham and the Black Country. The tender has been called by Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority. It is part of a renewed effort to persuade the government to provide funding for a project which, it is argued, fits into its policy of encouraging private and public sector partnerships in infrastructure development. Centro suspended its tendering process for the light-rail system last June, when the government said there would be no funding available to start construction in April 1993. Now, Centro officials believe, a new opportunity to start the project, called Midland Metro, has come with last week's Autumn Statement. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said then that the government would 'actively encourage joint ventures with the private sector where these involve a sensible transfer of risk to the private sector'. Existing plans for Midland Metro provide for only 10 per cent of the Pounds 100m cost to come from the private sector. The remainder would be provided by central government with Pounds 40m, local authority borrowing with Pounds 40m and the European Community with Pounds 10m. Midland Metro's first line would run from central Birmingham through West Bromwich and Bilston to Wolverhampton. The government has provided Pounds 4.5m to help finance advance works. It is the only planned line in the UK which has won parliamentary and Department of Transport approval. Centro said yesterday that a government grant of Pounds 10m would enable construction to start next year. Tendering would be completed by April. But this assumes an extra government funding allocation to light-rail systems. The four tendering consortia are: Civil engineering group Balfour Beatty and German electrical group Siemens. Centram, made up of construction company Taylor Woodrow and Ansaldo Transporti, subsidiary of the Italian Finmeccanica group. Construction group John Mowlem and GEC Alsthom Transportation. Eurotransit, made up of Norwest Holst, subsidiary of French construction group Societe Generale d'Entreprises, contractor Tilbury Douglas and AEG Westinghouse Transport Systems.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Entel plans to raise Dollars 350m Entel, Chile's largest long-distance telephone operator, yesterday decided to raise Dollars 350m through the issue of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in New York and shares on the Santiago exchange. The cash is to be raised in two tranches, one this year and another in 1996, said company spokesman Mr Marcelo Maturama. It will be used to fund the company's expansion plans including extension of its micro-wave and fibre-optic lines and the development of its personal telephone service.</p>

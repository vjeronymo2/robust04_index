			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Big Blue turns red The fourth-quarter operating loss and huge restructuring provisions announced yesterday by IBM were heavily trailed in advance. Yet the scale of the company's problems is still breathtaking. While the bureaucracies of several US corporate giants have been overtaken by a changing business climate, IBM's plight seems worst of all. The company has seen its main large computer market dwindle with astonishing speed. It is fashionable to blame the chairman, Mr John Akers, for being slow off the mark, but there is little the company could have done to avoid its basic dilemma. The falling price of computing power was bound to lead eventually to standardisation and cheaper networks - IBM's personal computer merely accelerated the process. As a result the company has to run its expensive mainframe business on vastly reduced revenues. Since there is limited scope for cost-cutting in that business, margins will be permanently squeezed. Splitting the company up might help some divisions - notably personal computers - but there are others, like networking systems, whose fate is firmly tied to IBM's mainframe sales. It is also far from clear that the company's aim of becoming a large-scale service and software provider meets a real need. Investors are balancing the possibility of a dividend cut following next week's board meeting against their calculations of a break-up value of the company. But IBM's recovery hinges on its ability to catch up with change. The omens are poor.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Lottery ticket duty to be 12% DUTY ON tickets for the National Lottery will be 12 per cent, the chancellor said. Other lotteries, such as those run on behalf of charities and local authorities, will be exempt. He said the announcement on the lottery, due to start next year, was being made 'to allow businesses to make informed competitive tenders' for the contract to operate the system for the government. At the same time, the chancellor proposed an increase of 20 per cent in most rates of gaming machine licence duty from May 1, though duty on small-prize machines - costing up to 5p per play - will not rise and is to be abolished from November 1. Customs and Excise yesterday laid an Order before Parliament to increase the exemption limit for non-dutiable bingo played at fairgrounds and other commercial entertainments from Pounds 20 to Pounds 25.</p>

The decree was issued in order to increase the effectiveness  of export potential, to strengthen the system of trade  calculations, and to protect inner trade.    The decree will remain in force until corresponding  legislative acts regulating foreign economic activity can be  adopted.    In line with this decree, outside the republic, goods will  be  exported through preliminary payment or by opening a letter of  credit. Only with certain exceptions will goods and services be  exported without preliminary payment by the order of the  Cabinet. Preliminary payment for imported goods and services  has been banned. These operations can be implemented with a  letter of credit. Preliminary payment for imported goods and  barters can be put into effect, in exceptional cases, with the  permission of the government.    A list of strategically-sensitive goods, which can be  exported only with the permission of the President, has also  been defined.    The Cabinet has been given two weeks to work out and to  adopt  a list of temporary measures. In addition, the Cabinet must  work out and present to the President a bill regulating foreign  economic activity of organizations and enterprises. Since this  decree went into effect on January 10, 1994, all the former  decrees (No. 402 from January 13, 1993 and No. 403 on March 18,  1993 and Instruction 118 from September 10, 1992) have been  cancelled.    The types of strategic export production, consisting of 60  articles, have been added to the Presidential decree. They  include oil and oil products, chemical production, cotton,  non-ferrous, black and precious metals, tobacco, snake poison,  black caviar and others.</p>

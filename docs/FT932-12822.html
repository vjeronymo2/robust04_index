			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Reed sets up its stall in prison REED EMPLOYMENT, the recruitment agency, yesterday opened an office inside Holloway women's prison to provide training and work for inmates. The project is the first of its kind to be run by an employer in a UK prison. Prisoners will take on typing, data processing and telephone sales work for outside companies, supervised by Reed staff. If the scheme is a success it could be extended to other prisons, Reed said. Part of the inmates' pay of about Pounds 3 an hour will go towards their keep in the prison, with the rest for pocket money and savings. Women taking part in the scheme will also be able to make a voluntary donation to the charity Victim Support.</p>

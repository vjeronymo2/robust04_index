			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Dow Jones lifts income 14% to Dollars 34m Dow Jones, the US media group that publishes the Wall Street Journal, lifted net income by 14 per cent to Dollars 33.7m in the third quarter to September, helped by a big increase in revenues from its electronic information services division. However, the underlying profits growth was less strong than appeared. As the company pointed out, the previous year's third quarter included an unusually high tax charge relating to an increase in federal taxation. If that had not occurred, the year-on-year increase in net income would have been 7 per cent. Group revenues rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 501m, but operating income edged ahead only 2.5 per cent to Dollars 69.6m. Earnings per share rose from 30 cents to 34 cents. The biggest contributor to profits growth was the information services unit, which comprises the Dow Jones/Telerate group of real-time news services and the business information services group. Revenues from the division, fed by demand for its products, surged 15 per cent to Dollars 246.6m, lifting operating income 22 per cent to Dollars 49.6m. The business publications division did less well. The Wall Street Journal, the company's flagship newspaper, suffered from poor advertising revenues caused by the same downturn in financial market activity that is afflicting Wall Street investment houses. The division's revenues fell by 1 per cent to Dollars 190.5m and its operating income slumped 37 per cent to Dollars 14.6m. For the nine months, Dow Jones increased net income by 20 per cent to Dollars 119.9m on revenues up 7 per cent at Dollars 1.5bn. Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.20 from Dollars 1.01.</p>

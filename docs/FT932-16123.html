			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Gartland and Whalley set up new company ENTREPRENEURS Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeffrey Whalley are part of a team which yesterday set up a new group by bringing together a coin handling equipment maker and an optical products manufacturer for Pounds 24m. The move is the first of significance made by the previously high-profile pair in their latest vehicle, the Gartland and Whalley company. Mr Gartland and Mr Whalley, as directors of the FKI engineering company, presided over its acquisition-led high growth rates in the 1980s, including the purchase of Babcock, the contracting company in 1987 - a deal which was undone some two years later. Mr Gartland and Mr Whalley left executive employment with FKI in 1989. Mr Whalley remains FKI chairman. The new company, which the backers hope to float within the next 12 months, acquired its main subsidiary, Coin Controls Group, for Pounds 20m cash. Mr Richard Williams, CCG chief executive is to be managing director. The new group acquired the Slough-based Combined Optical Industries Ltd for more than Pounds 3m of equity. Gartland and Whalley bought COIL in 1990. Total funding is made up of Pounds 10.5m senior debt supplied by Bank of Scotland. Gartland and Whalley contributed more than half of the Pounds 9.5m equity capital with Granville Development Capital making up the balance and Kleinwort Benson's European Mezzanine Fund contributing Pounds 4m.</p>

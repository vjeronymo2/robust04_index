			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Rabuka named premier of Fiji MR Sitiveni Rabuka, the former army officer who led two coups in 1987, was yesterday appointed prime minister of Fiji at the head of a coalition government elected under a racially-biased constitution. The appointment, announced by President Sir Penaia Ganilau, followed three days of manoeuvring for the premiership between Mr Rabuka and Mr Josevata Kamikamica, a former finance minister. Both are members of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party, which supports the political supremacy of the country's 345,000 ethnic Fijians, who account for about 48 per cent of the population. The SVT won 30 of the 37 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians in the 70-seat House of Representatives. The more extreme Fijian Nationalist United Front won five seats. Two were taken by independents. Mr Kamikamica, a former civil servant, was the preferred choice of the president, and was regarded as more acceptable to the 340,000 ethnic Indians who account for 47 per cent of the population. However, Mr Rabuka's appointment was assured by the support of Mr Mahendra Chaudhry, leader of the trade union based Fiji Labour Party, which won 13 of the 27 seats reserved for Indians. Ironically, Mr Chaudhry was one of several Indian leaders detained by Mr Rabuka when the army twice intervened in 1987 to overthrow a coalition government dominated by Indians. The key element of the deal was an agreement to review the constitution, which seeks to entrench ethnic Fijian dominance through unequal parliamentary representation and an ethnic Fijian Senate with significant veto powers. The prime minister and president must both be ethnic Fijians. Mr Chaudhry also extracted from Mr Rabuka an undertaking to review restrictions on trade union activity introduced by the interim government which has ruled Fiji since December 1987. The deal is likely to give Mr Chaudhry a bigger role in Fijian Indian affairs than the formerly dominant National Federation Party (NFP), which won 14 seats. However, Labour stopped short of entering a formal coalition. Mr Rabuka will govern with the support of the two Fijian independents and five MPs elected by the 35,000 Europeans, Chinese, and other races.</p>

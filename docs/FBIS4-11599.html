			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Peasant Leader Juan de la Cruz Villca,  50 roadblocks have been established nationwide. Contrary to the  government's assessment, peasants have indicated that the road  blockade was a true success on its first day.    [Begin Villca recording, in progress] ...we have information  on hand about 50 roadblocks. This means that over 150,000  fellow peasants are taking part in this nationwide mobilization.  Moreover, the military have been mobilized all over.    The main road blocks that have been set up are: in Santa  Cruz  Department: Angostura, Sevaruyo, Yapayapa, Ivirganzama, Bulu  Bulu; (Chifarsama), near Tropico Cochabamba; in Cochabamba  Department: (Parautani), the entire highway; in Oruro Deparment:  Caracollo. From (?Cruce Machamarca) we have reports that  despite the presence of tanks, one of which turned over while  transporting soldiers, fellow peasants have established  roadblocks along the entire highway.    Peasants have also established roadblocks in Potosi  Department, near (Ipalla), near Tarija. Moreover, fellow  peasants from Chuquisaca have been established on all local  roads.    This is why we are saying that the rejection of the  government's intention to commercialize land has been truly  successful. [end recording]    Peasants and Army personnel this afternoon engaged in a  violent clash in Chapare Region, Cochabamba Department.  Desiderio Choque, leader of the United Central Federation  [Federacion Central Unidas] reported that no serious injuries  were reported among peasants, and that despite the clash, the  roadblocks have not been lifted.    [Begin Choque recording, in progress] ...today there was a  regrettable clash when we were staging a nationwide road  blockade in compliance with instructions put forth by the  National Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers.    This incident occurred at 2130 GMT. The clash lasted 30  minutes. It ended at 2200 GMT. However, our fellow peasants are  stronger than ever, and we are continuing with the road  blockades, that is, the roadblocks have not been lifted. [end  recording]</p>

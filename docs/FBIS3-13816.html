Sources close to the foreign ministry said the Tunis meeting  could lead to a meeting Thursday in Paris between Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO) chief Yasir 'Arafat.    A delegation led by chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq  will discuss the deployment in Hebron of Palestinian police  under Israeli authority and an international presence there,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's office said.    The four-man team, was to leave for PLO headquarters after  the weekly cabinet meeting, to discuss how to restart talks on  Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, suspended since the  February 25 massacre.    Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, who is one of  the delegates, said on radio that Israel was fully responsible  for the "safety of Palestinians" in the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip.    "There is a demand to deploy an international force as  stipulated in the (September) Declaration of Principles and we  hope to put it into practice," Savir said.    "These two points can serve as a good basis for satisfying  both parties and make progress toward peace."    Israeli state radio said the government would accept a  temporary international presence in the West Bank town of Hebron.    Rabin said Saturday he hoped negotiations with the  Palestinians as well as with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan could  resume after Passover in early April and Israeli Independence  day on April 14.    The other members of the Israeli delegation are Rabin's  political advisor Jacques Neria and the foreign ministry's legal  advisor Yo'el Singer.    The PLO in Tunis Saturday welcomed Friday's UN resolution on  the Hebron massacre as a basis for protecting Palestinians and  restarting the negotiations to launch self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho.    "UN Security Resolution 904 is a solid basis for immediately  starting the necessary measures to protect Palestinians in the  territories and for assuring the restart and success of the  negotiations," it said in a statement.    Besides meeting the Israeli delegation, the PLO leadership  will also consult in the next two days with senior envoys from  the United States and Russia, the sponsors of the Middle East  peace talks.    The meetings will focus on "practical measures" to apply  Friday's resolution calling for a temporary international or  foreign presence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a PLO  official said.    A decision on whether to resume autonomy negotiations will  be  taken later based on talks involving "all parties, particularly  Israel," he said.    By calling for an armed international observation force to  protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, the PLO has  been asking for more than Israel is willing to give.</p>

Latvian volunteers blocked several buildings belonging to  the  Russian army and kept two Russian generals in handcuffs for  several hours and showed a disgusting approach to the Russian  Ambassador in Latvia.    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has ordered that the  Russian military transport planes, paratroopers and pilots in  the republic be put to combat alert owing to the events in the  Latvian capital.    Kostikov has told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that should  similar incidents repeat, the reaction of the president and  Russia would be tougher, I would say very tough taking into  account the world precedents.</p>

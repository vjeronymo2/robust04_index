			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Dentists' fees to be studied quickly THE GOVERNMENT yesterday tried to head off threatened disruptive action by dentists, Alan Pike writes. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced a review of dental remuneration that would report by the end of the year. She urged dentists to 'think long and hard before taking any action that would damage patients or jeopardise the improvements in dental health achieved in recent years.' Dentists this week voted in favour of partial withdrawal from National Health Service treatment after the government reduced their fees by 7 per cent. Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, is to review the pay system, and Mrs Bottomley emphasised that he had been asked to report to ministers by the end of the year. The review will be overseen by Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister. He said the British Dental Association had told the government it believed the review must have an element of independence, and ministers had responded by appointing Sir Kenneth. The government imposed the 7 per cent fees cut from this month on the ground that the profession's earnings have exceeded review body recommendations. Association members responded by voting to stop accepting new NHS patients.</p>

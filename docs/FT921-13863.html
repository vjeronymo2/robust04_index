			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Two girls go soul searching THE TOUR to which this devised double bill at the Gate Theatre, Notting Hill acts as guide is of female relationships. In the first piece, Slight Possession, which won the Guardian International Student Drama Award, the relationship that is explored is a passionate one. The journey is from infatuation through rejection to a reconciliation that styles itself a happy ending against the evidence of the two personalities involved. They torment and torture each other, then kiss and make up, spouting romantic cliches while subverting them through behaviour which is choreographed into metronomic repetitions. Their neuroses converge on a step-ladder, which is clacked open and shut, mounted, leapt from and cowered behind. In the second piece, The Detour, the trip is more abstract. Two women are walking along a road. As they go, they accumulate the baggage of a lifetime  -an unwanted gift, a chair, a corpse, an infernal blue boa which becomes an icon of a certain sort of female sexuality. What precisely is their destination? A washing line at the front of the stage on which they peg out their luggage as they peer over our heads to a distant horizon. They have arrived. Yes, but where? By this stage I'm afraid I neither knew nor cared. Talking Tongues have found themselves a lively performance style, but they have as yet to develop the common touch that can woo an ordinary audience. A sense of humour helps, and narrative is important, even if one chooses to ignore its more obvious manifestations. In Slight Possession, Kim Walter and Rachel Weisz at least create the continuity of two characters in a given situation. In the episodic Detour, they abandon themselves to their imaginations in a way that is at once self-indulgently studenty and prohibitively difficult to follow. David Farr directs.</p>

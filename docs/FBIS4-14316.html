			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Yemeni House of Representatives issued on 28 </F> April]    [Excerpt] Praise be to God, who says: And fear the trial  which affects not in particular only those of you who do wrong  [partial Koranic verse], and peace and blessings be upon his  honest messenger, Muhammad, and his family and companions.    The House of Representatives has been following the  exacerbating political crisis since the beginning, and has been  exerting intensive efforts to end it. In the meantime, the  House provided successive chances for coalition parties and  direct dialogue to find solutions to the crisis in a manner that  satisfies all parties.    The House, along with the masses of our people, used to  believe that the drafting and signing of the pledge and accord  document would end the political crisis, which has negatively  affected every aspect of citizens' daily lives.    Having followed the regrettable military incidents in 'Imran  at noon yesterday, Wednesday, 27 April 1994, leaving many of our  people's sons in the Armed Forces dead, the House expresses  extreme regret and concern for those incidents. It instructs  the Defense Ministry and the command of the Armed Forces to  immediately stop the use of weapons between the brother members  of the same people and same army. It instructs all of them to  abide by the instructions of legitimate constitutional  authority, which represents the people, and to abide by their  constitutional duty to safeguard national sovereignty and  legitimacy. It appeals to everyone to immediately stop using  weapons and to abolish all military manifestations which lead to  disputes at the camps and outlying [formerly border] areas.    The House, along with all the sons of our people, condemns  the use of force and all those who directly or indirectly  fomented the sedition among the sons of the same homeland. The  House demands that the executive authority take the instigators  to court as soon as investigations are concluded, within one  week. The House instructs the Defense and Security Committee to  move to 'Imran to investigate what has taken place and to submit  an urgent report to the House. [passage omitted]</p>

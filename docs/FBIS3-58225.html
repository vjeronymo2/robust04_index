			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Zafer Kiraz from Brussels] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a speech at the NATO  summit, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller discussed Turkey's  assessment of the recent developments and of the roles NATO must  play within that framework. The meeting was held in camera.    In a statement on her speech Ciller listed the main points  of  this assessment as follows: Turkey is pleased with the  establishment of the European Union and of a European security  and defense identity. However, this identity must include all  the European NATO members; in other words, Turkey must be a full  member of the European Union.    The alliance remains inadequate before the clashes and human  tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Whatever is necessary must be  done to prevent new tragedies elsewhere. NATO must continue to  be an intervening power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when an  agreement is reached, it must make contributions, not only  donations. We must either protect the innocent, or we must lift  the arms embargo. The people of another country are not the  children of another God.    The attack on Azerbaijan must stop.    We support the process of democracy and reform in Russia.    Everyone must support the independence of the new republics  established in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse.    Turkey views positively the project of a united and common  duty force that can be established to protect peace.    The proliferation of mass destruction weapons constitutes an  important threat, and is therefore an important source of danger  in Turkey's region. This threat can be eliminated only through  joint effort.    Terrorism is a kind of war aimed against democracy and human  rights, and no pretext can conceal this fact. Those who support  terrorism end up being its victims. As in other fields, we must  be in solidarity and cooperation regarding this issue as well.    For Turkey, the territorial integrity and independence of  every ally is sacred. We expect the same approach from our  allies.    We live in an uncertain world. Even though unity is more  difficult in such situations, it is important. Those who want  to foresee the future must be strong enough to form the future.  [passage omitted]</p>

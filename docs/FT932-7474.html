			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / IMF tells Greece to continue reforms GREECE is at last tackling the structural problems that have undermined the economy over the last decade, but perseverance will be needed to achieve convergence with the rest of the European Community, according to the International Monetary Fund. 'After years of hesitant starts, structural adjustment gained substantial momentum in 1992, especially in privatisation, deregulation and financial and public sector reform,' the IMF said in its annual report on the Greek economy. However, the confidential report also pointed out that inflation, now 16.2 per cent, is still much higher than elsewhere in the EC, while revenue raising remains a pressing problem. The IMF said the government should take immediate measures to ensure that this year's target of a primary budget surplus, amounting to 5 per cent of gross domestic product, can be achieved, following a serious shortfall in revenues in the first quarter. The government has ruled out introducing new taxes ahead of next spring's election, but is preparing spending cuts that would reduce public investment this year and trim subsidies to state-controlled enterprises. The report added that further spending curbs would be needed next year, focusing on 'cost-cutting in the government and the broader public sector, with a vigorous attack on overmanning'. Despite pledging to cut 50,000 public sector jobs by 1994, the government has made little progress on reducing the civil service payroll, swollen by patronage appointments. The report also called for a more determined effort on privatisation, despite political opposition, in order to bring down the public debt, now at around 120 per cent of GDP. The IMF warned against any relaxation of the stabilisation effort.</p>

			<p>Drug   Traffickers   <F P=102> BK2604110194 Islamabad THE NEWS in English 26 Apr 94 p 12 </F> <F P=103> BK2604110194 </F> <F P=104>  Islamabad THE NEWS </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Excerpts] Islamabad -- The National Assembly Monday  adopted four bills, including the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment)  Bill, 1994 to provide death penalty to drug traffickers.    The bills were passed without any discussion as the  opposition continued to boycott the session.    Stating the objective of the dangerous drugs bill, the  Interior Minister said it has been tabled to check the menace of  trafficking of narcotic drugs which has assumed alarming  situation in the recent years. It is expedient to award capital  punishment to the criminals involved in offences relating to  trafficking, or financing the trafficking of heroin or cocaine  or opium or coca leaf, import into Pakistan, export from  Pakistan, import or export inter-provincially.    The Minister said the bill seeks to achieve that object by  amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930,  to provide death penalty and also to raise the minimum  punishment of imprisonment.    In order to prevent the narcotics smugglers from benefiting  out of the illegal gains, acquired through narcotics  trafficking, the bill further seeks to achieve this objective by  amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930,  to provide for forfeiture of assets of a person convicted for  two years or more. Later the House adopted the bill.    The Interior Minister also tabled another bill titled as The  Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd Amendment) Bill, 1994, for  passage.    While stating the objective of this bill, the Minister said  the expression "raw opium" has not been defined in The  Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 which resulted  into release of accused. The Federal Shariat Court and the High  Courts have, therefore, desired an appropriate amendment in the  statute, the Minister added. The House passed the amended bill  with voice vote.    The House also adopted the Anti-Narcotic Task Force Bill,  1993 which provides for the constitution of anti-narcotics task  force.    Describing the objectives of the bill, the Interior Minister  said that with a view to inquiring into and investigating all  offences relating to, or connected with, preparation,  production, manufacture, transportation, trafficking or  smuggling of intoxicants, narcotics and chemicals, precursors or  reagents used in the manufacture of narcotics or dangerous drugs  or assets derived therefrom, the Federal government decided to  constitute an anti- narcotics task force, and empower its  members with necessary legal powers for the aforesaid purpose.    He said the bill seeks the necessary legal frame work for  constitution of the said anti-narcotics task force, by the  Federal Government and empower its members with such powers,  including the powers relating to search, arrest of persons or  seizure of property and such duties, privileges and liabilities,  as a police officer has in respect of offences under the Code of  Criminal procedure, 1898 or any other law for the time being in  force.

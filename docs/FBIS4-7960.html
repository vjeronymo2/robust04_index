			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nicolae Militaru: "Romania's Army Is Struggling </F> for Survival"]    [Text] For the second time within a short period, Defense  Minister Gheorghe Tinca was among the officers and soldiers of  the Transylvanian 4th Army. Immediately following his  appointment, Tinca had accompanied, about two weeks ago, the  head of the executive [Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu] on his  tour in the counties of Brasov, Covasna, Harghita, and Mures.  Following this, on 26 March he attended the oath-taking  ceremony that took place in the Someseni garrison, together with  General Paul Cheler, commander of the 4th Army, the Cluj County  prefect, Grigore Zanc, and the mayor of the city of Cluj-Napoca,  Gheorghe Funar.    After the solemn moment of the soldiers' taking their oath  of  allegiance to the country, the defense minister talked with the  parents and relatives of the soldiers, after which he visited  some of the barracks of the "General Avramescu" motorized  battalion, the shooting and training grounds, as well as the  military equipment maintenance and repair bases. At the end of  his visit, at the headquarters of the 4th Army, the minister met  with the Transylvanian army corps, with generals, and  high-ranking officers. The press was admitted to that meeting.  Despite the fact that it is the first time ever that this has  happened -- which proves that the Army is trying to be open in  its relations with the press and, through the press, with public  opinion -- we have to admit that we did not learn too many  "secrets." We were already aware, as everyone else in today's  Romania, that the budget allotted to the army has decreased each  year, that the country's defense industry is almost not  functioning at all, and that the pay given to the soldiers is  hardly sufficient for them to buy food and pay for the rent and  their families' other expenses. We had known that over a number  of years the army has ceased to have that spirit of  competitiveness it should have, being much rather characterized  by a state typical of those struggling for survival.    Thus we went there to learn, straight from the source, how  much truth there is in such information, so that we can sound  the alarm bell while there is still time to correct things.  What we heard from generals and high-ranking officers of the  4th Transylvanian Army confirmed that things are much graver  even than we had believed. In Transylvania alone, and just in  the near future, the cadres of that army would need a total of  4,587 apartments. The Ramnicu Sarat clothing factory is  seriously behind with its deliveries of uniforms, and therefore  the recruits have been given worn-out clothing. The boots, and  generally, all the footwear produced in Bacau come apart the  first time they are used in the sleet. Food prices increased so  much that officers detached to other units can hardly afford to  maintain themselves, let alone support their families left  behind hundreds of kilometers away. Many people do not know that  officers are expected to teach their soldiers a total of 22  various disciplines, and if they want to sound convincing when  they order: "Soldiers, follow me! Forward!" they have to be  considered genuine models by their men. "What is even more  serious, General Paul Cheler said, -- and this holds true for  the entire Romanian Army, not just the Transylvanian one -- is  the fact that the officers and other military cadres in all  military units will not complain about their low pay or other  personal problems, but rather about the fact that their units  lack ammunition and fuel needed for drills, their Russian-made  radio equipment, for instance, is 40 years old, and that their  night ammunition is almost identical to that used at the  beginning of the century, because its phosphorus needs to be  activated with a flashlight." In order to keep its tanks and  armored carrier vehicles operational, the 4th Army needs several  dozens of thousands of batteries, 11,000 tires, 2,700 trucks,  and several hundred buses and vans, as the ones they are  currently using are 20 years old.    Besides the shortage in equipment, now they are taking away  the army's firing ranges too. A firing range near the town of  Turda, spreading over 12,000 hectares, which was in the army's  possession before the last world war, is now reduced to merely  2,700 hectares, and that land is also claimed by the inhabitants  of an Alba County village. Another firing range in Harghita  County, previously used to practice artillery fire in mountain  regions, was declared a "natural monument" by local authorities,  which also denied the soldiers access to that area. A more  serious matter is that they are unable to ensure training for  the reserve cadres. According to the law, the army has to pay  the called up persons the same amount they earn in their  civilian life. However, the army's budget does not provide for  such payments, and, if the called up person works for RENEL  [Romanian National Electricity Network Corporation], his payment  would exceed the salaries of three officers. At the same time  the fines to be paid by persons who do not carry out certain  military duties amount to merely 24-40 lei.    The crisis currently facing the army is not a new one. It  has been going on for 10 years. However, one would expect that  the modernization process that began over the past few years in  Romania would also include the army structures, its endowment  with the necessary means to increase its defense ability.  Because being a modern country, which we claim we began to be  after our admittance to the Council of Europe and after the  signing of the Partnership for Peace with NATO, also presupposes  our having a modern army.</p>

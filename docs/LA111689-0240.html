			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NBC'S 3 ANCHORS: NOT A SIGNAL  </P> <P> An "NBC Nightly News" show using three anchors instead of Tom Brokaw alone was  brought on by special circumstances and does not signal a change in the  program's format, the network said.  </P> <P> Brokaw taped the start of the Wednesday night show in Washington, then had to  leave to serve as master of ceremonies at the annual Robert F. Kennedy Human  Rights awards, said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.  </P> <P> Mary Alice Williams, in New York, filled in during the rest of the broadcast,  with Garrick Utley, in Berlin, anchoring reports about developments in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> ABC was the first network to use a triple-anchor format on a regular evening  newscast. From 1978 to 1983, its newscast was anchored in Washington by Frank  Reynolds, in Chicago by Max Robinson and in London by Peter Jennings. Jennings  has been sole anchor of "World News Tonight" since ABC's troika format was  dropped six years ago. Reynolds and Robinson have since died.  </P></p>

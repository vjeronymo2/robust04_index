			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading HEAVY selling of stock index futures led to a decline in the June FT-SE 100 contract as dealers focused on Friday's heavy falls on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo. In spite of the decline, the biggest part of which came after the market close in London, trading in the June contract opened firmly on buying from independent traders. However, the buying had dried up by mid-morning, which then left June to drift down as dealers feared further falls in New York. By early afternoon, the contract had fallen to its fair value premium to cash of about 11 points, an opportunity which many traders used to arbitrage between the futures and the cash market - leading to increased turnover in the contract. However, the anticipated further fall on Wall Street did not materialise, which led to sporadic buying before the close. The June contract finished at 2,855, down 17 from Friday's close and around 7 points above its fair value premium to cash, with turnover a reasonable 9,000 contracts. The volume in the traded options was poor, reaching only 23,898 contracts by the close. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,794 lots traded, although there was little business in the Euro FT-SE 100 version, with a mere 753 dealt. Lasmo was the most active stock option, seeing 2,012 contracts traded, followed by Forte, with 1,106 lots.</p>

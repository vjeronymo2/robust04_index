The  principal leaders of the bloc who are currently in Washington,  officially invited the members and political allies to join the  party's leadership in its new position. In a letter addressed  to the legislators in favor of the return of President Aristide,  the bloc is inviting them to reunite, to close ranks in order to  pursue together the struggle for democracy. This letter is  addressed particularly to Senator Yvon Gislain and two FNCD  deputies who approved a first plan for a solution to the crisis,  siding with some legislators from the opposition. One FNCD  ally, Deputy Samuel Madistin, who severely criticized the plan  supported by the Americans and the United Nations also rose up  against the initiative of the legislators without a mandate who  are trying to involve the Legislative Branch as a whole. Deputy  Madistin ascribes this plan to a vast international plot.  [passage omitted]</p>

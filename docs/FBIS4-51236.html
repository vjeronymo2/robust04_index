			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter You Xiayin (3266 1115 5419)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying,  deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, today met a Hong Kong Textile Council  delegation. He said that China's policy of "one country, two  systems" and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" is based on  full trust in Hong Kong compatriots.    Chen Ziying listened carefully to the guests' opinions and  views on how to realize a steady transition and maintain  economic prosperity in Hong Kong.    He added that the Chinese Government is trying by every  possible means to preserve Hong Kong's position as an  international economic and trade center, and hoped that all  systems which have been proved effective and beneficial to Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity will remain.    Chen Ziying reiterated his repeatedly expressed view, namely  that he takes an optimistic attitude on maintaining Hong Kong's  prolonged stability and development.    He pointed out: Hong Kong's present-day prosperity has been  created by the Hong Kong people themselves. They have adequate  ability and talent to exercise good management over Hong Kong's  affairs after 1997. This was the basis for putting forward the  policy of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people  ruling Hong Kong." In addition, political stability as well as  rapid and healthy [kuai su jian kang 1816 6643 0256 1660]  economic development on the Chinese mainland also serve as new  opportunities and fine conditions for Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity and the development of cooperative relations between  the mainland and Hong Kong.    In conclusion, Chen Ziying indicated: The Chinese side has  always cherished sincerity in cooperating with the British side;  now the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's constitutional system  have broken down, but we hope that the British side will not  adopt an uncooperative attitude in other aspects. This will not  only serve Hong Kong's steady transition but is also for the  sake of Sino-British long-term relations.    After the meeting, Chen Ziying held a banquet in honor of  the  30-member delegation.    The Hong Kong Textile Council delegation, headed by Fong  Hang, arrived in Beijing yesterday. During their Beijing tour,  they will visit the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, and the Chinese  General Chamber of Textiles.</p>

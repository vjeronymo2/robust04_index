The plans were strongly criticised by the Government's chief  safety adviser last year.    Mr. Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, who  has indicated that he wanted to see privatisation before the  next election, has been pressing for what some officials call a  "short and dirty" review.    This would focus narrowly on the potential commercial  viability of privatised Pressurised Water Reactors and would  report by the summer.    But Mr. John Gummer, Environment Secretary, is adamant that  the review should cover both long-term liabilities from  decommissioning nuclear plants -- costing an estimated 20  billion pounds -- and plans for disposing of nuclear power waste.    A remit for the waste review, to be carried out by the  Department of the Environment, has been long delayed but is now  expected within weeks. The review would be expected to take  until the end of the year.    Yet some industry observers say Mr. Heseltine must take a  decision this summer on the sell-off of Nuclear Electric and  Scottish Nuclear if privatisation is to happen before the next  election.    It was uncertainty about the scale of long-term liabilities  that led to the nuclear industry being dropped from  privatisation in 1989.    The waste review is likely to focus on plans of the nuclear  waste agency, Nirex, for a 3 billion pound national nuclear  waste dump at Sellafield -- and how realistic these are. These  plans have slipped from around 2003 to after 2010 while waste  continues to mount at Magnox power stations.    The review is also likely to look at costs and strategies  for  decommissioning nuclear power stations, many of them closing in  the next 10 years. This alone will cost up to 10 billion  pounds. Other liabilities, including disposing of Atomic Energy  Authority sites and British Nuclear Fuels, bring the total  closer to 20 billion pounds.    Final disposal of waste, which environmentalists say has  never been properly planned, is expected to cost more than that  but has never been fully costed.    The recent approval given for the British Nuclear Fuels  Thorp  plant will probably mean that a lot of extra waste is likely to  be generated, with nowhere for it to go.    Last autumn Prof. John Horlock, departing chairman of the  Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations,  criticised the quantities of waste piling up at power stations  and nuclear stores. He called on the Government to ensure that  the Nirex waste repository proposed for Sellafield came into  operation earlier than 2010.    It is not known if the review will cover reprocessing or dry  storage. If it were to do so, it would be a new blow to British  Nuclear Fuels which has just won a 16-year battle to open its  Thorp reprocessing plant: dry storage is seen by many as a  cheaper option than reprocessing.    Nuclear analysts reacted without surprise to the news of a  nuclear waste review.    Mr. Gordon MacKerron, senior fellow at the Science Policy  Research Unit at Sussex University, said: "There is a clear  public perception that our nuclear waste disposal policy is in a  complete mess."    "Nuclear Electric will want the Government to clear up all  the historic liabilities because it is clear that the City does  not want to take them on."    A spokesman for Nuclear Electric disputed whether a waste  review would mean delay for privatisation.</p>

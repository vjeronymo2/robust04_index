			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Losses widen at Nissan in first half Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, reported a sharp drop in first-half non-consolidated revenues and a wider loss as it was battered by poor sales at home and the sharp appreciation of the yen. Sales for the period dropped 12 per cent to Y1,568.8bn (Dollars 16.1bn) from Y1,781.8bn a year ago, while operating losses ballooned to Y82.6bn from Y38.6bn. Recurring losses - before extraordinary items and tax - widened to Y57.9bn from Y28.9bn previously. Net losses rose to Y53.7bn from Y32.8bn, and the interim dividend wasagain passed. Nissan's losses came in spite of an increase in sales of securities amounting to Y32.8bn compared with Y13.1bn in the previous first half. Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, executive managing director, described the results as providing 'a very regrettable image' of the company. But he said Nissan expected to return to the black at the operating level in the second half of the year and that it would pay a Y7 dividend for the year, equivalent to last year's amount. The better result in the second half is expected to come as a result of Nissan's strenuous rationalisation measures, which are achieving their targets earlier than expected, a recovery in domestic demand and new product launches. During the period, Nissan tried to reduce inventory levels and improve the profitability of its dealers, Mr Hamaoka said. At the same time, cost-cutting measures, and price increases, allowed Nissan to counter the adverse impact of the yen's sharp appreciation on its overseas operations. The biggest difficulty Nissan had in the six months was selling its cars in Japan, including those with model changes, as a result of the large inventory levels at its dealers. Nissan's luxury cars in particular were shunned by Japanese consumers who have become increasingly sensitive to price. Domestic sales plunged almost 19 per cent while exports were down only 2.7 per cent under the impact of the high yen. Nissan has revised down its full-year forecasts. Instead of breaking even at the recurring level, it predicts a recurring loss of Y60bn and a net loss of Y65bn on sales of Y3,400bn.</p>

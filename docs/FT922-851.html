			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / More freedom urged for aid body THE government-controlled Commonwealth Development Corporation should be given greater financial freedom to support projects in the developing world, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said yesterday. Endorsing the role of the development corporation, which provides loans and equity capital for projects in 68 developing countries, the commission said the corporation's funds should be less vulnerable to Treasury cuts, and it 'should be free to expand its activities by financing more projects and investing at a greater rate'. The commission examined the corporation's role in Britain's aid policy and the way it is managed. It said the corporation provided a very effective form of aid and was highly regarded in the developing countries. Its strengths 'fit well with the trend of international thinking on development assistance', placing appropriate emphasis on the private sector as an vehicle for growth in the developing countries. The commission was asked in November last year to investigate whether the corporation could improve its efficiency and reduce costs. Its report said there were no significant savings to be made - although its assessment was coloured by the development corporation's 'unique and ambiguous character'. The report added that efficiency could be improved, but largely by loosening government control. The corporation's contribution to aid policy was 'particularly important'. The report identified areas for possible improvement: The corporation should have its own equity capital. The lack of it 'gives the impression that it is only an extension of government'. This should be in the form of public dividend capital, and should be provided either as new money, or by converting the corporation's outstanding borrowings. The corporation's ambiguous 'quasi-commercial' status should be resolved by dividing it into two parts - one to operate entirely commercially in prosperous developing countries, and the other to be 'aimed at the poorest countries'. The organisation's funds should be set as a given percentage of the UK aid programme. At present if it boosts its income the government can cut its funding, reducing the incentive for it to expand its activities. The report reached no conclusion on whether the development corporation should be privatised, partly because of fears that this might compromise its development role, but called for further consideration of this by ministers.

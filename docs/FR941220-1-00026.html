Summary of Today's Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today the Agency is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L, an MCL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 500 mg/L, and other NPDWR requirements for sulfate. Sulfate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a unique contaminant for several reasons. The health effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the ingestion of relatively high levels of sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in drinking water (i.e., ranging from loose stools to diarrhea) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acute and temporary, and is expected to last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately two weeks. In addition, the health risk only applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to persons not already acclimated to high sulfate-containing water:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants, travelers, and new residents. (For the purposes of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, infants are defined as children up to the age of 12 months.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed rule is also unique because it affects all public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water systems, that is, community water systems, traveler non-community water systems, and non-transient, non-community water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. In the past, only regulations on microbial contaminants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nitrate have affected transient, non-community systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA decided to defer promulgation of a sulfate standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally proposed July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify an implementation approach which was tailored to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target populations. The approach EPA developed, working in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation with several States at a 1992 meeting, is innovative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and was designed specifically to provide flexibility to smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. This approach could reduce compliance costs while still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing adequate protection of public health. It provides public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water systems a means of compliance which is less expensive than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central treatment, and it affords States flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the rule. Under this approach, the State would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority to allow the public water system (PWS), as one means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance with the sulfate MCL, to provide ``Alternative Water''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and public education/notification to the targeted, sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population. A PWS authorized to comply under this option would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to supply customers with ``Alternative Water'', defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either bottled water which has been monitored or certified to be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with all EPA MCLs, or water treated by point-of-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (POU) or point-of-entry (POE) devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interest of reducing costs and maximizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility, the proposal allows for unique means of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four options are being proposed for public comment. The lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option requires provision of alternative water to both transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults (travelers and new residents) and infants. Two variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the lead option require provision of alternative water to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants only. These two options differ only in the content of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public notification. In one case, only infants are considered at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk, and temporary diarrhea is considered as only an inconvenience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adults. In the other, both adults and infants are considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at risk, but public notification is deemed sufficient protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adults. Because the lead option and its two variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent a significant change in regulatory approach, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered another, more conventional option. This fourth option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would enable systems to seek a variance from the sulfate MCL. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a condition of receiving a variance, systems would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide alternative water to their target populations, just as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lead option. The only difference is that the relief for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems would be provided through a different statutory mechanism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also considered limiting compliance to central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, which would be consistent with the approach for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants, but which would not provide flexibility for smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency expects that approximately 1,500 of the 2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected systems would choose the lead option (Option 1) if it were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to them. The annual cost to those systems is estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be $7 million. The Agency has conservatively assumed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining 500 systems would choose central treatment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regionalization in spite of the availability of Option 1. The cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those systems is estimated to be $71 million. Total national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of Option 1, including $8 million for State implementation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring costs, is $86 million. If central treatment were the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only means of compliance with the sulfate rule, the annual national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost would be $147 million (household costs ranging from $244 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $811). Household costs for Option 1 range from $106 to $287 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, but this is an average of all households in all systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including those choosing central treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to reduce the cost of this rule even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further, the Agency is giving serious consideration to variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Option 1. These variations, described as Options 2 and 3, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require public notification/education, but would only require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs to infants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difference between Options 2 and 3 is that Option 2 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target only infants as being at risk from an adverse effect, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 3 would target both adults and infants, but would propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that public notification/education is sufficient protection for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults. The Agency sees advantages and disadvantages to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative options, which are discussed later in this notice. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost for either option would be $16 million, which includes $8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million for State implementation and monitoring costs. Household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs for these two options would be from $2 to $145 per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also considered Option 4, which would achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same result as Option 1, but with different administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures involving a variance from the sulfate MCL. Under Option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4, the regulation would specify that the conditions for States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant a variance from the sulfate MCL would include the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements described for Option 1, namely public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification/education and Alternative Water provisions. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements would be defined as BAT only for the purposes of Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1415 of the SDWA. The Agency believes that the unique nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sulfate health effect warrants a more flexible perspective on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementation of the Act. The Agency recognizes that while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transitory nature of the diarrhetic effect of high-sulfate water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be uncomfortable and inconvenient for healthy adults, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential risk to infants of diarrhea, as well as the dehydration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and electrolyte imbalance which may be associated with it, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant and potentially fatal if untreated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2(,0,),p0,8/9,i1,s25,r25 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Proposed MCLG and MCL for Sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Inorganic Contaminant  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Sulfate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed MCLG  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 500 mg/L1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed MCL  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 500 mg/L <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Best Available Technologies  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Reverse Osmosis (RO) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=4 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Ion Exchange2 (IE) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Electrodialysis (ED) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Analytical Methods3  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Colorimetry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=4 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Gravimetry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Ion Chromatography <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1An alternative MCLG/MCL option of 400 mg/L was proposed in the July 25, 1990 notice but is not proposed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 2For those systems with other anions that need to be removed (such as nitrate), the removal efficiency will decrease for those anions since sulfate binds more strongly to the exchange resin than other anions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 3Acceptance limits= <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 --> 15% at &ge;10 mg/L. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

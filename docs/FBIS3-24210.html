			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Laptev, Foreign Policy Association: </F> "Conference on Bosnian Conflict Needed"]    [Text] The process of reaching a settlement in Bosnia and  Herzegovina based on the principle of threat of use of force has  reached an impasse and constitutes the road to nowhere. The NATO  countries cannot go on threatening air strikes for years on end.  Nor can the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia live under  such a threat for years on end. Unfortunately, not even having  begun combat operations, military leaders in the United States  are already discussing the possibility of their expansion. UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and the NATO leaders have not  rescinded their threat--they have only postponed it. They are  not considering that in the event of air strikes in Bosnia, NATO  and the United Nations will turn into a warring faction. The  blue helmets will turn dark with blood, and the units wearing  them will be quickly swept aside by armed forces of Serbs,  Croats, and Bosnians--which might evoke a responsive reaction  from the NATO forces. Such a course of events could lead  inevitably to large-scale war in Europe.    It is clear that the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro,  and Croatia would be the primary victims of this. It is not  clear who would compensate for the material damage--many times  surpassing the scope of humanitarian assistance now being  extended to Bosnia.    Today like never before it is important to prevent  escalation  of the conflict in Bosnia into a European tragedy and to deny  NATO the right to determine when bombing and missile strikes  will be carried out in Bosnia. It is important that we urgently  begin to seek new approaches and ideas for achieving a political  settlement in Bosnia and, on the broader scale, in the Balkans.  As a minimum such a decision must be made by the UN Security  Council. It seems that a conference must be convened to this end  under the aegis of the United Nations to attain a settlement in  the former Yugoslavia. The initiator of such a conference could  be Russia and other Slavic states that support even contacts  with all sides in the Bosnian conflict. Such a conference could  give all republics of the former Yugoslavia the opportunity to  participate in it on an equal basis and preclude the possibility  of a situation arising where decisions would be made behind  their backs and be imposed on them by outsiders. It is also  important that all permanent members of the UN Security Council  participate in the conference.    In the event accord is reached with respect to convening  this  conference, the preparations group need not be limited to  international representatives David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg, whose positions reflect the pro-West, pro-NATO  orientation, but should include representatives from Serbia,  Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia, as well as the ethnic  minorities of these republics. The group could include Russia,  Greece--as the neighbor of the Yugoslav republics, and  Bulgaria--as a Balkan Slavic country. The preparatory work of a  broad-based group could help convene the international  conference in a more favorable environment than that in which  negotiations have thus far been conducted.    Conflict in the former Yugoslavia has been ongoing for about  two years and no end is in sight under the current development  of events. Conference preparation with participation of the  Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians themselves should help reduce the  tension. Negotiations can and must replace military operations.    The time has come to establish in Russia the Committee of  the  Russian Community To Facilitate a Political Settlement in Bosnia  and Herzegovina, with the participation of representatives of  political parties, social movements, and Slavic organizations.  This committee could also facilitate the search for a settlement  through the establishment of unofficial contacts between  representatives of the sides in conflict. This too could yield  great dividends.</p>

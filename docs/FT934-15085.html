			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price consolidated yesterday following Monday's move above Dollars 360 a troy ounce. At the London close it stood at Dollars 361.15 an ounce, up 90 cents on the day. But analysts warned that the market was nervous and lacked clear direction, making it just as likely to slip back as to continue its current rally. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices surrendered early gains and the three months delivery position closed at Dollars 1,703.25 a tonne, down Dollars 5.25 on the day. Copper looked to be finding a range of between Dollars 1,680 and Dollars 1,720, dealers said, but continued to encounter profit-taking and hedge selling on rises. LEAD prices extended early gains as a breach of resistance at Dollars 395 a tonne triggered stop-loss buying orders. The three months price closed up Dollars 24.75 at Dollars 413.50 a tonne. Dealers said consumer interest, trade buying and short-covering had aided a recovery from the recent seven-year low of Dollars 372. COCOA prices continued Monday's rally during the morning, but in the absence of fundamental justification the gains were erased in the afternoon. Compiled from Reuters</p>

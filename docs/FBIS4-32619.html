			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "Jerzy Milewski, under </F> secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defense:  Poland-NATO Agreement Will Be Signed Soon; What Shape of the  Partnership?"]    [Text] RZECZPOSPOLITA is the first paper that has been able  to take a look at the document entitled "Individual Program of  Partnership between the Polish Republic and NATO" (IPP)--that  is, the agreement on mutual military and political cooperation  resulting from the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program.    The document, which may be published only simultaneously in  Poland and the West, consists of 32 typewritten pages. It  includes a one-page political declaration; the following pages  contain details of various undertakings. The first part of the  IPP document recalls the declaration made at the NATO summit on  10 January of this year and the offer of the Partnership for  Peace, then the fact that Poland signed the so-called framework  document of the PFP on 2 February (general rules of  participation in the program). It is also recalled that our goal  is participation in the organization and the incorporation of  operational forces into the integrated military structure of  NATO. Therefore, we are ready to attain the capability for  joint operations and to adjust to the requirements of the  Western Armed Forces. In the second part of the document, all  intentions are marked with the symbols P1, P2, and P3. These  symbols denote the sequence of the implementation of the various  intentions. Each page is divided into six vertical columns:  Code, Areas of Cooperation (Goals of the Partner), General  Activities of the PFP, Type, Executive Instance, Remarks.    NATO has recognized the fact that the main Polish priority  in  cooperation with this organization is to ensure our country's  effective air defense, which is possible exclusively in a system  integrated with NATO. NATO has generally agreed that the issues  of the so-called three "C's" (communication, command, control  [preceding three words in English]--that is, the systems of  communication, command, and control) are the most important to  us, and it also wants to include them in the area of cooperation  with Poland.    According to Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in the  Ministry of National Defense [MON], who has all along been  responsible for the shape of the agreement with NATO, an  agreement that was proposed by NATO at the January summit  meeting and that is now at the final stage of negotiation, the  final agreement will not differ, at least basically, from the  joint decisions that have already been made.    The IPP will be accepted any day now, certainly before the  visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Poland (6 and 7 July).  Poland was the first country to present NATO with the so-called  presentation document (25 April), in which it specified its  priorities for cooperation (after the so-called framework  agreement, containing general rules and plans, was signed on 2  February). Now it will be the first country to sign the IPP  with NATO. It will be of symbolic significance to both us and  the "16." To us, because we stated already a long time ago that  our strategic goal is to join the Euro-Atlantic security  structures, and to them because they perceive Poland as a  country that is determined to join NATO.  <H5>  We Are Setting Off Without an Umbrella </H5>   When they started negotiating IPP, Poland and NATO had  relatively little cooperation experience; however, there were no  serious problems in the friendly atmosphere in which the talks  were held, stressed Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in  MON, in an interview for RZECZPOSPOLITA. We were able to draw  on bilateral agreements--that is, on undertakings that were  planned earlier by Poland and the individual NATO member states,  such as the joint exercises with the Dutch, the British, and the  French. Also, we could take advantage of the contacts within the  framework of the North-Atlantic Council, which existed until the  end of 1991.    In its presentation document, Poland listed its wishes and  proposals in 40 points. NATO experts codified them in a method  practiced in contacts among the member states of the "16." They  marked them with appropriate symbols, letters, and numbers. As a  result, the entire IPP document, except for the one-page  preamble, consists of tables.  <H5>  There Were No New Ideas </H5>   Then negotiations started (on the level of officers of both  sides), the goal of which was to explain the various points.  "During these talks," Milewski emphasizes, "NATO did not have  any new concrete ideas; however, the organization's intentions  for cooperation with us became increasingly clear."    NATO's negotiators wanted Poland to do the following:     -  Agree to use the principle of clarity in the activity of  the Armed Forces--that is, agree to introduce the fundamental  standards that would make the planned activity predictable for  all partners.    -  Agree to democratic control over the Army  (exercised by elected civilian authorities).    -  Be able and ready  to take part in UN peacekeeping forces because peacekeeping  missions are currently becoming the basic type of military  activities and of preventing destabilization in the world.    -  Be  able to take on peacekeeping, rescue, and other types of  operations thanks to joint defense planning and exercises.    -  Make  clear its intentions concerning its future cooperation with the  organization.     Poland accepts all these conditions.    Jerzy Milewski underscores that Poland's participation in  the PFP is subordinated to our strategic goal, formulated two  and a half years ago: full membership of Poland in NATO. This  is why Poland declared in the IPP that it will incorporate all  of its operational forces into the military structures of NATO,  even though we were only expected to double our participation in  peacekeeping missions. Poland will take measures that may help  us incorporate our own Army in the NATO structure: The  commanding staff of our Army will cooperate with the  various--land, air, naval--commanding staffs of the joint NATO  forces in Europe and with the combined task forces [preceding  three words in English], which are being established by NATO  right now.    Cooperation with NATO would consist of the following:     -  The beginning of permanent consultations concerning the  defense policy.    -  Communication between our General Staff and  SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe) and AFCENT  (Allied Forces Central Europe).    -  Installation of technical means  of communication (mainly digital communication, coding  methods).    -  A striving to adjust the Polish Air Defense and  incorporate it in the integrated NATO system (which in the West  is at least 50-percent automated). Poland mainly wants to get  access to the air reconnaissance system.    -  Adaptation of the  command procedures and all other procedures, such as signs on  maps and methods of commanding (in NATO, there are approximately  2,000 signs that codify their procedures).     The IPP envisions various individual undertakings that are  supposed to help achieve these goals.  <H5>  In Entirety or in Part </H5>   According to Milewski, we must strive for a situation in  which both all our Armed Forces and smaller formations (such as  one corps, three divisions, two battalions) can be used--in  cooperation with NATO. Contrary to what it seems to be, the  second possibility may be more difficult to implement because  the isolated units must be able to operate on their own, must be  well equipped and mobile. Later at least some Polish airfields  and martial ports should be adjusted to Western standards; in  addition, appropriate supply needs should be satisfied--for  example, fuel characterized by appropriate parameters.    Minister Milewski believes that cooperation with NATO should  develop "step by step." As a result of concrete minor  organizational and technical measures, as well as greater  undertakings, the Polish Armed Forces should be considered to be  adjusted to NATO requirements, adjusted to cooperation so that  all or part of those forces could be commanded by international  commanders, should a NATO summit decide to launch a military  operation.  <H5>  Under the Name PFP </H5>   Cooperation within the framework of the PFP is practically  under way. Before that, even before an agreement is reached, the  planned undertakings have already begun--under the name PFP.  From the formal point of view, the first joint undertaking will  be international exercises of the peacekeeping forces, which  will be conducted on the firing ground near Zagan in September.  Participating in it will be 400-500 U.S. Army soldiers, soldiers  from other Western countries and from Poland and some  Central-East European states. Because NATO is the one that  issues an invitation, the possibility cannot be ruled out that  the Russians will also come to Zagan. Soldiers will use only  light personal arms.    Central-East European states unofficially inform each other  about their negotiations with NATO. Individual programs of  partnership will not be secret. It will be possible to review  these documents every year.  <H5>  Without Political Protection </H5>   The question whether the IPP is satisfactory to Poland  evoked  many words that were critical of the entire PFP; Jerzy Milewski  told us that two aspects should be distinguished in this  program. The first concerns so-called temporary guarantees; the  other pertains to a long-term program of full integration with  Western structures. The PFP was rightly criticized as a program  that would not give us any political protection from pressure on  the part of the Russian Federation, the goal of which is to  leave Poland and other Central European states in the gray zone.  This pressure caused anxiety among the people. Because the  pressure did not encounter a counterreaction from the Western  states, the entire situation began to be increasingly similar to  Yalta. If we were offered membership in NATO or at least some  form of association with the organization, political protection  would be expected. Full integration into NATO is not possible  right now. It calls for an adaptation process, as a result of  which our defense structure would be adjusted to the NATO  structure. This should make our future membership real, not  only formal. We look upon the PFP as a mechanism to help  integration into NATO, and, from this standpoint, it can be  considered sufficient.    Jerzy Milewski stresses that Poland should make efforts to  be  admitted to the NATO structures gradually. The political  integration might be made right now; military integration,  because of the necessity of defense planning and adapting the  Army, would take some time. The example of Spain, which signed  six agreements on gradual integration before it was actually  admitted to NATO, shows that gradual integration is possible.</p>

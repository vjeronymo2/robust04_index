			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CSUN EXPO GEARED TO MAKING PEACE  </P> <P> Adults can learn about apartheid and the arms race, and children will be  invited to write a rap song about peace at a conference this week at Cal State  Northridge.  </P> <P> The Peace Expo -- scheduled today through Saturday -- will feature  non-competitive games, a dance, films about the homeless and nuclear weapons,  and discourses on subjects from wife beating to Soviet leader Mikhail  Gorbachev. Participants will be allowed to camp on the Sierra Quad lawn on  campus during the event.  </P> <P> The object of the conference is to demonstrate how a more peaceful world can be  built, said Carol S. Kelly, a child development professor at the university and  director of the International Institute for Violence Prevention, which  organized the event. The institute, formed in 1986, consists of 200 Cal State  Northridge teachers, students and community members who are working to develop  peace topics in the university's curriculum, Kelly said.  </P> <P> "We didn't want just another conference," she said. "We can't afford just to  look at what we don't want -- we don't want spousal abuse, child neglect,  nuclear annihilation. We have to look at moving to what we do want."  </P> <P> For instance, organizers said, participants will be asked to submit written  reports on their visions for the future -- a clean planet or a world without  political borders, for instance. The reports are to be presented to the United  Nations next year.  </P> <P> The $20,000 to run the expo, which organizers predict will draw 2,500 people  during its three days, comes from donations, Kelly said. The events will be  free and will be held at the Student Union.  </P> <P> For children, games are scheduled such as "hug tag": You're "it" if you are  tagged while not hugging somebody, and the hugging limit is four seconds per  person, said Jack Foley, associate professor in leisure studies and recreation.  </P> <P> Even college students have a lot to learn about peace, said expo student  coordinator Lisa Sherwood.  </P> <P> "People my age are so much into 'What am I gonna do . . . ? How am I gonna make  money?' " and don't feel "connected to foreign policy and global decisions."  </P> <P> Sherwood will be on a panel discussing student involvement in such movements as  the French Revolution and U.S. civil rights.  </P> <P> Other panels will feature students from England and Argentina discussing the  Falklands/Malvinas war. The university debate team will argue the pros and cons  of gun control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 55 Community Groups  </P> <P> About 55 community groups will offer workshops or information booths, including  the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, Survivors of Physical and Emotional  Abuse as Kids, the California Vegetarian Assn., Gray Panthers of the San  Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, the War Resisters League  and the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Keynote speakers include the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., a longtime peace  activist; Stanley Sheinbaum, an organizer of the Americas Watch Committee of  Southern California and one of five American Jews who met in December with  Yasser Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, and author Riane  Eisler, who wrote "The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future," a book  about societies throughout history in which men and women have been equal  partners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Willing to Listen  </P> <P> There are no scheduled speakers who believe that a strong military is the route  to peace, but people with that opinion are welcome at the expo, Kelly said. "We  have to be open to listening to them. We're trying hard to understand each  other's position."  </P> <P> The expo will also feature workshops on date rape, domestic violence, gang  violence, racism and the environment.  </P> <P> "We hope each person who comes -- children, youths, adults -- will leave not  only with more information and resources, but leave feeling empowered to . . .  do at least one thing to make a better world and make a difference," Kelly  said.  </P></p>

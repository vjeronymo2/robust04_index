			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: GPA suffers further ratings downgrade GPA Group, the financially-troubled Irish aircraft leasing company, has suffered a further downgrade in ratings by the Moody's agency. About Dollars 1.8bn of debt has been downgraded to Caa from B1, which was already in the speculative rather than investment grade. Moody's said the change reflected the uncertain outcome of the company's financial restructuring negotiations with aircraft manufacturers, lenders, and shareholders. It was concerned that efforts to restructure GPA financially could be jeopardised if shareholders failed to come up with Dollars 200m in new equity, or if new shareholders were not found to fill the gap.</p>

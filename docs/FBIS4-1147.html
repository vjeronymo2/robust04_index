			<p>BFN     [Text] President Eyadema yesterday afternoon received  separately the two leaders of the democratic opposition, Edem  Kodjo of the Togolese Union for Democracy and Yaovi Agboyibor of  the Action Committee for Renewal. After his audience with the  head of state, Edem Kodjo told correspondents that he had been  tipped for the post of prime minister:    [Begin recording] [Kodjo] The head of state has just honored  me by naming me prime minister. I express my gratitude not only  to him but to the Togolese people, and to all those who enabled  us to win a parliamentary majority in order to build a growing  force in our national political life. I think it was time to  settle this problem of premiership. That situation was  endangering the parliamentary majority and this should not have  been so. Also, it was necessary to act quickly so that our  country does fall behind others. We must quickly tackle the  country's economic revival, national reconciliation, and social  peace. [Words indistinct] future action of forming a  government, a task which we must tackle now. We must set up a  government now.    [Unidentified correspondent] What is your first message for  the Togolese people?    [Kodjo] I congratulate them. I want to express my gratitude  to them and to comfort them because they have suffered a lot. We  must comfort them now. We must [words indistinct] settle down to  solve the main issues. Our youths have a challenge to meet.  Our women, farmers, active forces of the nation, and workers  must all get mobilized. Our employers association must also  participate in the task of reviving the country and its economic  development. I think our country now wants to escape the  situation in which it has found itself to chart a new course  which must guarantee peace, stability, and security. The people  must be confident in themselves. They must help us and I think  we shall move forward. [end recording]</p>

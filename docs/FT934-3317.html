			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Even the most optimistic expectations were confounded by the reception accorded to yesterday's gilt auction. Last minute US demand was cited as one factor but, whatever the reason, cover of 2.19 times and the concentration of bids around the average accepted yield of 6.51 per cent indicates strong underlying demand. Without that, the market would certainly have reacted badly to yesterday afternoon's Pounds 1.2bn tap stock announcement. It looks therefore as though international investors are moving quickly to reassess gilts after last week's budget. The UK is, after all, one of the few industrial countries which can offer a background of low inflation, some economic recovery, declining short term rates and a sharply falling government borrowing requirement. That might give gilts some immunity from any further setbacks in the US bond market. Yesterday's taps will further reduce new issue volume next year and add to the prospect of shortage on which the market thrives. Yet there is limited headroom for yields to fall. The shortest dated paper is already trading below 5 per cent. The market could become impatient if the next rate cut is delayed. And it still requires an act of faith to lend 25-year money to the UK government at just 6.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Salvadoran  polling stations opened at 0700 local (1300 GMT) today so 2.5  million voters can decide which, either the rightist candidate,  Armando Calderon Sol, or the leftist candidate, Ruben Zamora,  will be the next president of the Republic.    More than 1,000 foreign observers, most of them from the  United Nations, are attending the procedures. In addition, some  6,000 police are watching over this run-off election, which will  close at 1700 local (2300 GMT).    The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was severely  criticized  for irregularities in the first round held on 20 March, in the  past few hours assured the people that the electoral machine was  operating smoothly. The leftists, however, have warned of the  danger of "another fraud" in favor of Calderon Sol.</p>

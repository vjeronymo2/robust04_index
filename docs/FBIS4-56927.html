			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has  said the placet for the new U.S. ambassador to Panama will be  issued this week.    The foreign minister has said the advancement of diplomatic  relations with the United States is vital for the transition  period that will lead to the handing over of the Panama Canal  during the year 2000.    Mulino has said the placet will be given to the U.S.  ambassador to Panama who will replace Deane Hinton, most likely  Robert Pastor.    [Begin recording] [Mulino] I think it is most important to  maintain close relations with the United States during the  coming five-year period. I think President-elect Perez  Balladares will need that. This is a fundamental task. Once  they assume the government, they will see the task involving the  canal issue is huge and requires much tending; because of this,  President Endara and I will evaluate this appointment on 12 May.    [Ortega] How is the transition for the Foreign Ministry to  the next government progressing?    [Mulino] Yesterday, I personally called my successor, my  great and good friend Gabriel Lewis Galindo, who has confirmed  to me he will be the next foreign minister, to put my working  team, our experience, and our cooperation at his disposal so  that when he takes over the Foreign Ministry on 2 September he  may routinely go to work ignoring nothing about the  international negotiations we are conducting or the integration  processes in which we are engaged with Colombia and Central  America.    I will also give him certain recommendations, in writing, on  the canal issue and on the modernization the Foreign Ministry  requires, modernization we have been unable to make due to  economic limitations.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- Vladimir Kazimirov, roving  ambassador of the Russian Foreign Ministry, and Morteza Bank,  director general in the Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed deep  concern over the sharp escalation in military activities in  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Russian-Iranian talks on settling the Karabakh conflict have  taken place in Moscow. The sides expressed particular disquiet  at the growing scale of combat actions, their worsening severity  and the increasing bloodshed, which is intensifying the inhuman  nature of the conflict.    As ITAR-TASS was told at the Department of Information and  the Russian Foreign Ministry press center, both sides noted that  the increasing internationalization of the conflict represents a  great danger to the cause of peace and regional stability. It  carries the threat of a major conflict with unpredictable  consequences for the region and for the whole world.    During the consultations it was acknowledged that only by  relying on peaceful political means and on the capability of the  sides to reach a sensible reciprocal compromise will it be  possible realistically to lay down a firm and long-term basis  for a settlement. The Russian side stressed that the main  priority is to reach an immediate cease-fire, the cessation of  all combat actions, and the conclusion of an agreement on this.    The sides confirmed their conviction that it was possible  and  essential to reach a bloodless political solution to all the  problems of the conflict exclusively by peaceful means,  including the liberation of territories, the restoration of  transport and power links, and the return of refugees.    The participants in the consultations noted that Russia and  Iran support the efforts of the world community to settle the  conflict. Russia and Iran are in direct proximity to and have  interests in achieving a settlement of this conflict and they  have frequently put forward initiatives toward reaching a  peaceful resolution and they are continuing their efforts and  maintaining constant contact with each other.</p>

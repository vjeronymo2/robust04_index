			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Time to try a tracker fund? TRACKER funds have until now offered the simplest way to lift the 'load' of unit trust charges, writes John Authers. They do this by removing one of the biggest expenses - the cost of active fund management. Tracker funds make no attempt to 'beat' bench-mark indices. Instead, they use complicated quantitative techniques to mirror the performance of the index as closely as possible. In some cases this just means 'replicating' the index by buying holdings in every share in the index (in the correct proportions). Others carefully choose a basket of shares which have in the past shown a tendency to track the index, with occasional adjustments to reflect changes in index weightings. Once established, a good part of the management of an index fund can be left to the discretion of the computer. In the UK, this means that annual management charges are significantly lower than on other trusts. For example, Gartmore and James Capel both only charge 0.5 per cent. Leaders in the field so far include James Capel and Legal &amp; General, both of which now have strong quantitative teams, and Gartmore. Initial charges tend to be up with the industry's average - for example, James Capel charges 5.25 per cent at the front end, while Legal &amp; General charges 5 per cent. However, Gartmore's front-end load is well below the average - 3.75 per cent - and its chairman Paul Myners does not rule out lowering this further if the group's costs can justify it. Nobody, however, seems to view tracker funds as a route to US-style 'no load' funds. Rather, they are viewed as an aid to portfolio management - individuals or institutions can guarantee that a substantial ballast of their portfolio will mirror the index, and then rely on 'satellite' investments to add value. Michael Hayden of L&amp;G says: 'We believe they are building blocks for independent financial advisers. They are core holdings to give you exposure to the market as a whole.' However, a big point in favour of trackers is that mainstream unit trust performance currently looks dismal. They are trying to beat the indices, but conspicuously failing to do so. This makes the lower management fees of index funds look much more appealing.</p>

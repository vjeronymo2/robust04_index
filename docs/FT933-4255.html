			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nikko Kyodo in plan to restructure US subsidiary NIKKO Kyodo, the Japanese mining and oil refining group, plans to restructure Gould, its US electronics subsidiary and the world's largest manufacturer of copper foil, which it bought five years ago for Dollars 1.1bn. Nikko will liquidate Gould and its stock holding company, Nippon Mining US, and transfer Gould's operations to two new companies it will set up in the US. The move by the Japanese company, which was formed in December last year through the merger of Nippon Mining and Kyodo Oil, reflects difficulties in turning round Gould. Gould, which was acquired by Nippon Mining, has suffered a downturn in its main businesses and run up heavy debts. Nikko Kyodo will book an extraordinary loss of Y90bn (Dollars 865m) due to the liquidation of the company. As a result it has revised downwards after-tax profits to Y4bn from Y33bn. The company's shares yesterday fell 6 per cent to Y510. The US company has had problems with its semiconductor and defence electronics businesses for a number of years. Nippon Mining has invested about Y100bn in Gould which has chalked up recurring losses of Dollars 440m and debts of Dollars 890m. Nikko will set up Gould Electronics to take on Gould's copper foil and fuses businesses and Gould Instruments to carry on its measuring instruments operations. The Japanese company said that it had not changed its view that Gould's businesses were crucial to group long-term strategy.</p>

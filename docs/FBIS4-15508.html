			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Russian independent  television analytical programme Itogi focussed on stabilisation  of relations between the country's executive and legislative  branches of power last week.    The fundamental meaning of the concept of national accord  consists in establishing specific rules of the game between the  political leaders represented in the bodies of state authority.  The short-term aim is to reach stabilisation of relations  between the president and the two chambers of the parliament.  The latest clash between the two branches of power occurred  over the Federation Council's decision not to release Aleksey  Kazannik of his duties as Russia's chief prosecutor, as decreed  by Yeltsin earlier. The results of the vote on the decree  revealed that for the first time since it was established, the  Federation Council declared its independent role, dispelling the  image of a pro-president chamber, the Itogi host said. Some  people regarded the incident as another clash between the  legislature and the executive. The president's representative  in the chamber Aleksandr Yakovlev expressed the hope that the  upper chamber would return to the question again, and Aleksey  Ilyushenko will remain the acting chief prosecutor until then.    Commenting on the situation, the presidential aide Grigoriy  Satarov said in an interview with Itogi that many  interpretations were prompted by political concerns. The  vestiges of the old confrontation between the president and his  extreme opponents were instrumental in this case, he said. A  small part of the political forces is not interested in  political and economic stabilisation which would be a poor  background for them in the forthcoming elections. In appraising  the chances of the parliament's approval of the presidential  draft accord on civic peace in Russia, Grigoriy Satarov said the  chances are fairly high and he did not see any serious obstacles  to the approval of the document before the proposed deadline,  April 28. [passage omitted]    Itogi interviewed lower chamber speaker Ivan Rybkin, an  ardent supporter of the national conciliation concept. As  concerns the approval of the presidential call for peace and  concord in society, Ivan Rybkin stressed that there are forces  in the Duma which can rally in order to achieve peace, concord  and success of reforms. About his own political future, Ivan  Rybkin declared he had never thought about running in the  presidential elections in 1996. "But when I see many of those  who nominate themselves for presidency, I know firmly after many  years here that it is a heavy burden to bear and I understand  that many of them will be simply crushed by this burden, the  presidential duties, in the very first days. They should be  more circumspecting and abstain from such actions the burden is  too heavy and it is not for every man to bear". The realisation  of the idea of national concord presupposes a definite  representation of all major political forces of Russia in the  parliament, the host said. Paradoxically, the radical  reformers, who controlled much of the power in Russia until  recently are probably experiencing the most difficulties in the  State Duma. Last week the Russia's Choice coalition lost one of  its leading figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis left the ranks of the  faction of which he was one of the founding fathers. Burbulis  said in this connection that the country has radically changed  lately and Russian society needs new political approaches, and  added that he was planning to create a new political party for  representatives of the private capital, who were not welcomed to  Russia's Choice.    Commenting on the promotion of the presidium leader Sergey  Shakhray to vice-premiership, Itogi stressed that Shakhray's  party, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, now has two  vice-premiers in the government, more than any other political  coalition.

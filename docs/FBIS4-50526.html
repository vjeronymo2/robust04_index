			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP)--Beijing moved quickly  Wednesday to rule out any possibility of South Africa extending  dual recognition to China and Taiwan. "We are against any form  of dual recognition," a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would  not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria  switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing.    The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked  the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to  tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese  spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable  to Beijing. "We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two  Chinas, or one China one Taiwan," he said.    China refuses to permit countries with which it has  diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded  as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the  island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the  mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any  country which switches formal recognition to Beijing.    Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity  are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this  year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's  struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously  refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria  until the country's apartheid system had been completely  dismantled. "We believe that relations between China and the  new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the  future," the spokesman said.    In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links  with South Africa which were suspended in 1960.    Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29  countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years  launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia  -- to cement ties with other governments.</p>

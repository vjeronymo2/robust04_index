			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Murdoch seeks stake in Chinese magazine MR Rupert Murdoch is negotiating the purchase of a substantial shareholding in Better Life, a Shanghai-based lifestyle magazine. According to the Chinese official Business Weekly newspaper, News Corporation - Mr Murdoch's master company - is discussing the purchase with China's State media and publication administration. Mr Hu Xiaosheng, editor-in-chief of Better Life, told the paper Mr Murdoch's bid was 'highly likely' to be given the go-ahead, but that the Chinese government would probably insist on retaining 51 per cent to ensure control over editorial policy. The Chinese government has recently loosened its grip on magazines and newspapers. Should the talks prove successful, Mr Murdoch would become one of the few foreign joint venture partners in the Chinese media. A successful bid for Better Life could serve to ease disappointment over problems Mr Murdoch faces with a HKDollars 1.85bn (USDollars 239m) bid for 22 per cent of Television Broadcasts of Hong Kong. The bid has met stiff resistance both in Hong Kong and China. Officials maintain that a large foreign holding in the Hong Kong TV station could lead to erosion of local content and flavour. Mr Murdoch already controls Hong Kong's top English-language newspaper and a large Chinese-language daily in the colony. Economic reform in China has brought with it an explosion of popular tabloid-style newspapers and magazines, though they remain subject to scrutiny by the Communist party's propaganda department. With 800 new publications approved by March this year, China now has around 1,700 daily newspapers and about 7,000 periodicals. Circulation of such stalwart party organs as the People's Daily have been falling rapidly in recent years.</p>

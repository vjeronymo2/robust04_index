			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Irfan Ljubijankic, foreign  minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has praised Egypt's role and  participation in the peace-keeping force in Sarajevo. He noted  that any Arab and Islamic troops operating within the UN forces  would be welcomed by his country, particularly after the  withdrawal of some European troops from Bosnia. Ljubijankic  expected peace keeping troops from Pakistan, Malaysia, and  Turkey to arrive in Bosnia.    Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the  nonaligned foreign ministers' meeting currently being held in  Cairo, Ljubijankic added that Bosnia had been reluctant to  accept a comprehensive cease-fire for fear that the Serbs might  use the truce to legalize their occupation of Bosnian territory  and impose a fait-accompli by force. He pointed out that  Bosnia's acceptance of the European peace plan is conditional on  ascertaining that the refugees who fled war-stricken Bosnian  cities would return home. He added: Their return is one of our  main conditions for accepting the plan. Their return would mean  a rejection of the tendency to acquire territory by force, he  added, noting that the return of Muslim refugees to their homes  would solve the problem.    Asked about the prospects for the survival of the federation  between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, he said that there are  cooperation and long-standing common interests between the two  sides, even if there is no love lost between them. He noted  that this federation is a new development in the Bosnian war  that has been proposed by the United States, and it is a good  idea. He added: We have prepared everything on paper, but what  counts is the actual implementation on the ground.    On his expectations about the chances that peace may be  established in Bosnia in what is left of 1994, the Bosnian  foreign minister said that officials would be happy if peace  were achieved by the end of the year. But he expressed his  belief that it is hard to persuade Serbia to conclude a peace  agreement because its policy is based on the annexation of  territory, and it is very difficult for the Serbs to give up  this policy. He added that he hopes to meet with a reasonable  Serbian official with whom he could talk. Noting that peace can  be achieved with any degree of justice, he ruled out the  possibility of achieving peace during this year.    The Bosnian official praised the efforts of the Nonaligned  Movement in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He  added that in the future his country will seek to gain full  membership in the movement, noting that it is attending the  current conference as a guest.</p>

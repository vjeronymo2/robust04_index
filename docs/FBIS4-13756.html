			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpt of "secret memorandum" obtained by AL-MUHARRIR from </F> the Yemeni Foreign Ministry, date not given]    [Text] AL-MUHARRIR has obtained the text of a secret  memorandum from the Yemeni Foreign Ministry revealing the true  dimensions of the conflict, the position of the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP], the role of some Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin  in fomenting the inter-Yemeni conflict, and its oil objectives.  The memorandum reveals facts and puts some YSP leaders in the  prisoner's dock.    The following is part of the verbatim text of the  memorandum,  a copy of which was made available to AL-MUHARRIR:    Apparently, great progress has been made in relations  between  the YSP and Saudi Arabia. There is much information about this  issue. We have included the important parts in our memorandum to  you No. 91, dated 23 February, following the important visit by  YSP leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid to Saudi Arabia on his way home  from Jordan.    Pursuant to our instructions, and as is customary in dealing  with such kind of political developments, a number of our aides  have held several contacts and meetings with various parties.  They have reached a conclusion including the following elements:    1. The progress made in relations between the YSP and Saudi  Arabia constitutes a success for the great behind-the-scenes  action of a number of Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin from  the Hadhramaut area. "It should be noted here that the Saudi  Embassy in Sanaa was not aware of these relations." These men  are affiliated with rich financial institutions, and have a  strong desire to invest in the southern parts of Yemen and to  impose economic control, through their interests, on these  areas. They have found the current circumstances in Yemen and  Saudi Arabia an appropriate opportunity. On the one hand, they  seek to satisfy the royal family in Riyadh by weakening the  position of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on whom the Saudi  regime seeks to take revenge due to his position during the Gulf  crisis, and later his position on the demarcation of the  Saudi-Yemeni borders, which the Saudis termed as inflexible and  unyielding. On the other hand, this wealthy group believes that  the current YSP leaders constitute the best group of men to deal  with, especially since they were able to tighten their control  on the southern areas of Yemen, and engaged in a big conflict  with President Salih and his aides in Sanaa.    2. The thing that contributed to the success of these  Saudi businessmen's efforts is that their Yemeni origins,  particularly from Hadhramaut, are congruent with the  affiliations of the most prominent YSP leaders. YSP leader 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister [Haydar Abu-Bakr] al-'Attas, and  Aden Governor Salih al- Siyali, who is very close to al-Bid, are  all from the Hadhramaut region. The Saudi businessmen seek to  involve the YSP deeper in the current conflict in Yemen even if  this leads to the separation of the southern areas from the  country as was the case before the Yemeni unity in Mayo 1990.  If this turned out to be difficult, then, at least, the  separation of Hadhramaut would be alright, along with the  establishment of an independent state in it after annexing the  al-Mahrah area similar to the other Gulf states, especially  since the recent exploration of oil has encouraged such  ambitions. We do not yet have sufficient and confirmed  information about the YSP leaders' readiness to deal with this  plan. There are only some signs and unconfirmed information  about strong inclinations to respond to this plan by both  al-'Attas and Salih al-Siyali. (It should be taken into  consideration that in the case of such countries, personal  inclinations of some strong political leaders can have a great  impact on the general policy, particularly when there are  adequate financial capabilities to support these inclinations).    3. The Saudi regime is exerting strong pressures and clearly  encouraging the separation of south Yemen from north Yemen. The  regime is supported in this regard by some Kuwaiti rulers. The  reason here is self-explanatory and needs no further  justification. These parties pin more hopes on the position of  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his role in achieving the separation plan  than on the YSP itself.    4. It has recently been noticed that undeclared large Saudi  aid has been flowing to the officials in the southern areas.  The powerful Aden Governor Salih al-Siyali is the coordinator  of these relations. He enjoys powers that go beyond the powers  of any other governor. What attracts many people's attention is  that al-Siyali spends money lavishly. It has become clear that  the greatest part of these expenditures does not come from  government sources; something which proves that the source of  these funds is the secret Saudi financial aid.    5. The group from the southern Hadhramaut region exploits  its current presence in the YSP leadership to escalate the  Yemeni crisis in order to separate south Yemen and to establish  an independent state. This issue has become a source of concern  for the other YSP leaders some of whom are from northern areas.  They began to realize that the Hadhramaut group has deceived  them and involved them in this. For this reason, signs of an  internal conflict began to appear, a conflict which is expected  to escalate. Surprises are not ruled out.</p>

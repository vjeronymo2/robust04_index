			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;368] </RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;6 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. for operation of Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2 (ANO&hyph;2) located in Pope County, Arkansas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would delete requirements to perform the full complement of steam generator surveillances as outlined in the Technical Specifications (TSs) when the steam generators are subjected to special inspections that are in addition to inspections that are required by the TSs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 1_Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change has no actual impact on any previously analyzed accident in the final safety analysis report (FSAR). A double-ended break of one steam generator tube is postulated as part of the ANO&hyph;2 design basis accident evaluation. The change permits Entergy Operations to determine the appropriate scope and expansion criteria for special steam generator tube inspections that are beyond the scope of the augmented inservice inspection program included in the TSs. The augmented inservice inspection program contained in the TSs is not being modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Design Criterion 14 of Appendix A of 10 CFR 50 states: ``The reactor coolant pressure boundary shall be *&blank;*&blank;* tested so as to have an extremely low probability of abnormal leakage, of rapidly propagating failure, and of gross rupture.'' The proper scope and expansion criteria for special steam generator tube inspections are determined such that the requirement of the general design criterion will be met. Additionally, special inspections utilize calculations of minimum acceptable wall thickness per the guidance of Regulatory Guide 1.121, ``Basis for Plugging Degraded Steam Generator Tubes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change does not modify any parameter that will increase radioactivity in the primary system or increase the amount of radioactive steam released from the secondary safety valves or atmospheric dump valves in the event of a tube rupture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative corrections made to correct inconsistencies introduced in previous TS amendments do not affect reactor operations or accident analyses and have no radiological consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 2_Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident From Any Previously Evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of this change does not establish a potential new accident precursor. The design basis accident analyses for ANO&hyph;2 include the consequences of a double-ended break of one steam generator tube which bounds other postulated failure mechanisms. The proposed change would permit determination of alternate inspection criteria for special inspections which are in addition to the inservice inspections required by the TSs. The equipment used in special inspections would not affect any plant components differently than those used for TS required inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The corrections made to remove inconsistencies introduced in previous TS amendments are administrative and do not change the design, configuration, or method of operation of the plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 3_Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously stated, a double-ended rupture of one steam generator tube is accounted for in the ANO&hyph;2 design basis accident analysis. Safety margins to detect and repair tube defects prior to rupture are reflected by the 0.5 GPM primary to secondary leakage limit stated in the ANO&hyph;2 TSs and the minimum acceptable wall thickness criteria included in Regulatory Guide 1.121. As stated in the ANO&hyph;2 TS Bases, cracks having a primary to secondary leakage less than the 0.5 GPM limit during operation will have an adequate margin of safety to withstand the loads imposed during normal operation and by postulated accidents. Considering that special inspections are in addition to the inservice inspection program defined in the ANO&hyph;2 TSs, that the scope of special inspections are determined taking into consideration General Design Criteria 14, and that leakage detection capability is not being modified, the exemption of special inspections from the requirements of the augmented inservice inspection program does not significantly reduce the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other administrative changes do not reduce TS operability and surveillance requirements, and, therefore, do not reduce any margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

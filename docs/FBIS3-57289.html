The Senior Officials Committee met in Tallinn on Jan. 20-21.    A final decision on establishing the new commissioner's  institution with the Council of the Baltic Sea States must be  made by the council's foreign ministers at conference to be held  in Tallinn in May, said Mare Kukk, the head of the Estonian  coordination bureau of the council.    Kukk said the new office was designed as an expert  institution to consult the council's member countries,  coordinate the activities of human rights organizations and  inform the international community about the human rights and  minority rights situation in region.    The commissioner will not engage in resolving conflicts,  Kukk  added.    The draft of the commissioner's mandate was approved by the  senior officials in September.    The budget of the new office, established at about 270,000  German marks, is much smaller than that of the CSCE High  Commissioner for Human Rights and Ethnic Minorities. Expenses  will be covered proportionally by all members of the council  according to the size of the country.</p>

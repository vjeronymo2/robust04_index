			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, 20 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) --  Hebei Province is one of the regions seriously plagued by iodine  deficiency. Since last October, the authorities in the province  have adopted firm measures to rectify the salt market. So far,  they have outlawed 187 contraband salt markets and effectively  halted the once-rampant selling of inferior and iodineless salt.  The general public can now enjoy regular salt, which sets their  mind at ease.    Iodine deficiency is known to cause congenital problems,  such  as imbecility, dumbness, and sterility. Hebei is a major  producer of sea salt, yet iodine deficiency is quite common  there, and it is one of the most seriously affected regions in  China. The population in the province's affected areas is a  high 26.55 million. In recent years, owing to such factors as  loss of control over the production of edible salt and loose  management, large quantities of inferior and iodineless salt  have reached the consumers via contraband salt markets,  expanding the use of iodineless salt and causing the incidence  of deficiency cases in the affected areas to show a renewed  upward trend.    To safeguard public health, Hebei Province set about  organizing a specialized campaign against contraband salt  trafficking last October. The supply and marketing  cooperatives, industrial and commercial administration bureaus,  public security authorities, and salt management departments  cooperated closely with each other, plugged the source of such  salt and intercepted its flow, imposed stern sanctions on  saltworks engaged in illegal transactions, and firmly outlawed  contraband salt markets. So far, the authorities in the  province have handled more than 10,400 cases of contraband salt  trafficking and have confiscated 39,157 metric tons of  contraband salt.</p>

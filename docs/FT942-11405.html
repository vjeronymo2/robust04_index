			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (16): Patchy co-ordination a hindrance - Regional efforts to promote trade abroad have gained some ground but duplication and rivalry between the various national and local bodies need to be tackled / Using regional networks, France Twelve years of decentralisation in France has given regional authorities and agencies an important role in promoting overseas trade. Although this strategy has undoubtedly brought success, it has been played out against a backdrop of patchy co-ordination verging in some cases on chaos. Two reports commissioned by industry and trade minister, Gerard Longuet, and due to be published soon will call for a greater synergy between the different national and regional bodies to try to halt duplication and rivalry. 'We have no time to waste as we have a lot to do to catch up with the Dutch, the Germans and the British,' says Thierry Bernard, general manager of Entreprise Rhone-Alpes International (Erai). Recommendations in the report will include drawing up a new national export charter to follow the first five-year one which expired on March 14. It is not difficult to see how lapses in co-ordination can occur, considering the profusion of agencies involved in trade promotion. They include the regional governments or councils themselves; separate development agencies financed totally or partially by the councils; and chambers of commerce and industry and trade associations working nationally and regionally. That is quite apart from an array of national organisations and the 160 offices in French embassies abroad that promote companies. In spite of the shortcomings, however, the various efforts of the organisations seem to have paid off. Small and medium-sized enterprises, with payrolls of between 50 and 500 employees have not previously been active abroad, but they have gradually increased their share of French exports from 21.1 per cent in 1984 to 26 per cent in 1992. Moreover, one of the bright spots in the French economy today is the trade surplus. This reached a record FFr87bn francs in last year. Although this has been achieved partly through a fall in imports, it is generally acknowledged to be due also to the improved competitiveness of French firms. Even so, the whole question of the role that the regions play in trade is sensitive. The independence of the regions and instances of over-spending or even mis-spending have raised questions about whether the move to decentralise has not become out of hand. Several of the 22 French regions have structured their efforts to ensure that those involved co-operate at all levels. These examples include Aquitaine, Nord Pas-de-Calais, Ile de France, Provence-Alpe-Cote-d'Azure, the Pays-de-la-Loire and Lorraine. The wealthy Rhone-Alpes-region is one of the most dynamic in promoting French enterprises overseas. It was the first to open its own offices abroad and now has a total of nine, in Barcelona, Brussels, Milan, Montreal, Shanghai, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Toronto and Turin. London and Atlanta may be next, but not before 1995 at the earliest. The days when general market studies and lists of addresses were enough to equip firms in their search for overseas business are gone, says Erai's Mr Bernard. 'Now we have to adopt a customised approach. 'We can no longer look through a trade prism, but must sell a company abroad. This has become the only means of survival since France went into recession.' Since Mr Bernard took up his post in 1991, Erai has helped 209 companies start operations outside France and in 1993 helped firms sign FFr37m worth of contracts in China alone. This was out of a total of FFr75m worth of contracts for the region and is explained by the high proportions of expensive heavy industrial deals in China. For Maurice Baudoux, deputy general manager of the Nord Pas-de-Calais Regional Development Agency, the aim is to help small and medium-sized enterprises learn how to operate abroad, whether by exporting, transferring technology, appointing commercial agents, or entering into co-operation agreements. The autonomy of the region gives France 'at least equality' with other decentralised competing nations, such as Belgium and Germany. The chambers of commerce and industry also play a key role in helping French companies to expand abroad. As public agencies, they have greater resources at their disposal than their counterparts in countries such as the Netherlands, where the chambers are financed entirely by the public sector. Excluding staff at Delphes, the largest French language data base in the world, the 183 French domestic chambers have a total of 500 experts operating abroad and are backed up by 69 chambers in 50 other countries, information centres peppered across France and 147 language training centres. Organised trade missions are fewer these days than in the past, now that smaller French firms have become more accustomed to working in other countries, according to Annie Arsaut-Mazieres, international economic relations director of the Assemblee des Chambres Francais de Commerce et d'Industrie. But meetings are organised regularly by zone to ensure that all efforts are going in the same direction, she says.</p>

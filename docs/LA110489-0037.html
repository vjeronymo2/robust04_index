			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT THAT POWERFUL?  </P> <P> The Joe Eszterhas/Michael Ovitz flap ("How One Letter Has Divided Hollywood,"  Oct. 30) certainly has divided my feelings. I can't decide who is more  ridiculous: Ovitz, whom the film writer accuses of saying, "You'll never work  in this town again" . . . or Eszterhas for believing him.  </P> <P> GENE FARMER, Northridge  </P></p>

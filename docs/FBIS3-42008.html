The manufacture of chemical weapons ended in the former USSR  back in 1987. Nonetheless, Russia has inherited 40,000 tons of  lethal fluids and gases. These are the biggest stockpiles in  the world. The convention stipulates that by the beginning of  the next century virtually no chemical weapons stockpiles will  remain. Currently preparations for the destruction of these  weapons are under way. The coordination of the efforts of  ministries and departments has been entrusted to the Committee  for Convention Problems.    [A. Kuntsevich, chairman of the Committee for  Convention Problems Under the Russian President, identified by  caption] The expenditure involved runs into trillions. We  expect that in the course of the talks between Boris  Nikolayevich and Bill Clinton important accords will be reached  on problems of U.S. participation in specific areas of our  program for the destruction of chemical weapons.

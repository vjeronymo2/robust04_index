			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Management: Time to use a little help from abroad - More British companies are inviting foreign directors to join their boards Wanted: international high-fliers with strategic vision, energy, commitment. Preferably continental European or American US nationals, must be prepared to visit UK for 12 board meetings a year. Successful candidates will get rare insight into the running of UK companies. About Pounds 15,000 a year plus expenses. The call has gone out: foreign non-executive directors are being sought by British companies. The markets for British products have long been international, and the markets for British shares are becoming increasingly so. But until recently British non-executives had been selected from among the chairman's golfing friends, fellow citizens to the last. A few British companies have had big-name foreigners on their boards for some time. Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, joined the board of Pilkington 10 years ago. Charles Price, the former US ambassador to London, sits on the boards of British Airways and Hanson. ICI has no fewer than three foreigners on its board: Paul Volcker, the former head of the US Federal Reserve Board, Tom Wyman, who is also a director of General Motors and AT&amp;T, and Ellen Schneider-Lenne, a director of Deutsche Bank. The trend is now gathering pace. Last week Rank Organisation took on its first foreigner with the appointment of James Harmon, chief executive of the US bank Wertheim Schroder. Rank had become aware that its increasing turnover from the US did not tally with its all-British board, and sent Schroder, its merchant bank, to recruit a suitable American. A few days earlier, Budgens, the small British supermarket chain, gained a foreign heavy-weight in Hans Reischl, chief executive of Rewe, the large German food retailers. Reischl, whose company has a stake in Budgens, plans to use his position on the board as a listening post - to get first-hand knowledge of the British market. Whitehead Mann, the headhunting firm, has recently surveyed the top 100 British companies and concluded that in the foreseeable future 84 per cent of big public limited companies will have at least one foreign national on their boards. Of the companies surveyed, 40 per cent already have a foreign non-executive  -half of those executives have been taken on in the last two years - and a further 44 per cent are planning to recruit one. Of the existing foreign directors, Americans are slightly more plentiful than Europeans, whereas Japanese are still rarities. However, this balance is changing. According to the survey, 60 per cent of companies are looking to Europe to fill the next slot on the board. The motivation for taking on foreign directors is shared by most companies: nearly all said they hoped to gain a more international perspective or a fresh insight into a particular region. Those who have already hired their foreign directors seem happy with the result; more than half of those asked were very pleased and none was disappointed. Yet finding the right person may be a slow process, as Grand Met found out when it completed a 14-month search before coming up with German management consultant Gertrude Hohler. One problem is the commitment of time required of non-executives. British boards meet about three times as often as those of US companies or the supervisory boards of German companies. Foreigners have further to come, although this difficulty can be overstated. 'It is quicker to get from Paris to London than from London to Norfolk,' comments Bruce Rhodes, a director of Pro Ned, the organisation set up to promote non-executive directors. Indeed, the Whitehead Mann survey showed that attendance by foreign nationals was no worse than attendance generally. Rhodes also argues that language is not the barrier it is believed to be, as the sort of people with a suitably broad perspective to make them possible candidates are likely to be able to speak good English anyway. More of a problem is that non-executive directors in the UK have the same legal responsibility as executive ones. This is particularly a concern for American candidates, who are unlikely to take the position unless the company takes out special insurance for them. If the company has business in the US such cover may be expensive. Busy foreign executives may also be concerned that the matters discussed at the meetings are too routine and time-wasting. 'The guys don't worry about jet lag - but they may be worried that the board meetings are too operational, and are not the best use of their time,' says Ian Butcher of Whitehead Mann. To get around this problem, many UK companies are setting up international advisory boards. Such boards may consist of two or three international heavy-weights who meet the chief executive and perhaps one or two other board members twice a year in assorted locations to discuss global strategy. While foreign directors are in demand by British companies, the same does not seem to be the case for British directors and foreign companies. This is partly because the board structure in some countries does not invite outsiders. In Germany, for example the supervisory board is made up of representatives of the workforce and shareholders. The US as a bigger country can perhaps afford to be more insular, and if it wanted help from foreigners the UK might not be its first point of call.</p>

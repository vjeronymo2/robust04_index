			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Tensions rise as Savimbi returns to guerrilla base MR Jonas Savimbi, the hard-line leader of the Angolan rebel movement Unita, left the capital Luanda yesterday, increasing fears that the country might return to civil war. His politically symbolic departure for Huambo - the southern provincial city where he launched his pre-independence guerrilla struggle in 1975 - came as efforts continued to save Angola's peace process. Unita claims that the ruling MPLA's victory in the war-shattered country's first democratic elections was fraudulent. For 10 days, Mr Savimbi has been in virtual isolation at a villa in a hilltop suburb of Luanda and has refused to meet all international observers, including those from South Africa and the US, his former backers. Last Saturday, he alleged the elections had been rigged and made a veiled threat to plunge the country back into conflict. This week, former Unita generals withdrew from the newly unified Angolan armed forces. Western diplomats in Luanda have said that, if Mr Savimbi went to Huambo, that would considerably increase fears of a return to violence and distance Mr Savimbi further from negotiations to keep the peace process alive. Huambo is the stronghold of Mr Savimbi's Ovimbundu tribe and a strategic point if he means to launch a military challenge to the MPLA led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Mr Savimbi made Huambo his military base in 1975 for his failed attempt to march on Luanda, with the backing of 5,000 South African troops. Mr Nirberto de Castro, a senior Unita official who confirmed Mr Savimbi's departure to Huambo, said last night: 'We do not want war but we do not fear it.' Other Unita officials tried to downplay Mr Savimbi's departure, saying that he was going to consult his Unita colleagues and was escaping Luanda, where he feared for his life. 'War is not the only option,' said Mr Jardo Muekalia. 'There are many options we will pursue before we would even consider going back to war. Nobody wants to fight again.' Western observers were unsure whether the guerrilla chief was trying to turn up the heat as a way to force the government to make concessions on the elections and on power-sharing, or whether he was making tentative plans for a return to civil war. Angola's government said yesterday that Unita was welcome to join a government of national unity if it accepted electoral defeat. The offer was made in Lisbon by Mr Pedro van Dunem, Angola's foreign minister. The conciliatory move came as the United Nations Security Council agreed to send a committee of representatives of member states to Angola to join international efforts to shore up the peace process. There was no response from Unita to the offer and, despite Mr Savimbi's departure, Unita officials in Luanda continued to work in four committees set up by the National Electoral Committee to investigate the movement's allegations of fraud. As a concession to Unita, the announcement of final election results has been postponed to the beginning of next week, after the investigation is complete. Official returns more than 90 per cent complete show President dos Santos leading Mr Savimbi by 50.8 per cent to 38.8 per cent.</p>

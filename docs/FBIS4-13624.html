			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baghdad, 21 Apr (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister  Tariq 'Aziz has said human rights are being abused by certain  governments for political purposes to further their own  interests.    'Aziz's remarks were made at the third session of the  Baghdad  International Symposium on human and women's rights and ways to  cope with challenges. He said the sanctions targeting the  women, children, and the elderly of Iraq amount to a gross  violation of human rights. The sanctions, he pointed out, were  passed as a political decision by George Bush under known  circumstances, and under U.S. control of the United Nations and  the UN Security Council.    'Aziz reviewed the advances Iraq made in the seventies in  the  areas of education, health, and social welfare for women and  children. He emphasized that these advances can be supported by  statistics and international agencies and were achieved despite  the iniquitous embargo that has covered all aspects of life.    The deputy prime minister called for a rethink of the  sanctions resolutions that deprive an entire people of food and  medicine and restrict international trade. [passage omitted]</p>

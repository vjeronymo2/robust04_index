			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Surveyors do not make the ultimate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision, which is why only a draft of the statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies is available to the facility at the time of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exit conference, if at all. The statement of deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reviewed by the State survey agency which makes the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope and Severity Scales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble to the proposed rule, we requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public comment about how the severity scale levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were described as well as assigned. We specifically asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for comments on the proposed construction of the severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale whereby deficiencies at a severity of 3 or 4 can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the same sanctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received in response to this section have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been included and addressed under &sect;488.404 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned elsewhere in this document, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of commenters expressed concern that HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency may decide to conduct an extended survey at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time for any reason. One of the reasons for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern is that, under regulations at &sect;483.151(b)(2)(iii),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which expressly reflect the statutory requirement, when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility undergoes an extended (or a partial extended)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey, it automatically loses approval of its Nurse Aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training and Competency Evaluation Program (NATCEP) for 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our response to that particular comment was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated earlier in this preamble under our discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended surveys. However, there is a closely related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy we would like to address here that goes beyond NATCEP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescission as a result of an extended survey. There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other circumstances described at &sect;483.151(b)(2) that also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trigger a 2-year prohibition on NATCEP. It has been our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy that the remainder (if any) of a 2-year prohibition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on NATCEPs also applies to a new owner when the provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undergoes a change of ownership as defined in &sect;489.18(a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. The implicit basis for this policy has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d) of &sect;489.18, which states that an ``assigned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and to the terms and conditions under which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was originally issued&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy was explicitly set forth in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 48894) on September 26, 1991, as well as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Operations Letter 91&hyph;75. The latter reads in part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, ``a facility subject to the prohibition on [NATCEP]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training remains subject for two years after the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triggering the prohibition regardless of the change of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership.'' While we have been consistent in this policy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have been reexamining it within the larger context of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafting these regulations. We have been reexamining all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our policies and regulations concerning remedies to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they are consonant with the fundamental purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies, which is to motivate providers to come quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into compliance with program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we spoke to the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions, saying in part that our intent is to ``deter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations as well as encourage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> immediate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (emphasis added)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response and sustained compliance.'' If the new owner of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider must wait for the expiration of the remainder of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-year prohibition of NATCEP that was imposed on a previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner, regardless of any action he or she may take to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct the deficiencies that triggered the prohibition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-year prohibition on NATCEP would be unlike other remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As soon as a new owner corrects the noncompliance that led  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the imposition of any other remedy, the remedy can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifted. The exception to this is that when a facility has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had a denial of payment imposed against it for repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care or has been placed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management, in addition to achieving substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, it must demonstrate to HCFA's or the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfaction that it will remain in substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

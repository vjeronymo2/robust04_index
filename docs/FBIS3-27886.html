Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's North America bureau chief,  said his Ministry had just received from the U.S. State  Department a letter officially confirming Kim's permanent  residenceship application.    The U.S. Government said the immigration and naturalization  office would make the final decision on Kim's application  because it falls under the office's responsibility.    It is hard at the moment to tell when the office will start  examining Kim's application and when it will finish the  examination.    Kim's application was for permanent residenceship, and not  for political asylum, Chang quoted a U.S. Government official,  who handed the State Department's letter to the Ministry, as  saying.    The U.S. Government promised a maximum cooperation in  dealing  with Kim's permanent residenceship application, stressing the  issue is not a matter of political consideration, Chang said.    Asked about Washington's decision to shelve Kim's  application, Chang said the U.S. Government is not in a hurry to  take action on this matter.    The government has earlier asked the U.S. Government not to  permit Kim's permanent residence on the ground that he is wanted  in Korea in connection with the irregularities related to the  military modernization program.</p>

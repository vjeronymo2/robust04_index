			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION SATURDAY  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard and the Ventura Regional Sanitation District are sponsoring  a household hazardous waste collection on Saturday for Oxnard residents who  would like to dispose of pesticides, paint thinners and other chemical waste.  </P> <P> The waste will be collected from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Oxnard Equipment Yard,  1060 Pacific Ave.  </P> <P> Acceptable items for disposal include poisons, corrosives, furniture and auto  polish, varnishes, pool chlorine, acids and wood preservatives.  </P> <P> John Zaragoza, refuse superintendent for the city's Solid Waste Division, said  people should not dispose of those items in their regular trash cans.  </P> <P> "We have had refuse operators who have gotten hurt when acid splashed in their  faces," Zaragoza said. "Those materials also contaminate the landfill sites  when they seep through the soil into aquifers."  </P> <P> The collection-day crews will not accept materials that can be recycled at the  Bailard Landfill, such as oil- and water-based paints, used motor oil,  antifreeze and automobile batteries.

In a communique, the PGR reported that during the  operation--one of the most important carried out in  Mexico--authorities confiscated heroin that could have been sold  on the U.S. black market for $20 million.    The communique added that five foreigners and three  Mexicans,  including a Postal Service employee who was used as a liaison to  send the drug from Thailand to California, were arrested.    The report added that the drug was camouflaged in bottles of  shampoo and soap and transported from Asia by Thai citizens  Seachao Vern Chieng, Phan Saeng Vern, Vang Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou  On, and Seaphan Aecho, all of whom have been arrested.    Mexican citizens Maricruz Barrera and Armida Aldaco, who  were  hiding suitcases containing 42 kg of pure heroin inside a  closet, were also arrested.    The PGR also arrested Alfonso Romero Verdugo, head of the  Mexican Postal Service in Ensenada, who was accused of receiving  money from the presumed drug traffickers to use that office for  drug shipments.    The source said that the eight detainees are confessed  criminals, and they will be sent to the corresponding  authorities to face charges for various crimes against health.</p>

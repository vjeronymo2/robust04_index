			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Debtors can claim for BCCI set-off MS FASHIONS LTD AND OTHERS v BANK OF CREDIT AND COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL SA Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice Scott): May 22 1992 JOINT DEBTORS under a charge to an insolvent company in liquidation can proceed against it to ascertain whether the set-off of mutual debts as between one of their number and the company under the Insolvency Rules is effective to reduce their joint net liability. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by prospective plaintiffs, MS Fashions Ltd, MS Fashions (Wholesale) Ltd and Mr Mohammed Sarwar, from Mr Justice Millett's ex parte decision refusing them leave to bring proceedings against the prospective defendants, Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA and joint administrative receivers of the companies appointed by BCCI under a debenture. An appeal against the judge's refusal to restrain the receivers from continuing in control of the companies' affairs and assets was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said that since 1980 the two companies had been customers of BCCI and had borrowing and overdraft facilities. BCCI had taken security. Each company gave a debenture to BCCI, and cross-guaranteed the other's debt. In addition, security for the companies' debts was given by Mr Sarwar and his brother by a charge of property in Leeds. Under the charge the two companies and Mr Sarwar and his brother, defined together as 'the principal debtor', covenanted with BCCI to pay 'all moneys and liabilities . . . due, owing or incurred' by them to BCCI. The effect was to render each of the four parties included within 'the principal debtor' jointly liable for the monies and liabilities. Mr Sarwar had some Pounds 300,000 on deposit with BCCI. Under a letter of charge dated December 9 1985 he charged the sums standing to his credit with payment of the companies' indebtedness to BCCI. On July 5 1991 a provisional winding-up order was made against BCCI. On November 12 it made demands for payment of the sums owed by the two companies. It demanded Pounds 135,981 against MS Fashions and Pounds 433,964 against Wholesale. It demanded against each company the sum for which demand had been made against the other company. It demanded also that Mr Sarwar and his brother paid each of those amounts. So there was a comprehensive demand against each of the potential debtors for the total indebtedness owed by the two companies. The effect of those demands was to transform what might previously have been only a contingent debt into a present debt. On January 14 1992 a winding-up order was made against BCCI. BCCI was heavily insolvent. Those to whom it owed money could expect only a dividend. There was no defence available to the companies or Mr Sarwar in answer to their obligation to pay the total Pounds 569,945 odd demanded by BCCI, save under rule 4.90 of the Insolvency Rules 1986. Rule 4.90 provided that where, before a company went into liquidation, there had been mutual debts between it and a creditor claiming to prove in the liquidation, 'the sums due from one party shall be set off against the sums due from the other'. Mr Driscoll for Mr Sarwar contended that the set-off operated as at date of winding-up. He said the effect of rule 4.90 was to diminish the debt owed by Mr Sarwar to BCCI from the initial figure (Pounds 600,000 as a round sum) leaving him as a debtor to BCCI in the net amount of Pounds 300,000. It was contended that Pounds 300,000 was the only sum he owed to BCCI and which the companies owed to BCCI. On that footing the companies and Mr Sarwar desired to discharge the indebtedness and redeem the debentures. Mr Pascoe for BCCI contended that it was not open to the companies to take advantage of the set-off. It was not disputed that the effect of rule 4.90 was to reduce Mr Sarwar's indebtedness but, it was said, the two companies remained indebted in the full amount. If that was so, BCCI was entitled to claim the full Pounds 600,000 from the companies and then became accountable to Mr Sarwar for the Pounds 300,000. But Mr Sarwar's recovery in respect of that sum would be limited to the dividends payable in the liquidation. Those contentions treated the operation of rule 4.90 as if it were a matter of election by BCCI whether or not to invoke the set-off. BCCI could not be required, it was said, to set off the Pounds 300,000 against the debt owed by the companies. That was the view that attracted Mr Justice Millett. He said release or discharge of a surety did not discharge the principal debtor, and it followed that BCCI could if it wished release the guarantee and still enforce its security in full, notwithstanding that it had already demanded payment from Mr Sarwar. He said BCCI was not bound to release the surety. It might proceed in any order it chose. It might enforce its security against the principal debtor before seeking to enforce the guarantee for the balance, if any. It was correct that release of a surety did not discharge a principal debtor. Nothing but payment did that. Also, BCCI could, if it wished, release the guarantee and still enforce its security against the companies. But that was not the point. It was plain enough that payment by the surety not only released the surety, but also discharged or reduced the principal debtor's liability to the creditor. The set-off effect of rule 4.90 in reducing Mr Sarwar's liability corresponded to payment of a corresponding amount made by Mr Sarwar to BCCI. If that was the right analysis, operation of the set-off reduced to Pounds 300,000 the debt for which both the principal debtors, and the surety, Mr Sarwar, were liable to BCCI. Rule 4.90 could not properly operate unless it operated in reduction of the debt owing to BCCI for which, at date of liquidation, the principal debtors and the sureties were all liable. If it did so operate, all that was left for BCCI whether against the principal debtors or the sureties, was the balance of the original debt. Leave should be granted to Mr Sarwar and the companies, to seek a declaration that the amount of the debt which they owed BCCI had been reduced by operation of rule 4.90 to the extent of the sum standing to Mr Sarwar's credit in his deposit account with BCCI at the date BCCI went into liquidation. If on the hearing of the application BCCI or the receivers thought of other arguments or found other authorities which invalidated the present conclusions, it was open to them to employ them. His Lordship simply dealt with the matter for the purpose of leave and on the basis of conclusions which seemed at the moment to be impelling. With regard to the application for an injunction to restrain the receivers from acting in the receivership, though the court had not seen the debentures under which they were appointed, it was common ground that even if on the set-off point the companies and Mr Sarwar were correct, they owed Pounds 300,000 to BCCI. They had not paid. There could therefore be no challenge to the validity of the receivers' appointment. The security held by BCCI entitled it, following the demand for payment and in the absence of payment, to appoint receivers. It was well-established that unless a mortgagor debtor had tendered the sum owing to the mortgagee creditor, the mortgagee creditor remained entitled to exercise whatever remedies the security provided. The appeal against Mr Justice Millett's refusal of the injunction was dismissed. the appeal against his refusal of leave to bring proceedings was allowed. LORD JUSTICE WOOLF gave a concurring judgment. For Mr Sarwar and the companies: Michael Driscoll QC and Francis Tregear (Zaiwalla &amp; Co). For BCCI: Martin Pascoe (Lovell White Durrant). For the receivers: David Marks (Dibb Lupton Broomhead &amp; Prior).</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: KISS THE CILANTRO FOR ME  </P> <P> There are thousands of restaurants in L.A., including a few five-stars and an  abundance of others whose collations require ketchup poured over them before  the food is considered edible. Even the custard pudding needs help.  </P> <P> I eat mostly at little Italian places on the corner, where a nameless red house  wine is served in chipped glasses and one suspects the pasta may have been an  uneaten portion off someone else's plate.  </P> <P> I got used to chowing down like that in Oakland, where a food establishment is  considered gourmet if nothing on the plate moves. Members of the Oakland A's  still dine at such eateries, which results in a pathological condition that  obviously impedes athletic performance.  </P> <P> I mention this to stress that my background does not include the kind of  training that would prepare me to write about food. I either like what I eat or  I don't, whether it is foie de veau prepared by Wolfgang Puck or chili over  eggs by Mama Consuela.  </P> <P> Which is why I was somewhat surprised to receive a letter from Carlos Haro,  owner of Venice's Casablanca restaurant, that began, "Dear Mr. Martinez. As a  food and dining expert, you. . . ."  </P> <P> It was an invitation to judge a new gourmet dish Carlos had created. Since I  had never been asked to discuss anything I ate, I said to my wife, "I smell a  column." She said, "Poor Carlos."  </P> <P> It was a new experience. We found ourselves among people who could actually  tell the difference between a clam and an oyster. There were restaurant critics  not only from L.A., but from Mexico and Japan.  </P> <P> They nibbled at their food and then smacked their lips ever so slightly, as  though throwing baby kisses to the air. Then they'd look off to the middle  distance, savoring the subtle tones of tangy sauces.  </P> <P> "Isn't that beautiful?" I said to Cinelli, watching them baby-kiss, then either  nod in approval or make those squinty little faces food experts make when they  aren't sure. "They're such cute little buggers."  </P> <P> "You've learned something new," Cinelli said. "Now you can baby-kiss after your  Big Macs."  </P> <P> Carlos' new creation was something called an enchiLaCa. It's meant as kind of a  hip Mexican joke, see, like the "La" stands for L.A. and the "Ca" means  California. Hence, enchiLaCa.  </P> <P> It's called that, Carlos explained, because L.A. people like to try new things,  and also some enchiLaCas are filled with vegetables, which L.A. people like  very much.  </P> <P> At least that's what I think he said. Carlos has been up from Mexico only a few  years, and doesn't speak good English.  </P> <P> And since I don't speak Spanish at all, there was something of a communication  problem.  </P> <P> For instance, it took five minutes for us to work out that "angreliants" meant  ingredients, as in they are composed of very selected angreliants.  </P> <P> It took even longer to learn one of the enchiLaCas was filled with chayote. It  is a tropical vine off of which grows a grotesque squash-like thing.  </P> <P> "Is good," Carlos explained, "but skin is look ugly."  </P> <P> "If you didn't drink martinis," Cinelli whispered, "you'd know what he's  saying. Look at the food experts, they're only sipping a little champagne. It  keeps their taste buds happy, but sober."  </P> <P> Casablanca's decor is fashioned after Rick's Place in The Famous Movie of the  same name, although its specialty is Mexican food with angreliants. A star of  the evening was 75-year-old Dan Seymour, one of the last of the actors who was  in "Casablanca."  </P> <P> Dan is a big-bellied man who played the Arab guard at Rick's. He tells terrific  stories about Bogart and the others, some of which last longer than the movie  itself.  </P> <P> One of the stories was about Ingrid Bergman riding a camel, or maybe it was a  giraffe. Dan began telling the story during the soup and was still telling it  when the food critics were baby-kissing the dessert.  </P> <P> We were at the same table with David Westheimer, an owlish little Texan who  wrote "Von Ryan's Express" and "My Sweet Charlie," among other best sellers.  </P> <P> I guess he's something of a gourmet, which is why he was invited. He said the  food was terrific, they didn't have things like that in Houston.  </P> <P> You can bet your royalties on that. I've been to Houston and know for a fact  that many of their chefs were trained in Oakland.  </P> <P> The food experts gave the enchiLaCas high marks. You could hear their taste  buds singing vivacissimo in three languages as they left.  </P> <P> I said to Cinelli as she drove us home, "I really liked that stuff."  </P> <P> "Good," she said, "that will no doubt appear in subsequent ads. 'I really liked  that stuff' -- Al Martinez, Gourmet-in-Training.' It's a shame you don't  baby-kiss."  </P> <P> I'm working on it.  </P></p>

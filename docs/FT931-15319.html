			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / American South puts emphasis on new skills: Barbara Harrison looks at moves to switch from manufacturing to service industries IF INVESTING in people is a central tenet of the incoming Clinton administration, it will come as no surprise to the American South. As an Arkansan, the roots of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic perspective are embedded in the South's experience: a region that, sooner than the rest of the nation, has bumped up against the barrier to economic growth that poor skills and low productivity represent. For many years, cheap labour and low production costs drew American companies southward from the north-east and Midwest. But, as global competition has toughened, these lures no longer catch enough fish. The developing countries have dramatically outbid the US South on labour and enticed away unskilled manufacturing jobs. 'We cannot compete with low-cost labour in other parts of the world,' says Mr Moncure Crowder, chief economist at the Atlanta-based Wachovia Bank. The prime example of this shift is in the textile and apparel industry, which, even with modern equipment, is still labour intensive. While textile and apparel companies continue to lead in manufacturing employment in the south-east, the industry lost 271,000 jobs between 1970 and 1989, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Many of these jobs went abroad, and the prospect that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) could bring further erosion of such jobs has many southerners worried. The threat is worse given that the region's manufacturing jobs account for nearly 25 per cent of employment compared to 17 per cent nationally, according to Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. The region's job base could further be hit by defence spending cuts. The axe could fall on both the South's many military bases - which during the second world war gave the region its first big economic impetus - and local defence industries. The region's politicians are trying to shift from a manufacturing-based low-skill economy dependent to a services-based economy more reliant on knowledge. At the recent annual meeting of the Southern Growth Policies Board, a regional think-tank, West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton said: 'If you keep doing things the way you're doing them, you'll keep getting what you've got.' Although the South has prospered during the Sunbelt boom of the last 20 years, it is still behind in incomes and living standards. In the crescent of 12 states from West Virginia to Florida and across to Arkansas, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that average per capita income is only 89 per cent of the national average. Southerners maintain that there is no mystery why this is so: although economic and social conditions in the 12 states vary considerably, the region has higher levels of children in poverty, adult illiteracy and inadequate public education. In many states, between a third and a half of first-year university students need remedial education. 'In education, we're still scraping along the bottom,' says Mr Jeffrey Rosensweig, an economist who studies the region at Emory University's business school in the Atlanta area. On the other hand, the tide of skilled workers from other parts of the US attracted by the Sunbelt boom has helped fill the labour demands of new and expanding businesses. For example, in Atlanta, the region's business and financial capital, an estimated 60 per cent of its 3m people are not native to the city. And, despite the region's being hit by the 1991 recession, it's appeal - warm climate, relatively low cost of living, high personal income growth - persists, particularly along the dynamic Atlantic seaboard. Foreign investors have felt the pull of the South's low wages and relative absence of unions. UK, Japanese and German companies have favoured the region since the 1970s, when the pervasive racism that marred the area abated. One out of four Americans who worked for foreign-owned companies at the end of 1990 was in the South, according to the BLS. Some analysts believe that foreign trade could be the next big impetus for the region's economy. Mr Wayne Gantt, an Atlanta economic consultant, believes that, while the Nafta accord could accelerate the demise of the South's low-cost manufacturing, it will bring many opportunities for businesses in services, telecommunications, trade and exports. However, others caution that, if the South does not raise the skill level of its workforce, these opportunities may go with the wind.</p>

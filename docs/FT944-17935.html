			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / France increases space budget France is sharply increasing spending on military spy satellites next year both as an example for its European partners to emulate and as a fall-back if they do not. France's planned 23.4 per cent increase in space expenditure to FFr5bn (Pounds 600m) next year, chiefly on the Helios I and II reconnaissance satellite programmes, is the most striking change of direction in the government's 1995 draft defence budget detailed yesterday by Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister. Out of a proclaimed desire to free France and Europe of dependence on US intelligence satellites as well as on military transport aircraft, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, last month urged fellow Europeans to join France in developing 'a true European space observation system', saying that he was counting particularly on German support. Regardless of this project, however, Mr Balladur forecast France would spend enough on the Helios programme, carried out in co-operation with Italy and Spain, to give it a spy satellite system of its own. Mr Leotard said yesterday this would come as early as next spring with the launch of the first Helios I satellite. The minister claimed that France and Greece were the only Nato countries raising their defence spending. In fact, the 1.5 per cent nominal increase in overall French military spending to FFr202.3bn next year is less than expected inflation of 1.7 per cent. But expenditure on equipment is to rise by 2 per cent to FFr102.4bn, constituting the slight increase in real terms to which the Balladur government is committed.</p>

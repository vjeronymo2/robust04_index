			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe's advance helped by acquisitions BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group, increased pre-tax profits by 5.8 per cent last year, helped by acquisitions and strong operating profits from its UK and US-based operations. The group lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 42.7m over 1992 on turnover ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 265.4m (Pounds 220.5m). Mr Colin McCarthy, finance director, said that about 9 percentage points of the turnover advance came from acquisitions, about the same proportion was attributable to organic growth and 2 percentage points reflected foreign exchange translation gains. Overall, he said, translation gains resulting from sterling's devaluation added about Pounds 900,000 to trading profits and would add about Pounds 5m in 1993 if currencies remain at current levels. Operating profits rose to Pounds 42.3m (Pounds 38.5m) while interest receipts fell to Pounds 381,000 (Pounds 1.8m). Operating profits jumped 36 per cent in the UK, were up 22 per cent in the US but fell 4 per cent in continental Europe mainly due to the German recession. Earnings per share increased to 15.36p (14.04p); a final dividend of 4.57p brings the total to 6.36p (6.04p). Commenting on the results, Mr Anthony Vice, chairman, said performance improved in the UK as a result of acquisitions and internal reorganisation, while in the US, higher profits reflected the beginnings of economic recovery. However, he noted that in Germany the growing impact of recession led to a slowing down of sales growth and lower margins in the second half, while the group's associate in Japan reported lower profits 'reflecting the general setback in that economy.' Among recent developments Bowthorpe has been building its specialist data acquisition and environmental sector business which now includes Penny &amp; Giles, the aircraft black box manufacturer, acquired for Pounds 30m last May, and Odessa Engineering which was acquired for Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m). Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said the group continues to search for new acquisitions. Although profits reported by Penny &amp; Giles were somewhat lower than the company had budgeted, Mr Westhead emphasised that short term economies from integration of the company proved greater than expected, and said the potential longer term benefits 'remain considerable.'</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS AND A COMMUNITY: THE IMPACT ON THE GAY LIFESTYLE IN LAGUNA BEACH  </P> <P> The article concerning Laguna Beach and AIDS was the worst piece of sensational  journalism I have ever read.  </P> <P> If the purpose of a feature article is to inform and educate, then you failed  miserably.  </P> <P> I am a person with AIDS and your article was an unfair representation of gay  people in Laguna Beach. To highlight a man who killed himself, to focus on a  sex workshop at Laguna Shanti, this is not what the gay community is about.  This article could have been written by the Rev. Lou Sheldon. This article was  not worthy of the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> MARK MOLONEY, Laguna Beach  </P></p>

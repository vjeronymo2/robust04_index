			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 30 (TANJUG) -- Russia's special envoy  and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is in Zagreb at the  start of a new mission aimed at settling the conflict in former  Yugoslavia. As announced in Moscow, Churkin is to meet with  members of the Croatian leadership in Zagreb on Monday to  discuss the implementation of a Russia-brokered agreement on a  cessation of hostilities between Croatia and the Republic of  Serb Krajina. They are also expected to discuss the situation  in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and other issues regarding the  settling of the conflict in former Yugoslavia.    On Tuesday, Churkin is expected to leave for Belgrade, where  he will meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to  discuss the finding of a settlement for the Bosnian conflict.    Churkin is in Zagreb and Belgrade on the eve of a meeting  scheduled for June 2-3 by U.N. special envoy for former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. The Russian envoy wants to check  once again Belgrade's and Zagreb's stands on the Bosnian crisis.  Over the past few days Churkin has on several occasions  criticized the Bosnian Moslems for their attacks on Serb  positions in Bosnia.    A ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry told the  Russian Interfax agency on Monday that special importance was  being attached to Churkin's current mission because it comes  after the failure of the meeting between the international  "contact group" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the representatives  of Bosnia's three warring sides.    The official said the declaration released at the Geneva  meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union, the  United States and Russia on the territorial division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the Bosnian Serbs should  get 49 per cent and the Croat-Moslem federation 51 per cent of  the territory of that former Yugoslav republic -- was still  effective.    Russian sources claim that such a proportion will most  probably be accepted both by the Croat and the Moslem side, but  the main problem will be the "quality" of the territories.    The Serbs, who are now holding 70 per cent of the territory  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are willing to give up a certain  percentage provided that they do not lose anything of "quality".</p>

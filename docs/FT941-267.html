			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (8): The Americans are coming  -Patrick Harverson discovers a dramatic change in US sentiment Viewed from the US, India is a country of enormous potential. Historically, however, the hostility of Indian governments to the free market and to the foreign business community has kept US companies and investors from seeking to take advantage of that potential. Now, after several years of a gradual economic liberalisation policy that has opened up Indian markets to foreign capital, US money is pouring into India in unprecedented amounts. Mr Anil Trigunayat, the commercial consul at the Indian Consulate in New York, says that US private sector investment in India between 1992 and 1993 exceeded the total amount of money invested by US companies in the previous 40 years. In the first 10 months of last year, for example, Dollars 800m was invested in India by US companies, and another Dollars 2.2bn was in the pipeline at the end of the year. By contrast, in all of 1990, Mr Trigunayat says, total US investment measured just Dollars 90m. As well as the host of giant blue-chip corporations which have long ties to India (such as Citibank, General Electric and IBM), scores of other big US companies have been moving into - or in some cases, returning to - India, through purchases of majority stakes in Indian businesses, or through the establishment of new ventures. According to Precision Sourcing International (BSI), a New York based consulting company which works with US companies in India, among those which have recently raised their interest in Indian companies to majority shareholdings are Colgate Palmolive, Whirlpool, Chevron, Pepsico, Procter &amp; Gamble and J Walter Thompson. Others which have set up joint ventures include Duracell, Goodyear, Mobil, and Alcoa. In the financial services industry, the Capital Group, Soros Fund Management, and Kemper have all created asset management businesses with Indian partners over the last year. Mr Richard Hedberg, vice president of J P Morgan, which has an investment banking joint venture in India, says interest in India has snowballed in the past two years. 'It started slowly, because everyone didn't know (what the reforms) meant, and you had a lot of left-over biases. Then, about a year ago, all at once a lot of US companies started increasing their minority ownerships to majority ownerships. Then you saw the snowball headed down the hill.' US money is flooding into India primarily because the government is opening up the domestic financial and consumer markets, albeit gradually. Mr Manu Bammi of PSI says: 'We have been involved in assisting US corporations in India since 1989, and have a witnessed a sea change in the economic and business environment. Rather than treat business as a necessary evil, the government sees business as a critical part of the solution of India's problems.' Mr Bammi's comments are echoed throughout the US business community, which applauds the economic reforms introduced in the past two years by the administration of prime minister Mr PV Narasimha Rao and his finance minster, Mr Manmohan Singh. 'Clearly the business climate has changed,' says Mr Neville Isdell, vice president responsible for Coca-Cola's operations in India. 'That is the direct result of the policies of the current government. They have really attacked the major areas that were holding back investments by international companies.' Mr Robert Eichfeld, head of Citibank's operations in India, where the company has a long-established consumer banking and corporate banking business, as well as a unit developing banking software, is equally upbeat about India's economic outlook, especially in the light of the February 28 budget presented by finance minister Singh. 'The feeling is that the reforms are now pretty much irreversible in terms of direction, no matter what might happen politically. This is the fourth reform budget in a row.' Interest in India among US companies is especially strong in the consumer goods sector, which is hungrily eyeing India's vast, well educated, increasingly prosperous middle class. In consumer goods, the impact of liberalisation was especially significant, because recent reforms mean that foreign companies can now sell their products in India under their own brand names. Coca-Cola, for example, has wasted little time in returning to India (it left with many other US companies in the late 1970s when the business climate turned hostile). Last October, the company relaunched the Coca-Cola brand in India, and a month later it bought the brands and trademarks of Parle, the biggest Indian soft drinks manufacturer. Also last year, Coca-Cola built a new beverage blending plant outside Poona. Pepsico is also moving aggressively into India. As well as its bottling plants, snack-food business and tomato paste manufacturing plant, Pepsico has just received clearance to set up a holding company with Dollars 95m in capital that is already negotiating to buy some of India's smaller soft drinks companies. Pepsico has also received permission from the government to set up Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. Ensuring that the notoriously cumbersome Indian bureaucracy handles foreign businesses efficiently has been a big part of the government's liberalisation programme, and Mr Suman Sinha, head of Pepsico in India, says approvals for the company's recent expansions were granted and processed in just six weeks. This contrasts greatly with the pre-reform days, says Mr Sinha. 'In the past, if we got (approval) in three years it would have been a miracle.' While the business climate has changed greatly, US companies still have their concerns about doing business in India. The country's infrastructure - particularly transportation and telecommunications - leaves much to be desired. Tension between the different religious communities, which has broken out into violence several times in recent years, is also a worry for US businessmen. And on the economic front, the recent budget, which placed the emphasis on economic growth over fiscal rectitude, raised some eyebrows. 'The main concern is that there is still a large budget deficit that is going to have to be covered at some point in time,' says Mr Eichfeld of Citibank. Moreover, the political situation, while stable now, could give cause for concern if Mr Rao's government runs into trouble. Asks one New York banker: 'Will there be political stability for the long-haul? Will the reforms continue? And can people count on being able to make long-term decisions now?' Yet, these concerns aside, US companies are bullish about India, a country with a well-educated and skilled pool of labour, a British-based legal and accounting system, and an English-speaking business and political community. All these factors, plus the steady liberalisation of the economy, and a business-friendly government, are in India's favour. Mr David Thomas, head of Procter &amp; Gamble's Indian operations, says: 'If India can build on this base through the efforts at deregulation, and involvement of foreign and Indian private enterprise in the creation of a national infrastructure, there is significant potential for growth. Asian 'tiger' countries have shown the way, and there is no reason why India should be an exception.'</p>

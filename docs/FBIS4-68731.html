			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from Eduard Limonov's book "Limonov Against </F> Zhirinovskiy: Limonov Against Zhirinovskiy: Obscure Facts From  the Life of the LDPR Leader"]    [Text] "Limonov Against Zhirinovskiy" is the title of  writer Eduard Limonov's new book on the subject of his former  political ally Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. For a while Limonov was a  member of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and was even a  minister in its "shadow cabinet."    We are offering our readers excerpts from E. Limonov's  new book. The book itself will soon be released by the Konets  Veka publishing house.  <H5>  Parisian Secrets </H5>   On 19 September 1992 Zhirinovskiy called me from Moscow and  said that they were arriving on the 23rd. He me asked to arrange  for a meeting with the National Front and with Chirac. He also  asked me to get in touch with the Russian Embassy. He said that  his hosts in Paris will be "our businessmen, a certain banker."    The next day at 0800 I was awaken by Zhirinovskiy: "Eduard,  please get me the telephone numbers of Chirac and Pasqua. I will  talk to them myself." I promised that I would, but not before  1000, and besides, he should not count on me getting their home  telephone numbers--this is not Russia, you have to follow  protocol in everything. If I get the numbers of their personal  secretaries, this will be a great achievement. By 1000 I  delivered to Minakov the telephone numbers of the RPR [Rally for  the Republic] chairman and Paris Mayor Chirac and former  Minister of Interior Pasqua. If only the LDP people knew what  efforts this had cost me! And what strings I had to pull!  Zhirinovskiy clearly had an exaggerated notion of his fame. The  French newspapers did write about him, but not much, during the  presidential elections in Russia in 1991, but in September 1992  he remained a "dark horse" for this country. Chiefs of the  international departments of major newspapers asked me "who?"  when I called and invited them to a press conference.    Political figures who had never heard of him were not  anxious  to meet him, while those whose secretaries understood who  Zhirinovskiy was actively did not wish to meet him. A majority,  however, completely indifferent to his name, were simply busy;  besides, meetings with leaders of parties in France are not  arranged on a moment's notice: "Is is all right if we drop in?  We are right around the corner, a 10-minute walk." I was  completely dumbfounded to learn that Zhirinovskiy and his team  nevertheless made several raids on parties' headquarters,  uninvited, the only calls being to find out the addresses  associated with the telephone numbers I gave them. The result of  these raids, in my opinion, was zilch: They were received by  whichever party functionary happened to be at the headquarters  at the time. In most cases these people even refused to provide  their names. "If Zhirinovskiy always travels abroad this way," I  remember thinking, "this is a deception." Returning to Russia,  the LDP will circulate in the mass media reports of meetings  with leaders of French parties. And the Russian masses, seeing  among them the name of Le Pen, which they are more or less  familiar with, will think naively that Vladimir Volfovich  received a warm welcome in the political establishment of  France, while at other parties the people who talked to him may  have been secretaries on duty or doormen.    On Friday 25 September I arrived at the hotel Amina (where  Zhirinovskiy and his team stayed) earlier than 0945, because I  wanted to make sure that everything was going as it was supposed  to.    We are going to visit Mr. Le Pen at home, not at the party  headquarters. We drove down the Champs-Elysees. French and  Kazakh flags were flying everywhere: Kazakhstan's President  Nazarbayev was in Paris at the time. I think there was only one  Frenchman who knew that these were Kazakhstan's  flags--Mitterrand.    Passing Montrait Park [as transliterated], we approached the  cast iron gate of our destination. We were led upstairs to a  large living room with yellow-ocher wallpaper. Yellow roses  adorned the coffee table between two yellow leather coaches. A  couple of marble busts in the corners of the room. The terrace  to the left of the entrance provided a magnificent view of Paris  from the Saint-Cloud hill; the right terrace opened to the  garden. We were left alone. After peeking at the terraces,  Zhirinovskiy said to Minakov: "See how politicians live  here, Valentin Nikolayevich. This is how the head of a party  should live! And I huddle in a two-room apartment..."    "Far from all political figures in France have villas,  Vladimir Volfovich," I interjected. "Jean-Marie Le Pen inherited  this villa from a deceased National Front member, who left the  villa to him in his will." Zhirinovskiy stayed on the subject  and began to talk very seriously about this being a good  idea--to will property and apartments to a party... and that it  would be good to include this point in the LDP rules. I thought  that he was suffering from a middle class complex toward the  upper class standard of living. If Zhirinovskiy ever comes to  seize power, he will live in the fast lane and greedily grab  property.    Zhirinovskiy was silent throughout the entire first half of  the meeting. It so happened that I had to talk more than the  others. "Aside from the language problem, his knowledge of local  politics is not great," I wrote in my diary at home the next  day. In the end he did get into the conversation. His French is  poor, stammering, university-level, dead, hard to understand for  the interlocutor, because it lacks precisely the hundred or so  most frequently used modern words. "Where did these icons come  from?" I asked Le Pen. It turned out that he had known artist  Ilya Glazunov for a long time--that is where the icons came  from. He had not seen Glazunov for about 10 years, though. "What  happened to him? He used to be nationalist and monarchist a good  20 years ago." I explained what had happened to Glazunov. We  started talking about the American penetration of Russia and  France. Cultural and political. "I would prefer to eat borscht  in a cellar than an American hamburger in McDonald's on Pushkin  Square," said Le Pen gaily.    Zhirinovskiy then bragged about his only victory: 6.2  million  votes in the presidential elections. And said that his LDP is  the largest right-wing party in Europe. Le Pen, being a polite  host, did not argue. He in turn asked Zhirinovskiy why his party  had such an unsuitable name: "Here, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, the  liberal democrats hate the National Front; they are our  enemies." Stammering, Zhirinovskiy began to explain that for the  Russian people "nationalism" brings out an association with  Nazism (not true, Russians most often use the word "fascism."  "German fascism," "Italian fascism"); that Russians have not yet  matured for a party name that would include the word "national."  As he was saying this he cast sideways glances at me. The  Russian National Assembly and the National-Republican Party  already existed, and in October of the same year the National  Salvation Front [FNS] was launched. Zhirinovskiy was lying.    Since the LDP delegation expressed the desire (and Vladimir  Volfovich louder than everyone else) to visit Paris' dens of  iniquity, I took the delegation on a tour of the Pigalle with  its sex shows and sex shops, striptease and massage parlors. The  driver waited for us at the agreed place. I myself pass through  this area maybe once every couple years: the noise, colors,  advertising, dirt, and throngs of tourists are tiresome. I go  there precisely on occasions like this--to show it to visiting  friends and acquaintances. They, however, did not limit  themselves to a passing look. In another seedy area of Paris,  Saint-Denis, the talkative Vladimir Volfovich stopped several  times and chatted with prostitutes, while other members of the  delegation giggled shyly. I invited them all to a sex show. To a  place where I thought the girls on the photos looked more  tempting. We barged inside. The place turned out a bit of a dump  and unpleasant, like a public laundry. Behind the counter was an  oriental-looking young man, but the noise created by the  delegation, and most of all by Zhirinovskiy (maybe he was so  raucous out of shyness) brought out the owner, a short and  unkempt type of undefinable oriental origin--Lebanese or  something. The owner dropped tokens onto the counter, turned a  handle, and left.    A naked girl with a face showing that she had been around  the  block a few times appeared behind the glass and began making  movements to the music. We sat there in the dark for quite a  while; then another girl appeared; they petted each other in  rhythm with the music, but no "sexual act" promised on the  marquee ever materialized. The lights went out. We emerged from  the booth. In the lobby Vladimir Volfovich demanded our money  back, yelling that the owner was a crook. The noise brought out  of the establishment's bowels a bow-legged woman in a shawl,  carrying a cup of tea. She turned out to be Russian! "Vladimir  Volfovich, the hell with them, let us go!" I said. "What do you  mean, the hell with them? Let them refund our money, or at least  half of it. Where is the act? They promised the act, and we did  not see any act. Did you see the act, Zhebrovskiy?" Zhebrovskiy  said that he did not. "So let them refund half the money, or I  will hand them over to the police!"--"Vladimir Volfovich, this  entire industry rests on deception. If you walk in here, you are  already permitting yourself to be deceived. One way or another  they will cheat you." I talked him into leaving. "Who is he?"  asked the bow-legged woman. "Zhirinovskiy?" She watched us leave  with her mouth agape. IZVESTIYA recently reprinted from BILD  magazine a story that had allegedly taken place in Germany:  Vladimir Volfovich and a Russian-born prostitute. Let this story  remain on the conscience of BILD magazine. Such an incident  could have taken place, but I consider its darkly sadistic  interpretation improbable. Vladimir Volfovich is more of a  grumbling trouble-maker, who wants to get the best possible  service for his money. He is an aggressive Philistine, not a  Dracula. You are a prostitute? I have paid you? Cheats! They did  not give me a full serving!--this is more his style.  <H5>  Divorce </H5>   The first time I saw Zhirinovskiy after Paris was on 24  October in the hall of the Parliament Center at 2 Tsvetnoy  Boulevard. As usual, the communists-patriots would not let him  in their games. He did manage to be admitted into the building,  but certainly would not let him become a member of the National  Salvation Front. Zhirinovskiy was willing to sign anything in  order to be accepted. He was sitting in the audience, expecting  to be given the floor. Zyuganov, who was increasingly gaining  momentum then (he had already squeezed out Anpilov), promised  everything to everyone, and to me, too: "We will make you a  member of the political council," put me in the presidium and  let me speak that evening. But the cunning syrupy communist has  not kept his main promise.    I want to dwell a little here on the National Salvation  Front  congress. When we speak of Zhirinovskiy, it is impossible to  ignore the context in which he found himself in the fall. Here  is what the political status of the opposition was by 24 October  1992: Anpilov was not included in the Front. Zhirinovskiy was  not included; he did enter the building but left during the  second half of the proceedings. On the other hand, 40 boyars in  tall hats, ceremonial generals--most of them useless or of  little use--were included in the National Council.    At this juncture it should be explained that these boyars  originated from the perestroyka elite of the Gorbachev period,  and a considerable number even from the Brezhnev nomenklatura.  Not a political class, they, sitting on the stage (I sat in the  first row in the rightmost seat, but was the only one who was  not a "former") resembled most of all precisely BOYARS--a social  group that has done a lot of harm to Russia at all times.  Selected by the voters (in the case of deputies) or by the  authorities around 1990, mainly for being sympathetic to  "reform"--then-fashionable among the voters--they were people  from the country's past, who had an increasingly diminishing  grasp of its present. They had been selected by rank, by the  number of stars on their shoulder boards, loudness of voice, the  weight of their name during the Brezhnev times, and the degree  of frenzy in their anti-Stalin or antistagnation demagoguery.  Their merit in 1990 was that they--people of the past--supported  some vague "civilized" future. Such transitional groups  inevitably appear during periods of social catastrophe, and it  is normal that for the lack of a real political class they  temporarily fulfill this function. I emphasize: TEMPORARILY.    It is quite natural that these BOYARS, incapable of  thinking ahead (political mentality), simply changed obediently  together with the country and the population. And when the  country screamed, unable to bear any longer the sadistic  experiments it had been subjected to by "Yeltsin's team," and  the people screamed, some of the BOYARS screamed and became  outraged together with the people, too. The 40 up on the  stage were mostly of this kind, mere conduits of the country's  emotions, its fear and pain. There was another group--frankly  unprincipled ones, far more unprincipled than the CPSU  nomenklatura had ever been. This group of BOYARS is  characterized by a complete lack of morals and responsibility,  as well as disarming opportunism. Just as in the past the  boyars, their coattails pulled up, ran to Dimitriy the Pretender  and then back to the legitimate tsar--wherever they thought the  best opportunity would present itself, quite a few such  "runners" appeared in the FNS. Well, a majority, to be honest.    During a break between sittings I happened upon a backroom,  where all the members of the FNS organizational committee had  gathered. They were dividing the leadership pie there, and quite  unpleasantly at that. Unpleasantly in the sense of being  quarrelsome and hypocritical. There was an obvious rivalry  between Zyuganov and Konstantinov, which ended in Konstantinov's  victory. Baburin, his cheeks flushed, upset over being elected  only to the political council, was angrily saying something from  the door. DEN editor Prokhanov--the man who united them all  together with his communicative temperament and romantic  imperialism, was silent. Nine cochairmen and a coordinator with  two aides were elected. Konstantinov was elected coordinator.  The communists in the leadership were clearly outnumbered by  bearded defectors, "new patriots"--Astafyev among them. I do not  like defectors and cannot stand those admitting "past errors."  Therefore, the presence of some General Sterligov (he was the  one who went to arrest the GKChP [State Committee on the State  of Emergency] members) in the FNS was an unpleasant surprise for  me. While I like writer Rasputin, I remember very well, however,  that it was Gorbachev's State Council, of which Rasputin was a  member, that on 6 September 1991 recognized the independence of  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. I was not the only one disgusted  with the backroom bickering over power. An organizing committee  member--a gaunt man who appeared to be a blue-collar worker--got  up, noisily pushed away his chair, and said angrily: "Some  representatives! Now they will start dividing salaries!" And  slammed the door behind him. The Kazakhstan representative tried  to appeal to FNS leaders from the door: "What am I to say to my  people? Kazakhstan's Russians are waiting for concrete  guidance--`what to do,' and you are doing what!"    During the second part of the congress, Zhirinovskiy was no  longer in the audience. I think this congress pushed his  patience beyond the limit. He could not know, of course, what  was happening behind the scenes, but was guided by his  instincts. He realized that he was not accepted, finally and  irreversibly. And will not be in the future. (The reasons are  not that important.) So he decided to look for allies in  another camp. In order to do this, however, he had to  change his behavior (albeit temporarily) and change the image of  the party. There is no question that it was after the FNS  congress that Zhirinovskiy decided to become a "centrist." Just  as there is no doubt that it was then that he decided to take  Jean-Marie Le Pen's advice and "purge" the LDP of "young people  in leather who will pull his movement toward national-socialism."</p>

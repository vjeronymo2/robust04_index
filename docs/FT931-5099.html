			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: Ellen Taaffe Zwilich - Music in New York The music of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich has made little impression outside the US, but it is different at home, where her scores fly around the country like shots in a pinball machine. Not a year passes without a new symphony, concerto or mighty orchestral piece, always tidily made, practical, uncomplicated, and sure to appeal to orchestral managements from Florida (where she was born, in 1939) to Alaska. On the very night of the first performance of her Third Symphony, commissioned and played by the New York Philharmonic, Zwilich was also to be heard in Phoenix and Minnesota. And this was only the first of three Zwilich orchestral premieres planned for 1993. Zwilich's skill is clear from the new symphony - as clear as the cautiousness that may account for such success. She is cautious not to cause expense (so no additions to the standard symphony orchestra), not to trespass too much on rehearsal time, not to exceed the patience of the many audiences she has the right to foresee (so three movements, and the whole work over in 22 minutes) and not to go beyond, either, what the standard repertory has taught those audiences to regard as the proper stuff of symphonies (so strong themes, strong tonal centres, and a rhetoric of combat). What comes out of all this is music curiously close to that of another 20th-century symphonist who operated under a machinery of cramps and constraints: Shostakovich. Except for the steamrolling syncopation that shows the hand of a sometime jazz trumpeter, almost nothing in the symphony would prevent one's hearing it as a Soviet product of 50 years ago, by a composer taking her bearings from Prokofiev (a few moments of spiky glamour reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet) as well as from Shostakovich's symphonic procedures: the emphatically stated keynotes, from which the melodies are often hopelessly adrift and isolated; the insistence on germinal motifs (here especially the very Shostakovich-like opening gambit of rising through a minor third by way of a minor second); even the desolated triumphs. For when this symphony finally returns to the F sharp of its opening, the blazing triads are perched precariously in an unrooted treble, and dominated by the over-bright, unsteady sound of high trumpets and vibraphone. This moment needs a crack performance - and received one. Zwilich also expects much from her violas, placed at the front right, from where they can balance the first violins in voice and action, while the resort to traditional sources of energy and argument inevitably brings the brass ensemble and various woodwind soloists repeatedly to the fore. Created for the musicians who were so confidently introducing it to the world, the symphony was perhaps created, too, for Kurt Masur, though in the event of his indisposition it was strongly urged by Jahja Ling, well used to this composer's work.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa Dzhemilov, chairman of the Crimean </F> Tartar Council, by unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given: "Autonomy!"]    [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Who are the Crimean Tartars supporting  in the Crimean conflict?    [Dzhemilov] The Crimea is our homeland. We are trying to  reestablish Tartar autonomy within the confines of Ukraine. The  young Ukrainian state is not responsible for the crimes against  our people.    [DIE WOCHE] Most of the population of the Crimea are  Russians. Do they have no right of self-determination?    [Dzhemilov] Russian claims to the Crimea stem from their  conquest thereof in 1783. The Tartars are indigenous to the  Crimea. We are not going to accept annexation to Russia  passively.    [DIE WOCHE] Have you not backed the wrong horse?    [Dzhemilov] During the 211 years of Russian colonization, we  have not experienced anything good about Russia. The Tartars  were drive out of their homes, and Russians were settled in  their place. In 1944, Stalin had the Tartar population deported.    [DIE WOCHE] Might not your warm feelings toward Kiev drive  the Russians and Tartars further apart?    [Dzhemilov] We are already being discriminated against  everywhere. There is no work for the 250,000 Tartars in the  Crimea. Unemployment has reached 40 percent. Our health  situation is catastrophic. We constitute 10 percent of the  population, but 30 percent of its patients.    [DIE WOCHE] What would the Tartars do in the event of an  armed conflict between Ukraine and the Crimea?    [Dzhemilov] Should fighting break out, we will know how to  defend ourselves. We are well organized, and can deploy defense  troops in the shortest time.</p>

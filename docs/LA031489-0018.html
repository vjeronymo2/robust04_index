			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: DYING IS A SCARY THING TO DO  </P> <P> From where he sits, the young man can see the buck-brush ceanothus blooming on  the slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains, brushing tones of smoky white into  the deep green. Signs of spring are everywhere in the canyon that encloses him.  Feathery yellow acacias glow in the sunlight, and blossoming fruit trees sing  renewal to the sweet-scented breezes that blow across an open courtyard. The  young man sits amid the bursts of life on a day laced with gold. And he talks  about death.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I dream I'm dying," he says, pulling a heavy jacket around him, more  protection from the dream than the day. "I see myself being shot and then I  feel myself, you know, fading away, and I wake up sweating, man, really  shaking. I can't tell you the feeling." He thinks about it for a moment and  then says, "You hear guys say they'd die for their neighborhoods, but you know,  man, when you think about it, dying is a scary thing. . . ."  </P> <P> His name is Richard and he is sitting slightly hunched forward on a bench at  the edge of a central courtyard in a Los Angeles County juvenile probation camp  tucked into Las Virgenes Canyon. Walls 14 feet high surround the camp, and the  rules of incarceration are severe and unbending, belying the peaceful tone of  its surroundings. This is prison. The young man knows it.  </P> <P> Richard is a member of the Westside Raymond Crips and is doing time for armed  robbery and possession of narcotics. "Sometimes," he says on the day I visit  him, "I think I'm going to get out of the gangs, you know, leave the city. But  you've got to go far away, man, or they'll find you. A friend will find you, or  an enemy. You don't just step in and step out of a gang, man. You step in and  they lock the door behind you."  </P> <P> "This is like R&amp;R for those guys," camp director Robert Stanley says as he  leads the way through the bleak dormitory that is home to the camp's 125  inmates. "They come out of a war zone to 'rest.' It's safe here. A lot of them  get nervous when it comes time to leave and sabotage themselves to do more  time."  </P> <P> He stops and turns to face me. "They're only kids. Sure they can be deadly, but  they're still kids and they have no options. We try to develop their  self-esteem, but you put them back in the same neighborhood and it's a lost  cause. Eventually they bend to the pressures and the temptations. A guy running  dope makes $600 a week. How can $5 an hour compete with that?"  </P> <P> What strikes me are the contrasts. The youth of the boys and the enormity of  their crimes. The vast efforts and the deep frustrations. Spring coming and  lives unraveling. "I'll never make it," a young man says to me on a day that  glows with birth. "I'll be dead by the time I'm 20."  </P> <P> Who's to blame? I read the numbers. Sixty-nine gang killings in the county in  the first two months of the year. Maybe more than 400 by the time December  fades. Babies die. Pregnant women die. Old men die. The sidewalks of L.A. are  stained with the blood of the innocents. Who's to blame? You? Me? The cops? The  kids? Curiosity brings me to the camp.  </P> <P> "How did it happen?" I ask Richard.  </P> <P> The ambiguity of the question doesn't faze him. He's a bright kid, but at 18  Richard has lived a lifetime of violent, antisocial behavior, shooting,  robbing, beating and using a range of narcotics that staggers the imagination.  </P> <P> "I don't know, man," he says. "You kind of ease into a gang, you know? My  brother was a gang-banger, in and out of jail. I began kicking with these guys  when I was 12 and pretty soon I'm in. My mother would say, 'No, get out,' but  it didn't do no good, man. I wouldn't come home or I'd come home stoned. You  don't think about nothing. You get high and whatever comes up, man, you just do  it. Who cares, you know?"  </P> <P> "We were like a club at first," another kid says. His name is Perez and he's a  member of the Lynwood Mob. "We only met to party, but then the Compton people  brought in guns and people got shot. They shot one of our home boys and we shot  them. It made no sense, you know? What were we doing? The scariest place is our  own neighborhood. All I ever thought about was being killed."  </P> <P> The time for talking is over. "I can make it, man," Richard says. "I dream of  dying and I know now that dream can come true."  </P> <P> As I drive out of Las Virgenes Canyon, I wonder if tonight he'll dream of  death. And I wonder, as evidence of renewal brightens the mountainsides, if  spring will ever truly come for him again.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States are positively considering deploying Patriot  missiles at American bases to counter North Korea's Scud  missiles, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said Wednesday.    "Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong  said. "As to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be  made after further consultations."    South Korea will not be purchasing the Patriots, the vice  foreign minister said, the anti-missile defense system will be  part of the weaponry deployed by the U.S. Forces in Korea at  their bases here.    Though officials deny it, the decision is likely to  negatively affect the stalemated nuclear negotiations with North  Korea.    "The threat of North Korean missiles is very real," Hong  said. "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will  enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability."    The idea of importing the Patriot system has been on the  table ever since its celebrated success against Iraqi Scud  missiles during Desert Storm, but some military experts are  questioning its accuracy and effectiveness, insisting that the  defensive missiles are already outmoded.    North Korea is believed to have upgraded the Soviet Scud in  its Nodong-1 missile, making it nuclear-capable with a 1,000 km  range.    The stalinist state sent shudders through South Korea and  Japan when it successfully test-fired a Nodong missile last  summer.    Hong said the negotiations will be handled by the defense  ministries of the two countries.</p>

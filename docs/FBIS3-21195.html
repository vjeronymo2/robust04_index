These operations support individual technology development  for areas receiving the approval for activation plans based on  the Integration Activation Act (abbreviation). This organization  has the form of determining themes based on regional prospects  and entrusting their development to enterprises. As the  application of the activation planning gets serious in each  region, it starts essentially from 1993. The total amount of  trust expenses is over &yen;570 million.    The names of the regions and development themes determined  are the following.    Hokkaido-Asahikawa: Pure wood fire door technology,  structural furnishings and wall panels as home construction  materials    Hokkaido-Kushiro: Squid flake commercializing technology,  production technology for prepared foods maintaining the flavor  of the materials (food products of a combination of agricultural  and marine products)    Hokkaido-Muroran: POS interlocking value display systems,  precision processing technology for stainless steel unified  special lightwall vacuum containers, high capacity dehumidifiers  using electronic refrigeration elements, high capacity oil  burners    Hokkaido-Hakodate: New products and development for food  preservation technology    Niigata-Sanjo, Tsubame: Polishing equipment without using  nappy cloth and polishing material, face grinders with composite  technology integration, development of thin film molding  technology and application to industrial machine blades for  zirconia ceramics, flexible sequential molding technology by  local heating    Gifu-Gifu: Partially esterized PVA coating processing for  material for embroidery, bulky adhesive polyester cloth  according to the new spinning act, triaxial, three-dimensional,  multilayered base material    Toyama-Oyabe, Tonami: Technology for producing knit material  for highly elastic and high density sportswear, technology for  producing inner material by elastic nap raised knit, technology  for producing sportswear with a composite of different elastic  materials, production technology for highly elastic cloth    Fukui-Fukui: Production technology for a three-dimensional  structured net, print technology for optical applications, heat  generating cloth for thermal flooring, fiber material surface  composite film molding technology    Kyoto-Maizuru, Miyazu: Shore cleaning vehicles, cleaning  automated delivery equipment, refining and reproduction  equipment for various processed oils (waste treatment system)    Kyoto-Hokutan: Automatic deburring equipment for sprockets,  high density work stocker-equipped ceiling running loader,  technology for elimination of water solubility in small forged  parts    Yamaguchi-Shunan: Year round cleaning machine system for  closed water areas like dams, lakes and marshes, silicon wafer  high precision cutout equipment from improved general saw  cutters, industrial hard floor cleaning and polishing  intelligent robot applying the new processing method (dry method)    Aichi-Imabari: Long and short pile cloth production control  system, cotton paper cloth towels, automation and energy saving  equipment for towel print processing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Improved farming  conditions are helping farmers escape the grip of poverty in  Xihaigu area, in north-west China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region, a senior official said here today.    Guo Zhanyuan, director of the Regional Committee for  Agricultural Development, said that since 1982, a massive  farmland improvement campaign has increased the area's irrigated  farmland by more than 30,000 ha and ordinary farmland by 120,000  ha.    Compared with ten years ago, the farmland per person in the  area has risen from less than 0.06 ha to 0.12 ha in 1993, and  the grain output for each person went up from 92 kg to 275 kg.    In the same period, the average income for each farm  increased from 126 yuan to 375 yuan a year.    With a population of 2.1 million in an area of 39,000 square  km, Xihaigu was once one of the poorest areas in China, due to  poor farming conditions caused by dry climate, infertile soil  and severe water loss and soil erosion.    Seeing that improving the farming conditions was critical to  the fight against poverty, the local government launched a  massive campaign to create more irrigated farmland and to  transform broken hillsides into larger pieces of terraced land.    The larger and flatter pieces of land are not only easier to  cultivate, they also retain more water and reduce erosion of  soil and fertilizers, and can therefore increase grain output by  one half.    Encouraged by the initial success, the farmland improvement  campaign is proceeding on a larger scale and with better  planning. More and more bulldozers are being used.    Guo Zhanyuan said the area plans to create 200,000 ha of new  farmland in ten years, so that the area of farmland per person  will rise to 0.2 ha.    If that goal is achieved, the area's population will be able  to get rid of poverty completely, Guo said.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Potential Lloyd's investor pulls out Nervousness about structural upheaval at Lloyd's of London has led to a US investor pulling out of a plan that would have provided Pounds 50m in corporate capital for the insurance market next year. The decision is a setback for Brockbank, one of the largest managing agencies. It had hoped to announce a new investment company last week, supplying funds for the syndicates it runs, in time for the 1995 underwriting year. It is also a disappointment for Lloyd's, reducing the total funds raised by corporate investors for next year to about Pounds 320m. This is in addition to the Pounds 900m invested in 1994. Brockbank has not named the investor but agreement is understood to have been close enough for funds to have been lodged with Lloyd's before the November 30 deadline for those planning to invest in 1995. Last minute problems are believed to have occured because the investor was worried about the knock-on effects if Lloyd's failed in its attempts to 'ring-fence' all liabilities for 1985 and before as part of its plans to create a 'clean' insurance market for future investors. There were also problems in drawing up a contract that would accommodate the investor's interest in acquiring half of the Brockbank managing agencies business. Lloyd's rules restrict ownership to 25 per cent, though the market is expected to relax regulations next year.</p>

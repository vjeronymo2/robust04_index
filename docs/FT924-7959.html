			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Council tax bills still hang in balance - Local government THE SIZE of individual council tax bills next year still hangs in the balance after yesterday's announcement. However, the statement did show, that the government prefers to exercise its extensive powers to limit local authority spending rather than to use taxpayers' money in smoothing the introduction of the property-based council tax. The assertion from Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, that the statement means there is no reason why local authorities in England should have to raise more next year from the council tax than they are raising this year from the poll tax, depends on assumptions not shared by local councils. Among those assumptions are the opportunities for further efficiency savings, and authorities' ability to keep to a maximum increase of 1.5 per cent on their pay bills. Above all, they do not take account of the difference between government plans at the start of the year and the increase which occurs when the local budgets are drawn up and the money is actually spent. Local authority associations were swift to warn yesterday that the government's plans could mean drastic cuts in services and jobs. Mr Jeremy Beecham, the leader of the Labour-controlled Assocaiton of Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'The target falls far short of what is needed to provide crucial services.' In particular, the associations pointed out that councils are already committed to Pounds 350m more spending on pay next year as a result of pay deals agreed with groups such as the police and the fire service. The cost of 1.5 per cent for the next round of pay deals represents a further Pounds 300m or so. Year-on-year comparisons in local government finance are never easy, but this year the task is made harder by the shift in functions and by the change from the poll tax to the council tax. The new figure for total standard spending - the government's plans for local authority budgets - is Pounds 41.142bn. This is, the department of the environment says, an increase of 3.1 per cent on the plans for this year, taking account of local government's loss of most responsibilities for further education, and its gain of responsibility for community care. Those changes carry in themselves the prospect of further disagreements between central and local government. The new grant of Pounds 539m for community care is considered insufficient by the authorities. They also argue that in deducting about Pounds 2.4bn from the spending total for the loss of further education the government has overstated the amount that councils were spending, and has, as a result, left them in an even more difficult position. The increase in total local spending is noticeably lower, compared with the amount that councils are actually spending this year. This is set to overshoot the government's target by just over Pounds 1bn, taking spending for this year to Pounds 42.9bn. Overall, English councils will receive an extra Pounds 1.2bn in money from central government and the business rate, as aggregate external finance rises to Pounds 33.519bn. The three local authority associations, including those dominated by Tories as well as those led by Labour, said that the target represented an increase of less than 0.5 per cent over the current year's budget. In any event, the final spending outcome for next year will be higher than the government's intention. This is because even the stricter regime of capping local spending which will be announced later this month leaves some leeway for spending slightly over the government's plans, and also because councils will have to take account of poll tax arrears, which remain outside the process of limiting local spending. The range of council tax bills across the country will not be apparent until later this month when Mr Howard announces the grant distribution and the provisional criteria for capping local spending. However, one element in the amounts people will have to pay in council tax will be the scale of the transitional relief scheme, which is included in the total Pounds 33.519bn of central government support and the business rate. Latest estimates put the cost of this for next year at about Pounds 500m maximum, with those in lower property bands qualifying more readily for help. The increase in the business rate by the inflation rate - 3.5 per cent  - is a blow for business organisations which have been agitating for a freeze. It was inevitable that the government would put the rate up by the maximum possible because a fall in the number of businesses paying has already led to a shortfall in the national non-domestic rate pool from which the government distributes the business rate to local councils.</p>

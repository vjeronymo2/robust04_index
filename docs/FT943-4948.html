			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bumper US crop but farm incomes to fall Ideal harvesting weather across most of the mid-west is allowing US grain farmers to reap near-record maize and soyabean harvests. The bountiful crop will recharge silos and grain bins drawn low after last summer's drought and flood-ravaged season, but will do little to improve farm profits. Producers have watched market prices for feed grains sag steadily through the summer as crop prospects brightened. Now, with only scattered chances for damage from frost or disease remaining, analysts say official estimates of a 9.21bn-bushel maize harvest and a 2.28bn-bushel soyabean crop are almost certainly on target. The output gains come not only because there were more acres planted this year - for the first time in recent history the US Department of Agriculture did not require farmers to set aside unplanted ground - but because yields per acre are up in many states. Although domestic food processors and livestock feeders will consume more grain than ever this year, export markets for maize and soyabeans are on decline. A dip in farm income this year could slow the current mini-boom in agricultural machinery sales next year and limit the recovery in farm real estate prices. The big crop will also require Washington farm-policy makers to reconsider acreage set-aside rules. Analysts say the big crop will also keep pressure on USDA officials to beef up export subsidy programs to move grain overseas. USDA economists, who are revising their farm-income data for this year and last, are expected to report this week that farmers' net cash income in 1994 will be substantially lower than last year. The USDA recently estimated that net cash income to farmers was a record USDollars 62.5bn in 1993, when higher prices and government payments more than offset income lost due to crop disasters. However, that figure will be revised downward to Dollars 58.4bn, according to Mr. Bob McElroy, senior financial analyst with the USDA. He says 1994 farmers net cash income will be below that record, in the range of Dollars 53bn to Dollars 57bn. The dip in net cash income this year is the result of several factors. Expenses, including interest rates, are higher this year, and government payments to farmers are expected to drop to about Dollars 8bn, far below last year's Dollars 13.4bn. Throughout much of the mid-west, livestock prices are an important factor in farm profits. 'In our seven-state area, livestock accounts for about 60 per cent of farm income,' says Mr Mark Drabenstott, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. 'We think farm incomes will be down this year largely because of sour cattle prices in the spring in early summer.' Cattle feeders had a bad first half in part because high feed grains prices prompted many livestock producers to slaughter herds, creating a glut of red meat. Now, with the feed situation reversed, livestock producers are contemplating herd expansion, a factor that may keep a stream of inexpensive beef flowing to supermarkets over the next two years.</p>

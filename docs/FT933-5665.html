			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Frost retires from NatWest The passing of a management generation at National Westminster Bank was formally completed yesterday with the announcement of the retirement of Tom Frost, the bank's deputy chairman and its former chief executive. Frost retired on reaching the age of 60, the bank's official retirement age. He became deputy chairman last year in order to devote time to clearing his name of misleading a government inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair. NatWest has no plans to appoint another deputy to Lord Alexander, its full-time chairman, who oversaw the appointment of 45-year-old Derek Wanless to succeed Frost as chief executive last year. That appointment installed a new generation at the bank. Frost became a director of NatWest in 1984 after becoming the first chief executive of its US retail bank operation. He was appointed group chief executive in 1987 before the bank becoming entangled in the Blue Arrow affair.</p>

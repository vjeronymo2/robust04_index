			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> OUT OF JAIL, HE'S STILL NAMELESS  </P> <P> An abortion protester who faced no more than 30 days in jail but wound up  spending a year behind bars because he wouldn't give his name was free today,  his identity still unknown.  </P> <P> "I did what I think was right," the man, who has identified himself only as  Baby John Doe, told Judge Randall Nichols at a hearing Tuesday.  </P> <P> Nichols ordered the protester to pay $12,547 to the county for the cost of  jailing him.  </P> <P> When asked whether his real name might be Gary Christopher -- a name supplied  by a penal farm guard -- the protester said, "I cannot comment on that, sir."  </P> <P> Nichols agreed to release the man under the names Baby John Doe and Gary  Christopher, saying his decision was affected by nightly questions from his  8-year-old son on the protester's fate and letters from all over the United  States on his behalf.  </P></p>

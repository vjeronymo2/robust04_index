			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  reactionaries must ponder over the grave consequences arising  from their unreasonable acts, stop the repression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and the  Korean nationals in Japan and apologise for it, declares MINJU  CHOSON today.    The news analyst says:    A sequence of savage repression by the Japanese  reactionaries  such as search of the hall of the Osaka prefectural headquarters  of Chongnyon and its branch offices and the houses of senior  officials is a heinous hostile act to wantonly infringe on the  democratic rights of Koreans in Japan and stifle Chongnyon and  an intolerable provocation against the DPRK.    Their repressive acts hitherto against Chongnyon and Koreans  in Japan are countless, but there had been no such wholesale  search and rampage as the recent one. This clearly shows their  anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign has reached a very grave  stage.    Chongnyon is a dignified and authoritative organisation of  overseas citizens of the DPRK which is engaged in righteous  activities to defend the democratic national rights of Koreans  in Japan, achieve the reunification of the country and promote  friendship with the Japanese people. Therefore, there is no  ground for Chongnyon to be the target of repression.    It is unpardonable for the Japanese authorities to join the  United States and the South Korean puppets in the row over the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and deliberately aggravate the  situation, while resorting to vicious anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon  acts.    Their reckless acts are aimed at blocking the legitimate  activities of Chongnyon, controlling and restricting the life of  Koreans in Japan and impairing the just peace policy of the DPRK  at any cost.    However, it will bring into relief their inferiority and  ferocity.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Negotiators down in the dumps over US draft - Washington set to take on the world in clash over anti-dumping proposals America's Thanksgiving gift to trade negotiators in Geneva is expected to be an unwelcome set of proposals to reform rules disciplining international dumping. A clash over anti-dumping rules has long been anticipated by negotiators in the Uruguay round of talks on global trade liberalisation. Five separate texts have been presented in six years, and all have been rejected. The draft imposed at the end of 1991 was an arbitrated text, never agreed. At the heart of the conflict has been a fundamental difference between the US - as a principal user of dumping laws and a fierce defender of its national prerogatives in this area - and the rest of the world, which at one time or another has felt victimised by what is seen as arbitrary use of unfair rules which lead with near-certainty to the conclusion that dumping has occurred. But in the calm before the storm that is expected to erupt when the US list of amendments lands on desks across Geneva, officials recognise that something will have to be done to accommodate US concerns that the present text unreasonably weakens its power to act: 'I pray it will be the minimum,' one said. From January this year, the US flagged its intention to challenge the existing draft text, in the teeth of near-universal opposition from the other 114 countries negotiating the Uruguay round. 'The danger is great,' one negotiator said. 'The US appears quite prepared to pull the plug on this issue. This would pull down the agreement we have on subsidies, which in turn would pull down our agreement on farm trade. The pack of cards would collapse.' Most countries see the growing use of anti-dumping laws - duties and fines against imports that are alleged to be sold at prices below those charged in a domestic market - as creeping protectionism. As customs barriers have fallen over the past decades, so dumping actions appear to have become the protectionist's weapon of first resort. According to a recent World Bank study, average tariffs in the US manufactured goods sector would be 23 per cent today, compared with a nominal level of less than 6 per cent, if they were adjusted to account for the impact of dumping duties on imported steel, textiles and cars - the industries most affected. As the number of dumping actions initiated has risen steeply since 1988, so an increasing number of countries have introduced their own anti-dumping laws - and have proven willing to use them. India and Japan initiated actions in 1992 for the first time. Developing countries, which until 1985 had never initiated dumping action, have initiated around 40 a year for the past three years. Significantly, the US was the target of 20 dumping actions in the year to June 1993 - overtaking Japan (the target of just 13 actions), which is so often seen by the US as a leading 'dumper'. In January this year, Mrs Carla Hills, the outgoing US trade representative, asked the International Trade Commission to study the net impact of dumping actions on US industry. Her successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, has since reversed the request, but not without prompting questions on whether the higher import costs arising from dumping duties damage the competitivenes of US companies. This has not prevented supporters of domestic anti-dumping policy from mounting a fierce defence of the existing regime, and an effective campaign pressing the US administration to lengthen its list of proposed changes to the intended Uruguay Round agreement. In the House Ways and Means committee three weeks ago, Mr Eric Garfinkel, a leading Bush administration negotiator on the Uruguay round anti-dumping text, attacked the draft as 'highly political', and 'not a balanced or well-reasoned document'. He detailed the need for various amendments, which seem likely to appear in the list presented to negotiators today. These include: Scope and standard of review: the US fears the draft will allow Gatt panels to revisit the facts presented in a domestic dumping inquiry, rather than examine whether laws had been fairly applied. Circumvention: the US says the draft will allow offending countries to side-step dumping duties by shifting production to other countries. It wants the power to put duties on 'like goods' being exported to the US from third countries without fresh investigation. Sunset: the proposed draft says a dumping duty will expire after five years unless a review shows dumping is still occurring. The US objects to the need for fresh proof of dumping. Over 30 of the 268 dumping duties currently in effect in the US have been in place for more than 20 years. Start-up: particularly relevent to high-technology industries, the US objects to rules which would allow companies to charge prices that are below true production cost during the start-up period before full economies of scale have been achieved. It wants the length of start-up to be defined De minimis: the Uruguay round draft would block dumping inquiries if the effective dumping margin were less than 2 per cent, or if the volume of dumped product - and injury to domestic competitors - is 'negligible', defined as less than 1 per cent of the domestic market. Standing: only governments are entitled to bring a dispute to Gatt under the present draft. The US wants non-government bodies to be able to bring actions - notably trade unions or environmental groups. The list of proposed amendments was promised for last Wednesday. Successive postponements have frustrated other negotiators, and added to the prickly array of outstanding issues that must be resolved by December 15 if a Uruguay round package is to be completed successfully.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANTI-DUMPING: CASES INITIATED (JULY TO JUNE)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             83-84    84-85    85-86    86-87    87-88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia                      70       63       54       40       20 Canada                         26       35       27       24       20 EU                             33       34       23       17       30 US                             46       61       63       41       31 Other developed countries       1        0        2        5        9 Developing countries            0        0        3        4       13 TOTAL                         176      193      172      131      123  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             88-89    89-90    90-91    91-92    92-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia                      19       23       46       76       61 Canada                         14       15       12       16       36 EU                             29       15       15       23       33 US                             25       24       52       62       78 Other developed countries      12        5        9       21        8 Developing countries           14       14       41       39       38 TOTAL                         113       96      175      237      254  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gatt  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

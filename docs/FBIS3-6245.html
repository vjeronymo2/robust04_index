			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Justice Department, claiming 70 Japanese  construction firms including general contractors inflicted 1.1  billion yen in damages to the U.S. Government through rigged  bids for a contract to construct facilities at the U.S. Atsugi  Naval Station, has decided to ask the Japanese construction  firms involved to pay compensatory damages in accordance with  Article 9 (Illegal Business Actions) of the Civil Act. The U.S.  Justice Department will soon ask each construction firm to  comply with the U.S. demand for compensatory damages through  process attorneys. It is said the U.S. Justice Department plans  to file a suit with a Japanese court against 70 Japanese  construction firms for compensatory damages. In 1989, the U.S.  Government filed a suit against Japanese general contractors for  rigging bids for a construction project at the U.S. Yokosuka  Naval Station, but the U.S. Government dropped the suit  following an out-of-court settlement. This is the first time  that the Clinton administration has decided to take legal action  against Japanese construction firms for rigging bids.    The prevailing view is that the "exposure" of the  bid-rigging  by the U.S. Justice Department is an indication that the Clinton  administration has embarked on the offensive against Japan  following the breakdown of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  and the break off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks.    The United States, which revived the Super 301 provision of  the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, is believed to have adopted a  strategy to bring the Japanese keiretsu [interlocking corporate  grouping] and bid-rigging structure to light by taking forcible  measures to expose bid-rigging, and to open the Japanese market  by hinting at the possibility of slapping sanctions on Japan in  accordance with the provision.    The same government source said the U.S. Justice Department  claimed the Japanese construction firms have been engaged in  bid- rigging for six years between 1984 and 1990 in connection  with the construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station.  The U.S. Justice Department also asserted that 70 Japanese  construction companies, including Nishimatsu Construction  Company, Obayashi Corporation, and Penta-Ocean Construction  Company, have formed a cartel and, as a result, the U.S.  Government has been unfairly forced to pay 1.1 billion yen more  than ordinary prices.    According to the U.S. side, Japanese construction firms have  rigged bids for contracts for construction projects at three  U.S. military bases of Yokosuka, Yokota and Sasebo. In the case  of Yokosuka Naval Station, the Fair Trade Commission ordered 70  Japanese construction firms involved in the bid-rigging to pay  penalty fees totalling 289.890 million yen after confirming  their involvement in the bid-rigging. The Japanese construction  firms later paid compensation of 4.7 billion yen to the U.S.  Government at the end of an out-of-court settlement.    The Fair Trade Commission has yet to confirm their  involvement in the bid-rigging in connection with the  construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station. Therefore,  the government plans to investigate facilities constructed by  the Japanese construction firms, their bidding prices, and the  possibility of their violation of the Antimonopoly Law.</p>

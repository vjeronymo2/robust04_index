			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Dialling a lower lighting bill - Worth Watching Few businesses would even consider that their internal phone system could help cut the lighting bills. But Morgan Automation, of Liss, Hampshire, has developed a telephone-controlled lighting system which, the manufacturer says, can cut lighting bills by more than 40 per cent. As staff enter the building they trigger a core of essential lighting. They then control the lighting around their desks by dialling specified numbers on their phones. Typically 70 per cent of the lighting in an office block could be controlled through the phone network. The Morgan system incorporates a computer which links the lighting and phone systems. The smallest system costs around Pounds 13,000. Morgan Automation: UK, 0730 895900.</p>

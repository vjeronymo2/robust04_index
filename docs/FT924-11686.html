			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Gentiana sino-ornata This splendid autumn flowering gentian from China and Tibet sets a high standard of beauty with its large, azure-blue trumpets standing up on carpets of narrow shining green leaves. It can be grown most easily in beds of peat that contain absolutely no lime.  It requires plenty of moisture and, unlike most alpine plants, benefits from replanting each March or April when it is just starting in to growth and tufts can be pulled out of the old beds with white roots attached. These tufts should establish themselves rapidly in moist peat in an open, sunny place. They must not be allowed to get dry which is one reason why it is easier to grow them in a deep bed of peat rather than in a pot.</p>

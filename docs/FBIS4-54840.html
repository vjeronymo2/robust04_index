			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Rados Smiljkovic, the  ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Sofia [name  and title as received], today lodged a protest with the  Bulgarian Foreign Ministry in reaction to a speech delivered by  Albanian President Sali Berisha in the Bulgarian National  Assembly when he attacked the FRY, Serbia, and the Serbian  people in the harshest of terms. Such an anti-Serbian attitude  displayed by the Albanian president raises the issue of  responsibility borne by the hosts for this verbal assault on the  FRY in the highest institution of Bulgarian democracy, the  protest underlines.    We express our deepest regret at the fact that such a  possibility was granted to a man well known for his advocacy of  the war option in the Balkans, a man who is voluntarily offering  everybody -- primarily Turkey -- bases and strongholds for  military operations against the FRY, it is said in the protest.    The Albanian president is disseminating lies about the  creation of a Greater Serbia in order to conceal his own program  for the creation of a Greater Albania, which, besides Kosmet  [Kosovo and Metohija], would include western Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and parts of  Montenegro. According to the protest, the most glaring untruths  in Berisha's speech in the Bulgarian Assembly related to Kosmet,  because, it is said, the Albanian population there neither  numbers two million nor has their autonomy been abolished.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ATA understands that for Kansas, a single trip permit would normally be issued for ``occasional use'' purposes. It is clear that the intent of the (SVC) permit was for multiple trip purposes and not occasional ``one or two trips.'' The permit had been applied for long before the freeze language was proposed. It was only a matter of timing that so few trips were made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is nothing in the ISTEA legislative history that clarifies the meaning of ``regular or periodic basis,'' but the ATA's interpretation is plausible, especially in view of the Caltrans' response to the SNPRM. The Caltrans stated that it <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [I]ssued two permits, at the request of the California Legislature, allowing two vehicle combinations with three 26.5-foot trailers to operate from October 27 to November 5, 1971. These vehicle combinations had an overall length of 94.25 feet with gross vehicle weights of 76,800 pounds and 90,000 pounds. The 1971 permits were issued to gather information on truck tractor and triple trailer combination operations. The information was used to consider whether triple combination operations should be allowed in California. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1983, the Caltrans issued permits for operational tests of (1) a 111,000-pound ``Triple'' (28-foot trailers) between October 24&hyph;28; (2) a 106,850-pound ``Rocky Mountain Double'' (48-foot semitrailer, 28-foot pup) between November 7&hyph;10; and (3) a 122,650-pound ``Turnpike Double'' (two 48-foot trailers) between November 14&hyph;18. The Caltrans argued that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> California retains the right to issue an extralegal permit for good cause to operate a divisible combination of vehicles exceeding the maximum size or weight limits with specific guidance provided by the California Legislature. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The brief tests performed by California one and two decades ago, which never resulted in the authorization of LCV's, are certainly among the minimal operations that the requirement for ``regular or periodic'' use was intended to exclude. The FHWA has therefore declined to list these vehicles in appendix C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kansas and Yellow Freight, on the other hand, clearly expected LCV's to use I&hyph;70 routinely and for years to come, and made elaborate preparations on that basis. In addition, the KDOT's efforts to cooperate with the FHWA delayed the issuance of the first permits, which would otherwise have been available in March 1991. On balance, the FHWA believes that the SVC operations on I&hyph;70 satisfy the statutory standard. The Goodland route has therefore been restored to appendix C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CRASH commented on the accuracy of the lists of routes available to the different vehicle combinations. Appendix C now reflects the proper route listings. Due to the SVC and Turnpike operations, the truck tractor and three trailing unit combination does have more route mileage available to it than do two trailing unit combinations. The new route lists show that I&hyph;70 between the Colorado State Line and Goodland is available only to SVC's with three trailing units and not to LCV combinations with two trailing units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> LEGAL CITATIONS: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One change has been made at the request of the State. KSA&hyph;8&hyph;1915 has been moved from the list of applicable statutes for two trailing unit combinations to the list for three trailing unit combinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> MASSACHUSETTS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CRASH commented that the cargo-carrying length listed in the SNPRM for the ``Turnpike Double_LCV'' was incorrectly listed as 114 feet. This figure is the overall length previously allowed for this configuration. Applying the convention for determining cargo-carrying length used throughout this rulemaking, 10 feet will be deducted for the tractor. The cargo-carrying length now shown in appendix C for the truck tractor and two trailing unit combination is 104 feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

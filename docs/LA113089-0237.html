			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ELWAY AMONG N. ARIZ. APPLICANTS  </P> <P> Former Stanford and San Jose State Coach Jack Elway is among 77 people who have  applied for the job as Northern Arizona's football coach, school officials  said.  </P> <P> A 12-member search committee started reviewing the applications Monday, and  officials said Wednesday that a new coach could be named as early as this  weekend.  </P> <P> The vacancy occurs because Larry Kentera announced Nov. 7 that he is resigning  after his fifth season.  </P> <P> Tom Jurich, Northern Arizona's athletic director, said that among the people  who have applied besides Elway are USC defensive coordinator Chris Allen;  Arizona defensive coordinator Larry Mac Duff; former NFL quarterback John  Hadel, now a receivers coach at Kansas; Arizona State receivers Coach Don  Bocchi; Western New Mexico Head Coach Bob O'Mera; West Virginia defensive  coordinator Bob Shaw, and Boise State defensive coordinator John Gough.  </P> <P> "I think it's a really strong field," Jurich said. "I think it's a credit to  the university that we can attract those kinds of people."  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Gardening: Heading for the last Roundup - Poisoning, pruning and planting, that's the programme for Easter Early Easters are a blessing for gardeners and this one rounds off a miraculous March. The wind might have been strong but spring flowers are running in the fast lane. The flowering cherries have gone mad and nobody, not even in Eden, can ever have had a better Saturday than last weekend's. If Easter repeats that, even non-gardeners will wonder what they can best do outside. If you trust them, put them to work on the three essential 'p's' in horticultural life - poisoning, pruning and planting. The indispensable poison is still Roundup, which is the correct starting point for anyone with a new garden or plans for a new bed. I emphasise this every year because it kills by contact with greenery, not by lingering in the soil. It wipes out rough grass, dandelions, nettles and buttercups and shakes up everything unwanted, annihilating annual weeds. Conditions are perfect for its use this weekend. Your worst enemies are bursting ahead of themselves into frantic early growth and, if you choose a dry spell of a few hours, you can round them up and reckon that one or two applications will kill them by the end of the month. My own Easter enemies have two origins: the wet winter and the surrounding lawn. The exceptional rains have turned almost everybody's lawns into pile carpets of uninvited moss. It might look soft and cuddly this weekend but, in a normal June, the entire carpet will die and turn brown, and the lawn will look fearful. I am intending to strike first with Maxicrop Moss Killer, raking out the debris at the end of the month. The lawn bothers me for a different reason. After six years of frantic upheaval on my new site, I now see that nature has quickly diagnosed one of my great blind spots. I made flower beds in the lawn and did not edge them with a solid barrier against the adjacent grass. It intrudes with amazing cunning and the buttercups are unspeakable. If you are cutting out a new bed of any size, it pays to edge it with a solid barricade, something much firmer than the strips of thin metal which are palmed off on 'front gardeners' by DIY stores. In Oxford, my predecessors in the years of academic splendour edged the lawns with long runs of solid metal, 3in wide and  1/2 in thick. Metalworkers or blacksmiths will quote you a price for special orders in quantity, but we have come down a grade in the Patten-Major era and now are using long lengths of treated timber,  3/4 in thick and 4in wide. They are held firm by pegs knocked at intervals into their undersides and hammered down into the ground. The timber then sits at the level of the adjoining lawn but blocks all the invaders which try to violate your recognised boundaries. Wooden edging will last for 10 to 15 years, by which time we may be back with an age of academic splendour, and metal can return. But anyone who is looking out on a new country garden this weekend is advised strongly to attend to a permanent edging for anything which they cut out as a border or flowerbed with the help of a spray and Roundup. If you and your helpers cannot face poison, you will probably take refuge in pruning. You might also have forgotten to prune your roses a month ago but, when you set about them belatedly, do please be more restrained. Hard pruning will delay their flowering now they are so far into growth. If you want to find a non-gardening husband something useful on which he can vent his aggression, direct him in a week or two's time to the forsythias, which have had such a superb season this year. Their flowering stems will need to be cut back immediately the flowers drop. Meanwhile, let him loose on dead wood, especially in the cistuses and deciduous ceanothus. If you have neither, point to an ordinary buddleia and let him hack that until it is reduced to a height of about 3ft. Meanwhile, I am fed up once again with the line between 'professionals' and 'amateurs' which is drawn in the garden trade. This carries the implication that 'ordinary' gardeners should never be allowed to use what professionals use in order to present the best possible plant to the market. For years, I have fiddled around with general fertilisers such as bone meal or the one to which every conservative heart will rally, Basic Slag. I now realise that professional growers pack the best plants which we buy in containers with slow-release fertilisers which put chemicals to the plant over a period up to two years, releasing them like rationed sweets to children. The best-known is Osmacote, but it is hard to scale down for use on one or two shrubs at a time. I have gone over to Agroblen because it comes in individual tablets which can be given like an aspirin to an orange blossom and will last for two years. A 10kg bucket cost me Pounds 29.25 (plus VAT) from every big gardener's sundries' supplier: Joseph Bentley, Beck Lane, Barrow-on-Humber, South Humberside DN19 7AQ. Enough of the practicalities. If it looks a bit bleak at home and the neighbours are doing wheelies on the mini-tractor, get into the car and head for an established arboretum or botanical garden. At Hilliers Arboretum, Ampsfield, Hampshire, those marvellous magnolias are flat out this week and almost peaking too soon. From Cornwall to the milder parts of Scotland, from Trewithen to Logan, the story is the same. Camellias, magnolias and early to mid rhododendrons are ahead of themselves marvellously. On my lime soil, if I could only plant one, it would have to be the pure white magnolia Soulangeana Alba, just opening to perfection without any stain from rain or severe frost as we all take a holiday weekend and exhaust ourselves instead, in the garden.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON MOSQUE DESIGN  </P> <P> Mosques and condos -- to the City Council, they're all the same! The council  appears incapable of making a decision where there are distinctions of purpose  and symbolism. I can't recall a house of worship in Los Angeles which "fits in"  to its neighborhood.  </P> <P> In fact, if churches in New England can be taken as an example, the mosque  ought to stand out as a place of spiritual refuge and regeneration.  </P> <P> Muslims ought to have houses of worship which suit their history and culture,  just as Jews and Christians get to have crosses, steeples and Stars of David.  The design suggested by the Muslim clergyman certainly seems no more unusual  than the designs of churches throughout the city.  </P> <P> However, this whole red herring gives me an idea. Perhaps a few onion domes on  the City Hall -- where our confused council meets -- would add at least the  appearance of wisdom and purpose.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Brazil's state groups face costs crackdown BRAZIL'S Economy Ministry has warned that state companies' failure to rein in spending could jeopardise the country's stabilisation programme, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. Under a programme agreed with the IMF, Brazil must produce an operating surplus of 1 per cent of GDP this year. However, preliminary figures for last year show the public sector deficit worsened to 2.25 per cent of GDP, mainly due to the failure of state companies to cut costs. Federal investments have been slashed, but few state companies met the requirement of last February's economic plan to reduce costs for 1991 by 10 per cent, according to ministry officials. Some even increased spending, appealing to the Treasury for extra funds. Many failed to make payments to the state social security fund, pushing it to the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the large state companies, such as Petrobras, started this year by granting generous salary increases to employees. A ministry official said yesterday: 'The state sector is out of control.' Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, economy minister, is expected to order a crackdown on costs and try to resolve the problem of state companies unable to service debt because they are owed money by other parastatals. He has already blocked the accounts of Eletrobras, the state electricity company, for not meeting debt payments and threatens the same for other offenders.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS, STILL IN HUNT, DEFEAT CARDINALS, 29-10  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins are making a late-season run at the playoffs, while the  lack of a rushing attack has killed the Phoenix Cardinals' chances.  </P> <P> Gerald Riggs and Earnest Byner each had one-yard scoring runs, and rookie  cornerback A.J. Johnson returned a third-quarter interception 59 yards for his  first NFL touchdown as Washington beat Phoenix, 29-10, Sunday to keep its  wild-card playoff hopes alive.  </P> <P> "We're not out of it by any means," Coach Joe Gibbs said after his Redskins  improved their record to 7-6, two games behind the NFC East-leading New York  Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. "There are still three games left. Anything can  happen."  </P> <P> Phoenix (5-8) lost its third straight game and second under interim head coach  Hank Kuhlmann. The Cardinals will have to win their last three games to avoid a  fifth-straight losing season.  </P> <P> Washington held Phoenix to a season-low 29 yards rushing on 16 carries, their  fifth game in a row under 100 yards and ninth game this year. The Cardinals  were held to 263 yards in offense.  </P> <P> The Redskins took a 10-0 lead on Chip Lohmiller's 29-yard field goal with 5:34  remaining in the first quarter and Byner's one-yard run at 3:31 into the second  quarter.  </P> <P> Phoenix tied the game, 10-10, on Al Del Greco's 27-yard field goal with 7:03  remaining in the second quarter and Earl Ferrell's one-yard touchdown run with  1:24 left in the half.  </P> <P> But Washington took the second-half kickoff and drove 61 yards in 11 plays,  with Riggs' touchdown putting the Redskins ahead to stay at 17-10.  </P> <P> Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien, who missed the first half's final minute after  spraining his left knee on a sack, completed 16 of 22 passes for 153 yards.  Doug Williams replaced Rypien and completed two of five passes for 22 yards and  threw one interception.  </P> <P> Byner rushed for 86 yards in 20 carries while Riggs had 39 in 12.  </P> <P> Phoenix quarterback Gary Hogeboom completed eight passes in 11 attempts for 131  yards before dislocating the index finger on his throwing hand eight minutes  before halftime.  </P> <P> Tupa took over and was 10 of 18 for 124 yards and two interceptions -- the  other by Wayne Davis in the Redskin end zone with 1:04 remaining in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Chip Lohmiller kicked a 24-yard field goal with 1:38 left in the game, and Tupa  was called for intentionally grounding the ball out of the end zone for a  safety with 53 seconds remaining.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish side is continuing its lack of political  will and its unacceptable delaying tactics regarding the  acceptance of the 21 March document. On its side, the Cyprus  Government, by showing its goodwill, has exhausted all limits.    This statement was made by Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Konstandinos Bikas, who concluded by noting that the UN  secretary general's report, expected to be submitted soon, will  record the actual situation.</p>

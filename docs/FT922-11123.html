			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Kathleen Ferrier Awards As the number of singing competitions multiplies, so the need becomes more pressing for each to attract public attention and the sponsorship necessary for large prizes. There has been some ungainly leap-frogging this year, as each competition tries to keep a nose ahead of its rivals. On Friday it was the final of the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship, founded in 1953 and the most senior of the awards. This is the 80th anniversary of Ferrier's birth (how heartening to find all her recordings available on CD), though that will not have been the only reason for the enhanced profile of the competition this year. The prize money was well up; and television cameras were noisily present, always choosing just the wrong moment to change their films or shift across the hall to get a better angle. The venue had also been changed to St. John's, Smith Square, while the Wigmore Hall is closed. For the ten finalists this will not have been a minor consideration: St. John's is a difficult hall for singers, given to long reverberance even when it is as well filled as it was on Friday, and the competitor with the larger voice is likely to be at an advantage. At first it seemed an equal and not very impressive line-up. Then two candidates of outstanding quality followed one after the other: the baritone Nathan Berg and the contralto Alice Coote. Berg, who had already taken a prize in the BP Peter Pears Competition last year, is fast becoming the complete artist and his expressive voice is matched by an increasingly mature musicianship, memorably so in his Mahler song. Coote had the larger voice, firm and strong in tone, enunciating those fateful words 'Es ist vollbracht' from Bach's St. John Passion with a chilling air of finality. A choice between the two was difficult. I would have been tempted to proclaim a tie, with third prize going to the baritone Gwyn Hughes Jones, whose singing of Verdi's Don Carlos, impressively long-breathed if less striking as pure voice, made a stirring end to the evening. The judges felt differently, as invariably happens when their impressions have been formed over the whole week of the competition. First prize went to Gwyn Hughes Jones; second, though only a whisker behind, Nathan Berg; and third, Alice Coote. All three should have successful careers in front of them.</p>

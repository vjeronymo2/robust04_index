			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Irena </F> Satavova and Eva Klvacova; place and date not given: "Ten `Whys'  for Vaclav Klaus"]    [Text] The first interview by EKONOM in the new year  was the already traditional discussion with Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus about issues concerning the economic transformation  and its progress. This time our questions were directed at the  deeper pivotal connections of the reform, at the logic for  selecting the individual systemic measures.    [EKONOM] Why is the Czech Republic being acknowledged as the  most successful of the former socialist countries after three  years of the economic transformation? Do you see the main reason  more in the relatively favorable starting position of our  economy, or do you think the chosen transformation strategy was  decisive?    [Klaus] That question has two parts: first, distinguishing  between what was a kind of gift from the past and what was our  own doing, and second, determining the factors that played the  key role in the transformation process.    I tend to play down the view that we are doing well simply  because during the First Republic there was a democratic  tradition here and a good level of industrial production.  Naturally, it is a question of degree and quantitative  calculation, but my assessment of the ratio between the past and  the present is 2:8. I think the absolutely key factor was that  we succeeded in choosing precisely at this time the only correct  and the only possible way. Given the same kind of past, if the  concept of one of the "third" ways had prevailed, then today we  would be exactly where the other postcommunist countries are now.    The general answer I can give to the other part of the  question is that the uniqueness of our transformation process is  the interplay of our political and economic factors. The notion  that to achieve success only the political factors and the  velvetness of the revolution would suffice, or that being a  little bit better economists than the others would be enough, is  not right. I believe that the magic and the charm lies precisely  in the mutual interplay that makes possible an upward-leading  process. If this interplay is poor it creates a vicious circle  of hopelessness, which is precisely where many postcommunist  countries find themselves.    [EKONOM] Why, in spite of a number of problems of which  every  citizen is to some extent aware, there still exists a large  measure of consensus on the reform among the majority of the  population? Do you think it is due to the fact that the reform  was measured out in the right doses or to the fact that people  were able to recognize that the chosen way is correct...?    [Klaus] I think that the consensus is the result of a very  open, clear, and forceful reform policy, and of the fact that we  simply managed to sell our basic concept which we promulgated  and are promulgating. Using the terminology of your journal, we  could say that we were good salesmen of our concept of the  reform and that we marketed it very well. We are talking about a  kind of perpetual election campaign, incessant explanations,  arguments, and influencing of the public. That has not happened  and is not happening now in the other postcommunist countries.    [EKONOM] Why is there in the Czech Republic, in spite of the  decline in production, a significantly lower unemployment rate  than to the west and the east of us? Is it because of the growth  of the private, especially the service, sector, or because, in  the thus-far unprivatized enterprises, overemployment still  persists?    [Klaus] From Milton Friedman I learned to always distinguish  permanent quantities which have their fixed, long-term value,  from transitory quantities which deviate in the short term from  some level that holds over the long run. Our temporary  unemployment rate is now evidently below this long-term value,  at which it will stabilize itself in time. In that respect, the  short-term movement in the unemployment rate will certainly be  upward, but it will be a continuous and moderate movement within  the range of a few percent, not a big jump.    As far as the causes of the favorable short-term  unemployment  rate are concerned, in my view there are three. One stands apart  from the economic mechanism and belongs more in the category of  the societal and social climate in the country. I evaluate it  with the help of the participation rate (share of the employed  or those looking for employment among the able-to-work  population) which, thanks to historical, ideological, as well as  peculiarly specific traditions, has been extremely high here.  Its decline to the level usual in other countries is the natural  consequence of the democratization process. The remaining two  factors, of which one is positive and the other negative, are  economic. The positive one is the tremendous dynamics of the  nascent private sector which succeeded in absorbing a  considerable part of the released labor force. From the  structural point of view, there has been an evident outflow of  the work force from the primary and secondary sectors to the  service sector, which is very labor intensive. That, after all,  also made possible the tourist boom here, while at the same time  being financed by the tourist boom. The third, this time  negative, element is the survival of the phenomenon called in  the economic literature "labor hoarding." It is known from the  standard course of an economic cycle in the West, when during a  recession and a fall in demand production declines much more  than employment, because companies hope that it will be better  for them to keep their skilled workforce and not have to look  when demand goes up again for new people whom they would have to  train. Labor hoarding here has many causes. Today, from my  position as prime minister I would not presume to determine  whether this is a standard, in its own way a rational,  phenomenon or a specific behavior by the present and former  state enterprises, and I have a feeling that not even your  magazine's independent experts have enough arguments to do that.    [EKONOM] Why, even after the law on bankruptcy and  settlement  went into full effect, are there no bankruptcies? Do you suppose  it is because of the nonexistence of real, private creditors,  the interlinkage of the banking sphere and the enterprises, or  the overload in the courts?    [Klaus] Bankruptcy is not some desired economic phenomenon.  The economic phenomenon we want is restructuring. It has many  forms: enterprises divide, combine, some grow, some fail  spectacularly, and the notion that the only correct form of  restructuring is a bankruptcy is simply fundamentally wrong. I  believe that a critic of the restructuring process of the Czech  economy should assess the rate of this process while keeping in  mind that the absolute number of bankruptcies is only a very  imprecise indicator of it. Those who connect these two phenomena  are making a terrible analytical mistake.    Which indicator of the restructuring do I consider better  than the number of bankruptcies? I would offer any number of  them. For example, the number of available jobs on the labor  market, which, however, are poorly recorded in the statistics,  or the rate of labor turnover. The correlation between them and  the number of restructured enterprises says more than a mere  number of bankruptcies, which is only the tip of the iceberg.    [EKONOM] Why was it possible to maintain during the entire  period since December 1990 a stable exchange rate of the Czech  koruna and not find ourselves in the vicious circle: imported  inflation--general inflation--imbalance in the balance of  payments--further devaluation? What arguments can be used to  counter the demand for the revaluation of the exchange rate, in  favor of which speaks the undervaluation of the exchange rate in  relation to the parity of the buying power, and how to resist  the pressure from the lobby of exporters calling for further  devaluation?    [Klaus] Fundamental for the success of the reform was to  create what I would call a cushion--that is a sufficient  difference between the real exchange rate and what is usually  hypothetically called parity of the buying power. In other  words, the economic exchange rate had to be placed on its  marginal, not the average, level. Its stability during the 36  months proved that our choice of the starting rate of exchange  was absolutely correct. Since that time it has been continually  strengthening, in other words, the real exchange rate is  increasing even though the nominal rate remains constant. We  succeeded, therefore, in fulfilling the announced prerequisite  of having the nominal exchange rate become the anchor of the  entire economic system, the single fixed point around which  other quantities revolve, not the other way around.    As far as the devaluation or revaluation pressures are  concerned, they reflect the fact that various economic entities  stand on various sides of the market and each pushes its own  interests. The magic of the market lies in the fact that a  partisan interest must not and cannot prevail, as long as there  is not in power an obtuse and bumbling government which would  allow itself be influenced by those lobbyists. I believe that  with our government no such danger exists. But it would be an  absolute mistake to assume that our exchange rate is rigid.  Although the nominal exchange rate is firm the real exchange  rate is growing stronger, so that actual revaluation goes on  continually. But I do not think that there should be a nominal  revaluation.    [EKONOM] Why was it necessary to resort to wage controls?  Don't you have the feeling that the thus far unprivatized  enterprises, to which it should mainly apply, do not take wage  regulation very seriously, while private entrepreneurs use it as  a shield against the demands of their employees?    [Klaus] In the ideal market, after the entire transformation  in its macro and micro dimensions is completed, wage regulation,  of course, makes no sense and has no justification. We are not  yet in a situation where stable market relations exist; when the  government analyzed the developments in the wage situation, the  movement of the wages caused it justified concern. Although  after the price liberalization a so-called second transformation  cushion was created, when the average real wage fell below the  average labor productivity, since the initial months of 1991 a  process of real wage increases began. A faster increase of wages  over prices is in this situation of emptying the cushion logical  and quite all right, the only disturbing thing is its rate--and  that was, in our opinion, considerably exceeded in 1993 and did  nothing else but increase inflation and worsen our economic  position abroad. Therefore the government resorted, even though  it was not very happy about it, to this unpopular step, and the  minute it is under the impression that it can retreat from it,  it will do so without delay. A country which quickly increases  its real wages pushes itself out of the market. We know many  cases where this happened--we can name, for example, the former  GDR after the unification of Germany or the latest developments  in Slovenia--which should serve as a warning.    And as far as the fact that some "escape" from the wage  regulation, well, every regulation has its drawbacks. Economic  policy has, always and everywhere, its two dimensions: one sends  a psychological signal and the other has the effect of blocking  or making something impossible. These exist parallel to each  other even in the case of wage regulation. Which one of them has  a stronger effect I cannot say exactly, but I believe that there  is a certain effect.    [EKONOM] Why is it necessary to maintain a balanced budget  and not allow a deficit budget, when all West European countries  work with one. In this connection the case often cited is that  of the United States, which has one of the greatest indebtedness  in the world and which at the same time was one of the first to  get out of the current recession?    [Klaus] All parents know the standard question of their  children: Why do I have to be home by nine when all other  children are allowed to stay out until eleven? Remember the  answer you give them, and my answer to your question is not that  different. Just because somebody else does something differently  does not necessarily mean that it is good and that we have to do  the same no matter what. It is absolutely clear that to run a  deficit in the state budget, when we borrow at the cost of  somebody else in the future, is bad policy. Let nobody confuse  it with an individual's decision to take out a loan, which is  made by one and the same person who knows that he himself will  have to repay that loan. The decision of the state as a whole is  something entirely different than such a decision which carries  individual responsibility, and the state today and 20 years  later, when the loan may have to be repaid, is not an identical  entity. And that a deficit leads to inflation, which is another  form of taxation on a number of economic entities, is also  absolutely clear.    [EKONOM] Why was it possible to make the assumption that  this  year the inflation will be only in the single digits? Is such  expectation realistic?    [Klaus] To inflation applies the theory that less inflation  is better then more inflation, and no inflation is the best.  Why? The entire economic system is held together by a general  equivalent--money. In fulfilling its function as a measure of  value it should be stable. If we have inflation, the measure is  no longer made of steel but of rubber, which sometimes  stretches, sometimes contracts. But we need to work with  economic quantities about which we know what value they have  today and what value they will have tomorrow, the day after  tomorrow, in a week, in a year. That stability of values, made  possible by minimizing inflation, is an enormous economic good.  Not mentioning the fact that many of us have fixed incomes which  are devalued by inflation. These are standard textbook arguments  and are no exaggeration, as they may appear to some.    When I declare that inflation will be in the single digits  this year I am not arguing about percentages, I am stating above  all the following: inflation will be visibly lower than in 1993  when it approached 20 percent.    [EKONOM] Why are many prices still regulated by the  government? To what extent is it a question of the social  tolerability of the reform and to what extent a question of  subsidizing monopolies?    [Klaus] Undoubtedly, some prices are still regulated by the  government, but there are not many of them. In comparison with  many West European countries we are a country that is regulated  less rather than more. I am not aware that the basic objective  of regulation is to struggle with the monopolies. It is rather a  question of a general tolerability of the reform. Prices must be  adjusted during the entire transformation process toward their  final point, which we can define as the world prices, only  slowly (that is, after all, another rule of transformation). We  are all angry at Skoda-Volkswagen when it wants to sell vehicles  for world prices calculated by the exchange rate. That is simply  nonsense, which, unfortunately, many of those gentlemen do not  understand. I would not confine the reasons for changing prices  gradually only to the social aspect, because far more important  is the economic aspect: increasing the price of a railroad  ticket to the level of world prices would not mean just that  some will stop riding the trains because it is socially  intolerable for them, but the next day the railroad would perish  because it would cease to be used by those for whom it is  economically intolerable. And it is precisely in cases of some  of the more or less badly structured branches that is is useful  to have the state help keep the adjustment process gradual by  regulating prices.    [EKONOM] Why, in spite of the fact that the private sector  is  growing very rapidly and shared in the creation of GDP in the  third quarter of 1993 by more than 60 percent, is the decline in  industrial production continuing? Data for the first three  quarters of 1993 showed a decline of 5.2 percent, and in  construction 4.1 percent, in comparison with the same period  last year. What is the reason?    [Klaus] Statistical data that describe this phenomenon may  be  correct, maybe not. If they are correct, then all I can say is  that the process of eliminating the economically unhealthy  production for which there is no demand has simply not yet ended  in our economy. Nothing more, nothing less. It is a different  matter, however, if the numbers do not give us the correct  information. And I can make serious arguments for thinking that  this is the case.    First, we have here an enormous problem with the master  database. Every statistician knows that the most important thing  is to have a permanent master database with which to work.  Thanks to the restructuring and privatization there have been  some unreal changes in our database of enterprises, and I do not  believe that with all these transformations every enterprise is  submitting statistical reports compatible with those they had  submitted in the previous year. If we grant that the error could  be on the order of 1-2 percent, which, for every statistician,  is a perfect result, just such an error means that the GDP in  the third quarter of 1993 registered not a decline of 5 percent  but an increase of 1 percent, for example.    The second factor is the more precise evidential capability  of the natural quantities than of the value quantities.  Therefore, no matter how paradoxical it sounds, I also pay  careful attention to quantities in the current prices, and I put  big question marks over the quantities in the constant prices.  The complexity of constructing price indexes is so enormous that  an error in the category of 1-2 percent is completely negligible  and rather tends to be much greater. The third argument in favor  of my assertion is that in all cases individual statistical  indicators measure only the gross rate, not the net quantities.  The question of what is getting rid of the "wheel spinning" in  any number of economic activities and what really is a decline  in the net product, that for me is an unknown and statistically  not recordable phenomenon. It leads me to the conclusion that  the information, for example, about the decline in GDP during  the first three quarters of 1993 by 0.9 percent says absolutely  nothing to me, it only evokes the problem of political  vindication and explanation of that number.</p>

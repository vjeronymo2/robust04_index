			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Travel: Under the volcano, the real Mexico erupts - Nicholas Woodsworth flees a sanitised haven of luxury in search of the noise and bright colours of the traditional frontier towns - and the mountain that shadows them 'FUMAROLAS,' said the Mexican gentleman sitting on the aircraft beside me. Was he talking about some local brand of cigars, I wondered? He was a big, middle-aged man with a heavy black moustache and a large girth: just the type, I thought, who at the end of this non-smoking flight might be badly missing his favourite cigars. 'Fumarolas,' he said again, this time tapping the plexiglass window beside my head. I looked out, and far below saw a cone-shaped mountain rising high above the surrounding hills. From its summit a long trail of white vapour tailed horizontally in the wind. 'Es el Volcan de Fuego,' said the big man, buckling his seat belt for our descent. 'Esta un cono eruptivo y constantamente emite fumarolas.' Not even a hopeless Spanish speaker like me could fail to understand. As the volcano receded In the distance and the aircraft headed earthwards to Manzanillo and the Pacific coast, the image of that long white tail of vapour lingered, bright against the dark green jungle beneath it. The luxury hotel Las Hadas sits at one end of the wide, sweeping Bay of Manzanillo. At the other end, across four or five miles of bright blue water, you can see the port city of Manzanillo itself, a silhouette of cranes, shipping piers and freighters riding at anchor. Perched on the steeply sloping edge of a small peninsula and surrounded by walls and gates, the resort is a little world unto itself. Las Hadas has everything - tennis and golf, bars and restaurants, marinas and beaches, shops, beauty parlours, doctors and church services. Exclusive in the true sense of the word, Las Hadas has everything, in fact, except Mexico itself. Most of the guests are American. They vacation at Las Hadas not to come to Mexico but to get away from Chicago, Philadelphia or Kansas City. Struggling to catch up with the Japanese has its price - most Americans have only two weeks' holiday a year, and it shows. Captains of industry arrive, pale and drawn, and are received by smiling staff in red fezzes and white uniforms. Silent electric golf carts ferry them to rooms where bouganvillia-covered patios overlook the bay. Once installed, they collapse at pool-side, not moving very much more than the captive green iguanas that sit sunning themselves on the little island in the middle of the pool. The last thing the guests at Las Hadas want is noise, bustle and that mixture of pleasures and irritations which, in unpredictable measure, lie in the vast country that is outside the hotel gates. Like everyone else at Las Hadas, I fed the iguanas red hibiscus flowers and drank coco-loco cocktails sitting on an underwater stool at the pool bar. I wandered through the white-washed architecture - domes, arches, towers and terraces - that lends to the resort its Moorish village theme. I browsed through the souvenir shops at the shopping arcade. I tried lunch at the Oasis beach restaurant, a sunset aperitif at the Legazpi piano bar, and a seafood dinner at The Dolphins restaurant. It was all undeniably pleasant. But unlike everyone else, I had one simple problem. Not having worn myself ragged through 50 consecutive weeks of merciless battle with the Japanese, I found myself the tiniest bit bored. This was relaxing perhaps, but it was not Mexico. I wanted noise, movement, colour and the country outside the Las Hadas gates. So I rented a car. I was thinking of the volcano and its long white trail of vapour. * * * Mexico is like any part of the world where holiday-makers come for warm ocean water and sunny beaches: leave the coast and head inland and in a surprisingly short time the traffic, crowds, bars, restaurants, hotels, condominiums and time-share apartments disappear. Less than 15 minutes behind Manzanillo, where the heavily commercialised coastal plain suddenly gives way to steeply-rising hills, I felt myself moving into an older, more traditional Mexico. A dramatic change came over the country as I rose above the humid coast. The country became drier and more sparsely covered. The leached tropical red soils of the littoral gave way to grassland. Corn grew tall in roadside fields. Cactus appeared. Cattle wandered in herds. By the time I leveled off on a plateau high over the coast, the air was cool, clear and scintillating, and I was in the open rangeland of cowboy country. As I drove through the town of Colima in the centre of the plain I saw, looming over the twin spires of the town's baroque cathedral, the skyward-rising flanks of the Volcan de Fuego. Built by the Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortes in 1527, Colima is one of Mexico's oldest settlements. Cattle ranching and farming on the surrounding plain have done it well. Proof of its wealth are the shiny new pick-up trucks that roll into town when a day's work is over. Driven by smiling Mexican ranchers wearing cowboy hats and silver-and-turquoise belt buckles, they blast music far and wide through open windows as if to announce their happy prosperity. But it will take more than prosperity to change Colima. Although only 30 miles from tourist seaside resorts, its colonial churches and plazas are rarely visited by foreigners, and its frontier flavour remains strong. The greater the distance I drove from the coast, the further back in time I seemed to move. Outside Colima I began to climb again, following a road that made its way first past sloping corn fields and pastures, and then wound upwards through green jungle of broken hills and narrow valleys. An hour later I was at last under the volcano. From 20,000 ft in the air, the Volcan del Fuego had looked perfectly smooth, featureless and still. Now, looking upwards from its base, I saw a steep world that was rough, wild and full of life. Wildflowers - bright orange, yellow and blue - grew in masses along the roadside. Whole trees were picked out with blooms, and long-tailed birds perched in their branches. More spectacular yet were the butterflies that flitted about in their thousands, some tiny, some so large they looked like white handkerchiefs being jerked in the air by an invisible hand. But this was a human world as well. Riding horses fitted with high, wooden-pommeled saddles, dour and silent Indians followed by packs of dogs filed along the roadside carrying loads of maize or firewood home to adobe villages. Higher on what had now become a rough dirt road, the villages - smokey, low and mud-built - seemed to revert to some prehistoric existence. Higher still, where the road became a track, the mountainside took on its most primordial aspect: just six months before, large swathes of the volcano's upper slopes had been scarred by the lava burns of a violent eruption. But I was not interested in travelling too far back in time. In the small hillside village of Comala, where ashes from the eruption had rained down on cobbled streets, red-tiled roofs and the shady gardens of walled courtyards, peasants in white cotton were celebrating the fiesta of the Virgin of Guadaloupe. In the village's main square, scores of horses tied to hitching posts stood in the sun flicking their tails at flies. Hot and sweaty, their scent mingled with that of the square's flowering roses and the odour of tortillas cooking in cantinas behind arched collonades. Like the horse's straw-hatted riders, I took refuge in the shade there, and feasted on bean and guacamole tacos and a strong red punch made from tequila and pomegranates. Out in the middle of the plaza, under the cupola of a band-stand surrounded by milling crowds, tall coconut palms and trees bright with oranges, a uniformed brass band played Mexican marching music. From the church opposite, where a winged angel perched between two tall spires, swelling organ music drifted through open doors. At the tables immediately around me, strolling guitar and accordion players sang loud rancheros, the vibrant, simple music of the Mexican countryside. It was the most cheerful, clashing, and confusing of seranades. It did not matter. Here, under the volcano, was every movement, colour and noise any fugitive from a peaceful seaside resort could wish for. I had found Mexico. There are no direct flights between the UK and Mexico. The most convenient routes are via Dallas and Miami. Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Mexico with American Airlines: (London tel: 081-572-5555), which offers excursion fares to a number of Mexican west coast destinations for around Pounds 600. In Manzanillo, Woodsworth was the guest of Las Hadas Hotel, PO BOX 158, Manzanillo, tel 30-000, telex 62506. Car hire for inland excursions is available through major agencies, but somewhat pricy at around Dollars 80 (Pounds 44) per day. Information about travel in Mexico can be had from the Mexican Tourist Office, 60 Trafalgar Square, London WC2N 5DS, tel: 071-734-1058.</p>

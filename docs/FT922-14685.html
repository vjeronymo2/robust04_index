			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Ambulance crews win pay award NORTHUMBRIA Ambulance Service, one of the first ambulance services to have become a self-governing trust, has awarded employees a 5 per cent pay award from April 1. The award, the first local deal in the ambulance service, is higher than the settlement offered to ambulance workers who are either not employed by trusts or who have not accepted trust terms and conditions. They have national negotiating machinery and this week they were made a final offer of 4.75 per cent or Pounds 400, whichever was the greater.</p>

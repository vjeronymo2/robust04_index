			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Clarke arrives in Brussels MR Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, arriving at yesterday's finance ministers' meeting in Brussels. Mr Clarke said before his departure that he intended to make a 'friendly and constructive' contribution to the talks. Britain withdrew from the ERM last September and has since called for rectification of 'fault lines' in the system. It was in a position, Mr Clarke said, to say to its other European partners: 'We did tell you so.' Mr Clarke, accompanied by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'We are, in a way, observers making sure that no fallout occurs which damages Britain or brings unnecessary uncertainty and instability.' He hoped arrangements could be made which would maintain recovery prospects for other European economies and which would avoid the turbulence and uncertainty damaging business confidence.</p>

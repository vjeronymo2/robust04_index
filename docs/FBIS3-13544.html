The Islamic Resistance, Hizballah's armed wing, said "a  Merkava tank exploded and a truck fell into the valley in  flames" in the attack at the entrance to al-Shaqif Castle in  Israel's self-declared security zone.    Lebanese security services confirmed the attack but could  provide no information on eventual casualties.    Israeli tanks and artillery then shelled woods and the area  around villages opposite the Crusader-era castle while Israeli  helicopter gunships machinegunned targets in the region, police  said.    There were no immediate reports of casualties following the  Israeli attacks.</p>

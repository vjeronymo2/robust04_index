			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: MAS hits financial turbulence - Malaysian carrier's latest results are seen as dismal SOMETHING seems to be going wrong in the cockpit at Malaysian Airline System (MAS). In recent years, the carrier has gained a reputation as one of the world's more ambitious airlines. At a time when many airlines are pruning services and rescheduling aircraft deliveries, MAS is in the middle of a full throttle expansion programme. New routes have been opened and capacity has been expanded. In the course of its present five-year plan to 1996-97, MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn (Dollars 4.13bn). However, the airline's latest results - for the year ended March and released at the weekend - suggest that MAS has flown into some nasty financial turbulence. Pre-tax profit was MDollars 157m, up 32 per cent on 1991-92. But the result is well under half the MDollars 372m pre-tax return forecast by MAS at the end of last year when the airline raised Dollars 700m via Malaysia's biggest rights issue. The year's profit includes a MDollars 337.1m profit from the sale of two Boeing 737-200s and five McDonnell Douglas DC10-30s. If these are stripped out, MAS falls into a pre-tax loss of MDollars 180m. All the aircraft involved in the sale were disposed of on a lease-back basis: MAS has to pay substantial amounts in lease payments to continue operating the aircraft. 'The sale of the aircraft might have brought the figures into the black,' said one analyst. 'But there's no getting away from it - these are dismal results.' Mr Zain Azraai, MAS chairman, said there had been a sharp drop in passenger and cargo traffic due to the continuing recession in the main industrialised countries. Intense competition and over-capacity on many international routes had affected performance. With about 55 per cent of MAS's revenue denominated in foreign currencies, Mr Zain said the appreciation of the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, had caused problems. Two fires at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, one of which caused flight disruptions for nearly a month, had added to the woes of MAS. Analysts say MAS has expanded capacity too fast: the carrier's overall load factor - seen as an important performance indicator in the aviation industry  -has dropped to 62.9 per cent from the 65.9 per cent of 1991-92. MAS is more than 50 per cent controlled by the Malaysian government. Observers say that some recently opened international routes - to Mexico City and Johannesburg, for example - are more a reflection of the government's wish to project the country on the world stage than straightforward airline economics. MAS's extensive domestic network is a continuing drain on funds. The airline says it is mystified by a recent sharp drop in domestic passenger growth - down to 3.7 per cent in the second half of 1992-93 from 18 per cent in the first half. Domestic fare increases of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent during the year could be one factor behind the sudden drop in internal passenger traffic. The decline in passenger growth could also reflect a general slowing down in Malaysia's economy, which has been growing at a rate of more than 8 per cent in each of the past five years. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, recently proposed setting up a second airline, mainly to handle domestic routes. Prospective operators are likely to be cautious in light of these MAS results. MAS says it is examining ways to slow planned additions to capacity, including deferring delivery of some new aircraft and early termination of some aircraft leases. There are rumours that the airline will be forced into another cash call, probably next year. MAS remains locked into an expansion programme which will see its fleet increase from the present 80 aircraft to more than 100 in the next four years. Leased and ageing aircraft are being phased out to form what will be one of the world's most modern fleets. In 1992-93, MAS took delivery of 21 aircraft. In 1993-94 a further 28 airliners are scheduled to join the MAS fleet. 'Financing this expansion is a tremendous strain on MAS,' said an analyst. 'The next two years are going to be critical - finance costs will be peaking and it is vital that operating performance is improved. Proper utilisation of capacity is the main factor.' MAS defends its expansion as part of a long-term strategy. It says that in the years ahead the benefits will flow through, particularly as regional passenger traffic expands. Most other airlines are facing financial problems. But MAS's high-flying ambitions have received a bad jolt. Financial seat belts are likely to remain firmly fastened for some time to come.</p>

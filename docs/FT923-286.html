			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Pay gap 'widens' THE PAY GAP between the lowest and average earners in the UK this year is the greatest since records began in 1886, the Low Pay Unit said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. The unit, in its analysis of Department of Employment statistics, said the poorest 10 per cent of men working in manual jobs this year earned just 62.8 per cent of median earnings for this group, compared with 68.3 per cent in 1979. Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'Caught between the devil of recession and the deep blue sea of government labour-market policy, the working poor are increasing in numbers and declining in prosperity.' He warned that if the government abolishes wages councils, pay inequality would widen. That would especially affect women - who make up the majority of workers protected by councils. Wages councils set pay in some low-paid industries. The analysis also shows that - excluding overtime pay - nearly 10m employees, or four in 10 of the adult workforce, earned less than the Council of Europe's 'decency threshold' of Pounds 207.13 per week or Pounds 5.52 per hour. The threshold is 68 per cent of full-time average earnings.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish air crash hits sector's shares SHARES of leading Swedish companies linked to the country's military aerospace programme fell sharply yesterday after the spectacular crash of a JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft during an air display over central Stockholm on Sunday. The high-profile accident, in front of TV cameras and thousands of spectators at the city's annual water festival, casts a shadow over the future of the JAS project - and over Sweden's entire military aerospace programme. The project was already well behind schedule and over budget. Shares in Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company, fell hardest, dropping nearly 5 per cent to SKr139. Investor owns Saab-Scania, which is the leading participant in the JAS manufacturing consortium along with Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics, and FFV Aerotech (part of the newly-privatised Celsius group). Volvo's B shares fell SKr7 to SKr439 in early trading, although they later recovered some ground to end the day at SKr442. Celsius shares eased SKr2 early on, but closed unchanged at SKr155. The crash will increase the project's cost - which already exceeds SKr60bn (Dollars 7.6bn) - and add to the delays caused by the crash of a prototype JAS aircraft during its development phase in 1989. Only if the latest accident can be blamed squarely on pilot error will the consortium be able to avoid further rigorous testing and possible system changes. 'We are looking at a minimum delay of half a year,' said Mr Kjell Gothe, information officer for Swedish defence minister Anders Bjorck yesterday. He indicated that the extra costs would be borne by the manufacturers, not the government, although these would be subject to discussion. The JAS programme is well advanced, with orders for 140 aircraft from the Swedish air force already in place. For this reason alone the government is almost certain to resist calls for the project to be scrapped. Ironically, the first aircraft to be delivered, amid much pomp and ceremony in June, was the one which crashed on Sunday. The greater danger is that the manufacturers will now find it harder to win the export orders they need to make the JAS programme a commercial success. Consortium members have said they are aiming for orders for a total of 500 aircraft in the next 10 to 20 years. Although they have never identified potential export markets, countries in south-east Asia, Latin America, and central and eastern Europe, have all been mentioned. There was bitter disappointment last year when the Finnish government opted to buy 57 new F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas rather than from the JAS. Even before Sunday's crash, there were questions as to whether Sweden could maintain a viable military aerospace industry on its own, for all its undoubted high technological expertise. Greater emphasis has been placed on co-operation with foreign groups, and talks have been held with British Aerospace, Dassault of France, and Germany's Dasa, among a number of US and European defence companies. Mr Hans Ahlinder, managing director of the JAS industry group, said he could not say what impact the crash would have on the aircraft's costs and delivery schedule until investigators had established the cause of the accident. Investor also declined to comment, pending the investigation's outcome.</p>

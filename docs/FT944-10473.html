			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ingham falls to Pounds 853,000 after provision Ingham, the York-based motor parts, worsted spinning and property group, reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 853,000, for the six months to end September. Turnover was slightly ahead at Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 13.6m). The result included the provision for an exceptional administrative expense of Pounds 210,000. This was in respect of potential compensation payable to Mr Nicholas McMahon Turner, the former chief executive, for loss of office. Profits before tax and interest slipped in both the motor group and the property division, but more than doubled for the group's spinning company, in spite of a steady rise in wool prices. Earnings per share were down from 7.1p to 3.2p, with the interim dividend unchanged at 1.75p.</p>

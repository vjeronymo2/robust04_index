			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dilemmas of divorce THE DIVISION of assets after a divorce is one of the most fiercely-contested areas of family finance. For most married couples, the husband's pension rights form the most valuable possession after the family home. Where the house is still mortgaged, its net value often falls below that of the pension. More than one-third of UK marriages end in divorce. Yet, the law in England and Wales means pension rights are dealt with at the discretion of the courts. While discretion can provide a desirable degree of flexibility, it can also lead to uncertainty and apparently idiosyncratic judgments. By contrast the law in Scotland is clear on the division of the pension spoils. Under the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 'matrimonial property' specifically includes the proportion of pension and insurance rights accumulated during the marriage and, in most cases, these must be divided equally between the partners. However, even in Scotland, there is seen to be a need to revise the law to include a fairer method of splitting the pension rights other than through cash or instalment payments awarded by the courts. The UK government is under pressure to clarify the law on pensions and divorce. In recent years, several eminent authorities have put forward proposals but perhaps the most influential of these is the Pensions Management Institute (PMI) working group on pension and divorce set up in February. The group draws on the expertise of the legal profession, the government, pensions experts and consumer organisations. In April the group issued a consultation paper inviting evidence by the end of June. The group will present its findings early next year and recommend the most appropriate form of new legislation. Sir Alec Atkinson, chairman of the working group, identified four options for dividing pension rights: A cash payment (or its equivalent) from the partner with the most valuable pension rights; A transfer payment from the scheme of the partner with the most valuable pension rights, to create new rights in a separate pension scheme for the other partner; Achievement of this by reallocating benefit rights within the original scheme; or Earmarking a proportion of the benefits of the partner with the most valuable pension rights so that this proportion will become payable to the other partner on retirement. Whichever method is selected as the basis for new legislation, the question remains how pension rights should be calculated. Occupational schemes in the UK are either on a 'money purchase' or a 'final salary' basis. Under a money purchase scheme contributions are invested to build up a fund which, at retirement, is used to buy an annuity. With this arrangement it is relatively simple to split the accrued pension rights since an individual pot of money can be identified. However, most pension schemes in the UK are on a final salary basis where it is more difficult to calculate accrued benefits at a given time. Typically, under these schemes an employee builds up a pension at the rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service up to an Inland Revenue maximum of 40/60ths, or two thirds final salary (in some cases subject to a final salary limit of Pounds 75,000 for the current tax year.) Sir Alec said: 'There are two methods by which actuaries arrive at figures in this area - one to arrive at the transfer value or cash equivalent, and the other to arrive at the past service reserve.' The transfer value or cash equivalent is calculated when an employee changes jobs and leaves the former pension scheme. Past service reserve is calculated in bulk transfers when, for example, the company has changed hands and the employees' pension rights are transferred into the new employer's scheme. While pension scheme members might feel more comfortable with the notion of a cash equivalent, this is usually worth less than the past service reserve. This is because the increases in the preserved pension for early leavers, which are used to calculate the cash equivalent, are limited by law to a maximum of 5 per cent per annum, whereas full salary inflation is assumed in the calculation of the past service reserve. While the PMI attempts to create equitable and practical legislation for pension rights on divorce, you should understand your rights under the current law. Anyone contemplating divorce should seek legal advice on pensions aspects. It is not only private or occupational pension rights that are affected by divorce. Under the basic state pension system a divorced woman who does not have a right to a pension in her own name can still claim a Category B pension under her former husband's National Insurance Contribution (NIC) record. However, if she remarries she loses this right and must claim under her new husband's NIC record. Moreover, the divorced woman has no claim to a state widow's pension on the death of her former husband even if he was supporting her financially at the time of his death. The rules under the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) are equally harsh since all benefits, including a widow's pension, are lost on divorce.</p>

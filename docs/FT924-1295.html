			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Barclays and NatWest downgraded THE senior debt ratings of Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank, the UK's two biggest banks, have been downgraded for the second time this year by Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency. The move reflects the damage done by the UK recession to each bank's loan book and profitability, as well as the long-term impact of greater competition in banking. Moody's new AA2 ratings, two notches below the top AAA ranking the banks held until earlier this year, bring the banks into line with the AA accorded them by rival agency Standard &amp; Poor's. Moody's pointed to Barclays' 'extended profit and asset quality weakness, and pressure on equity capital formation'. The protracted recession in the UK has pushed the bank's problem loans 'to historically high levels'. NatWest faces similar problems. 'Profitability and capital retention should remain depressed until 1994.' The ratings affect about Dollars 10bn of debt.</p>

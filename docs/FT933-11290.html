			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / EOC to probe sex bias claim from men THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission will launch its first formal investigation into the practices of an employment agency, following allegations by men that one agency refused to give them 'women's' jobs. The formal investigation into Halifax-based Workforce Employment Agency, which has branches in Leeds and Bradford, West Yorkshire, was announced by the EOC yesterday. The commission said it had received complaints from men alleging they had been refused jobs as packers. It was claimed the jobs were advertised as being in 'a predominantly female environment'. The EOC said it 'has reason to believe that the agency may be reserving jobs by sex so that women are also being disadvantaged. There are 14,701 agencies licensed by the Department of Employment. Any findings in this case may have an effect on other agencies. All agencies should operate and be seen to operate without regard to sex in all their activities.' The commission's annual report for 1992 disclosed that, for the first time, men were forming a large proportion of those claiming that companies were discriminating in their hiring policies. Of 1,253 complaints to the EOC, 40 per cent were from men. The investigation could take up to a year. In cases where the EOC finds discrimination has taken place, it can issue a notice telling the company to stop discriminating and then monitor activities for the next five years. The company refused to comment.</p>

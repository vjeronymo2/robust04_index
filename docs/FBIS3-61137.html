The initiating group, made up of members of the business  community, scholars, and attorneys, acquainted representatives  of the news media and accredited foreign journalists with the  "Liberal Program of Action." It explains why the members of the  initiating group united in the Liberal-Reformatory Alliance.    The future party will propose its own program, based on the  liberal doctrine which was and is the basis of modern Western  civilization and embodies the essence of the liberal democratic  reforms.    Advocating the establishment of freedom in an atmosphere of  law and order, the Liberal Alliance will strive to attain the  goals of its program in the political, economic, and social  spheres and will take action to strengthen the institutions of  the civic society, to foster decentralized government, and to  promote the encouragement, support, and legal protection of  private ownership.    The development of economic liberalism presupposes  denationalization through the privatization of state property  and the demonopolization of production.    The initiators of the Liberal-Democratic Party want to  create  the kind of social environment in which the majority of people  will live freely in an atmosphere of political and social  stability.    The reporters had many questions, and these were answered at  the press conference.</p>

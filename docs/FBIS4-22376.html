Eliyev.    In the directive the direction of talks between the State  Oil  Company of the Azerbaijan Republic and the Consortium of Western  companies was applauded. Authority was granted SOCAR for the  preparation and signing of an agreement on the exploitation of  the "Azeri" and "Chyrag" oil fields.    On Friday of last week Eliyev held a closed meeting in which  the Prime Minister, the SOCAR leadership, and specialists in the  petroleum industry participated. At the meeting, questions on  the discussion of a joint project for the exploitation of the  sea beds were examined.    It is known that following preparations done with Western  oil  companies in October 1993 talks were broken off. SOCAR made  known the fact that the "Manafov Plan" did not coincide with  Azerbaijan's interests.    In connection with this, the government issued a decree on  granting all authority for conducting the talks to SOCAR.    At the last meeting, the Company presented a packet of  proposals for improving the "Manafov Plan." No information was  given on the details of these proposals.    It is hoped that differences in the basic ideas on  exploitation and capital costs will be established. The  contractor is trying to gain capital investment quickly; as for  SOCAR, it is trying to gain the income stemming from the  realization of the "Manafov Plan."    The signing of an agreement by foreign companies on the  exploitation of the Caspian oil beds "Azeri" and Chyrag" is to  be extended for three years.    In the opinion of experts, there is as much as three  milliard  barrels in the oil fields.    According to the conditions of the contract, Western  companies will receive 20 percent, and Azerbaijan 80 percent of  the income.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The customs union and the payment agreement with the  Czech Republic were disadvantageous in many respects for  Slovakia, declared Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita  Schmoeglerova. According to the deputy prime minister, the  Czechs could not be blamed for this state of affairs. On the  contrary, the blame was attached to the former Slovak  Government, which was not well prepared for negotiations that  led to the conclusion of the agreements.    Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister of industry and trade, had  this to say to Czech Radio on the subject:    [Begin Dlouhy recording] I would need to know her comments  in  total. My opinion is, however, that the customs union is  advantageous for both sides because it has opened up markets for  us more than if we did not have one. I would not like to enter  into a discussion about the payment agreement--which, according  to press reports, was also contained in the comments made by the  deputy prime minister--but, regarding the customs union, I am  100-percent certain that it is advantageous for both sides.

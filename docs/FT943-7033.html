			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: S Daniels Pounds 244,000 in the red S Daniels, a supplier to the food manufacturing and baking industries, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 244,000 for the first half to June 30, which it attributed to 'unprecedented competitive pressure' and rationalisation costs. The company had forecast a loss for the period at its annual meeting in May. The previous first half saw a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25,000. Sales expanded by 15 per cent to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 16.7m), but the group said all divisions had experienced intense pressure on margins, particularly the bakery ingredients business of Kluman &amp; Balter. In addition, start-up costs were carried in connection to a new depot and relocation of the beverage packing facility. An exceptional item of Pounds 46,000 reflected the rationalisation of the head office and the raw materials division, which was expected to benefit the second half. Losses per share were 3p, against earnings of 0.3p.</p>

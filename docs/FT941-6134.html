			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Sheerness admits unfair dismissals Port of Sheerness conceded yesterday that it had unfairly dismissed 247 of its dock workers nearly a year ago when they refused to accept new terms and conditions of employment, including wage cuts of up to 60 per cent, Robert Taylor writes. The former dockers have been offered cash compensation that could amount to about Pounds 10,000 each, but they are not expected to secure re-instatement in their old jobs. The climbdown by the employers came unexpectedly on the third day of an industrial tribunal hearing into the case of the dismissed workers. The dispute at Sheerness erupted after the privatisation of the port in 1991. The workers alleged that they were told by the new company that they would be made redundant if they rejected sweeping cuts in their pay and benefits. When they started a work-to-rule they were dismissed, although with redundancy. Their jobs have since been taken by others under the new terms and conditions. Mr Keith Watson, an official of the TGWU general union at Tilbury, said yesterday: 'It is a marvellous victory for our members. It shows workers can resist successfully the imposition of new contracts of employment on them.' The tribunal will reconvene this afternoon. It is expected that a settlement between the port and the dockers will be announced then.</p>

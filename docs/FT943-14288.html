			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Rosyth deprived of warships and jobs The Rosyth naval base in Fife is to lose its warships and be downgraded to a naval support establishment, under the plans announced yesterday by Mr Rifkind. Although the base has escaped the closure which had earlier been feared, there will still be considerable job losses and a serious impact on the local economy. Mr Rifkind said one of the two squadrons of minehunters now based there would be moved to the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde while the other would move to Portsmouth. The ships at Faslane would be nearer their operational area, while the ships moving to Portsmouth mainly operated off England and Wales. Rosyth will retain the option of being an operating base if necessary and be used for defence research, storage, accommodation and support for the adjoining naval dockyard, which is unaffected. The civilian workforce will fall from 1,300 to 600, and the number of service personnel located there will be cut from 1,800 to 300. Mr Rifkind said about 70 jobs would be created at Faslane. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said Scotland would 'bear its fair share, but no more' of the job losses announced in the review. He said hundreds of manufacturing jobs in Scotland would be secured by defence orders made possible by the review. Fife Regional Council dismissed the diminished role for Rosyth as unacceptable. It said the base would be the target of resistance for trade unions and local authorities, which are meeting to plan their campaign today. The council believes that last year the naval base was responsible for securing 4,000 jobs outside the base in the local economy, to which it contributed Pounds 180m. It believes that only 1,000 jobs will be sustained by the scaled-down operation and its economic contribution will fall to Pounds 75m. Unemployment in the Dunfermline area would rise from 11 per cent to 15 per cent after the cuts, the council said. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said last night: 'What kind of naval base will Rosyth be with no ships based there? A naval base without ships has the same long-term prospects as a pub with no beer.'</p>

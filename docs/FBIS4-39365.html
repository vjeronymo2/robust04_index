			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Akmatbek Nanayev, Kirghiz ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia, by Pavel  Shinkarenko; place and date not given: "Treaty With Russia  Opens New Chapter in Kirghiz History"]    [Text] [Shinkarenko] Over the last few years Kyrgyzstan  has concluded dozens of interstate agreements. Nevertheless,  people in your country celebrate 10 June -- the date that the  Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation With Russia was signed in  1992 -- as an event of national importance. What is the reason  for that?    [Nanayev] Let us recall the events of the time. Kyrgyzstan  had just proclaimed its independence. The wholesale process of  its diplomatic recognition may be said to have begun. These  were worrying times. But our country was only really conscious  of its independence after Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin signed  the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between the Kyrgyz  Republic and Russia. This event was the point of departure from  which the current history of our state began. The treaty with  Russia is the foundation of cooperation between our countries  based on equality, respect, and support for our peoples.    [Shinkarenko] The foundation of cooperation....  Construction schedule overruns and unfinished construction are  associated with this word. What a lot of that we can remember!  But what has it really proved possible to accomplish on this  "foundation?"    [Nanayev] I can say with confidence that the first stories  have already been built. Needless to say, the greatest progress  has been made in the political sphere. Our presidents have  really displayed political will here. Thanks to this the Treaty  on Friendship has been supplemented by dozens of other  agreements and protocols, strengthening the international-legal  base of our bilateral ties.    We fully understand the ways of further developing  Kyrgyz-Russian relations, strengthening cooperation within the  CIS framework, and coordinating actions on the international  arena. Cooperation between our foreign ministries, in the  military-political sphere, and in peacemaking operations has  been comprehensively developed....    [Shinkarenko] The special relations of trust between Boris  Yeltsin and Askar Akayev are well known. However, there are  plenty of problems on which they do not have time to work.    [Nanayev] You're right. It would be unjustified to depict  all aspects of our relations solely in a rosy light. In the  political sphere a great deal is determined by the leaders of  the states. Cooperation in other spheres is strongly influenced  by many factors. This applies particularly to trade and  economic relations. Production is continuing to decline in both  countries. The fall in the standard of living of the bulk of the  population has not yet been halted. Many major enterprises that  were created to meet all-Union needs, particularly in the  military-industrial complex, have been left without orders. And  this means tens of thousands of workers and specialists have  lost their livelihood. We cannot resolve this problem without  Russia's aid.    In Moscow and Bishkek there is shared understanding of the  difficulties that have arisen. For instance, an accord has been  secured on Russia providing credit and on the creation of an  investment fund and joint production units, including some based  on defense enterprises capable of producing output that Russia  also needs. However, the accords are slow to be implemented.    But there have been improvements here, too. Both in  Kyrgyzstan and in Russia it has proved possible to bring down  inflation considerably. The national currency is being  strengthened.... Thus light can already be seen at the end of  the tunnel.    [Shinkarenko] Many people in Russia are talking about the  difficulties that have beset Russian-speaking residents of the  former Soviet republics and about a Russian exodus. How are  things in Kyrgyzstan?    [Nanayev] Following the breakup of the USSR the fate of  their compatriots became a pressing matter for virtually all the  former Soviet republics. Like homing pigeons many people  reached out for their historic roots and origins -- and that is  quite natural. The instinct of self-preservation is always the  first to come into play in critical situations, but there is  also a countermovement. Raisa Fedorovna Kazanina, who now lives  in Volgograd, wrote recently to a Bishkek newspaper that she is  homesick for Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], which she considers her  second home. She wrote that only illness prevents her from  returning home.    Our president is fully determined to support this endeavor  on  the part of the country's Russian-speaking citizens and create  favorable living and working conditions for them, and thus halt  migration. The Republic has formulated a concrete action  program. It has been discussed with the Russian president and is  bolstered by corresponding measures on both sides.    But people have spiritual as well as material needs. In  particular, a great deal has been done to ensure that the  Russian language continues to operate in the Republic as before  and the interests of the Russian-speaking population are not  infringed upon. In 1993 a Slav University where teaching is  conducted in Russian opened in Bishkek. Funding of the  university's activity is shared by Kyrgyzstan and Russia.    There are, of course, many farfetched fears and prejudices  in  the sphere of interethnic relations, and the Republic's  leadership is doing everything it can to dispel them. For  instance, a reasonable approach has been found with Russia to  the so-called dual citizenship problem. I think that this  solution will prove quite acceptable to all the Republic's  inhabitants.    [Shinkarenko] Are there any other events or things that you  would like to point out on the eve of the treaty's second  anniversary?    [Nanayev] First, President Askar Akayev's official visit to  Moscow in February, his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin.  During this summit they discussed the most topical problems in  our contacts, including the sphere of credit and financial  relations, the prospects for the creation of joint ventures, the  position of Russian-speaking residents, ways of strengthening  the CIS, and promoting a settlement in Tajikistan.    I cannot help but underline the following. During the  difficult days this spring a number of regions of the Republic  were beset by gigantic landslides (mountain torrents). Dozens  of people died and the country sustained tremendous material  damage. The Russians, the relevant services of the Russian  Federation Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency  Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters were the first  to respond to the disaster. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  Russia's Federation Council, visited the scene of the disaster.    Lastly, here is another interesting point. We are currently  preparing for a major event -- the Chuy Valley Days in Moscow  Oblast. This festival is in return for a visit that we were  paid by a delegation from Moscow Oblast. This event, as it may  appear, is of by no means local significance and does not date  from the time of stagnation. Familiarization with our friends'  affairs shows that in the new conditions, our people still have  a tremendous need for contacts with one another and have similar  interests and aspirations. The Chuy Valley Workers' Cultural  Days coincide with the second anniversary of the Treaty of  Friendship and in this respect are particularly symbolic.    [Shinkarenko] Good news and positive emotions are always  beneficial. But what particularly alarms you today, Mr.  Ambassador?    [Nanayev] By the strictest criteria, apart from the  difficulties that I have already mentioned, I do not foresee any  difficulties in either the short or the long term. On the  contrary, there is reason to think that our relations will  continue growing and bear increasingly rich fruit. But one must  not forget that these are relations between real partners linked  by thousands of strands. And, as you know, there have always  been, are, and regrettably will remain problems in our affairs  that we must work on, especially now, when our countries are in  the throes of a profound economic crisis. But unraveling these  "knots" is a matter for the political leadership and for us  diplomats.</p>

Although the names of those who  wish to try it on two or three trampolines at the same time are  known, an overwhelming majority of candidates have already  chosen a design to their liking and in line with their  potential, and are now enthusiastically demonstrating trial  leaps to their colleagues in electoral blocs in order to capture  the top positions on the qualifying list.    As far as the designs are concerned, they are perfect.  That is to say, each trampoline has been tailored to the needs  of the designer himself. The trampoline of the nomenklatura,  tall and made for the shortest leap without any particular  swinging, was introduced especially for individuals with heavy  behinds benumbed from sitting, to whom hopping into the chamber  of the Supreme Council is like walking from their office to the  room next door. Only in Galicia will there be trouble with this  design: Because of a lack of materials, the trampoline was built  on rotten supports, and the deputy careers of the few courageous  members of the nomenklatura may come to an end under its rubble.    The trampoline of the entrepreneurs is as simple as our  economy. One of its ends is held by the sinews of labor  collectives and the other by those of independent trade union  organizations. Each candidate will choose the end to his taste.  Before leaping, the catapulting mechanism should be well oiled.  A group of disconcerted private owners and businessmen has  nested somewhere in between the favorites of the labor  collectives and the pets of the trade unions. The push in this  place on the trampoline is going to be minimal whichever end is  pulled--those who have trained may fly far enough....    The trampoline of the political parties is somewhat  like its creators. It has three starting pads--left, center, and  right. Some mechanisms of the trampoline remain a mystery to the  designers themselves. The function of most parts changes daily.  Since the parts are worn out due to the frequent change of aim,  they have to be tied together by ropes or nailed down. Nobody  can say with certainty which mechanisms hamper the leap and  which give it an impetus. Perhaps all the mechanisms will be  turned off at the same time for the elections, provided, of  course, that the trampoline does not fall apart before then.    Given the differences in leaping techniques and  competitive tactics, each group of the candidates is training  separately. POST-POSTUP intends to familiarize its readers with  the peculiarities of this process.  <H5>  Entrepreneurs </H5>   Three all-Ukrainian associations of entrepreneurs are  getting  ready to run. The USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs] team appears the strongest among them. After  Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov got together, the USPP has  succeeded in bringing in some private businessmen, which will  undoubtedly create for it a favorable reformist image and fill  the coffers of the union with capital from businessmen. The  clear-cut pro-Russian orientation of Leonid Kuchma, the new  president of the USPP, makes the bloc reliable on the  preelection menu of the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine.  The chances of candidates from the USPP bloc are estimated to be  better than of those who went to other associations of  entrepreneurs--the All-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs of  Serhiy Babych and the Union of Private Owners and Entrepreneurs  established with the participation of Volodymyr Lanovyy, the  former deputy prime minister with the still untarnished  reformist image.    In combination, the Lanovyy and Babych blocs will offset the  obvious superiority of the USPP somewhat. The disproportion  would have been catastrophic had Lanovyy not secured support  from the Oleksandr Mril free trade unions. This combination  guarantees him fans during the duel with Kuchma: Both blocks are  betting on the "labor collectives." The power over labor  collectives which state directors from the USPP are easily  retaining both through the "aktiv" of enterprises and thanks to  resort vouchers, hospitals, and waiting lists for housing is  counterbalanced by the independent trade unions from Lanovyy's  bloc, which have painlessly reorganized their primary chapters  into labor collectives. A "labor collective" cuts both ways. It  is an ideal trampoline for the "director's man," where  democratic trade unions do not exist. However, the labor  collective is a director's headache in districts in which the  free trade unions have grown in strength. Nonetheless, it is  expected that Lanovyy's people will be successful in just 12  electoral districts populated mostly by miners, taking the  deputy seats from the USPP.    At least two intense clashes between USPP directors and  trade  union organizations are known--in Krivoy Rog and Pervomaysk,  where Vasyl Yevtukhov, current deputy prime minister, and Mykola  Surhay, current head of the State Committee for the Coal  Industry, grasped with surprise that they will have a problem  getting nominated by the labor collectives of miners, although  they were not able to link this phenomenon, an unpleasant one  for them, with their behavior during the miners' strikes. The  main battles between the free trade unions and the director's  tank are expected to break out in the Donbass, where Markulov's  Liberals and the Labor Party will interfere with dividing up the  election pie.    It is hard to imagine a more fortuitous tactical combination  than the alliance of the free trade unions and bankers from  Praveks and Inko which has been devised by Lanovyy. Having  grasped the futility of efforts to stand against the USPP alone,  Lanovyy opted for the only possible line of behavior whose  chances to be effective will improve by reason of a strike  scheduled by the trade unions for 18 January. It is precisely 18  January that may advance Lanovyy to the center stage of  Ukrainian politics.  <H5>  Parties </H5>   The party life of the democrats is full of contradictions.  Each one of them demonstrates devotion to the idea of a single  bloc, while stressing at the same time that such a bloc is  hardly possible. Some, dispensing with preelection agreements,  have gone to look for greener pastures in districts prepared  beforehand, maneuvering between the need to demonstrate  adherence to the ideas of private enterprise and the temptation  to scold the entrepreneurs before the voters, most of whom view  businessmen as "thieves" and "speculators." It appears that  participants in the center-right Council of Democratic Parties  and Organizations of Ukraine, the creation of which was  memorable at the last Rukh congress, are now more concerned  about the division of funds from the diaspora; failure to  apportion them is preventing the ultimate breakup of the council.    Les Tanyuk said: "Many problems of the association are  related to the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces]--an  organization created to break up Rukh. The so-called  All-People's Rukh of Larysa Skoryk, which is a direct  alternative to People's Rukh, also emerged from the recesses of  that organization. Many KNDS leaders believe that the democrats  have reared a Mazepa out of Kravchuk. If people from the URP  [Ukrainian Republican Party] understand that they have been  fooled, the array of national-democratic forces will possibly be  broadened. Everything depends on the degree to which these  forces distance themselves from the president. Painful  disappointment awaits them otherwise." Of course, it is hard for  Tanyuk to forget that some people from circles close to the KNDS  were privy to his persecution as a "KGB agent," and also that  the leader of the Republicans attacked Vyacheslav Chornovil on  television right before the 1991 presidential elections.    Larysa Skoryk, chairman of All-People's Rukh, does not  believe in consolidation of the democrats for the elections. She  calls the democrats' promises not to fight one another in  electoral districts "declarations backed up nothing." Mrs.  Skoryk asserts emotionally: "I am telling you that this will not  happen. There will definitely be several candidates from various  democratic groups per district, especially in Galicia." In view  of the fact that the KNDS is used to paying attention to the  reflections of Larysa Pavlivna, the paralysis of the council may  be explained from this point of view, if no other.    To skirt the "points of conflagration" in the council and  free itself from the trouble of settling adversarial situations  in the electoral districts, the leaders of Rukh appear to have  found a quite mild outcome which, it appears, Oleksandr Kibza,  an adviser of the department of political analysis of the  organization, has been charged with releasing. He said: "We are  planning to give regional organizations an opportunity to  themselves decide which candidates to nominate and support."    Old conflicts and misunderstandings are superimposed over  the  severe realities of the present day: It is hard for the  center-rightists to come to a compromise in dividing up their  traditional electorate in the western region (Galicia) and Kiev.  Some observers believe that approximately seven candidates from  the democrats will contend in the rural areas of Galicia for one  mandate, and 15 candidates in the cities. In Kiev, out of 2,500  contenders for candidates which are expected to be registered by  the electoral commissions of the capital city until 27 January,  the center-right will "field" only 100. It is quite possible  that some leaders of the center-right, having returned from a  futile tour of Galicia, will compete among themselves in Kiev.  Only Oles Shevchenko, who will run in Tarashcha, in the vicinity  of Kiev, and Dmytro Pavlychko, who considers the area of Kanev  to be the best jumping-off point, have given up the capital.    Kiev has prepared a few more presents for the voters, which  could also have been expected. Semen Yufa, chairman of the  Merkuriy company, which is widely known in the capital city,  will most likely be a candidate in Chervonoarmiyskyy Electoral  District, in which Yuriy Kostenko won the previous election. So  far, people willing to compete with him are not in evidence,  just as there are none who want to try their luck in a game  against Ivan Saliy. The "Podol wolf," who has organized his own  Choice, not only draws on the favorable position of KIYEVSKIYE  VEDOMOSTI but also impresses competitors with the directness of  his drive for power, a directness which, in combination with the  methods for persuading competitors, will be sufficient for Saliy  to win with no opposition.    The flight of the left wing of Ukrainian parties is not  endangered by surprises. Although Yevhen Marmazov, deputy  chairman of the Communist Party of Ukraine, says that "the  Communists will not form a bloc with anyone, but all of us--the  Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Peasant  Party--will help one another," his "other party comrades"  consider the issue of creating a left bloc already resolved.  People's Deputy Valentyn Trizna projects: "The time for the left  bloc to gain power has now come. I think that it will win the  elections." The possible "drain" of votes of the electorate by  the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc causes a certain alarm among the "left."  Nevertheless, the "left" do not avoid discussions with this  bloc. A certain outline of anti-Kuchma theses in the electoral  program of the Socialists may be found in the words of Oleksandr  Moroz: "The panacea for all misfortunes--privatization--which  was advocated by both the Fokin government and in particular the  Kuchma cabinet, has fully discredited itself. They brought our  society to the brink of catastrophe."    However, such theses of the left are not the foundation of  their electoral platform. Their leaders engage in anti-Rukh  propaganda with energy worthy of a better cause. Yevhen Marmazov  said: "The blockade of the Communist and Socialist Parties, of  those who do not subscribe to the positions of Rukh, is real."    Anticommunism remains the core of Rukh's propaganda.  Chairman  of People's Council Ivan Zayets said: "People are already  beginning to understand that the system of power which is  embodied and implemented by the procommunist forces is to blame  for all these troubles." Both party leaders are much more  reluctant to acknowledge a paradoxical situation whereby the  nomenklatura succeeds in "swinging the pendulum" from the  Communists to the Rukh people and the other way around while  remaining in the shadows in the process. Marmazov said: "Perhaps  Kravchuk is indeed trying to put the Communists and the  Socialists at odds with the nationalists. However, I consider it  more probable that they are not trying to put us at odds, they  are simply isolating us." Ivan Zayets: "Indeed, the arrows which  the democrats now shoot at the party of power ricochet in the  direction of the Socialists and the Communists." However, the  two antagonists recognize that the method of "swinging the  pendulum" is a quite effective nomenklatura technique to ensure  its victory in the elections.  <H5>  The Nomenklatura </H5>   Changes in the structure of the nomenklatura indicate that  Kravchuk's group has suffered a defeat at almost all its  positions. This is significant for Ukraine not only because it  is certainly the only country in the world in which elections of  the executive authority are carried out by the executive  authority itself, with the latter calling elections and forming  electoral commissions, but mainly because the Electoral Law  approved suits only the apparatchiks of the local  councils--Plyushch's nomenklatura. This conclusion has become  obvious following the adoption of the Electoral Law whose draft  called for 50 percent of the members of the TsVk [Central  Electoral Commission] and OVK [district electoral commissions]  to be appointed at the hand of the president, whereas in the  law, the appointment of TsVK and OVK members became the  prerogative of the Supreme Council and local councils, that is,  the "party" of the speaker. It was ultimately determined "who is  who" after Ivan Plyushch stated at an all-Ukrainian meeting of  representatives of the president that "the institution of local  representatives of the president is ineffective."    The intermediate results of the confrontation between the  nomenklaturas of Plyushch and Kravchuk, the difference in whose  territorial and clan backgrounds has been clear for a long time  now, the imbalance which has developed in relations between  them, as well as Kravchuk's open attempt to draw on the USPP and  the unheard-of fiasco of his calculations indicate that his  "party" has no chance of winning the elections. With the  exception of the official FPU [Federation of Trade Unions of  Ukraine] and several groups in the KNDS and the VsRU  [All-People's Rukh of Ukraine], virtually nobody supports the  president's nomenklatura. And even this support appears  ephemeral. The FPU, which is headed by Oleksandr Stoyan, a  former adviser to the president, is being torn apart by internal  contradictions; for different reasons, the Association of Trade  Unions of the Lvov Area (headed by Rukh member Yaroslav  Kendzyor) and the Association of Trade Unions of the Kharkov  Area (led by the Socialist Viktor Chub) have expressed their  disagreement with decisions of the council of the federation. If  the FPU had a major influence on 20 million of its members, any  opportunity for other political forces would be altogether out  of the question. The activity of small propresidential political  groups is generally restricted to the vigor of Larysa Pavlivna.    Plyushch's nomenklatura has better insurance against a  defeat  in the elections than any other political force. Each point in  the Electoral Law is a step toward the Supreme Council. The  already mentioned infamous "labor collective" is the "horse"  which is supposed to carry the nomenklatura people between the  rock and the hard place--the desire to obtain loans and  opposition to market-oriented transformations. The Electoral Law  does not define the labor collective at all. Two other laws, the  Constitution and the Code of Labor Law, provide either the  ideological or the production-oriented definitions of the labor  collective, and neither codifies the political role of the labor  collective. Sick days, waiting lists for housing, allocation of  mineral fertilizer, and the plowing of auxiliary plots are the  best starting conditions for the "party of the nomenklatura."    Even if a director, kolkhoz chairman, or commander of a  military unit wishes to become a deputy before retirement, the  law also envisions a soft "way out." Unlike the draft law, which  envisioned that public servants may run "if they resign from  their post no later than four months before the day the  elections are held," in the law (Article 2, Point 5) this  provision has magically changed--public servants "may be  registered as contenders for candidacy if at the time of  registration they submit to the district electoral commission a  statement of consent to their dismissal from the position in the  event of being elected people's deputies of Ukraine and a  statement on the temporary suspension of official powers for the  duration of the election campaign." Therefore, the law does not  mention the resignation of a deputy before the beginning of the  election campaign.    If we disregard the touching desire of the current community  of people's deputies to protect their director colleagues  against the loss of their positions in the event of losing the  election, the goal of this "innovation" in the law becomes more  transparent: It is hard to imagine that any "young worker" will  have the slightest desire to come out against the director at a  conference of the labor collective. The director may return  after failing at the elections.    However, the resourcefulness of the nomenklatura is not  limited solely to the nomination of candidates by labor  collectives. Article 11 of the law regulates the boundaries of  electoral districts. In keeping with the decree of the Central  Electoral Commission, the average number of voters in a district  should amount to 86,600. In keeping with the same law,  deviations in the number of voters may not exceed 12 percent.  However, if we analyze the Decree of the Central Electoral  Commission, dated 17 December 1993, On Electoral Districts for  the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine, well over a  hundred violations of the law may be found there. For example,  Pivdennyy Electoral District in Kiev has 66,200 voters,  Troyeshchinskiy District--108,600. In Sumy Oblast, Zaliznychnyy  District has 112,400 voters, Trostyanetsky District--61,400; in  Lugansk Oblast, Lisichanskiy District has 110,100 voters,  Lutuginskiy District--62,300. Certainly, the gentlemen from the  Central Electoral Commission do not know how to calculate 12  percent.    Readers not privy to the secret are surprised: "What  difference does it make?" However, try solving a riddle: Where  in Kiev Oblast will Ivan Plyushch run--Belaya Tserkov, which has  99,400 voters, or Baryshevets, which has only 64,400 voters? You  guessed it. On the other hand, in Galicia, where the  nomenklatura has almost no chance of winning the elections,  deviations in the number of voters do not exceed those specified  in the law.    "Trifles" such as "officials [word illegible] on consent to  being relieved from positions in local self-government shall  have no right to come out in support of a particular candidate,  party, or electoral bloc" (Article 36 of the draft) have  disappeared from the draft law. A very important section on  financing the election campaign is also gone; its draft included  many norms which did not allow abuse of the election campaign,  in particular, the amount of 500 times the minimum wage as the  personal electoral fund of a candidate for deputy, the procedure  for remitting funds, and the refusal of candidates for deputy to  accept "gifts." Out of a total of 15 points, only eight remain  in Article 36; this is an excellent opportunity to compromise a  person or, quite the opposite, make him a deputy. It was  announced on an oblast TV program that a company, the dubious  nature of whose capital is common knowledge in the region, had  resolved to give one of the current progressive deputies of  parliament a few tonnes of paper as a "gift." They said that the  deputy lost his mind before he managed to announce his rejection  of the "gift" on that same television; the people had the  pleasure of listening to it between 2400 and 0100....    However, unrestricted financing for runoff elections, which  promise to become the main point of the elections in view of the  number of those eager to a get a taste of the deputy's life,  became a particularly strong move on the part of the  nomenklatura. Funding for the second round of elections is not  regulated in any way. This gives those who have money a splendid  opportunity to manipulate the elections, and the "party of  power" has an opportunity to frustrate the runoff elections if  democratic candidates get through to the second round. It would  suffice to mount an "explanatory effort" among the masses, and  elections will not be held.    Finally, under the circumstances it is surprising that this  parliament will operate on a professional basis. Nothing stood  in the way of the nomenklatura using the need for an  "inseparable bond with the masses" as an argument in favor of  the right of a people's deputy to work in production. However,  rumors about the number of supporters of combining the art of  kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of parliament  member (during time off from the principal job) increasing  catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come true in  some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: An intensification of divided opinions - Peter John looks at the transatlantic division surrounding two of the UK's biggest stocks UK AND US investors may be committed to similar financial goals but they do not always see things the same way. Divided views on leading stocks have always existed and make for healthy financial markets. However, the transatlantic division on some of the biggest British stocks has intensified recently. Nothing exemplifies this better than their respective attitudes towards Glaxo and British Petroleum. Many US institutions have decided on the one hand they will not touch Glaxo shares but on the other they cannot get enough of BP. However, their UK counterparts, by and large, hold the opposite view. The conflicting opinions have led to a lively push-and-pull in the stock markets. The two companies have such a high market value that these diverse movements have implications for the whole London stock market. A 10p shift (1.5 per cent) in the price of Glaxo shares moves the FT-SE 100 Index by almost 2 points and the Glaxo share price has fallen nearly 150p since the start of the year. A 10p move (4 per cent) by BP shifts the Footsie by just under 3.5 points but the shares have risen only 20p since the beginning of January. In London, investors are happy to buy Glaxo having watched its shares fall from 800p at the beginning of the year to within a whisker of their 18-month low. Analysts have argued for the past couple of weeks that the traditionally highly rated stock is now on a similar rating and yield to the market. Yet they have watched bemused as it has fallen further. Mr James Culverwell, Hoare Govett's health and household sector analyst, advised his clients to buy the classically defensive UK drug stocks three weeks ago. He felt that worries about US pricing reforms pledged by President Bill Clinton were already in the weakened share prices and hopes for economic recovery were premature. 'US investors are very fickle; a year ago they judged drug companies on fundamentals and now they are looking at growth prospects. They are also herd-like; a US institution starts selling and by the time it stops the message is just filtering through to the small investor.' Indeed, many of the Glaxo shares sold recently have been bought by US retail investors. One US analyst believes the UK is slightly precious about its high profile drugs groups because it has so few. He adds that many of the UK institutional investors missed out on the sharp rise in Glaxo's share price a couple of years ago and are not prepared to be caught out again. In the US, says Ms Christina Heuer, of Smith Barney, 'the drugs sector has been slaughtered since the realisation that growth rates have fallen below 10 per cent and margins were slimming down. She was long one of Glaxo's most enthusiastic supporters but now she advises clients to maintain a neutral stance on the stock. She has reduced her earnings per share forecast for the year to June to 39p but points out that the stake held by US investors in the form of American Depositary Receipts has held constant at 23.8 per cent since November as institutional selling is mopped up by smaller investors. With BP, the international roles are reversed. London has taken a dim view of the company for some time but particularly since it cut the dividend last year. Mr John Toalster, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, was one of the first analysts to turn his back on the stock. 'BP is a victim of its past mistakes and its future is a hostage to oil prices and currency movements. A modest share rating is needed to reflect the slow recovery of a patient which will not be in the best of health even after convalescence,' he says arguing that a fair value for the share price is currently about 175p. Last week, however, the US holding of BP shares hit 23 per cent having risen from 8.4 per cent a year earlier. Mr Bill Randall, of Salomon Brothers, is slightly cautious on the shares ahead of the Opec meeting at the end of next week but broadly believes that the oil company is ready to move ahead. 'We think the restructuring and cost cutting that they have started will put the company in a much more solvent situation and the shares will prove a good long-term investment.' The US view on BP appears to have been gaining ground over the past week and the shares have risen 13 1/2 p to 267 1/2 p in London. Meanwhile, Glaxo shares have fallen a further 11p to 667p.</p>

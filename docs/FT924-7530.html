			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wilshaw advances 75% A 75 per cent advance in pre-tax profits was announced by Wilshaw, the specialist metals and building products group, for the half year to September 30. On turnover up 40 per cent from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 15.3m the profit amounted to Pounds 809,000 compared with Pounds 463,000. Mr Guy Askham, the chairman, was confident that a further increase in profitability could be achieved in the second half. He said that exports and overseas sales now accounted for 65 per cent of turnover and that the realignment of sterling against the dollar would improve profitability in overseas markets. The interim dividend is lifted from 0.1p to 0.15p, payable from earnings of 0.6p (0.38p).</p>

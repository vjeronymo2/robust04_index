			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: QVC seeks Paramount bid 'poison pill' ruling QVC Network, the US home shopping company, yesterday asked a US court to throw out 'poison pill' provisions standing in the way of its hostile Dollars 90 a share bid for Paramount Communications, the film studio and book publishing group. The company told the Delaware Chancery Court it wanted 'a level playing field' that would enable it to fight fairly with Viacom, the cable television company that has made an agreed bid for Paramount worth Dollars 85 a share. Under the terms of the agreed bid, Viacom would get a Dollars 100m consolation prize if a rival bidder won the battle, together with the right to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's stock on favourable terms. QVC claims the provisions are illegally hindering other bids. It told the court yesterday: 'It is a breach of fiduciary duty for Paramount directors to pull this poison pill for an inferior offer by Viacom.' Paramount vigorously denied the claim and the outcome of the court case is likely to prove decisive in the battle. A fall in Paramount's share price in the last two days suggests that Wall Street is putting its money on a victory for Viacom, the lower bidder. Meanwhile, QVC reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 21.5m, an increase of 31.5 per cent over the previous year's figure. Net income per share rose only slightly from 40 cents to 42 cents because of an enlarged equity base. Nynex, the US regional telephone company that has formed an alliance with Viacom in its bid for Paramount, yesterday challenged US laws preventing telephone companies offering cable services in their own regions. It filed a suit in the District Court in Portland, Maine, claiming the restriction violated its constitutional right to free speech and deprived customers of a full range of choices in the video services market.</p>

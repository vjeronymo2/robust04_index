			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 April, the National Secretariat of the Cuban  Workers Federation [CTC] agreed to hold, for the first time,  assemblies on economic efficiency, beginning in the second half  of May. The first of these assemblies will be held in April and  will examine how to fulfill the decision reached by the workers  in the workplace assemblies, as well as new problems in the  workplaces. The CTC National Secretariat also officially agreed  to allocate eight million pesos a year to cover the expenses of  the Jose Marti Pioneers Organization [OPJM].    CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal pointed out that the  goal of the decision is to reduce Cuba's budget and ensure that  children do not suffer the consequences of the special period  and are prepared for the future. OPJM Vice President Laritza  Diaz applauded the gesture of the CTC, which will cover the  expenses of over 300 children's facilities nationwide to benefit  the workers' children.    The CTC National Secretariat also discussed the results of  the plenum that closed the Parliament in the Workplace process,  and discussed the accomplishments of a group of workplaces  nominated to receive National Emulation Vanguard status.</p>

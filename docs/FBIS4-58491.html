			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Taib Mahjoub] </F>   [Text] Doha, 3 May (AFP)--Israeli and Arab negotiators  clashed here Tuesday [3 May] on the first day of talks on Middle  East disarmament aimed at halting the spiralling billion-dollar  arms race in the region.    More than 40 states, including Israel and most Arab  countries, were taking part in three days of multilateral  discussions behind closed doors on a draft arms limitation deal  for the region.    But trouble flared almost immediately as the Arab and  Israeli  delegations differed over how the talks should proceed,  officials said.    A Western delegate said the head of the Israeli delegation,  defence ministry director-general David Ivry, insisted "straight  away that the session should adopt the draft, provoking Arab  reticence."    An Arab delegate said: "Certain Arab participants, including  Saudi Arabia, saw the proposed text as a political statement  which has nothing to do with arms limitation."    The text specifies that arms limitation "must in no way come  at the expense of one nation or provide advantages to another,"  and it must be approved "with the unanimous support of all  parties concerned."    Under the terms of the 1991 Madrid peace conference which  launched the disarmament talks, the draft declaration of  principles on disarmament also includes a reference to "a  reduction in the arsenals and personnel of the armed forces" in  the region.    And it stresses that the Middle East should become an area  where "weapons of mass destruction will be eliminated."    UN and EU envoys, as well as representatives of the United  States and Russia, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace  process, were also attending the conference in the Qatari  capital, held under tight security.    A Western delegate said: "The Arabs believe we must first  agree on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, while  the Israelis insist the priority is to establish  confidence-building measures in the region."    The Arab countries first want Israel to agree to practical  measures on arms control, which should cover Israel's nuclear  weapons capability.    Israel has vehemently denied that it possesses nuclear  weapons, but Western experts have estimated it probably has up  to 200 warheads.    "The fact that a state in the region possesses a nuclear  strength perpetuates tension," said Qatari Foreign Minister  Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani.    He urged Israel to submit its nuclear potential to  international supervision, and called on it to sign the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.    "Political stability in the region depends on an arms  balance  between Israel and the Arabs," Al Thani said.    A Western delegate said Israel "considers its technological  superiority in defence matters is designed to ensure a balance  in the region, as the Arabs have such great advantages in terms  of population and territory."    In a bid to narrow Arab-Israeli differences, Western  countries have proposed setting up collective structures  including a crisis prevention centre to improve understanding  and promote cooperation, a delegate said.    Russia has also suggested opening a regional military data  bank "to exchange information on the state and position of  forces and military manoeuvres in the region," another delegate  said.    Ivry is heading a 21-strong team, the first to visit Qatar  since the creation of Israel in 1948.    Informal talks between Arab countries and other participants  are due to be held Wednesday on the sidelines of the main  meeting.</p>

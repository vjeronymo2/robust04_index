			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Government made a statement in which it  expressed particular satisfaction that the opposing Georgian and  Abkhaz sides signed in Moscow on 14 May an agreement on  cease-fire and the separation of forces.    Russia is expressing confidence that the sides in conflict  will steadily follow the responsibility undertaken by them. The  breach of agreements -- which had taken place before -- should  not happen again. Russia, for its part, realizes the  responsibility entrusted to it and together with the United  Nations is ready to assist the achievement of a wide-scale  settlement of the conflict and secure that fresh efforts for the  restoration of peace in the region and mutual understanding  follow the present agreement.</p>

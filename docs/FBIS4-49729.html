The conference was held by the provincial people's  government  to study and formulate a general train of thought aimed at  deepening scientific and technological structural reform and  integrating science, technology, and the economy under the new  circumstances as well as arranging for the province's present  and future science and technology work.    Vice Governor Fan Xiaomei stated in her report that  Shaanxi's  present and future scientific and technological tasks were as  follows:    1. To build and perfect a simple but highly efficient  scientific research and development system which integrates  science, technology, and economy;    2.

To strive to make major breakthroughs in developing  nongovernmental scientific and technological undertakings,  building a technology market, and building principal and  backbone projects, to raise the scientific and technological  achievements transformation rate and scientific and  technological utilization rate up to and above 50 percent,  thereby giving full scope to the role played by science and  technology as the primary productive forces.    During the next few years, vice Governor Fan Xiaomei noted,  the province's scientific and technological structural reform is  expected to focus on lifting the controls on more aspects to  enable more scientific research institutions to participate in  economic operations and operate like enterprises, turning more  scientific research institutions into nongovernmental  institutions engaged in socialized operation.    In his speech Governor Bai Qingcai stated: Science and  technology are the primary productive forces. We have yet to  acquire an in-depth understanding of the importance of science  and technology in practice and make greater efforts to turn  scientific and technological achievements into productive  forces. The province's scientific, technological, and economic  structural reforms are aimed mainly at turning scientific and  technological achievements, more expeditiously, from  intellectual products into commodities and from potential  productive forces into real productive forces by dint of the  market.    Governor Bai Qingcai called on people's governments and  scientific and technological workers at all levels across the  province to: Be more conscious of transforming scientific and  technological achievements into productive forces; employ the  necessary economic, legislative, and administrative measures in  this regard; successfully tackle a number of long-standing  problems hindering the transformation, such as setting excessive  store by scientific research while making little effort to  transform scientific and technological achievements into  productive forces, a poor sense of intellectual property rights,  not paying attention to economic efficiency, and so on; take  steps to strengthen each and every intermediate link regarding  scientific and technological achievements transformation;  transform scientific and technological achievements through more  channels and at more levels; and strive to really integrate  science, technology, and the economy.    Governor Bai Qingcai pointed out: We should strive to  transform Shaanxi's scientific and technological superiority  into economic superiority at a swifter tempo. To this end, we  should press ahead with large-scale, high-efficiency, and  high-quality technological exploitation and transformation of  each and every pillar industry that is capable of generating  more revenue, utilizing more local resources, and boosting the  development of other industries. We should strive to build more  industrial and agricultural projects capable of increasing  peasant income by a large margin and raise the efficiency and  scale and upgrade each and every pillar industry across the  province.    Regarding agriculture, Governor Bai Qingcai maintained that  the province should strive to vigorously develop a high-quality,  high-yield, and high-efficiency agriculture with an eye on  building a socialist market economic structure and increasing  peasant incomes; build a batch of exemplary agricultural zones  with local characteristics and influence; build more industrial  development zones and resources exploitation zones; tackle each  and every major scientific and technological problem; build  industrial groups which integrate trade, industry, and  agriculture; and try to sell more farm products on foreign and  domestic markets.    Speaking of industry, Governor Bai Qingcai asserted that the  province should make redoubled efforts to push ahead with  structural readjustment; reduce energy consumption; raise  efficiency; promote scientific and technological progress; sell  locally manufactured products on more markets; invite more  foreign funds to help merge and transform more large and medium  enterprises; and turn more traditional industries into  high-efficiency, export-oriented, and technology-intensive  industries.    Yesterday's conference was presided over by Guan Wuxue,  provincial people's government deputy secretary general, and  attended by a number of provincial leaders, including Ren Guoyi,  Liang Qi, Zhang Heling, Lin Jizhou, and others.</p>

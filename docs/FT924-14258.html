			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Motoring: Real cars, real people, real French flair FORGET the 200 miles-an-hour follies and the spare-no-expense creations for motoring's mega-rich. Small is beautiful at Mondial de l'Automobile, the French car industry's biennial show that opened in Paris on Thursday. At the centre of attention are two little cars that will be bought by real people, using real money they have worked hard to earn and on which they have paid taxes. Making their world debut are the Renault Twingo and the Nissan Micra. The Twingo is sub-Renault Clio in size and styled with the same flair that has made the Renault Espace Europe's leading multi-purpose vehicle for many years. While the Micra - now being made alongside the medium-sized Primera in the Nissan plant at Washington, north-east England - is a little bigger than the Twingo, it is small enough to feel at home in crowded city streets but has enough space to let four adults sit in tolerable comfort on a journey. The Twingo will lock horns with Fiat's Cinquecento, a perky little town car looking like a Fiat Uno's baby brother. The Cinquecento, already selling well on mainland Europe, is due in Britain by the end of the year. Many Britons will be disappointed that Renault has no plans at present to make the Twingo with right-hand drive. In France, it will go on sale early in 1993 at an anticipated FFr55,000. That is more than Pounds 6,700 in devalued sterling although a month ago, when Renault unveiled the Twingo, the price tag would have been nearer Pounds 5,500. There will be only one Twingo model: a 55-horsepower, 1.2-litre, three-door hatchback with a five-speed gearbox and a top speed of 95 mph (153 kph). There are just two extras: a fabric sun-roof and air-conditioning. Many of the 35,000 Micras to be made in 1993 will go to mainland Europe to compete with the likes of the Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio, Peugeot 106 and 205 and Fiat Uno. Britons will get first sight of it at the Birmingham International motor show later this month, and it goes on sale in the UK in January. Although the British-made Micra is 60mm (more than two inches) shorter than the old Japanese-made model it is taller, has a longer wheelbase and is bigger inside. There are two multi-valve engines of 1.1 and 1.3 litres' capacity, and a choice of five-speed manual or Nissan's continuously variable automatic transmissions. Although small, it is sophisticated. Options will include a tilt-and-slide sunroof, power steering, anti-lock brakes and air-conditioning. More and more Europeans who buy cars of modest size and price now are demanding air-conditioning. They find today's large, sloping windscreens attract enough sun-radiated heat to make interiors very uncomfortable without it. Renault used Harrison, an American air-conditioning giant, to produce the optional extra system for the Twingo. Diavia of Italy's after-market system for the Fiat Cinquecento incorporates many of the same US-made components. At the Paris show, Peugeot has introduced the long-awaited diesel and five-door versions of the 106. Diesel fuel is roughly two-thirds the price of unleaded petrol in France and more than 40 per cent of all newly-registered cars there have diesel engines, with 50 per cent on the horizon. With unleaded petrol at around Pounds 3 a gallon (66p a litre) and diesel Pounds 2 (44p a litre), the economic argument is compelling even without putting the diesel's 30 per cent lower consumption into the equation. Peugeot also is showing the revamped 405 range and a two-litre, turbo-charged and petrol-engined 605. The 405, which will be unveiled for Britons at Birmingham, has a new interior and a better boot. Engine options now include the outstanding 1.9 turbo-diesel seen first in the Citroen ZX 1.9td. I took a heavily-loaded ZX 1.9td to France last month. Despite a lot of cruising at the 130 kmh (81 mph) autoroute limit, it returned better than 50 mpg (5.65 l/100 km) and drove with a petrol car's vigour and refinement. Citroen's two-door ZX models made a Paris debut. These, too, will be at Birmingham. Rover cars are among Britain's most visible exports in France, none more so than the Range Rover, which the trendy and well-heeled consider the vehicle in which to be seen. The new, 4.2-litre, Pounds 39,995 LSE flagship of the Range Rover line (this column, last week), with its height-adjustable air suspension, was seen for the first time at Paris. Ominously, so was Chrysler Jeep's Grand Cherokee. This four-litre six or 5.2-litre, V8-engined rival to the Range Rover reaches Europe in January. It will be the first on-off road 4x4 with a driver's side air-bag, Although the price will be a great deal lower, it will not have the aristocratic - indeed, regal - connections that do so much for the British vehicle's image and sales overseas. Rover also chose Paris to launch the most potent car it has produced, the 220 Coupe Turbo. This front wheel-driven, 200-horsepower, 150 mph (241 kph) two-plus-two has a traction control system to assure driveability on slippery surfaces. The Paris Mondial de l'Automobile continues all next week at the Porte de Versailles exhibition complex. Arguably, it has upstaged the Birmingham show, which opens to the public on October 24.</p>

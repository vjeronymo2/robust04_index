			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Job prospects 'best for four years' The most optimistic outlook for job prospects for four years is reported today in the latest survey by Manpower UK, the recruitment organisation. No region is forecasting job cuts in the three months to September, with the east Midlands remaining the most positive for the second successive quarter. London continues to show a marked improvement in job prospects - last year it was the most pessimistic. Only the north-west and Scotland are forecasting a worse position than in the same period last year. The survey, which is based on responses from 2,165 employers, showed 26 per cent of employers forecasting job increases and 11 per cent forecasting job losses, resulting in a positive net balance of 15 per cent. The manufacturing sector is the most optimistic about job prospects. Significant jobs growth is also forecast in the building sector, with the private building sector forecasting the greatest increase in jobs over any industry covered by the survey. The public sector remains the weakest, with local government still affected by the large increase in contracted out services. Ms Lilian Bennett, head of Manpower UK, said: 'There is still a sharp focus by managers on increased productivity, improvement of quality standards and greater flexibility of labour, which augurs well for the fourth quarter.'

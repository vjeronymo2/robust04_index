			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JAPANESE GIRL DIES IN GRAND CANYON FALL; SECOND FATALITY IN THREE DAYS  </P> <P> A teen-ager plunged nearly 400 feet to her death at the Grand Canyon, the  second such death in three days.  </P> <P> Yuri Nagata of Gufuken, Japan, who would have turned 18 today, had moved past a  guardrail to descend to a rock ledge Sunday, authorities said. "Evidently, a  friend suggested taking a photograph of her, and as she was standing up to get  the photograph taken, she lost her balance and fell," said Chuck Lundy of the  National Park Service. She was a member of a youth group on a U.S. tour, Lundy  said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a 34-year-old West German woman fell to her death while watching  the sunset at a point also on the south rim of the canyon, he said.  </P></p>

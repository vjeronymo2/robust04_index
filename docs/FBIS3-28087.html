"It will be impossible to rediscuss the promises (agreement)  reached," the ambassador told reporters yesterday.    The opposition Democratic Party Tuesday [1 February] called  on the government to renegotiate the agreement of the Uruguay  Round talks which will result in the opening of the Korean rice  market, in the wake of a massive demonstration by some 20,000  farmers and students in downtown Seoul.    Farmers and students took to streets after a rally Tuesday  denouncing the opening of the domestic rice market. Some 100  demonstrators and riot policemen were reported injured and six  police buses were burnt during violent demonstrations which  paralyzed downtown traffic till late Tuesday night.    Member nations will verify whether each country implements  the agreement as promised by March 27 and a ministerial  conference will be held April 13-15 in Morocco to sign the final  draft, Ho said.    Ho is here to attend the annual meeting of ambassadors  serving in Asia and America, which opened yesterday and will  continue through next Monday.    Peter Sutherland, secretary-general of the GATT, earlier  expressed the hope that no new issues would be raised at the  ministerial talks, referring to Japan and the United States, Ho  said.    At the ministerial meeting, an interim committee will be  formed to inaugurate the World Trade Organization (WTO), which  will be in charge of the execution of the Uruguay Round  agreements, the ambassador said. He predicted that Sutherland  will assume the chairmanship of the interim committee. Ho  forecast that the WTO will be inaugurated in January or July,  1995. Japan wants July while the United States hopes for  January, Ho said. He forecast that Korea will benefit from free  trade although there will be difficulties in some area,  including agriculture and services.    World trade will grow 12 percent annually or $745.5 billion  over the next 10 years till the year 2005 and income will grow  by $230 billion as a result of the Uruguay Round agreement, Ho  said quoting reports of the GATT secretariat.    Korea contributed 1,990,000 Swiss francs to the GATT  secretariat, placing it 11th in terms of donations. The  contribution accounted for 2.27 percent of the total GATT  secretariat budget, Ho said adding that Korea is to donate 2.1  million Swiss francs (some $1.5 million) this year.    Korea should send to the WTO the number of experts  commensurate with its contribution to the world body, he said,  adding that there are few qualified experts hoping for the job.</p>

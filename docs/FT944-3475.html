			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Control premiums The Morgan Stanley/Warburg merger talks have raised the question of when a 'control premium' should be paid in mergers. Some argue no premium is payable because this will not be a takeover. Others think that, since Morgan Stanley shareholders will hold two-thirds of the combined group, Warburg shareholders should receive a premium. There is also the question of whether minority shareholders in Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, should receive a premium. The case for a premium in a cash takeover is clear: the bidding company expects the takeover to yield benefits, so it is reasonable that the target's shareholders receive some of these via a premium. MAM seems to fit this description. If Morgan Stanley/Warburg intends to buy out the minority so MAM can be merged with Morgan Stanley's own fund management arm, a premium will be needed. The opposite extreme is that of a share swap between two equally-sized groups. The idea then that premiums must be paid to both by giving each group of shareholders a larger share of the combined entity is nonsense. Their reward, rather, comes from enjoying the fruits of merger - provided it works. Does this logic apply when one company is twice the other's size? There are two reasons why it may not. First, in such a share swap, the smaller company's shareholders will enjoy only a third of any extra value created through the merger. Second, by merging, the smaller group loses the option of selling itself for cash. In such cases, a modest premium could be the answer.</p>

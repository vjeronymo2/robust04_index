			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Stanhope, Rosehaugh merger talks cease ROSEHAUGH and Stanhope, the indebted property companies which jointly own the Broadgate office complex in the City of London, yesterday called a halt to their merger talks. The companies issued a statement to the stock exchange, saying 'agreement is unlikely in the near future and . . . a further period of prolonged uncertainty would not be in the best interests of shareholders'. The news sent Stanhope's share price down from 25p to 23.5p and Rosehaugh's share price down from 6 1/2 p to 5 1/4 p. Ever since the talks were announced last summer, progress has been slow. One of the problems facing the groups was getting agreement among their 70 banks. The banks, which had loans secured against more solid assets, were concerned that a merger and reconstruction could impair the quality of their loans. Rosehaugh, which announced the breach of its covenants and pre-tax losses of Pounds 227m in December, issued a statement to the stock exchange yesterday which said discussions with its banks had always been on the basis that it would remain an independent company. Rosehaugh is trying to negotiate a medium-term facility with its banks. It has a stand-still agreement until the end of the month which may need to be renewed. Both companies believed merger discussions might resume. Stanhope, which was the stronger party in the talks, announced annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 77m and a 30 per cent fall in net asset value in October. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Stalking points Anyone seeking a sense of how long Hongkong Bank has been stalking Midland need only talk to Bernard Asher. Boss of the James Capel subsidiary and one of two 'honkers bankers' men on Midland's board, he was the corporate planner during the Hongkong Bank's abortive bid for Royal Bank of Scotland 11 years ago. Even then he liked the look of Midland. However, he did not start taking its charms seriously until 'six or seven years ago' when he was in charge of identifying possible partners. The more he came to know the Midland, the more logical a marriage appeared, says Asher, a former director general of the UK's National Economic Development Office. One of his first intimations that wedding bells would ring came when he wanted to discuss his pay with someone at his employers' headquarters in Hong Kong. He was referred to a Midland banker who was on secondment there. One difference from the Royal Bank affair is that the Hongkong Bank is using Schroders as its adviser instead of Hambros - which may be connected with the fact that Schroders' bos Win Bischoff is an old Hong Kong hand. Or perhaps it was because the Bank of England fell out with Hambros last time round after Hambros refused to dissuade its client from pressing the bid. That, oddly enough, was much to the displeasure of the Governor, Gordon Richardson, who just happened to be an old Schroders man.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Adams' choice - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) One of Belfast's leading political commentators believes that the inspiration for Gerry Adams, the president of Provisional Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA and now, ostensibly, a peace broker in Northern Ireland, is Michael Collins, an IRA leader who, in 1920, agreed to the treaty partitioning Ireland. Collins was the IRA strategist and intelligence officer who made Ireland ungovernable between 1916 and 1919 through guerrilla warfare. But by 1920 he had come to the conclusion that independence could not be won by military means alone and agreed to sign the treaty. 'When you have sweated, toiled, had mad dreams, hopeless nightmares, you find yourself in London's streets cold and dank in the night air . . . Think] What have I got for Ireland. Something she has wanted these past 700 years? I tell you this - early this morning I signed my death warrant,' he reflected after signing. Sinn Fein split, Eamon De Valera leading the faction which resisted partition. A bitter civil war followed. Eighteen months later Michael Collins was dead, ambushed in Cork. It is always dangerous to push historical parallels too far. But Irish people of both main political persuasions are consumed with a sense of their past. What can be said is that Gerry Adams, some time during the late 1980s, became convinced that the military campaign was not going to lead to the goal of a British withdrawal from Ireland - and a united country under the jurisdiction of Dublin - and that another route should be tried. Thus the ceasefire. It could cost him his life. There is no shortage of rumours that the IRA will again split as it did in 1979 when he, among others, formed the Provisional IRA because the old IRA had grown weak and tired of the military struggle. For the moment, he has carried the day and, significantly, persuaded Martin McGuinness, the vice-president of Sinn Fein, over to the talks process. McGuinness is the overlord of Sinn Fein in Londonderry and thought to be the real hard man within the IRA. Adams was born in West Belfast in 1948. His family was steeped in Republicanism. He was believed by the security forces to be head of the Provisional IRA in the Ballymurphy area of West Belfast when he was interned in 1971. He was released in 1972 to take part in secret London talks between the provisionals and William Whitelaw, secretary of state, which gave rise to a brief ceasefire. In the resumed campaign he was believed by British intelligence sources to be Belfast brigade commander of the provisionals. He was arrested again and released in 1976. There after he moved steadily up the hierarchy. As president of Sinn Fein he continued the policy of the 'bullet and the ballot box'. The military campaign would continue, but it would run in parallel with a political campaign. For a while it worked. In 1983 in the aftermath of the hunger strikes of 1981, Gerry Adams won the West Belfast seat at Westminster. He refused to take the seat but used his victory to claim that Sinn Fein was overtaking the Social Democratic and Labour party, run by the moderate John Hume, as the true representative of the Catholic minority in the six counties. By the late 1980s the support had begun to wane. Gerry Adams lost his Westminster seat in 1992. By this time Adams had been in protracted talks with John Hume and covertly with the British government. It may well be that he has a sense of history and realises it is time to talk. He is a vain man and is thought to be over-weaningly ambitious and wants legitimate political power. He is also said to be tired of going around in a bullet-proof London taxi accompanied by minders.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Newarthill loss grows to Pounds 9.2m Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil engineer Sir Robert McAlpine whose listing was cancelled in 1989, reported an increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 5.35m to Pounds 9.21m for the six months to April 30. However, Sir John Greenborough, chairman, said that the second half loss was expected to be substantially less than the first. Turnover dropped from Pounds 245m to Pounds 135m producing an operating loss of Pounds 3.66m, compared with Pounds 4.44m. The pre-tax deficit was struck after a provision of Pounds 3.76m for the loss in the partnership development on the Haymarket Leicester project, redundancy costs of Pounds 1.39m and Australian restructuring costs of Pounds 409,000. After a tax credit of Pounds 845,000 (Pounds 1.28m charge), and taking in profits on sales of securities and investment properties of Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 1.21m), the attributable loss came out at Pounds 3.42m (Pounds 5.37m). Losses per share were 63.9p (50.1p). Sir John said that construction activities made a profit before redundancy costs.</p>

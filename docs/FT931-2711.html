			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Legal moves by creditors may delay O&amp;Y debt deals TWO of the biggest creditors of Olympia &amp; York's US operations have threatened to delay the implementation of numerous debt-restructuring agreements unless progress is made in setting up a new board of directors for the developer's US subsidiary. Sanwa Bank and Citibank detailed their complaints in a filing to a New York bankruptcy court that revealed disagreements between O&amp;Y's creditors in the US and Canada. The filing alleged that the management of the US subsidiary, Olympia &amp; York Realty Corp (OYRC), had been paralysed by these disagreements and by the delays in reconstituting OYRC's board. According to the filing, 'current management of the US properties does not know to whom it should report and on what terms.' It added that 'US creditors of Olympia &amp; York will continue to refuse to consummate numerous out-of-court restructurings as the authority of current management is in doubt.' The dispute stems from petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection made by some of O&amp;Y's US subsidiaries at the same time as the Canadian parent, Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), sought court protection last May. However, O&amp;Y's US buildings, under OYRC, were not included in the court protection. OYRC's New York-based management has been trying to keep the properties outside Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by selling some assets and negotiating debt-restructuring agreements with the creditors of others. OYDL emerged from bankruptcy protection last week. It is now managed by an administrator, who acts on the advice of a monitoring committee, comprised of creditors. Citibank and Sanwa have objected to OYDL's efforts to dismiss the Chapter 11 filings in the US now that court protection of the Canadian company has been lifted.</p>

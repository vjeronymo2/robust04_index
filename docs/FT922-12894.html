			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Expanded Farnell slightly lower at Pounds 33m - Manufacturing demand down as companies reduce spending on capital equipment A FALL in interest income led to Farnell Electronics reporting a slight decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 32.7m, for the year to February 2. The electronic equipment distributor received interest payments of Pounds 500,000 compared with Pounds 3.8m because of its recent acquisition of STC's distribution division for Pounds 61m. A further Pounds 3m was spent on buying Cayson Engineering. In the first seven months STC contributed Pounds 5m to operating profits which rose to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 30m) on sales of Pounds 205m (Pounds 164m). Farnell's main division, electronic component distribution, increased its pre-tax profit by 28 per cent, from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 30.5m. Margins increased as less customers made use of the discount for larger volumes. Electronic equipment manufacturing saw its pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 7.03m to Pounds 2.52m. Demand from the division's biggest customers, such as BT and IBM, was significantly down on the previous year. 'There has been marked reluctance from companies to spend on capital equipment', said Mr Raymond Kidd, chairman. Last year's net cash of Pounds 29.5m has been transformed into borrowings of Pounds 13m associated with the group's acquisition of STC. Gearing has been reduced from 36 per cent, when STC was acquired in July, to 17 per cent. Earnings per share increased to 16.5p (16.3p). A recommended final dividend of 3.2p makes a total of 5.8p (5.5p). Mr Richard Hanwell, who joined the board as a non-executive director in January, is to succeed Mr Kidd as chairman in August when he retires at the end of his service contract. COMMENT These were better results than analysts had forecast, which has become something of a rare event in the last year. Farnell's acquisition of STC's distribution division, questioned by some commentators at the time who feared the company had paid too much, is beginning to look the good buy the company said it was after contributing Pounds 5m operating profits in the first seven months. With the lossmaking German enterprise in mind there is bound to be some uneasiness over the group's decision to expand its European operations. A sales office has opened in the Netherlands with France tipped as the next country for Farnell's continental expansion. The group has, however, halved the loss at its German business, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 800,000. With forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.5m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 15.7, slightly above the sector average. The shares still look undemanding.</p>

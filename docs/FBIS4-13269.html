			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The action taken by Jordan to ban political  activities of the office of the Islamic Resistance Movement,  Hamas, in Amman will make the Zionist regime more aggressive and  encourage its interference in regional countries' internal  affairs.    Even though Jordanian authorities have said that the measure  has been adopted within the framework of their country's  political position vis-a-vis the Palestine crisis, no one is in  doubt that the will of the Zionist regime has also influenced  the decision.    The Hamas office in Amman, respecting the sovereignty of the  Government of Jordan, continued its solely political and  propaganda activities in support of the legitimate and legal  struggle of the oppressed nation of Palestine until Rabin, the  prime minister of the Zionist regime said that Jordan provided  shelter for the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine.  [passage omitted]    In reaction to the closure of its office in Jordan, the  Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine warned the Zionist  regime that it should not extend the scope of the conflict to  outside the occupied Palestine. So far the Palestinian movement  of Hamas has limited the scope of its organizational and jihad  operations against the Zionist regime to within the occupied  territories; and in order to avoid repeating the mistake of the  PLO in diverting from the main struggle, it has not carried even  a single guerrilla operation against the Zionist regime outside  the borders of Palestine.    The political and propaganda activities of the political  office of Hamas in Jordan, contrary to past PLO activities in  that country, have, so far, not created any kind of problem.  Therefore, its closure is only due to foreign pressure,  particularly by the Zionist regime and probably its Western  supporters.    That is why it is probable that this decision of the  Jordanian Government would have negative consequences on the  public opinion of Islamic countries, particularly Jordan, where  most of the population are Palestinians and have strong  pro-Islamic tendencies.    In the opinion of political analysts, the exertion of  pressure by Israel on Jordan and Jordan's leniency can have  other unpleasant consequences. Such actions will encourage  direct and indirect efforts by Tel Aviv to limit activities of  Palestinian organizations in other countries of the region and  such interference, due to their aggressive nature, would  definitely create tension. Also, the aggressive nature of the  Zionist regime and its clear interference in the internal  affairs of the countries of the region may spread the scope of  the Muslim peoples' confrontation against the Zionist regime  from the occupied territories to beyond them. Such a situation,  in the first instance, will be detrimental to the Zionist regime  and the compromising Arab governments.</p>

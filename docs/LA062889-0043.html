			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAGLIAFERRI REJECTS 'FINAL' TIGER OFFER  </P> <P> Gino Tagliaferri of Kennedy High, the 1989 Times' All-Valley Player of the  Year, has declined an offer from the Detroit Tigers and will attend Fresno  State in the fall.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri met with Detroit representatives for three hours Tuesday night  before rejecting what he said was "their final offer" of a $55,000 signing  bonus.  </P> <P> "This is for sure," Tagliaferri said. "I wanted ($80,000) because that's what I  feel I'm worth. I'll get school, a degree, good baseball and, hopefully, I'll  get drafted even higher in three years."  </P></p>

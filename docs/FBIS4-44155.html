			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 27 (AFP) -- France has asked Belgium  to supply medical aid such as emergency hospital units for its  military intervention in Rwanda, the Ministry of Defence said  Monday [27 June].    Belgium has agreed to transport the equipment as long as  French soldiers "ensure the safety of any surgeons sent to  Rwanda," a spokesman said. Belgium also wanted to see the  French security zone extended, "so our team can work in the best  possible conditions."    France was interested in the type of Belgian unit already  used in Somalia, complete with medical supplies and personnel,  which can carry out operations in any situation, he said. The  location of the unit has not been established.    Two field hospitals have already been set up at French base  camps in nearby Zaire for Operation Turquoise, launched last  Thursday, described by Paris as a humanitarian bid to stop  ethnic killings in the Rwandan civil war.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bien Perez] </F>   [Text] China is expected to unveil a mammoth 60-billion yen  (HK$4.6 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) Samurai bond early next  month, which will mark its debut as a sovereign issue in Japan,  according to securities sources. The Chinese Ministry of  Finance will be the principal borrower to what will be the  biggest Chinese-name debt paper issue yet in the cash-rich  Samurai bond market.    Sources said Chinese finance ministry officials were  currently finalising details of the offering with co-lead  managers Daiwa, Securities and Nomura Securities. Both  individual and institutional investors in Japan were being  targeted by the lead managers, sources said.    Samurai bonds are yen-denominated IOUs issued by foreign  borrowers exclusively to investors in Japan.    The proceeds from the Chinese Samurai bonds would probably  be  used to support the mainland's ongoing financial-sector reform  program, sources said. One of the selling strategies being  studied, according to sources, is to split the Chinese  government's Samurai bond offering into two; a 30-billion yen  issue of five-year notes and another 30-billion yen package of  seven-year notes. In line with that set-up, the Chinese  government and the lead managers were also considering whether  to sell the two packages together or separately.    One Hong Kong-based securities official, who spoke on  condition of anonymity, said the borrower would probably benefit  more if the packages were launched together to take advantage of  "the current healthy appetite by Japanese investors for  Chinese-name debt paper.    During the past few months, well-heeled Japanese investors  swiftly snapped up separate Samurai bond offerings made by the  Bank of China (BOC) and the Tianjin International Trust and  Investment Corp (Titic). The BOC borrowed 15 billion yen and  Titic borrowed 13 billion yen.    Despite the prevailing negative sentiments in the  international bond markets, more and more foreign borrowers have  been drawing fresh funds from the Samurai bond market because of  Japan's low interest rates.    Although the size of the planned Chinese government  Samurai-bond issue this year was record-breaking, the biggest  mainland-based borrowers in the Japanese bond market in terms of  total number of issues were the BOC and the China International  Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), the overseas investment arm  of the Chinese government, sources said.    The BOC has already made 11 Samurai-bond offerings in recent  years, the largest of which was a 50-billion yen package in 1986.    Citic has made four Samurai-bond issues, the largest of  which  was a 40-billion yen issue in 1986.</p>

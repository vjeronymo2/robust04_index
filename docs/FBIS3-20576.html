The main  entities in these three systems are the grain producers,  dealers, and consumers. Once the market controls grain dealings,  the macroeconomic decisions of the three major entities will be  of crucial importance.    Government's macroeconomic decisions are the external  climate  in which peasant microeconomic decisions about grain production  are made. Once the grain markets have been deregulated,  government policies for the stabilization of market grain  prices, for the regulation of macroeconomic prices, and for the  regionalization of grain farming are bound to help the grain  production system. They will bring into line state macroeconomic  decisions and peasant microeconomic decisions.  <H5>  Choice of Macroeconomic Grain Production Models </H5>   The state should prescribe a production model in keeping  with  China's circumstances that is based on the present state of the  economic structure, the trend in supply and demand for grain,  and the state of agricultural resources.    A look at the history of grain production in China shows  three models at different stages, namely the pioneering model,  the fertility maintenance model, and the innovation guidance  model.    1. The pioneering model period ran from 1949 through 1957  during which the grain growing area and yields per mu increased  in China to contribute 50 percent of total output.    2. The fertility maintenance model period began during the  end of the 1950s. During this stage, China's cultivated land  area and grain growing area gradually declined. The only way to  increase grain output was to increase per unit of area yields.  Consequently, maintenance and improvement of soil fertility  became a more important part of the daily agenda. During the  1960s and 1970s, large scale building of water conservancy  projects, leveling of fields, and increasing the soil's organic  content were employed to maintain soil fertility and improve the  soil's ability to produce grain. Thus, during the 1960 and the  1970s fertility maintenance model was the main model used to  increase grain output.    3. The innovation guidance model period. With the advent of  the 1980s, the "innovation guidance" model was consciously or  unconsciously selected as a means of grain production. When land  became scarcer and rent increased, technological progress  appeared as an innovative way to save the land's biochemistry;  When manpower became scarce and wages rose, technological  progress appeared as an innovative way to save mechanical  equipment used for work.    Land is extremely scarce in China, and the amount is  decreasing by more than 4 million mu each year. Following  institution of the output-related contract responsibility  system, the role of intensive farming as a means of increasing  yields approached its extreme limit. Without innovations in  agricultural production technology to increase material inputs,  further increase in grain production would be impossible.    After entering the 1990's, the sole choice for further  increases in grain output was to increase material and  technology inputs. Biochemical innovations were need to extend  key elements in short supply was the only way to increase grain  output. This was a macroguidance principle that the government  had to bear firmly in mind at all times in the development of  grain production. The underlying implications of his principle  is the need to increase relative returns from the growing of  grain to increase peasant income, thereby enabling the peasants  to afford new commodity inputs.  <H5>  Grain Production Microdecisions </H5>   The climate in which peasants made grain production  decisions  changed fundamentally following the change to market dealings in  grain. Market price and opportunity costs became the main basis  on which peasants made decisions. In a market economy, the  peasants make the following three kinds of decisions:    1. Job and product decisions. Peasant households must choose  from among a series of industries the one in which they want to  work. However, because of financial, skill, management, and  social relationship limitations, most peasants cannot work in  anything but agriculture. They must make a choice from within  agriculture. They base their decision about what crops they will  grow on the relative profit to be made. Clearly, relative prices  are the main basis for peasants microdecisions. The government  may use financial subsidies to raise (or lower) the relative  price paid for grain (or cash crops), or it may use import and  export controls to change the relative price of any given crop.  Alternatively, it may use exchange rate policy to change price  levels, thereby influencing peasant decisions.    2. Resources decisions. Once the peasants have decided what  crops to grow, they must next decide how best to allocate scarce  resources. Here, the manpower and capital that peasant  households of different size with different amounts of money may  use to produce a certain amount of grain differs. However, in  deciding the proper allocation of manpower and capital,  different kinds of peasant households mostly consider factors  such as the price of manpower and capital.    3. Input-output decisions. Following deregulation of grain  markets, when grain will have to be sold through markets,  peasants will have to use the price of inputs and the price of  outputs, and the amount of inputs and the amount of output to  figure the amount of their gain in order to maximize profits.  <H5>  Grain Consumption System Decisions </H5>   The grain consumption system is the final link in the grain  system. Under a grain consumption market allocation mechanism,  consumers opportunities to make free choices are greater. This  raises the problem of consumer microdecisions. However, since  the market is left to operate as it will, and since attainment  of the goal of equitable distribution throughout society is  impossible, government must intervene in consumption, and this  gives rise, in turn, to macroeconomic decision problems.  <H5>  Macrodecisions About Grain Consumption </H5>   Macrodecisions about grain consumption rely on an analysis  of  grain consumption trends. The history of grain consumption in  China and other countries shows the following several trends in  grain consumption.    1. The amount of direct consumption per capita tends to  decline while the amount of indirect grain consumption tends to  rise, and total grain consumption tends to rise. The direct  causes of total grain consumption increase are total population  increase and a rise in per capita income.    2. As per capita income rises, the demand for grain changes  from quantity to quality. Thus, per capita income increase may  cause uneven increase in grain demand. This unevenness is  manifested largely in a premium quality grain demand income  elasticity that is greater than for low quality grain, and an  income elasticity for premium quality grain demand that is  greater in rural villages than in cities. This means that when  city and rural per capita income increases at the same rate,  rural demand for premium quality grain is greater than in cities.    3. More and more grain is processed into food. The  percentage  of consumption of whole grain decreases steadily in both city  and countryside families while the percentage of processed grain  consumed rises steadily. This trend may be seen from the  increase in output value of China's grain processing industries.    Given the above trends in grain consumption, what  macrodecisions should the government make? First, in view of the  steady increase in grain consumption as per capita income  increases, since it is a general rule that consumption is  greatest when income is moderate, and since China has now  entered the ranks of nations having a moderate income, grain  consumption in China is now at the peak period. Therefore, the  state should increase investment in grain production, increase  the price of grain relatively, and do all possible to increase  peasant income to enable peasants to buy commodity-type goods  for investment in order to increase grain production  tremendously so that the increase in grain supply can satisfy  the increase in demand. Second is increase in high income  elasticity food production. Since rural demand for premium grain  increases as per capita income increases, production of these  high income elasticity foods should be increased. Otherwise a  tremendous gap between supply and demand will be created. This  is already a very serious problem. The supply of premium quality  rice cannot meet demand, but early indica rice is in great  oversupply. Production of high income elasticity premium rice or  animal foods requires greater resources inputs. For example,  more irrigation water and more fertilizer are needed to grow  paddy than to grow sorghum. Therefore, government should set a  fairly substantial quality price differential to encourage the  peasants to grow premium quality grain. Third, since grain  demand income elasticity is greater in rural villages than in  cities, and greater in needy areas than in developed areas,  universal education, improved transportation and communications,  and the expansion of grain production in rural and needy areas  would lower the grain demand income elasticity of rural village  and needy area populations. This would be more effective than  simply considering income increase measures. Fourth, subsidies  for specific purposes should be given low income people.  <H5>  Microdecisions About Grain Consumption </H5>   The deregulation of grain markets has increased consumers'  opportunities to make free choices. However, these choices are  affected not only by the consumers' income level and prices, but  by individual preferences as well.    1. Consumer decisions when grain prices rise.    Following grain market deregulation, the overall price level  of grain may rise. Consumers will then readjust the mix of their  commodity purchases on the basis of their income and individual  preferences.    2. Consumer decisions after income increase. When consumer  income increases, at a fairly low income level, the amount of  grain purchased increases very rapidly. At a fairly high income  level, however, the increase becomes slower and slower. This  reflects an increasingly smaller percent of income spent on  grain as family income increases. This is consistent with the  laws of Engels and Bennett.</p>

Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]  and CIOC commander, presided over the meeting held at the first  conference room of the Defense Ministry.    The CIOC designated establishment of the nation's total  security preparedness as its key target in 1994.    The participants discussed a broad range of measures to  build  up the readiness to instantly counter an irregular warfare,  complete a joint civilian-government-military defense capability  and conduct training exercises for guerrilla warfare, reviewing  North Korea's capability of provoking unconventional warfare and  its possibility.    In a report, a senior CIOC officer said that North Korea  completed a "three-stage" preparedness for waging a war from  Oct. 8, 1992 through July 27, 1993 and that it regimented its  people and the military forces more tightly in its uphill  efforts to strengthen and maintain Kim Il-song's ideological  system, chuche or self-reliance.    North Korea has secured a 100,000-strong commando force, the  largest in the world, and about 2,000 special operatives, the  officer reported, revealing that it has recently concentrated on  construction of midget submarines and air-cushioned hovercrafts  for "high-intensity" infiltrations.    The North Korean military machine, according to the officer,  is also capable of sending roughly 20,000 combat troops  simultaneously into action by mobilizing AN-2 planes, cargo  aircraft and surface vessels.    He predicted that the types of provocations by North Korean  infiltrators would range from attempts to set up a underground  party in the South by using core agents and infiltration to the  rear areas through the demilitarized zone (DMZ) to conduct  political, ideological and psychological warfare and camouflaged  peace offensive.    In an address, Gen. Yi warned strongly against relaxation in  a sense of security and absent-minded posture, emphasizing the  sense of security in which part of the people regard a  possibility of military provocation by North Korea only as  groundless fear is a real threat and danger from within to the  national defense posture.    North Korea, the only Stalinist communist country in the  post-Cold War world, continues propagations and instigations to  both its people and military forces, for complete preparations  for a war with the South, Yi added.    At a ceremony in the wake of the hour-long meeting, the JCS  chairman conferred the presidential citations upon the Army's  Chungyong Unit, the Kyongsangpuk-to Civil Defense Consultation  Committee, the Kangwon-to regional police administration and the  Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co.s factory in the Changwon  Industrial complex for their contributions toward consolidation  of the counter-espionage system.</p>

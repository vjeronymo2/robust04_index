			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range with no economic features to assist dealing, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was subdued, coming in at 2,906, down 10 points from Wednesday's close. A firm gilts sector and a steady performance from the European markets brought a slow advance in the contract, and by 10am it was trading at the day's high of 2,921. It moved back and forth over the next few hours of trading mainly in the 2,905 to 2,915 range. Fears of a poor opening from Wall Street led to selling activity which pushed the September future to a day's low of 2,903. It recovered with the firm opening in New York. September ended at 2,913, off 3 points from Wednesday's close and 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume remained poor at 6,248 lots. Good turnover among the stock options continued to be the main feature in traded options, bringing total volume to 27,231 contracts. Hanson was particularly active and registered the biggest turnover at 2,810, with most of the day's business resulting from the August 220 puts. It was followed by Dixon's at 1,703 contracts and BP at 1,574. Lonrho, which reported figures yesterday, and Zeneca were also actively dealt. Just over 2,600 contracts were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,565 in the Euro FT-SE option.</p>

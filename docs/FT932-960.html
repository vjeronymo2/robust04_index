			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: The lines that led to a formula for success  -The rise of Shoprite, one of a new breed of hard discounters AT THE checkout in Shoprite's discount food store in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, a customer prods Mr Charles Good, managing director for Scotland, in the chest. 'When are you going to open one of these in Lennoxtown?' he asks in a thick Glaswegian accent. 'I'm sure you'd do a good trade there.' Such occurrences are not uncommon. Last week Mr Good had a letter from a family who claimed to be saving Pounds 1,500 a year by shopping at Shoprite. Another fan recently relocated 75 miles from his nearest branch wrote to say it was still cheaper for him to do his monthly shop at Shoprite even after making a 150-mile round trip. Those stories help explain why Shoprite has become one of the UK's fastest-growing food retailers, and has won the approval both of shoppers and of the City of London. Since branching out from its base on the Isle of Man and launching in Scotland in 1990, it has opened 50 stores and expects to be 'nudging 70' by the end of this year. The latest store, in Paisley, opened only last week and a second distribution centre opened at Cumbernauld last month to supplement the one it acquired from Safeway at Cambuslang in 1990. The group announced on Wednesday a 62 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.69m, and analysts are forecasting Pounds 4.8m for the full year compared with Pounds 2.7m in 1992. Shoprite is one of the new breed of hard discounters spreading across the UK but unlike other main exponents - Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's Ed - it is a home-grown format not proven first elsewhere. The man behind Shoprite, however, is Mr Deryck Nicholson, whose father Ken was a co-founder of Kwik Save, now the UK's largest discount grocer. Mr Nicholson has been steeped in the discount culture since he was pulled out of school at 16 to work in one of his father's stores for two shillings an hour. He has made Shoprite a model of the limited-line, hard discounter. Firstly, prices are pared to the bone. 'We don't charge what the market will bear, but the lowest price we can and still make a return,' says Mr Nicholson. Margins are correspondingly low - Shoprite claims they are the lowest in the retail trade, but will not reveal the precise figure. Discounting, according to the Nicholson philosophy, is about 'intelligent loss of margins'. The idea is that low prices stimulate large sales volumes and Shoprite aims to maximise this by selling fewer than 1,000 lines, compared with more than 15,000 in a typical Sainsbury or Tesco superstore. Those lines make up about 80 per cent of the average family's weekly shop, and hence are the fastest-moving. The next element in the formula is keeping both capital and operating costs low. Stores are sited in cheaper, secondary locations, and Shoprite is happy to convert old car showrooms or snooker halls. When it does build new stores, the designs are clean and bright, but basic. 'If you look at us from an interior decorator's point of view, you'll be surprised,' admits a cardboard sign at the entrance to Shoprite's store at Whitburn, Lothian. 'No frills, no soft lights, no kidding.' The advantages are obvious. Last year, capital spending was Pounds 13.8m - less than the average cost of one superstore for the likes of Sainsbury's - and Shoprite opened 22 stores. Stores are designed to minimise costs and maximise speed of turnover. Goods are sold off warehouse shelves from cardboard boxes with one side sliced off. Chilled cabinets open out into walk-in freezers behind, so that as goods are sold at the front, staff load fresh goods from the back. That, coupled with efficient stock handling, means Shoprite's stock turn rate - average stock divided by sales - is 'the best in the industry', according to Mr Nicholson. The result is that most goods are sold before they are paid for, so the company's suppliers effectively provide its working capital. Shoprite differs from some of its hard discount competitors in its investment in technology. Goods are scanned at the checkouts, and the sales information transmitted to Cambuslang where it triggers re-ordering of goods. The UK's biggest food retailers are only now introducing similar sales-based ordering systems. Another important Shoprite strategy is to rent out in-store concessions to local butchers and greengrocers, rather than trying to sell fresh fruit, vegetables and meat itself - a high-cost business requiring special skills. That means it can offer a full range of goods to customers without incurring extra costs, while receiving a useful rental income. Shoprite, until now the only hard discounter in Scotland, faces an increasingly tough environment as both Netto and Kwik Save have announced plans to expand north of the border. Mr David Webster, deputy managing director, is unconcerned. He expects the discount sector to have 25 per cent of the Pounds 4bn Scottish grocery market by 1996, trading from 350 stores. He forecasts that Shoprite will have 200 of those stores, and a 15 per cent market share - worth Pounds 600m a year. But Sassenachs take note - Shoprite is likely to open its first sites in England before the end of next year.</p>

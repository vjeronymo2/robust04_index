			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sega acquires French game machine maker SEGA Enterprises, Japan's leading maker of commercially-used games equipment, has agreed to buy WDK, the French games machine maker, for FFr9m, plus the assumption of undisclosed debt. Sega last year purchased Deith Leisure, the UK games equipment company, and has set up a representative office in Spain. Sega also last year purchased the video games subsidiary of Richard Branson's Virgin Group for Dollars 60m. The acquisition of WDK will give Sega a large opening into the European market since WDK will be installing about 220 machines in Euro Disneyland, which is to open next month. Sega is expecting first year revenue of over Y500m in the first year. WDK's current annual sales are about FFr100m.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  3. Public-Private Sector Joint Research Programs </H5>   The technical development of private companies in Japan is  shifting from the traditional means in which companies import  technologies from abroad to a more modern approach whereby  companies base their growth on applied research and practical  research oriented toward commercialization and  industrialization. However, when we consider the current  technological level and development potential of Japan, it is  obvious that a stronger emphasis must be placed on more  fundamental research and development.    Research and development in basic and foundational areas  carries with it major technical and economic risks, so it is  hard to say whether such R&amp;D will be fully implemented by  private companies in Japan.    On the other hand, since the AIST laboratories were  established we have seen a steady growth of practical results in  the area of foundational research, so the research potential is  extremely high when observed from that perspective.    In order to more effectively promote foundational research  in  Japan, AIST initiated the Private-Public Sector Joint Research  Program in 1985 with the specific aim of implementing joint  research that would take maximum advantage of the foundational  research potential in AIST laboratories and be organically  linked with the human and financial potential of private  industry.    In the conventional joint research system, government  research laboratories would promote research and development  through the private sector, but that system was equivalent to  allocating research as there was no exchange of research or  shared use of equipment. It would be an overstatement to say  that this system was successful, particularly since there were  no budgetary actions taken by the government. The new joint  research program, however, enables centralized joint research by  establishing organic links between the public and private  sector. This research program includes the joint use of  equipment owned by AIST laboratories as well as equipment owned  by private industry.  <H5>  1. Priority Research Projects </H5>   These are research projects in which public interest is  thought to be particularly high. These topics are concerned with  foundational research essential to building an industrial base  and with joint research between private companies and AIST  laboratories in high priority areas.  <H5>  2. Research Implementation </H5>   The research will be carried out at AIST laboratories or at  private corporations depending on the needs at the time.    (2) Use of research equipment    In order to produce effective joint research based on  organic  links between the public and private sector, AIST laboratories  will accept private researchers (civilians), allow private  research equipment to be used, and allow private researchers to  use research equipment owned by the AIST research laboratories  free of charge.    In addition, the government will send researchers to private  companies as the need arises (official business visits).    (3) Research and development funding    Personnel costs will be handled separately. In terms of the  equipment needed for research, there will be no charge to either  party for the use of each other's equipment. Payment for new  equipment, supplies, and utilities will be determined according  to the respective share of research being implemented by each  party.    (4) Contributing equipment    It will also be possible for privately owned companies which  are supplying their own equipment to the AIST laboratory for the  purpose of joint research to donate that equipment to the AIST  research laboratory if it is thought to be too expensive to  remove the equipment once the joint research has been completed,  or if the equipment was designed exclusively for a particular  joint research project, or if it was built so that it could  continue to be used in the future by the AIST laboratory.    The research findings made during joint research will become  joint public-private property.

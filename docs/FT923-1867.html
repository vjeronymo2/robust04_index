			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Senate tightens Cuba embargo The US Senate has passed the Cuban Democracy Act, bringing significantly closer a tightening of the US economic embargo against Cuba, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The act would ban the foreign subsidiaries of US companies from trading with Cuba. Both presidential candidates, President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, support the bill, and supporters are confident it will be passed by the House of Representatives this week. US companies have been banned from trading with Cuba for 30 years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by </F> correspondent Milan Velecky at the Turecky vrch military  training area near Bratislava on 8 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Velecky] At your press conference, you said  that Slovakia did not have the financial means even to maintain  the kind of army allowed by international agreements. Couldn't  this have a negative impact on the defense capability of our  state?    [Kanis] Naturally, in the prevailing peaceful conditions,  when there are prerequisites for stability based on peaceful  coexistence, as well as for stability and security of individual  countries, the demands on the numbers of servicemen are no  longer the same as in the previous historical stage.    Of course, just like any other army in the neighboring  states, the Slovak Army has problems arising from the lack of  financial resources. But even if we cut the numbers of  servicemen, it will not affect the defense capability of our  country because our neighbors are doing the same. Moreover, at  the moment, the whole question is an open one. It is a public  issue under international control, and therefore our defense is  also ensured through checks on the effort made in this sphere by  other states. We do not have to worry, therefore, that  Slovakia's defense capability will be affected as a result of a  reduction in the number of servicemen.    [Velecky] An amendment to the law on the state budget is  being prepared, and it has been suggested that some of the  resources alloted to the Army for this year should be cut. What  preparations for this variant are you making?    [Kanis] It is true that the situation in education and the  health service, in particular, is so serious that the government  has to find the necessary financial resources to prevent the  collapse of these two areas. [passage omitted]    Naturally, if my budget is cut, I would endeavor to make up  for it somehow--for example, by importing spare parts or  technology instead of repayments from the Russian Federation. A  contract for $(?90) million has been prepared, and this should  cover at least some of our needs.    At the same time, we have to make the Army more proactive in  generating income of its own. One has to say quite openly,  however, that the needs of the Army have not been properly taken  into account for some years, and, therefore, it is now extremely  important that next year's budget respect the needs of the  defense capability of the Slovak Republic.</p>

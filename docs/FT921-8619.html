			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Royal Exchange, Manchester One of the delights of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester is that - as its name suggests - it is the home of the old stock exchange. The theatre in the round is on the trading floor. It is ringed by galleries and some of the old prices can still be seen chalked on boards. This seemed a natural place for Romeo and Juliet, evoking images of Romeo shinning up and and down. The Manchester theatre, however, is full of surprises, and the central surprise of Gregory Hersov's modern dress production is that there is no balcony scene as such. Instead there is a bed scene: a large double bed where the adolescent lovers come of age is placed firmly in the centre of the stock exchange floor. Afterwards Romeo departs with a climbing rope, but we never see it being used. There are other novelties. This is the first time that I have seen the early love-sick Romeo enter drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels. Played by Michael Sheen, he also smokes heavily and wears a ring in his left ear. Alcohol is prominent throughout. The nurse (Gillian Hanna) gets drunk at the banquet. The icy Lady Capulet (Amelia Bullmore) seldom appears without a glass in hand, possibly as a sedative to protect her from her husband, splendidly played as a north country businessman by John Branwell. In the background there is a touch of John Braine's novel, Room at the Top. Poetry is not the production's strong point. Mercutio's Queen Mab speech, spoken by Jud Meyers, comes out as rap, with the music going in the background. There are no pauses to let the beauty of the lines take over. And whatever else may be said of Kate Byers's Juliet, she is not at her best when speaking verse. Some of the best-known lines like 'Gallop apace, your fiery-footed steeds' come out as if they were simply par for the course. Nevertheless, the entire show is an extraordinarily vibrant spectacle which, one is tempted to say, owes something to West Side Story. The remarkable fact is that, apart from the poetry, it gets everything right. This Juliet is, as she should be, more mature than Romeo, and clearly a handful for her parents. Romeo matures later and the piece is full of adolescent energy and changes of mood. The fights, seemingly springing up from nowhere, are convincing throughout. The production owes a lot to the set, designed by David Short, and the lighting by Michael Calf. At first it looks as if the play will be done almost without scenery and props - in line with the modern dress. The main device is the light: Calf manages to capture the shimmering Italianate heat rising up from the floor. Yet the initial absence of props is deceptive. It draws attention to the importance of the bed when it appears centre-stage. And by the death scene at the end, the stage is almost crowded with tombs. The performance runs in Manchester until March 28 and then tours a number of leisure centres around the country. It is worth catching anywhere.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Exchange to take big stake in Crest The London Stock Exchange board has voted to become one of the largest shareholders in Crest, the Bank of England's proposed system for paperless share settlement, partly in the hope of influencing the design of the project. The Tier 1 stake, which could cost up to Pounds 750,000, will give the stock exchange a Crest shareholding of up to 10 per cent. There are to be four tiers of shareholdings. The Crest board will consist of Bank of England appointees during the design phase, but shareholders will be entitled to influence a 'shadow board' which will be allowed to make some important decisions. The Bank has indicated that, because of strong demand for Tier 1 stakes, each shareholder's stake may be cut to about 6 per cent of the total and the price cut accordingly. The Bank set up a team to develop Crest after the collapse of the stock exchange's ill-fated Taurus paperless share settlement project, intended to replace the existing Talisman system. Since then, the stock exchange has been seeking a role for itself in equities settlement. When Crest is fully operational, the exchange may have no role in settlement. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, stock exchange chairman, had said the exchange would like to have a stake in Crest of up to 30 per cent. However the Bank said it did not wish any single entity or interest group to have a significant stake and told the exchange a 30 per cent holding would be inappropriate. The stock exchange has also suggested it could become the 'service manager' for Crest, a role the Bank has indicated it may well award to the exchange. The service manager would work for Crest on a contractual basis and set policy for the new system.</p>

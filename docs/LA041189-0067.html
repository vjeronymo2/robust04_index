			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO  </P> <P> An unidentified man, in his 20s, died of multiple stab wounds he suffered  during a scuffle near the international border Sunday night, authorities said.  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents witnessed the fight among five men in the Tijuana  River levee about a quarter of a mile west of the San Ysidro port of entry,  said Lt. Phil Jarvis of the San Diego Police Department's homicide detail.  </P> <P> When the agents approached the five men, four fled across the border into  Mexico, leaving the mortally wounded man, who died at the scene.  </P> <P> Jarvis said Monday that there was no motive yet in the slaying. He said it was  not known if the knifing erupted over an argument that spilled over to the U.S.  side of the border or if it stemmed from a holdup by border bandits.  </P> <P> The victim is described as being 5-foot-11 and 136 pounds, with a scraggly  beard and mustache, said Dan Matticks, deputy coroner.  </P></p>

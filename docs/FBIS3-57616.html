			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Vladimir </F> Gondusov]    [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan -- The Information and Press  Department of Russia's Defense Ministry today described an  article in the Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN as "utter fiction  and a provocative fabrication." The article claimed the  existence of a secret report entitled "The Military Policy of  the Russian Federation Toward the Asian-Pacific Region in New  Political Conditions." Extracts from the report were reprinted  in several Russian publications, which cited SHUKAN BUNSHUN as  the source.    The SHUKAN BUNSHUN report alleges that "the center for  military-strategic analysis" of the General Staff of Russia's  Ministry of Defense prepared a report, marked "especially  secret," on the involvement of 160 Russian nuclear scientists in  nuclear research in North Korea. It said that Russian  specialists had helped to develop North Korean nuclear warheads  and the medium-range Nodong-1 missile. Extracts from the report  were supposed to have been forwarded to the U.S. Defense  Department on 22 October 1993, under the serial number 001  SM-137, after it had been read by Boris Yeltsin and Pavel  Grachev.    The Defense Ministry told ITAR-TASS that "there is no such  center for military-strategic analysis." "There is a center for  military-strategic research" but "not only did it not prepare  such a report, it has never even heard of it." The Defense  Ministry does not use serial numbers of the type mentioned in  the article. It does not have the classification "especially  secret." It uses "top secret" instead. The Information and  Press Department describes this "sensation" as "totally  concocted."</p>

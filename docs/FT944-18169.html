			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / China and US settle missiles dispute The US and China yesterday settled a year-old dispute over Chinese exports of missile technology to Pakistan. In a deal signed in Washington yesterday, the US agreed to lift trade sanctions it imposed last year to punish China for the missile technology exports. In exchange, China promised to stop all exports of missiles that can carry a payload of more than 500kg further than 300km. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the deal was a 'global and verifiable ban' on all Chinese exports of missiles classified as Category One under the Missile Technology Control Regime, which sets the 500kg and 300km limits. The US originally imposed sanctions on China a year ago after complaining that China had violated the MTCR by selling Pakistan technology for M-11 missiles. China has always insisted that it did not violate the MTCR, and Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, repeated that position yesterday. 'China does not engage in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including missiles outside the MTCR regime,' he said. Some of the discussion hinged on whether the M-11, whose official range is slightly less than 300km, was covered by the MTCR. US officials said its capability placed it within MTCR guidelines, and see the missile as a proliferation threat because of its potential to carry nuclear warheads. The US sanctions prohibited the granting of export licences to sell China advanced electronics, space and aircraft systems worth an estimated Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m a year. Relations between China and the US have improved since President Bill Clinton in May abandoned efforts to link China's trading privileges to human rights.</p>

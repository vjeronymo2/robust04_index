			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Conservative victory close, says Heseltine MR Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said yesterday that the government is in striking distance of a fourth election victory. 'We are not quite there yet but we are in striking distance,' he said on LBC Radio. He emphasised that this was because of the prime minister's leadership style and strengths on the domestic and international stages. As campaigning intensifies ahead of Thursday's local elections, conflicting opinion polls suggest that neither the Labour party nor the Conservative party has a clear lead. They give widely differing impressions of how the parties are faring. Most worryingly for Labour, an Independent On Sunday poll by Numbers Market Research gave the Tories a 10 percentage point lead. Labour officials dismissed the results as 'rogue'. The Sunday Telegraph gave Labour a 3 percentage point lead over the Tories and a Sunday Times Mori poll put the Conservatives 2 points ahead of Labour. The Sunday Times estimated that the Tories were likely to lose 400 seats in the local elections, while Labour stood to gain about 600. The Sunday Telegraph poll said 52 per cent of voters thought Mr Major had been bold in dealing with the poll tax. A Sunday Express poll said 54 per cent were in favour of the council tax. Liberal Democrats, although standing at about 13 per cent or 14 per cent in the polls, remain pessimistic about Thursday's results, with one official admiting at the weekend that the party might make net losses. The party talks instead of raising its influence in areas of strength, issuing a list of 12 councils where it expects to take control. They include Berwick-upon-Tweed, Cheltenham, Eastbourne and Colchester. Letters, Page 17</p>

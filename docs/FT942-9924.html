			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Job creation shake-up proposed A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the departments of employment and education as part of a package of measures to focus education more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure group said yesterday. The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the Training and Enterprise Councils in England - the employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes - almost halving their number from 75 to 40 and allowing them to replace Local Education Authorities as a source of support for schools. Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually after the formation of this new department.' The other aim of his proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and create a skilled workforce up to world standards. He said that 20 per cent of the labour force was permanently excluded from work or functionally illiterate and employed in low skilled jobs which are disappearing. The new Whitehall department, said Mr Ayer, would take in the minister for sport from National Heritage and the prison education service. The Commons select committee on trade and industry recently suggested that the employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the trade department. The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in 1990. They needed to be relaunched, the report said, as independent local strategists freed from central government control and encouraged to merge with chambers of commerce. It also called for the development of a partnership between Tecs and universities, partly to refocus the educational system on vocational concerns rather than on academic elitism.</p>

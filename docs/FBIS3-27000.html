			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference held by Taiwan President Li </F> Teng-hui with unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang  Kai-shek International Airport on 16 February; from the "Hookup"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted containing reporter's summary  of Li Teng-hui comments] At present, after the end of the Cold  War, the international situation, especially the international  economic situation, has gradually shifted toward regional  cooperation. The further establishment of regional economic  relations under these circumstances is a matter of great  importance. There should be an exchange of views between the  leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of  China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and  their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will  be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there  were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic  relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and  hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the  three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded  fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to  further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation  in the Asian region in the future.    Through our current visit, we can see that all countries'  views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more  than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing.  Although we met with many unnecessary interferences in the  course of our visit to the three countries, we handled those  matters in a very serious manner. We are convinced that the  whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a  progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and  a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different  opinions toward any region or country, including Communist  China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our  efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia  are all the same. Further development of our country [women  guojia] must be separated from the ideological field. We should  continue to make greater efforts in the three directions, namely  peace, cooperation, and prosperity. [passage omitted containing  reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments]    The benefits to foreign relations through the current visit  cannot be seen in the short term. We must patiently make  contacts with many countries step by step. By doing this, we  will achieve genuine results. However, we do not have a  political agenda. Everyone should realize that the ROC on Taiwan  must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a country of a  divided China [zhonghua minguo keyi shuo shi zhongguo fenlie  zhong de yige guojia]. The whole world should realize that a  unified China is a goal we will attain in the future. However,  at present the reality is that China is divided. As a divided  country under separate rule, we should set the direction for our  own development. This will produce greater benefits for China  when it achieves unification. The Chinese of the world should  not approach this unofficial visit from a political point of  view, regarding it as something that was intended to create one  China, one Taiwan, or two China's. There is no need to see the  visit in this way, and quite obviously, that was impossible.  This may be a year the ROC will develop a new direction for its  international relations. I will visit countries with which we  have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we do not  have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say which  countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after every  preparation has been made. The country I would like to visit  most is the United States [Li and other people's laughter].  [passage omitted containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui  comments]    All the countries in the world, including their leaders and  officials, are very pragmatic. They have their own way of  looking at economic growth and democracy. Therefore, we need  not worry about this issue. Nor should we adopt an unfriendly  attitude toward the mainland simply because of its attitude. We  shall continue to maintain our existing ties with the mainland.  What we are doing is trying to strengthen mutual trust. We  should continue to do so. We should tell them: Your acting like  this will do no good to yourselves. We should use this  opportunity to let everyone know. We should help the countries  concerned. These countries will gradually come to realize that  the ROC can help them better than any other country. Once they  realize this, they will change their attitude. [passage omitted  containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments]    Whether it is an achievement or not, I will be very happy if  anything I did is beneficial to the country. My state of mind  has not changed as a result of the visit. I would feel very  good if I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning  candle, could help improve the life of ordinary citizens and  enable them to live peacefully in the country and region. It is  not appropriate to grade myself. Nobody has ever graded  oneself. However, I am very happy. [passage omitted containing  reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments].</p>

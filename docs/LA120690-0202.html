			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR LIGHTS AND HOLIDAY PARADES;  </P> <P> BOATS: THE CHRISTMAS PROCESSIONS HAVE BECOME A TRADITION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  -- FROM MORRO BAY TO DANA POINT.  </P> <P> Irving Fisher gets into the holiday spirit each year by putting a few lights on  the 47-foot sailboat Double Coupon that he moors in Marina del Rey . . . a few  thousand lights, that is.  </P> <P> The 3,000 lights are encased in plastic tubing, which makes it easier for  Fisher, his wife, Lil, and their crew of 29 family members and friends to  string them up.  </P> <P> But the lights, powered by an 8,000-watt generator, are just the beginning.  Next come the props and the rented costumes. After a week of planning, the  actual decorating takes as much as two days.  </P> <P> "We've got it down to a science now," says Fisher, 64, who has been  participating in boat parades for more than a quarter-century.  </P> <P> And when the boat is fully decorated, Fisher enters it in the Marina del Rey  Christmas Boat Parade, hoping to win one or more of the many prizes given to  the most impressive boats.  </P> <P> Christmas boat parades have become a popular tradition in Southern California.  Almost every harbor holds one in December and all are open to public viewing.  </P> <P> The tradition of lighted boat parades came to Southern California in 1908. An  Italian gondolier in Newport Beach and some of his fellow small-boat operators  piloted a gondola and eight canoes, all lit with Japanese lanterns, into the  harbor to celebrate the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> The summer parades were canceled in 1949 because of the traffic congestion they  caused. But the parades in Newport surfaced again years later, this time during  the winter holidays. Today, the Newport Beach parade is one of the largest with  as many as 200 boats participating.  </P> <P> The popularity of the Newport Beach parade has helped spawn others. When Marina  del Rey harbor was created, some people who had been mooring their boats in  Newport moved to the new marina and the parade tradition moved with them,  according to Marina del Rey parade spokeswoman Willie Hjorth. Marina del Rey is  holding its 28th annual parade this year, and regularly draws up to 75,000  spectators.  </P> <P> While some of the boat parades are one-night affairs, many drift into a second  night, and Newport Beach stretches the celebration over seven consecutive  nights.  </P> <P> The decorations also vary. Some boaters, happy just to participate, will simply  string up some lights and treat the parade as a good excuse to throw a party.  Others, like Irving Fisher, who lives in Sherman Oaks, strive to create a  stunning visual effect in an effort to capture a prize. After winning the  Marina del Rey parade sweepstakes award in 1965 and 1987, for example, Fisher  won a yet another award last year by setting up a mock film set on the front of  his boat while a woman played an electronic organ in the back.  </P> <P> Fisher says that by using the same lights each year, he doesn't go overboard on  decoration expenses. But some corporate entries will spend thousands of dollars  hiring to create an extraordinary floating entry, says Hjorth.  </P> <P> You can watch boat parades from just about anywhere. Prime viewing may be from  a blanket on the grass at Burton Chace Park in Marina del Rey to grandstand  seating in Newport Beach. In Dana Point, spectators even buy tickets to ride on  a parade boat.  </P> <P> But wherever you watch from, be sure to arrive a good while before the boats  sail. Parking on land is at a premium.

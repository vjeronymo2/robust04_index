			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIJING SAYS ZHAO IS FREE AND BEING PAID  </P> <P> Former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who has been widely  thought to be under house arrest for allying himself with pro-democracy  demonstrators, remains free and is drawing his normal salary, a government  spokesman said Sunday.  </P> <P> The statement by Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, China's Cabinet, is  the government's strongest indication yet that Zhao is unlikely to face a  criminal trial. Zhao, who has not been seen in public since May 19, was removed  from his post as party head in June for allegedly "splitting the party" and  supporting what the government now calls a "counterrevolutionary rebellion."  </P> <P> "Yuan Mu revealed that Zhao Ziyang remains free and enjoys the same pay and  welfare as before," the New China News Agency reported. "Zhao Ziyang still  lives in Beijing."  </P> <P> Yuan added, however, that the Communist Party is still investigating Zhao and  that he will be treated according to "the facts of his mistakes." Zhao, 70, who  was replaced as general secretary by former Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin,  is still a Communist Party member, and he could be further punished by being  stripped of his party membership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tells Japanese Reporters  </P> <P> Yuan's remarks were made to visiting Japanese journalists, then distributed by  the official Chinese news agency. He was not quoted as specifically dealing  with the issue of whether Zhao might be tried.  </P> <P> But by officially indicating that there has been no decision to detain Zhao,  even under house arrest, Yuan's statement appeared to back up more informal  comments made to Western reporters last week by Vice Minister of Culture Ying  Ruocheng. Ying, when asked specifically whether Zhao would be placed on trial,  replied: "I don't think so. I don't think so. That's a personal opinion. (Not)  unless he did something I didn't know."  </P> <P> Some hard-liners would prefer to take more severe action against Zhao, who was  widely viewed as China's most powerful advocate of rapid economic and political  reform, in order to increase the difficulties he would face in any bid to  return to power after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, 85, leaves the political  stage.  </P> <P> In an important indication that some economic reforms will continue despite  Zhao's fall, Yuan also announced the most sweeping price adjustments to be  approved since an economic retrenchment program was launched a year ago. China  will raise the prices of grain, cotton and some other farm produce, energy and  some key raw materials in order to promote the development of these segments of  its economy, Yuan said.  </P> <P> While the price boosts will occur under conditions of government control, they  will bring the costs of these key items closer to true market prices and thus  help eliminate some of the severe irrationality in pricing that distorts  China's economy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transport Prices Hiked  </P> <P> Early this month, transportation prices were raised sharply, with the average  cost of long-distance train tickets jumping 120%. Large price jumps in the  areas announced Sunday would be major steps toward price reform.  </P> <P> The conditions for carrying out price reform, which was put on hold last summer  amid accelerating inflation, may have been improved by a government-initiated  economic slowdown that has begun to show signs of sharply reducing inflation.  </P> <P> Official statistics released Sunday indicated that during the month of August,  there was virtually no inflation in 35 large and medium-size cities across  China.  </P> <P> Prices last December, according to official statistics, were up 26% over  December, 1987. Figures released Sunday show that urban prices in August were  up only 13% over August, 1987. The far greater part of that 13% rise -- perhaps  all of it -- occurred during late 1988 and the first months of this year, when  prices were climbing sharply. That means prices have been essentially stable  over the summer.  </P> <P> Yuan said that China's current restructuring program aims to strengthen  agriculture and basic industries and infrastructure, while limiting "excessive  development" of most light industries. The speed of expansion of small rural  and private enterprises, which have been the most dynamic sector of China's  industrial economy, will be slowed, while their technological and management  levels will be upgraded, he said.  </P> <P> Touching on other political questions, Yuan said that martial law in Beijing  cannot be lifted soon because it is "one of the important factors to maintain  the stability of the capital and the whole country," the official news agency  reported, paraphrasing his remarks.  </P> <P> Yuan also said that China will insist on maintaining the dictatorship of the  Communist Party and that no independent trade unions, opposition parties or  opposition factions will be allowed to exist.  </P></p>

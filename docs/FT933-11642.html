			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM reports second-quarter operating results IBM, which yesterday announced an Dollars 8.9bn pre-tax restructuring charge to cover job losses and plant cutbacks, also reported its second-quarter operating results, including a net loss of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents a share, before special items, write Martin Dickson and Louise Kehoe. That compared to earnings of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29, a year earlier. Revenues totalled Dollars 15.5bn, down 4.3 per cent on the year-ago period. The restructuring charge worked through at Dollars 8bn after tax and turned the net loss to one of Dollars 8bn, or Dollars 14.10 a share. IBM said its sales of computer equipment fell 12.9 per cent to Dollars 7.5bn, while its revenues from other sources rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars 8bn. Software revenues rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 2.72bn from Dollars 2.68bn. Revenues from maintenance contracts fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.90bn. Service revenues were up strongly by 26.6 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn from Dollars 1.86bn. Rentals and financing revenues fell 6.3 per cent to Dollars 1.07bn from Dollars 1.14 bn. The company's important mainframe computer business saw sales decline on a year-on-year basis, but the rate of decline was less than in the first quarter. Mainframe revenues in the second quarter were significantly above the first quarter. IBM's storage products business also declined, compared to the previous year. But the company said its personal computer and workstation businesses continued to do well. IBM said customers had responded well to new high end models of its AS/400 computers which it began shipping in the quarter. AS/400 revenues had fallen in the quarter, compared to a year ago, but the rate of decline was less than in the first quarter. Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, said the overall gross margin remained stable for the third consecutive quarter. It was 'far too early to declare victory on that front, but its an encouraging sign,' he added. For the six months, IBM recorded a net loss before restructuring charges of Dollars 325m, or 58 cents share, compared to earnings of Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.41, a year ago. Revenues fell 5.6 per cent to Dollars 28.6bn.</p>

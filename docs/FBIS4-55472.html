			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by "(vg)"; </F> place and date not given: "One Question for Defense Minister  Pavol Kanis"]    [Text] [Correspondent] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] command has shown an interest in dispatching another 400  of our troops to the former Yugoslavia. How will the Slovak  side react?    [Kanis] Naturally, we have to look at all of the aspects of  this request. It is necessary to weigh the material and  financial aspects and also, of course, the possibilities for the  human resources the Slovak Army has at its disposal. However,  from the preliminary discussions the members of the delegation  have had among themselves, it is clear that it would be possible  to comply with the request--on condition that the UN payments  would not be delayed, as is the case now, by a year, but would  be made immediately or, possibly, with a slight delay. In this  case, we could overcome the problem of this department's tight  budget.</p>

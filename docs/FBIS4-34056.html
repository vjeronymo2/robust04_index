			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 9 Jun (AE) -- The military ministers have  told President Itamar Franco about the pressure they are  receiving from the troops who demand salary increases. They  warned him of the worsening of the resentment in the barracks  over low salaries. Military chiefs today leaked official reports  passed to the president of the Republic in which they attempt to  prove the unfeasibility of the domestic military budget which  includes salaries that are considered dramatically low. "The  budget does not cover our expenses," said Admiral Arnaldo Leite,  chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff (EMFA).    Army Minister General Zenildo Lucena confirmed the concern  felt among the military leadership and admitted that a  disruption of discipline may occur, although in isolated  incidents and within the scope of control of the commanders.  Adm. Leite is not as optimistic and considers it risky to  attempt to contain the troops' resentment without concrete  solutions.    During a meeting at the EMFA headquarters today, the four  military ministers decided to send President Itamar Franco a  draft bill seeking to get Congress to establish a new salary  system exclusively for the military.    In the report given to President Franco, the military  leadership describes the situation as "unbearable." The report  contains one worrisome fact, particularly regarding the  recessive stage of the Real Plan: "What hurts the military most  is that the sacrifice is not being shared equally among all  public servants," the report states, adding: "Some employees are  much better paid than others."    Adm. Leite stressed this serious aspect of the problem,  mentioning the impunity with which businessmen commit price  abuses, and asked for immediate and concrete measures against  them. He said: "What hurts greedy businessmen most is not a  prison sentence, but high fines. That way their pockets are  affected, like ours."    To prove his complaints are well founded, Adm. Leite  reported  that a squadron admiral, the top post of the Navy career, with  45 years of service, currently earns a gross salary of 2,000  URV's [Real Value Unit] or a net salary of 1,300 URV's. Adm.  Leite mentioned his fear of discord among the troops, adding:  "If a soldier disobeys the rules we will arrest him, but this is  not a solution." Leite believes the solution is a salary that  at least allows military personnel to pay their bills, so as to  prevent moonlighting -- which is not allowed.    The military document warns: "There is a risk of instability  in the basic principles of hierarchy and discipline because  subordinates blame their chiefs for their low salaries. Since  they are prohibited from unionizing or striking, their chiefs --  that is, the Armed Forces Joint Chief of Staff -- must interpret  their feelings and fight for the troops' demands."    Here is a list of the expenses of a lieutenant colonel  graduated from the staff school and with 27 years of seniority,  married, with two children, one in college and another one in  high school, who is renting a three-room apartment in Grajau  District, northern Rio de Janeiro:    His gross monthly salary amounts to 1,329 URV's. (All  figures  are in URV) [1 URV is approximately equal to $1].    Gross salary (monthly): 1,329    Obligatory discounts (military pension fund, health fund,  income tax): 298    Net salary: 1,031    Expenses (monthly):    School (college, high school, English lessons): 518    Rent: 340    Energy, telephone, gas, and water: 168    Garbage collection: 2    Food: 350    Maid (earning a minimum salary, INSS [National Social  Security Institute] contribution, transportation): 80    Savings account (gross 10 percent to pay for a housing  loan): 199    Fuel and bus, subway fares: 86    IPVA [expansion unknown] (expenses for Volkswagen Gol  utility vehicle): 38    Clothes and shoes: 42    Health expenses: 64    Military Club monthly fee: 14    Minimum leisure (going to the movies twice a month): 30    Personal expenses (barber, snacks, children's allowances,  newspaper): 99    Total expenses: 2030    Deficit: 999    Adjustment needed: 97 percent.</p>

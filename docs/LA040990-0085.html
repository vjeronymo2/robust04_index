			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS PLAN FOR HOUSING NEEDS  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has rejected a proposed housing plan for the city,  saying that it unfairly places the bulk of the planned low-cost housing in Old  Town and the Hill Area.  </P> <P> The plan, which outlines how the city will deal with future housing needs, was  also rejected because it didn't point out that the high cost of land made it  difficult to provide low-cost housing in Seal Beach, Development Director Lee  Whittenberg said.  </P> <P> The commission decided to meet again on April 18 to amend and vote on the plan.  </P> <P> The document, which was sent to the state Department of Housing and Community  Development last month for comments, includes suggestions that the city  investigate the possibility of encouraging high-density, low-income housing on  two five-acre sites in the city; the conversion of an unspecified building into  one-room apartments for the homeless; zoning changes to encourage low-cost  housing, and financial incentives for developers of low-cost housing.  </P> <P> After the state has commented on the plan, the city staff plans to revise it so  that all areas of the city equally share the burden of providing low-cost  housing. The staff will also add a section explaining the difficulty of  providing low-cost housing in an expensive beach community. MICHELLE NICOLOSI  </P></p>

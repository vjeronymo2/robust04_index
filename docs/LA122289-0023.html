			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HOLOCAUST REVENGE TAKES ROOT IN 'ROSE GARDEN'  </P> <P> Fons Rademakers' "The Rose Garden" (at the Westside Pavilion) certainly  accomplishes what it sets out to do: Call attention to an especially hideous  Nazi atrocity and show how difficult it is to bring the responsible Nazi  commandant to justice. Rademakers, the veteran Dutch director whose similarly  themed "The Assault" won an Oscar, suggests quite forcefully how a segment of  the German population continues to resist coming to terms with the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "The Rose Garden" is further bolstered by an impassioned performance by Liv  Ullmann as a tenacious Frankfurt public defender and by Maximilian Schell's  fine portrayal of a haunted, ravaged Holocaust survivor. However, Rademakers,  working in English -- not even the smallest bit player sounds dubbed -- is  hampered by a script that does not serve him nearly as well as that of "The  Assault."  </P> <P> What is factual about the film is that on April 20, 1945, Hitler's 56th  birthday, 20 Jewish children, most of whom had been deliberately infected with  tubercular bacilli in their lungs at the Neuengamme concentration camp, were  taken to the basement of a Hamburg school and given morphine injections and  then hanged. The executions were ordered because British troops were only six  kilometers from the port city.  </P> <P> Around this horrendous incident, screenwriter Paul Hengge has imagined this  plot: Schell, brother of two sisters who apparently died at the school, has  come from his home in Ecuador to West Germany determined to prevent the  one-time commander of Neuengamme (Kurt Hubner) from leaving the country, just  as yet another investigation of his responsibility in the atrocity is about to  be launched.  </P> <P> To a large extent, the language barrier creates confusion and uncertainties in  the narrative. Obviously, if we have to have an English-language version of a  German film, it's better that it not be the usual dubbed kind. Even so, we're  never quite sure where we are -- even on a second viewing -- as the film  switches endlessly from Hamburg to West Berlin to Frankfurt. Other key matters  pose unanswered questions: Why, once Ullmann realizes that Schell is a camp  survivor, doesn't it occur to her immediately that the man he strikes out at  violently is most likely an old Nazi? Since Schell's victim is an old Nazi, why  does he want to press charges against Schell? Is it out of arrogance because he  has successfully evaded justice in the past? Probably, but we never know for  sure.  </P> <P> Schell, 59, plays a man his age but has made himself look a haggard 10 or even  20 years older, a man so traumatized he can barely speak in his own defense. He  is the film's linchpin, since Ullmann has been handed so many anti-Nazi  speeches that not even she can keep them from becoming wearying in their  repetitiveness. Peter Fonda, whose suggestion of a German accent allows him to  blend in with the cast, is effective as Ullmann's suave, ambitious ex-husband  (and ex-law partner) whose gradual response from indifference to concern is  persuasive. Gila Almagor, the grande dame of the Israeli cinema, makes a brief  but stunning appearance.  </P> <P> What "The Rose Garden" (rated PG-13 for violence and adult themes) has to say  is too important not to regret that it wasn't said better.  </P></p>

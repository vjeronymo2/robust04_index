			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KANSAS CITY SUGGESTION  </P> <P> Although I enjoyed "Kansas City Is a City of Fountains" by Beverly Beyer and Ed  Rabey (Nov. 12), I wonder why there was no mention of the Alameda Plaza Hotel.  As far as I'm concerned, if I can't stay at the Alameda Plaza I don't want to  go to Kansas City. The address is 401 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Mo. 64112,  (816) 756-1500.  </P> <P> LOUISE MILLER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

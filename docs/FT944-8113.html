			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Rise in Japanese household spending Japan's household spending in the three months to September rose by 0.5 per cent in real terms from the same period a year before, according to figures published yesterday by the Management and Co-ordination Agency, Gerard Baker reports. The increase was the first in three quarters, and suggests the gradual economic recovery is lifting consumption. Household spending in the month of September alone increased 2.0 per cent from a year earlier, following a 0.4 per cent fall in August, a 0.1 per cent rise in July, and five consecutive monthly falls to June. Agency officials said the increase was largely due to special income tax cuts which took effect in the summer.</p>

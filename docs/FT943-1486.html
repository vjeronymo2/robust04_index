			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: ANZ plans buy-back deal for shareholders Australia and New Zealand Banking group, one of the four big Australian banks, yesterday announced plans to offer a buy-back facility for the new ordinary shares which will result from the conversion of its ADollars 600m (USDollars 441m) convertible preference share (CPS) issue in July next year. The move, which will require shareholder approval, will provide a 'convenient facility for CPS holders', the bank said. Mr John Gough, chairman, said it would have 'a positive impact on earnings per share and improve the return on equity for ordinary shareholders'. The 6m CPS were issued in 1991 at ADollars 100 each. Each will convert at a 10 per cent discount to the weighted average sale price of ANZ ordinary shares during the preceding five trading days. The buy-back price will be that used in the conversion calculation, guaranteeing holders the conversion discount and giving them ADollars 111 for each CPS.</p>

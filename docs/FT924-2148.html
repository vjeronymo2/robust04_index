			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Lombard League tightens its grip THE populist Lombard League yesterday convincingly demonstrated it had become the largest party in northern Italy at the expense of the long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The municipal elections, held over two days, covered 55 municipalities and the province of La Spezia. With more than 1m voters, this was the first key test of the political parties since general elections in April. The protest vote evident in the general election was even more pronounced. Yesterday it appeared directed against the main traditional parties and not the Amato government but the result will complicate the existence of the four-party coalition. On the basis of early returns, the League looked set to win more than 35 per cent of the vote in Varese, the home town of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, and 33 per cent in Monza. If this trend is confirmed, it will mean almost a doubling of support in two years for the League which campaigns against government corruption. Elements of its policies are right-wing, although it could form a coalition with the communists and could now aspire to run the Varese and Monza local administrations in the Milan industrial region. Voters' disenchantment with the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the principal partners in the Amato four-party coalition government, increases the pressure on these two parties to reform themselves and provide new leadership. Attention is likely to focus in particular on Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, whose credibility has been badly damaged as a result of the corruption scandal in his home base of Milan. The success of the League appeared to extend further south to Liguria's province of La Spezia where the movement's 2 per cent vote in municipal elections two years ago rose to more than 14 per cent. Nationwide, the Socialist party fared the worst, confirming the damage done to its credibility as a result of the Milan corruption scandal. In many instances, even in the south where it has had a strong base, the party saw its share fall below 7 per cent. The Christian Democrats' vote only held up in the south, where the neo-fascist MSI party made considerable advances.</p>

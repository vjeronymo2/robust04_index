			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Kooijmans came to Stockholm  today directly from Brussels. He anticipated a dramatic  development if the European Union [EU] foreign ministers do not  solve their problems on Tuesday [22 March].    [Begin Kooijmans recording, in English, followed by Swedish  translation] I know that the word crisis is used very often,  sometimes too early, but I would find that a very dramatic  development, which would stall also other forms of cooperation  within the European Union. [end recording]    [Correspondent] This was said by the Dutch foreign minister,  Peter Kooijmans, who this afternoon arrived in Stockholm almost  directly from the dramatic night in Brussels. He said that it  is not a crisis yet, but if the Twelve have not solved their  institutional questions by next Tuesday, it will become almost  impossible for the EU Parliament to discuss the EU's enlargement  before the elections in June, in order that the timetable of 1  January can be adhered to in the case of the four countries  which have their membership agreements ready. This would be a  very dramatic development, the Dutch foreign minister said.    Kooijmans was very critical of those countries which are now  putting the brakes on over the question of the blocking  majority, as he said. He does not see any logic in that; the  way the others want to deal with the matter is the same way that  has been applied in all other cases when the EU has received new  members. In addition, the EU Parliament would never accept the  views of Great Britain and Spain, he said. He therefore sees no  need to show flexibility toward the two countries. He also said  that if their governments have problems with their parliaments  at home, like the British Government has, why not say to the  critics that this problem has already been solved, it was solved  at the EU summit in Lisbon when the procedure concerning the new  members was taken up.    So, one can judge from the statements of Dutch Foreign  Minister Kooijmans that there is no room for compromise, and  during the night he did not see any such signs from the British  side either.</p>

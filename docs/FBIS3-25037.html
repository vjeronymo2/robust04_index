			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Vermaak] </F>   [Excerpts] The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North  Korea), one of SWAPO's [South-West African People's  Organization] biggest former ideological allies in the  propaganda and armed struggle, has closed its embassy and trade  mission in Windhoek virtually overnight, sold its assets, left  behind an unpaid telephone account, and left the country like a  "thief in the night." The Korean diplomats left the country  under a cloud of alleged financial and other irregularities  after they allegedly said in diplomatic circles that Namibia is  not "productive enough for business." There are unanswered  questions concerning the manner in which the North Koreans  allegedly tried to convert huge amounts of Namibian dollars to  U.S. dollars before leaving the country.    A spokesman for the government says that he can confirm,  unofficially, that the embassy is closed and that personnel,  including the ambassador, have already returned to North Korea.  "They left the country like thieves in the night." He said that  it is not acceptable protocol to expect the government to  announce that a diplomatic mission is about to close. "It is  their prerogative to make such an announcement." No one would  comment on future trade ties between the two countries.  Earlier, personnel of the North Korean Embassy were under  suspicion following a transaction concerning two luxury Toyota  vehicles which they allegedly tried to export to Angola. Two  diplomats were subsequently asked to return to North Korea.  [passage omitted]    Sources revealed to DIE REPUBLIKEIN that the North Koreans  had been leaving the country one by one since December last  year. The ambassador, Kim Pyong-ki, left the country quietly on  18 January without greeting anyone. [passage omitted] It came  to light last week that the trade mission had not paid its  telephone bill of approximately 1,800 rands. Sources say that  the North Koreans tried to convert large amounts of Namibian  dollars at a bank in the city for U.S. dollars. They could,  however, not convert all the money after the bank questioned the  source of the money and informed the Central Bank. One of the  senior members of the embassy apparently left the country on 7  January with an unidentified box. It was tightly wrapped in  paper and officially sealed. At the airport he apparently  refused to allow the box to be inspected, citing diplomatic  immunity. It was apparently not subjected to a check. The  Embassy of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) said, upon  inquiry, that it has no intention of leaving the country.</p>

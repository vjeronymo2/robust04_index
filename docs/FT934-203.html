			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / US bank tries to distance itself from troubled partner J P. Morgan has enjoyed a reputation for quality which is the envy of other US bankers. So it was with interest - and not a little glee - that other US financiers have watched the US's most prestigious bank become embroiled in Banesto's difficulties. In hard financial terms, the Spanish bank's problems will to have little impact on J. P. Morgan. It is thought to have invested Dollars 17.5m indirectly in the bank through the Corsair fund, a specialist limited partnership it created to invest in bank stocks. But the fact that J. P. Morgan, with its blue-chip reputation, was so closely linked with the bank will have greater repercussions. Banesto, an outsider in the Spanish banking establishment, did not appear a natural partner for J. P. Morgan. 'This was not a Morganesque institution,' said Mr George Salem, banking analyst at Prudential Securities. A second concern has been the extent to which J. P. Morgan allowed itself to become enmeshed in Banesto. This is likely to prompt questions about how the bank handled possible conflicts of interest. In February Corsair, a J. P. Morgan-sponsored bank 'vulture fund', took a Dollars 175m stake in the bank. Such funds aim to buy shares in troubled companies which they believe are undervalued and benefit from a share-price rebound. Then, in the spring and summer, J. P. Morgan led international equity issues for Banesto totalling about Dollars 775m. And Mr Robert Mendoza, one of four J. P. Morgan vice-chairmen, had a seat on Banesto's board. J. P. Morgan appeared yesterday to be distancing itself from Corsair. One financial institution which made inquiries of J. P. Morgan yesterday said the bank disclaimed responsibility for the fund. 'They bragged about it when they launched it, so they can't disown it now,' the institution said. By denting J. P. Morgan's reputation, the Banesto debacle could hurt its attempts to build an investment banking business. J. P. Morgan has been in the van of US commercial banks seeking to extend their involvement into the capital markets. It has only a small presence in the US underwriting business, handling 3.2 per cent of corporate debt issues and 1.5 per cent of equity issues this year, according to Securities Data. But its presence in US capital markets is still more substantial than any other US commercial bank. Institutions like the GE pension fund and Northwestern Mutual Life, the eighth-biggest US life company, were large holders in Banesto. The bank's problems, coming so soon after J. P. Morgan promoted its shares, are likely to harm the bank's relationships with such prominent US institutions. While US investors are thought to have been among the biggest buyers of Banesto's stock in rights issues led by J. P. Morgan this year, several institutions said Banesto's problems would not affect their involvement in international equity markets. The GE pension fund, with about 1.5 per cent of the bank's stock, said it would not change its plans. A portfolio of European bank stocks would still show a considerable gain this year even after the Banesto problems, said Mr John Hickling, an international portfolio manager with Fidelity Investments, the biggest US mutual funds group. 'Clearly retail investors are throwing money at a lot of things - most recently it's been the emerging markets funds. Those are the things that really terrify me,' he added.</p>

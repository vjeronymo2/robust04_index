			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by H.S. Rao of PTI] </F>   [Text] A great deal of importance was attached to the visit  of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe Talbott, to  India and Pakistan. In New Delhi, the first (?stop) on his  first foreign trip as U.S. deputy secretary of state, Strobe  Talbott has had cordial and frank exchange of views with Indian  leaders, including the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao.  During the discussions spreading over two days, Indian leaders  conveyed India's concern on the proposed U.S. move to transfer  F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. There were even indications that the  U.S. persistence with the supply could cast a cloud over the  prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Washington.    As New Delhi sees it, F-16's would adversely affect the  strategic balance against it in the region, forcing India to  take appropriate measures diverting the much-needed resources  from economic welfare programs and setting back the process of  economic reforms. The future course of Indo-U.S. relations, it  was clear, would be shaped by Washington's response to India's  concern. As expected, Mr. Talbott defended the U.S. proposal in  his talks at various levels, the ground that it was linked with  the nuclear nonproliferation obligations on the part of  Islamabad and that the aircraft would be transferred only if  Pakistan agreed to verifiable cap on the production of weapon  grade material. [sentence as heard] However, he told his hosts  in New Delhi that he had noted India's strong views.    During the talks, Mr. Talbott was plainly told of the  prevailing popular sentiment in India against the U.S. tilt  toward Pakistan in [word indistinct] of the cold war attitude.  India as was told did not like third parties to look for  equality, parity, or balance between India and Pakistan. The  territorial integrity of the country would not be sacrificed,  the Indian side said, while emphasizing that Jammu and Kashmir  was part of India. Mr. Talbott dealt with the tilt perception  at his press conference. As he put it, the very word tilt  belongs to the vocabulary of the past and specifically to the  vocabulary of the cold war. The U.S. has good relations with a  number of countries in the area -- certainly with India and  certainly with Pakistan. On Kashmir, the position of Clinton  administration, he said, is very simple and consistent. The  United States hopes very much that India and Pakistan will be  able to resolve this matter themselves as per the Simla  Agreement.    Forty-seven year-old Talbott, a former TIME magazine editor  and columnist, is a close friend of President Clinton. They  shared a room as Rhodes scholars at Oxford University a quarter  century ago. When Clinton visited Washington as governor of  Arkansas, he often stayed at Talbott's home. One of the  Talbott's assignments was to remove the sense of frustration in  Indo-U.S. relations. After his one-hour long discussions with  the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, Mr. Talbott observed  that no one person (?is fit) to bring about better understanding  and cooperation between India and the U.S. than Mr. Rao himself.  He also announced that Mr. Rao has accepted in principle an  invitation to visit the United States and Mr. Clinton looks  forward to receiving Mr. Rao to make the most of what the two  countries have in common. This itself is an indication of the  positive aspect. But the same cannot be said about Mr.  Talbott's diplomatic mission to Islamabad.    In Islamabad, Mr. Talbott held intensive talks with the  Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, President Farooq  Leghari, and other leaders. On the whole, the talks were held  in business-like fashion although cordiality and nostalgic  memories of an old strategic relationship marked the  discussions. Three major areas were covered. The issue of  nuclear disarmament in the South Asian regional context,  Kashmir, and the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral framework on the  question of inspections to ensure the capping of Islamabad's  nuclear armament program. A noticeable degree of convergence of  objectives came into focus in respect of the U.S. proposal for  multilateral forum to discuss nonproliferation in South Asia.  On the other two issues, though Pakistan appeared to have given  a patient hearing, no appreciation and nod from the U.S. was  available. On Kashmir, he reiterated the U.S. stand that India  and Pakistan should resolve it in accordance with the Simla  agreement. This indicates Pakistan's failure either to secure a  recognition of the linkage between Kashmir issue and nuclear  nonproliferation in South Asia or to elicit a view that Kashmir,  more than nuclear proliferation, is a complicating factor in  this region. Mr. Talbott also refused to budge on the issue of  verifiable cap on Pakistan's nuclear program and maintained that  discussions would continue between the U.S. and Pakistan.</p>

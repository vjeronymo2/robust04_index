			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Ceasefire agreed by Croat and Bosnian leaders THE BOSNIAN and Croatian leaders yesterday took a small step towards the resumption of Bosnian peace talks by agreeing to an immediate halt to fighting between mainly Moslem government troops and Croat forces in central and south-west Bosnia. The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, said after talks in Geneva with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian leader, that they had signed a ceasefire accord, apparently to come into effect by noon on Saturday. Most ceasefires to date have been ignored by the commanders on the ground. But Mr Tudjman claimed the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, who was not in Geneva yesterday, would respect the agreement, which also calls for the closure of all detention camps and free passage for humanitarian convoys. However, the leaders made no announcement about when the peace talks might reconvene, although they said that working parties would be established to discuss points of contention. Earlier, Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Tudjman discussed between themselves and with the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the vexed issue of access to the sea for the Moslem republic, a key obstacle to a resumption of the Bosnian peace talks, which broke up two weeks ago. Meanwhile, amid mounting pressure on the Moslems to return to the negotiations, Lord Owen told a separate meeting of the 29-nation steering committee of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia that Mr Izetbegovic's demand for a port at Neum was 'second-best' to access to Ploce on Croatia's Dalmatian coast, which the Croats have already offered. Lord Owen added that, in the mediators' view, the Moslems could not expect more than 30 per cent of Bosnian territory. In another reflection of the attempts to recapture the momentum in the peace process, Nato military planners are due to present to a Nato council meeting in Brussels today documents for the deployment of Nato peacekeepers in Bosnia. In Croatia, UN officials were yesterday attempting to secure a ceasefire after rebel Serb forces shot down a Croatian aircraft on a bombing raid. The Croatian government confirmed a Mig-21 had been hit after conducting bombing raids in Krajina.</p>

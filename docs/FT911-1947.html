			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (35): Favourite son returns - Polish Pope's third visit next month POPE JOHN Paul II, Poland's most famous son, returns to his homeland for the fourth papal visit next month. It will be his first visit to the new post-communist, sovereign Poland which he did so much behind the scenes to foster. Nobody will forget the Polish pope's first triumphant return to his native land in 1979. Millions turned out to greet him in a spontaneous outburst of national pride and religious fervour, which definitively settled Stalin's famous question, 'How many divisions has the Pope?' A year later, Solidarity erupted from the same well-spring of revived national energy, led by an alliance of catholic workers and catholic intellectuals, whose faith and determination contrasted with and shamed the bankrupt communistestablishment. His two subsequent visits in 1983 and 1987 were altogether more sombre affairs in the Poland of martial law. But both his presence and his close following of Polish events helped keep alive the sense that one day Poland would again be free. The church, traditional repository of Poland's historical continuity and culture, thrived in opposition to atheistic Marxism, and grew strong in adversity. But the Poland the Pope returns to next month is a country in the throes of transition to a market economy, multi-party democracy and a 'normal' (that is to say, western) consumer society. It is fast becoming a 'normal' society warts and all, including sex shops, openly displayed pornography and many of the grosser forms of nouveaux riches exhibitionism - liberating and enjoyable to some, sinful to traditional believers. He will, of course, be welcomed. But it is unlikely to be the same as before. Under communism, there was a clear distinction between church and state. But in the new Poland the church is jockeying for power and influence in ways which more secular Poles find increasingly irksome. Successful church pressure to introduce religious instruction in schools, and above all its campaign to change the country's liberal abortion laws, are all controversial issues on views. So, however, do defenders of civil rights, such as veteran dissident and former labour minister Jacek Kuron, who is prepared to push for a national referendum on the abortion question. Such issues threaten to embroil the Pope in the domestic political scene, only months before elections in October, from which the church hopes to see emerge a strong Christian democrat-type party at the heart of Polish politics. At a time when many Poles face the previously unknown perils of unemployment and further economic hardship, his words will also be carefully weighed for any direct or implied criticism of the government's present commitment to the speediest possible transition to a market economy. The liberal free-marketeers, currently in charge, reject the old distorted communist welfare-state mentality. But to many, the old social safety-net sits easier with traditional Christian charity than policies which inevitably favour the fleet of foot at the expense of the lame. The Pope's travels will take him through rural Poland, where the church is strongest, and close to the eastern frontier. Thousands of catholics from the Baltic states, Byelorussia and the Ukraine are expected to flock over the borders to hear their spiritual leader. The church has its ost-politik, too, and is busy restoring ties and rebuilding congregations in lands which not long ago were part of Poland.</p>

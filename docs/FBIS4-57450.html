			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 14 May (EFE) -- Hernando de Soto, president of  the Freedom and Democracy Institute (ILD), said today that  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori uses the Armed Forces in  activities "for which they have not been trained." De Soto told  the press that when the Armed Forces are used that way "there is  the risk of contradictions, among them human rights violations,  corruption over drug trafficking, and the abuse of power and  authority."    De Soto, who was Fujimori's adviser, said in an interview  with the weekly EL MUNDO that the Peruvian president soon  realized that "the whip is much more effective than trying to  coordinate or reach agreement. He is left with the whip in his  hand which may have given him some short-term results but he has  not resolved the main problem: A state that governs for very  few," said de Soto who cooperated with Fujimori during the first  two years of his government beginning in 1990.    He said he was disappointed with Fujimori's administration  because at the start he represented a government for the great  majority and placed great emphasis on the democratization of the  country. He then implemented a system that was "less  transparent" following the 5 April 1992 self-coup "under the  pretext of a better democracy."    De Soto, the author of "The Other Path," added: "Instead of  concentrating on the difficult task of reforming a state that  does not work, he discovered there was, within the state, a  group of well-disciplined people he could use: the Armed Forces."    Hernando de Soto told a local radio station that former UN  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar would follow a more  democratic administration than Fujimori "because of his  tradition of respecting the rules" if he becomes presidential  candidate for the 1995 general elections.    He reiterated that Fujimori had democratic ideals for a long  time but changed when he realized that "getting his hands on  resources, based on vertical power and leaning on the Armed  Forces, resulted in important achievements like his near victory  over terrorism and his clear triumph over inflation."</p>

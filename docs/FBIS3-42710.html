And Has Told </F> the Miner What To Do?: The Miners' Dialogue With the Government  Is Expected To Be Difficult, As Always"]    [Text] ITAR-TASS report:    The atmosphere in the mining outfits of Vorkuta is  heating up, threatening to explode any time soon in mass  strikes. The reason is the long delays in the payment of wages  for previous months. The miners have been promised by their  leadership that the wages for past months will be paid before 1  February, before 5 February at the latest. This today has thus  far kept the miners from mass protest actions and social unrest.  Although local strikes are breaking out continually.    Editorial comment:    Simultaneously with this report RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA also  received a statement of the Russian Independent Coal Industry  Workers' Union--Rosugleprof. As we all know, this union has  always aspired to a resolution of the complex problems of social  protection of the working people on the basis of mutual  understanding and cooperation with the Government of Russia. But  the treasury's debt to the sector for realization of the 1993  Sectoral Wage-Rate Agreement has not yet been cleared. At some  coal enterprises the workers have not been paid for October  even. The treasury's debt for the past year amounts to R272  billion. Some 19 million tonnes of coal, whose shipment is being  held up on account of the enterprises' debt to the railroads,  has built up at the coal dumps in January. At the same time, on  the other hand, consumers' arrears on coal that has already been  shipped has amounted to R705 billion.    The Rosugleprof demands of the government payment of the  treasury's debt to the coal industry before 1 February. The  conclusion of the Sectoral Wage-Rage Agreement in January. An  immediate solution of the question of the clearance for the  consumers of the arrears in respect to the coal that has already  been shipped. Otherwise, the statement says, the miners will be  forced to switch from a policy of social partnership to  collective action--strikes.    It is hard to say how the government will behave in this  situation. On the one hand the debts have to be paid. Especially  since it was promised that the reforms would be turned in the  direction of social protection of the populace. On the other, it  will be necessary to increase money issue in the first quarter,  which will inevitably signify an increase in inflation. Had B.  Fedorov stayed on as minister of finance, the problem would have  been resolved unequivocally: no payments. Stabilization of the  ruble--at any price--was more important for B. Fedorov. The  present government is no less interested than the ex-minister in  stabilization, but it knows the costs of reforms not from  timetables but from real life. And, it would seem, has a  sympathetic attitude toward our problems. The search for an  alternative is expected to be difficult.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Bonds: NTT CDollars 200m issue leads activity in subdued start to week THE international bond market started the week in a more subdued mood, following the flood of new issues last week. However, moderately sized and cautiously priced deals were launched in Canadian dollars, sterling, French francs and Australian dollars. In the Canadian dollar sector, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone came with an anticipated CDollars 200m five-year issue, lead-managed by Goldman Sachs. The 8 1/2 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at the fixed price of 99.785, where the yield is 48 basis points more than Canadian government bonds. The deal was NTT's fourth in the Canadian dollar sector of the Eurobond market, and it has built a strong following among continental European retail investors. The proceeds of the issue were swapped back into yen. Participants in the deal reported strong buying for bonds, which were viewed as being sensibly priced. By the close of trading in London, the deal stood at a yield spread of 46 basis points. Municipality Finance, the local government financing vehicle of Finland, launched its debut in the sterling sector of the market. It launched a Pounds 100m five-year issue, jointly lead-managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Credit Suisse First Boston. The 9 1/2 per cent bonds were reoffered at a fixed price of 99.43, at which level the yield spread over UK government bonds was 34 basis points. This was seen as tight by participants for a little-known borrower. Municipality Finance is best remembered by some investors for a debut Ecu issue launched last September which has since performed poorly. However, the joint lead managers underwrote around 90 per cent of the deal and reported steady buying from continental European investors keen to buy sterling bonds at a healthy yield pick-up over government paper. UBS quoted the bonds at a yield spread of 34 basis points by the close. Another debutante was KFW, the top-rated German government-backed financing agency, which launched its first French franc issue. The FFr2bn 8 3/4 per cent 10-year deal was lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais and offers a yield of 35 basis points more than French government paper. International investors are keen buyers of French franc assets, and the deal appealed to institutions keen for additional yield over government bonds but wary of buying of lower credit quality. By the close of trading, the yield spread had narrowed to 31 basis points. Deutsche Bank launched a ADollars 100m six-year issue, hoping to capture flows from maturing Australian dollar Eurobonds, which amount to ADollars 750m over the next month. The paper carries a 9 per cent coupon, seen as necessary to attract retail buyers into the deal, but was issued 102, an unusually high premium to face value. Less full fees of 2 per cent, the level at which underwriters owned the bonds, the paper yielded 23 basis points more than Australian government paper. Tintas, a Brazilian paint company, launched a Dollars 40m two-year Eurobond issue yesterday, despite the turbulence of domestic financial markets following accusations of corruption against President Ferdinand Collor. The deal is lead-managed by ABN Amro. The Turkish government is rescheduling almost half the commercial bank debts of the loss-making Turkish Iron and Steel Works (TDCI) by securitisation, Reuter reports from Istanbul. State minister, Mr Tansu Ciller, said the six Turkish banks involved would receive state bonds after rescheduling TL1,000bn of TDCI's TL2,200bn debt bearing a compounded interest burden of 135 per cent. Turkish inflation presently runs at 74 per cent.</p>

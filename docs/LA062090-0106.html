			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> UPWARD BOUND IS HAILED BY EDUCATORS  </P> <P> Some 80 students are less likely to become involved with gangs and more likely  will return to school this fall as a result of Upward Bound, a new program  operated this year by the La Habra City School District.  </P> <P> "School attendance went up. GPAs (grade point averages) went way up. Kids  started to feel positive about themselves," Imperial Middle School Principal  Betty Bidwell said.  </P> <P> Bidwell credits the program, conducted by youth and community services  coordinator Felipe Plascencia, with improving attitudes and performance.  </P> <P> Plascencia met twice weekly with about 40 students at Imperial School and also  with 40 other 7th- and 8th-graders at Washington Middle School.  </P> <P> "We've had a really great response from the Spanish-speaking community," said  Rich Hermann, the district's superintendent. "We feel very privileged to be  touched by Felipe and really appreciate the good work he has done. The kids he  has worked with have developed strong self-confidence."  </P> <P> Plascencia, 24, is a 1989 graduate of Cal State Fullerton. He plans to attend  law school in the fall. Replacing him as a role model and adviser, Hermann  said, will be difficult.  </P> <P> "The students saw me as a friend, not as a teacher," Plascencia said. They  addressed him as "Felipe," he said, "so that they could immediately relate to  me. I didn't want them to call me mister."  </P> <P> Teaching youngsters about Latino history was an area of emphasis.  </P> <P> "The reason these kids are involved in gangs is that they don't know who they  are," Plascencia suggested. "Because they don't know their history, they hate  themselves."  </P> <P> Plascencia said he used the Socratic method of dialogue in small group settings  and tried to develop critical thinking skills.  </P> <P> "When we talked about gangs, we asked, 'What can you do when this happens?' or  'What are some of the negative things that occur when you are involved in this  type of thing?'  </P> <P> "I used a lot of whys," he said. "Sometimes, I could see them trying to come up  with solutions or answers to my questions. When I saw that happen, I knew I was  doing my job."  </P> <P> Plascencia said he sees parents as the key to success for most children.  </P> <P> "They have to understand the situation their kids are in," he said. "They have  to be supportive, to encourage their kids, to keep a positive attitude."  </P> <P> The future lawyer said he hopes to settle in Orange County but he also intends  to remain active with children.  </P> <P> "For me, the more kids I reach, the better," he said.DAVID F.

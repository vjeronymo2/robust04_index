			<p>BFN     [Text] Silistra, March 16 (BTA) -- The tenth session of the  Mixed Bulgarian Romanian Commission on Environmental Problems in  the Silistra-Calarasi Region, held in Calarasi, decided to  propose to the environment ministries of the two countries, to  introduce Western European standards in environment monitoring  in Bulgaria and Romania, Dr. Marin Peychev, director of the  Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute in Silistra, told BTA.    In the almost ten-month break in the work of the commission,  the Romanians managed to replace over 80 percent of the  purification installations of the metallurgical combined works  in Calarasi which reduced phenol, hydrogen sulphide and dust  emissions. The Bulgarian Institute of Hygiene, Medical  Environment and Nutrition carried out joint research with a  similar Romanian institute. The Romanian side showed interest  in environment related diseases incidence. The Bulgarian side  presented the required information and research methods. The  measurements taken in January and February in Bulgaria have  shown lower concentrations of pollutants against the same period  last year.</p>

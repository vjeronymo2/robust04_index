			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih al-Darwish: "Zeroual To Begin </F> Dialogue With Salvation Front Next Week"]    [Text] Paris -- An Algerian presidential office statement  issued yesterday said that President Zeroual would start a  serious and sincere dialogue next week without excluding any  party, the aim being to end Algeria's crisis and ensure a return  to elections. It said that dialogue was the preferred way of  bringing the situation under control. The presidential  statement also reaffirmed the need for the security forces to  continue their duties of maintaining public security,  safeguarding public property, and eradicating violence and  terrorism.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from reliable sources that  President Zeroual will initiate a dialogue with the leaders of  the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders now in prison, Abbasi  Madani and Ali Belhadj to be specific. These leaders were moved  from Blida prison the day before yesterday to an unknown place.  There have been numerous rumors over the past few weeks about  the transfer of the FIS leaders to a villa somewhere, but the  report seems to be genuine this time. The sources, who have  recently been in contact with President Zeroual, quoted him as  stressing that he assumed the post of president in order to hold  a genuine dialogue and that he intended to do so.    President Zeroual's statement came after the spectacular  Lambese jailbreak and after the lengthy meetings of the military  commands.    President Zeroual appears to have been able to settle the  controversy and disagreement in his favor after the recent  attacks by the hard-line anti-dialogue tendency as reflected in  the speech delivered by Prime Minister Redha Malek at the  funeral of playwright Alloula in Oran and in the campaigns of  the French-language papers criticizing the regime and its  failure in an attempt to obstruct President Zeroual, forced him  into a corner, and put him on the defensive.    Behind that campaign were the forces which maintain that the  fundamentalists should be stamped out and the hardline security  option, not the dialogue option, upheld.    Political observers believe that the death sentences handed  down to six fundamentalists yesterday were part of the attempts  to embarrass President Zeroual and part of the arm-twisting  tactics the hard-liners are trying to use.    In view of that situation, President Zeroual is expect to  reshuffle the cabinet.</p>

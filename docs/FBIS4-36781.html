			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive reiview  of all items in the 7 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo 'AQIDATI that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Sports Gambling Against Shari'ah    2. Appeal Made To Help Muslim Refugees    3. Youth Camp To Discuss Issues Facing Muslims    4. Writer Berates West's Stance on Islam    5. Al-Ghazali Urges Youth To Defend Islam    6. Writer Claims West Continues Plots Against Islam    7. Universities Prepare Summer Activities    8.

A  1,700-word question and answer article on pages 8 and 9 rules on  various issues raised by readers. One of them deals with the  ruling highlighted on page 1, namely that betting on soccer  matches is against shari'ah and appeals to "all Arab fans of  soccer not to undertake this illegal gambling and to protect the  traditions of Islam and its shari'ah and the Muslims' reputation  in the world." The other rulings cover such topics as the use  of foreign words such as "bye-bye" in Friday sermons, which is  regarded as a sin; the illegality of marrying a stepdaughter;  and the rules for marrying a divorced woman. Another ruling  comes out against the use of any medicine where alcohol has been  used in its manufacturing unless there is no alternative  medicine.  <H5>  APPEAL MADE TO HELP MUSLIM REFUGEES </H5>   A 100-word summary on page 1 reports on an appeal from the  governing body of the Higher Islamic Council for Propagation and  Relief to the heads of Islamic countries urging more aid to  Muslim refugees, who make up more than 90 percent of the  refugees in the world. The council also appeals to the leaders  of the major powers, the pope, and the UN secretary general to  take urgent action to stop the Serbian attacks on Bosnia's  Muslims and lift the arms embargo imposed on the latter so that  they can defend themselves. The appeal to help Muslim refugees  is further elaborated on in a 900- word report by Jamal Salim on  page 20. The report says the appeal calls for allocating fixed  financial and material aid to help alleviate the sufferings of  Muslim refugees and also appeals to rich Muslims to help their  brothers. Council Chairman Shaykh Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq  calls on world Muslim relief societies "to visit relief sites  for those harmed and for the needy and to give increasing care  to modern field studies, to use documented data when making  decisions, and to coordinate their work to save their efforts  and avoid duplication." After calling for diversifying the  types of relief, he underlines the importance of "abiding by  humanitarian principles in relief without racial, religious,  ethnic, or political affiliation discrimination and to be  completely neutral." Dr. Farid Qirshi, chairman of the  council's relief department, then reviews the council's  achievements in Bosnia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Somalia,  Sudan, Kurdistan, Sri Lanka, India, and the independent states  and then details some of the projects that the council is  preparing to help alleviate the suffering of refugees.  <H5>  YOUTH CAMP TO DISCUSS ISSUES FACING MUSLIMS </H5>   A 150-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 says that  the Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq Camp organized by the Higher Council for  Islamic Affairs will be held in Alexandria on 19 July and will  be attended by youth delegations from more than 20 Islamic  countries. It adds that the delegations will discuss a number  of religious and other issues facing the Muslim world, including  the need to fight corrupt ideas.  <H5>  WRITER BERATES WEST'S STANCE ON ISLAM </H5>   A 450-word article by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All  Frankness" column on page 6 welcomes recent statements by  Western officials that praise Islam, the shari'ah, and its  tolerant principles, adding that these are a gain for Islam and  the Muslims' just causes and could effectively help "rectify the  wrong and misleading image that has been projected by the  extremist groups through their rejected actions and alien ideas  that have nothing to do with Islam at all." But he notes that  these statements by Western officials do not reflect a clear  Western stance on Islam and the Muslims' causes, adding that the  Western media continues to implement a scheme to distort the  image of Islam while Western countries are not changing their  negative stances, which emphasize their support for all the  extremist and racist movements against Islam.    The writer then adds: "If it is the view of U.S. President  Bill Clinton's adviser that Islam is a call for tolerance and  dialogue and that it does not pose a danger to other nations and  civilizations, then what has the U.S. Administration done to  restore the Muslims' usurped rights and lift the yoke of the  clear injustice imposed on our Muslim brothers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, India, Palestine, and other areas of  conflict in the world?" He then criticizes Britain's attitude  toward the Muslims' causes after citing Prince Charles'  statements that Islam is full of the meanings of love,  brotherhood, and equality. He adds that "while we are happy  with these statements, we fear that they might be part of the  constant deceptions and plots against the Muslim world," noting  that the West alone cannot be blamed for this but also the  "Muslim countries that have accepted the role of the spectator  and have agreed to be pawns in a chess game controlled by the  West." Noting that Muslims' conditions are getting worse, he  urges them to return to Islam's principles and the shari'ah in  their dealings and in resolving their conflicts.  <H5>  AL-GHAZALI URGES YOUTH TO DEFEND ISLAM </H5>   A 350-word report on page 10 details a seminar organized by  the Islamic and Arab Documentation and Studies Center in al-Fath  Mosque in Ramsis [Cairo] under the slogan: "The role of the  youth between the past and the present." It cites Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali as telling the participants that the nation  needs the youth to hold the banner and defend Islam against the  forces hostile to it. He adds that: "The Islamic nation is in  dire need for those who will rejuvenate its religion and youth  and this can only be done by renewing its faith, resources, and  moral and material talents." He says that he is worried about  today's youth who are led by their sexual desires while the  nation needs the youth guided by faith and ideals. Another  speaker, Dr. 'Ali Jum'ah, adviser to the World Institute of  Islamic Thinking in Cairo, says that the problem today is that  youth are getting science and data confused, believing that  obtaining some data makes them scholars.  <H5>  WRITER CLAIMS WEST CONTINUES PLOTS AGAINST ISLAM </H5>   A 450-word article by Majdi Salim in the "God is Merciful"  column on page 10 argues that the West is continuing its plots  against the Muslim world. He says that this plot is implemented  on three tracks. The first one is the economic war that aims to  "restrict our strength, exploit our natural resources, and limit  our ability to use them to build an independent economic  structure." He adds that the West uses people from among us as  tools to implement this plot and to turn Islamic society into a  consumer one. The second track is an intellectual one, where  the West tries to impose its ideas and concepts on us "on the  pretext of liberating our minds from restrictions and  enlightening us to make us move away from Islam's tenets and our  true religion, which represents for them the main obstacle in  their struggle with the Islamic nation so that the Western way  of life becomes ours, too." He argues that the West is also  using tools from among us to achieve this aim. He then moves to  the third track, which is the military one, citing the cases of  Bosnia, Burma, Afghanistan, and now Yemen. He concludes that  "this is a plot and we do not believe it no matter how much the  West claims to support or back us and our only course is to hold  onto the rope of God, understand, and get ready."  <H5>  UNIVERSITIES PREPARE SUMMER ACTIVITIES </H5>   A 1,300-word report on page 19 by Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti  details  the programs prepared by various universities and colleges for  their students during the summer holidays. Saying that the  students are free to participate in the programs they like, the  report adds that this year's plans include holding seminars and  dialogues with students in the summer camps in addition to  health enlightenment convoys that will travel to villages and  action programs for students' participation in the development  of villages. The report says that the Cairo University program  varies between artistic, cultural, and sports activities and  that part of these activities will tour the governorates. The  report adds that al-Azhar University will organize religious  enlightenment convoys that will tour the governorates, cities,  and villages, especially in Upper Egypt, where leading teachers  will lecture on the principles of religion and propagation.  Meanwhile, Alexandria University will organize courses for  teaching professional skills such as plumbing, tiling, and  mechanics. Al-Minufiyah University's activities will focus on  scientific training, such electronics, biology, and environment.  Hulwan University's emphasis will be on various activities,  such as computer training, the teaching of the English language,  and chess tournaments.    The report goes on to say that al-Minya University will  focus  its activities on combating illiteracy and opening summer clubs  to attract the young, in addition to science courses and sports.  Asyut University's main activity will be "the friends of the  police program, which will be the first of its kind and in which  500 students will participate in cooperation with the security  directorate." Other activities include a forestry project,  combating illiteracy, electricity training, and manual  handicrafts for female students. Tanta University, the report  concludes, will focus on a health survey of the governorate.  <H5>  SAUDIS BUILD ISLAMIC COMPLEX IN UZBEKISTAN </H5>   A 400-word report on page 21 says that Islam Karimov,  president of Uzbekistan, agreed to a demand from rich persons  from Mecca to allocate a piece of land measuring 20,000 meters  in the middle of Tashkent to build an Islamic center complex.  The report adds that the complex will include a mosque that can  accommodate 10,000 worshipers, an Islamic clinic, an Islamic  library, a workshop for girls, and an Islamic studies center.  It notes that the first stage of the project has already  started and that the overall cost will be around $5 million.</p>

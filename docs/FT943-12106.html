			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / FT man to edit Independent Mr Ian Hargreaves has been appointed the editor of The Independent in succession to Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, one of the newspaper's founders. Mr Hargreaves, 43, joined the Financial Times in 1976 and was most recently the paper's deputy editor. He was head of news and current affairs at the BBC between 1987 and 1991. The announcement of his decision to take on one of the most difficult challenges in British journalism - trying to revitalise the loss-making title - ends two weeks of uncertainty. Mr Hargreaves, who will take over in mid-August, said yesterday: 'The Independent is an important voice in the diversity of the British media. It is important that it develops and remains.' Mr Hargreaves said he intended to continue the paper's tradition of political non-alignment and to keep it firmly at the top end of the market. He promised 'high quality and fair and balanced reporting' with 'strong opinion and strong debate but non-party aligned'. He intends to strengthen the editorial team at The Independent, partly because a number of senior journalists have already left. The board of Newspaper Publishing, the newspaper's holding company, meets today to decide on pricing policy. A cut from the present 50p is certain, with 40p and 45p the main options. In spite of the price-cutting wars between The Times and The Daily Telegraph, sales of The Independent have stabilised at around 270,000 a day. During the past two weeks Mr Hargreaves has met representatives of the main shareholders - Mr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent group, El Pas of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy and Mirror Group Newspapers. He has received a commitment from the board that none of its members can interfere editorially. The commitment clearly includes Mr Whittam Smith, who will remain chairman but on a part-time basis. Mr Hargreaves says he has also received assurances from the main Independent shareholders of their long-term commitment to the paper. Mr Whittam Smith is the sole survivor of the trio who founded the paper in 1986. Mr Stephen Glover resigned over moves towards closer integration of the daily and Sunday titles and Mr Matthew Symonds resigned this month. Mr Andrew Gowers, FT foreign editor, succeeds Mr Hargreaves as deputy editor. Mr David Walker, now managing editor, has been appointed to a new post of executive editor and Mr Robin Pauley, currently deputy managing editor, will become managing editor.</p>

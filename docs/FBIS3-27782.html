			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the morning of 27 January, the U.S. Senate  passed with a majority a resolution calling on President Clinton  to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam to help resolve the  fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War.    The resolution was submitted by Democratic Senator John  Kerry  and Republican Senator John McCain. It was supported by  senators who are war veterans to pass by a 62 to 38 vote margin.  Afterwards, the Senate also voted 58 to 42 to reject another  resolution submitted by Republican Senator Robert Smith  requesting President Clinton to certify that the Vietnamese  Government has provided the fullest possible accounting of  missing Americans before the trade embargo can be lifted.    The debate before passing these two resolutions lasted six  hours on 25 and 26 January. Democratic Senators John Kerry,  John McCain, and Bob Kerrey stressed that Vietnam is doing its  best to cooperate with the U.S. in locating missing Americans  and the U.S. is in danger of losing this cooperation if it  continues the trade embargo. Other supporters of lifting the  trade embargo also cited U.S. military personnel working in  Vietnam who say they are receiving cooperation which they are  sure will continue with the lifting of the embargo.    Senator John McCain also stated that U.S. military personnel  were working side by side with Vietnamese soldiers to locate  missing Americans. The cooperation may be terminated if the  U.S. does not show good cooperation. Senator John Kerry  believes that the Senate's action will lead to more information  on missing soldiers and help to close a bitter chapter in  American history.    The senators supporting the resolution calling for lifting  the trade embargo against Vietnam held that such an action is in  the best interests of the U.S. as well as Vietnam.</p>

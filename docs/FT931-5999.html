			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Spanish venture helps lift Generali income by 53% AGGREGATE premium income at Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company, surged by 53.6 per cent to almost L17,000bn (Dollars 10.86bn) last year, against L10,964bn in 1991, due to the weaker lira and a big new Spanish venture. Adjusted for currency factors and the new venture, aggregate premiums rose by 14.9 per cent, the company said. The preliminary figures come as Generali shares rose sharply on the Milan stock exchange following Monday's decision by the Italian government to open the door to the creation of private pension funds, which are expected to boost sharply the profits of the country's leading insurers. Generali gave no indications of its net profits or dividend for 1992, which will only be revealed after a board meeting in early May. In 1991, group net earnings before minority interests rose to L672.2bn. Premiums on directly written Italian business rose to L4,070bn last year, with an 11.9 per cent increase to L1,496bn on the life side and a rise of 7.6 per cent to L2,574 in non-life business. Directly-written foreign business jumped by 37.6 per cent to L1,661bn, thanks partly to the weaker lira. Adjusted for currency factors, the increase was 20.4 per cent. Indirectly-written business climbed by 21 per cent to L2,768bn.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Romanian links with US improve THE US and Romania are well on the road to improved economic and political relations, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US deputy secretary of state, said after signing a bilateral investment treaty in Bucharest yesterday. The treaty would lead to a 'substantial improvement' in the investment climate in the country and would encourage more US companies to come to Romania, said Mr Eagleburger, the most senior US official to visit the country for more than two years. US investment in Romania totalled Dollars 39m between January 1990 and April 1992, 12 per cent of the total pledged by foreign investors. Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are among the country's largest investors. Mr Eagleburger's visit comes at a critical time for Romania which is trying to improve its international standing and attract increased foreign investment. Renewed US support for Romania reflects the strategic importance of the country, which borders the Yugoslav republics, Moldova and Ukraine. Relations between the US and Romania were strained during 1990 and 1991 due chiefly to US concern about the Romanian authorities' handling of anti-government demonstrations, the lack of an independent television station and fears that the general election of 1990 were not held democratically.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific loan-to-value ratios required by the proposed rule, i.e., 80 percent for fixed rate loans and 75 percent for adjustable rate loans, were addressed by two commenters. Each suggested that the same ratio should apply regardless of whether a loan has a fixed or adjustable rate. However, one of these commenters preferred using an 80 percent ratio for all multifamily housing loans while the other preferred a 75 percent ratio. The final rule retains the separate ratios for fixed and adjustable rate loans that were contained in the proposal. These ratios are taken directly from the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, two commenters indicated that multifamily housing loans that do not meet the loan-to-value ratio requirement but have additional collateral or credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance should be eligible for the 50 percent risk weight. The FDIC's risk-based capital standards formally recognize only certain forms of collateral and guarantees for purposes of risk-weighting assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items. The FDIC does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize additional forms of collateral and guarantees solely for multifamily housing loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Annual Occupancy Rate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were received from three respondents on the proposed requirement, not mandated by the statute, that the average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least one year. These commenters pointed out that the ongoing loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage ratio requirements set forth in the statute should be sufficient to ensure that only high quality multifamily housing loans would qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. It was also indicated that information on occupancy rates is not regularly being obtained as part of the financial data that borrowers supply on the properties securing multifamily housing loans. Thus, the inclusion of an occupancy rate requirement in the final rule would impose an additional burden on both borrowers and lenders. The FDIC agrees with these commenters and has eliminated the proposed occupancy rate requirement from the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Properties Owned by Cooperatives and Nonprofit Organizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters questioned the applicability of the eligibility criteria to properties owned by cooperative housing corporations and nonprofit organizations. In particular, the ``operating income'' concept included in the debt service coverage requirement was considered inappropriate because these types of properties, since they are not owned by investors seeking a return on their investments, are not operated to produce income. Accordingly, these commenters suggested that, for multifamily properties with a nonprofit form of ownership, a more flexible approach to meeting the debt service coverage ratio requirements set forth in the statute would be justified. The FDIC recognizes that the cash flow to service a loan secured by a multifamily property can come from ``operating income'' as well as from other sources. Therefore, the debt service coverage criterion in the final rule indicates that properties owned by cooperative housing corporations or nonprofit organizations must generate sufficient cash flow to provide protection to the bank comparable to that afforded by the debt service coverage levels set forth in the statute that are based on annual net operating income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Repayment Performance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters stated that the FDIC's proposal to add a requirement that a multifamily housing loan must not be more than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status in order to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight was unnecessary because of the statutory requirement that all principal and interest payments be made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of the loan for at least one year. One of these commenters indicated that a loan on which timely payments have been made for at least one year ``will not be more than 90 days past due and is unlikely to be in nonaccrual status'' while the other suggested that the loan would be ``in reasonably good shape, even it is technically ninety (90) days past due.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

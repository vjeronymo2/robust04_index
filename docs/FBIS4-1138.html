			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Merton] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] would start "a major voter education  blitz" in Natal on Thursday [21 April] to reassure voters about  the voting procedure after agreement on the addition of the  Inkatha Freedom Party's sticker on ballot papers. IEC Voter  Education Director Albert Mokoena said that with the exception  of no-go areas, the commission's voter education programme had  exposed most people to the voting procedure.    "It does not matter how many parties appear on the voting  paper," he said.    IEC electoral administration training division head Kumi  Naidoo said electoral officers would affix the sticker to ballot  papers at a "supplies desk" before the papers were handed to  voters at national and regional "issuing desks".    The IEC would require an additional staff member at each  voting station to cope with putting the stickers on ballot  papers, but was confident this could be achieved within the  short time before elections next week.    Mr Naidoo said positive feedback had been received from  Natal, where about 600 electoral officers each with a staff of  25 were now needed. People who had previously been hesitant to  come forward, were volunteering, he said.    The IEC expected to set up more than 9,000 voting stations  countrywide, Mr Naidoo added.</p>

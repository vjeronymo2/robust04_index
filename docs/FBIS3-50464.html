At a news conference held in San Cristobal de las Casas, the  EZLN's Zone Clandestine Committee [Comite Clandestino de Zona --  CCZ] disclosed that the takeover of five mayoralties in Chiapas  State in southern Mexico today responds to "the people's needs.  They are dying of hunger, and that is why they are up in arms."    In broken Spanish, three alleged Indians of the EZLN  explained that their armed movement, which stunned Mexico on the  first day of 1994, "is a just struggle, not something crazy."    The spokesmen for the guerrilla group said: "We will not end  this struggle until we attain our goal and our demands are met;  that is, improvements for the people so they will have no more  needs."    The group maintains that the government does not solve their  problems and that the rich hoard the land, while the Indians of  Chiapas -- one of Mexico's poorest, most backward states -- lack  food, health, and education."    They said that their armed movement, the first to appear in  almost two decades in this country, "was created so the Indian  people will have the opportunity to choose their government.  The people have had enough of electoral fraud. According to  the government, we have a democracy, but that is a lie. The  people are on a war footing."    An undetermined number of EZLN members partially seized the  mayoralties in San Cristobal, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las  Margaritas, and Chanal this Saturday. According to provisional  unofficial reports, there are three dead and 18 wounded.    The CCZ members stressed that "we have not come to this city  (San Cristobal) to make threats. We respect the people. The  Army is the enemy; it is rank and file of the capitalists. We  know very well how members of the Army, the public security  forces, and the judiciary have been acting against the peasants,  teachers, and students who have been repressed with torture and  death and who have been made political prisoners."    In its first communique, disseminated by the guerrillas in  the towns they occupied, the EZLN ordered its forces to advance  to the capital, approximately 700 km north, and defeat the armed  forces.    At the news conference, the guerrillas said that in the  event  that the Army intervenes to suppress their armed uprising, "the  Indians have prepared themselves for the war because we know it  is for freedom, justice, and democracy."    Chiapas State authorities ordered the public security forces  to avoid confrontations with the guerrillas. Meanwhile, the  Armed Forces are on the lookout and have limited themselves to  remaining approximately 20 km from downtown San Cristobal and to  flying over the city with helicopters and planes.    The situation in Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, and  Chanal is unknown due to a lack of information from official  sources and from the rebels themselves.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0104 GMT transmits a report which  adds: "The Government and National Defense Secretariats, as well  as the Presidency, have not made any comments on the EZLN armed  action."]</p>

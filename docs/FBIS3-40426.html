The U.S. Group AT&amp;T Would Be The Ideal  Partner"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Zurich, 11 Feb (ATS) -- Ascom, the Bern-based  telecommunications group is facing serious difficulties.  However, it still has one chance to avoid the worst. If it  fails to seize this opportunity, this will mean the end of the  Swiss telecommunications industry. Mr. Heinrich Steinmann,  member of both the management of the Union of Swiss Banks and  the board of directors at Ascom, affirmed this in an interview  published in the economic weekly "CASH".    If Ascom does not succeed in turning the page, it will find  itself in the hands of major companies and will cease to exist  as an independent group. In his capacity as committee member of  the board of directors and as president of the Hasler  Foundation, which owns a majority stake in Ascom, Mr. Steinmann  feels that he is facing a major challenge. He must come up with  a corporate strategy that everyone will understand, and which  proves feasible.  <H5>  New Strategy </H5>   With the help of the McKinsey consulting company, a  market-based strategy has been developed. This strategy is  based on three main pillars: telecommunications, corporate  networks, and the automation of services. Sectors were selected  in these three areas where Ascom can obtain a market share of  over 25 percent, stated Mr. Steinmann. All the rest will be  liquidated or sold.    In the future, the group will be strictly managed according  to the needs of its customers. The time devoted to the  development and production of each product will have to be  considerably reduced.    At present, Ascom depends on the Swedish Ericsson group for  public telecommunications. The Bern-based company is good, but  a fair portion of the know-how involved comes from Sweden, noted  Mr. Steinmann. In the long term this sector will have to be  given up to Ericsson, bit by bit.  <H5>  Becoming World Champion </H5>   The strength of Ascom lies in its conventional telephones,  small exchanges, and cordless telephones. Here, both the  quality and design are good. In addition, Ascom's telephones  are user-friendly.    Ascom must become "world champion" in man's contact with the  system. However, in order to do this, it will have to make  considerable progress. In this respect, collaboration with the  U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T would be ideal.    AT&amp;T cannot sell its telephones in Europe, because they  were  designed specifically for and in accordance with the taste of  U.S. consumers. However, it could take over Ascom's telephones.  Should a group of this type open up its market, this would  represent a tremendous opportunity for Ascom.  <H5>  Chairmanship Not Targeted </H5>   Mr. Steinmann specified that he was not targeting the  chairmanship of Ascom's board of directors, led by Mr. Heinz  Frey, which is currently under tremendous pressure. It is up to  Mr. Frey to decide what he wants to make of his chairmanship.    Ascom's board of administration and the founding board of  the  Hasler Foundation should clearly support Mr. Frey. Should  either of these two bodies indicate doubts regarding Mr. Frey,  then the chairman-in-office would probably have to take the  consequences.</p>

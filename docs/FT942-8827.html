			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Christopher in first Jericho visit US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on a Middle East peace shuttle, yesterday became the first world statesman to visit Jericho - seat of the newly created Palestinian autonomous area evacuated by Israel last week. Mr Christopher's visit was clearly made to demonstrate US support for the Palestinian self-rule deal: 'One of the reasons I came here is to make it clear to our Palestinian friends that they are not alone in this endeavour and that we in the international community will stand with them as they make their historic transition.' In the blazing heat Palestinian security forces lined the roads of Mr Christopher's motorcade as an honour guard for the US secretary who spent much of the day trying to avoid being photographed in front of pictures of Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. Most Palestinians in Jericho, however, shunned the Christopher visit preferring to flock to a gathering point near the Jordanian border crossing to welcome home Mr Jibril Rajoub, a hero in the West Bank and Mr Arafat's adviser on the occupied territories. Mr Rajoub, a 41-year-old veteran activist of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, was allowed to cross the border with 20 other deportees yesterday after having spent six years in exile in Tunis and 17 years in Israeli prisons. He will become the overall PLO security boss for the West Bank. Thousands of jubilant Palestinians, many from Mr Jibril's Hebron home, were in Jericho to greet him. The days events were overshadowed as Palestinian extremists shot dead two Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and armed Israelis ignored Palestinian policemen and entered an ancient Jericho synagogue with their automatic rifles. The Islamic Resistance Hamas movement claimed responsibility for the attack in the West Bank less than 24 hours after armed Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 18 Palestinians in Hebron, the flash point of Arab-Israeli violence. Meanwhile, Israeli officials handed over daily administration of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to Palestinians yesterday putting 850,000 Arabs under self-rule for the first time in their history. The embryonic Palestinian self-rule authority took over 38 departments which have control from health to taxation.</p>

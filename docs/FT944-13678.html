			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (10): Documents not yet dead - Printer sales show a continued appetite for paper Paper prices may be rising, business, but our appetite for documentation is apparently insatiable. Multimedia communications and electronic data storage may be growth markets, but the paperless office is clearly as far away as ever. Almost 9m printers were sold in Europe in 1993, an increase of 8 per cent on the year, according to Matthew Checkley, printer market analyst at market research company BIS Strategic Decisions. Some 4m of those units were inkjet printers (most designed for personal use), 1.5m more than in 1992. The survival of a mass dot matrix market appears doomed. Just under 3m dot matrix printers were shipped in 1993, 1.3m fewer than in 1992. Indeed, Mr Checkley forecasts that by 1998, the dot matrix market will be reduced to a niche sector with just 5 per cent of total printer sales - for applications such as high volume multi-part stationery. But while the Star Micronics factory in Wrexham has collapsed under the strain, other dot matrix suppliers are optimistic. Rod Saar, managing director at Mannesmann Tally believes dot matrix will still represent 20 per cent of the total printer market by 1998. Eddie Huggins, director of marketing at Citizen, agrees, claiming sales of the ABC Colour dot matrix printer, at 30 per cent above market expectations, proves that it is still a viable technology in the SoHo (small office/home office) market where an occasional colour capability at low cost is a bonus. However, inkjet is clearly the technology for the masses. According to Romtec, the total UK printer market in 1993 was worth Pounds 740m of which inkjet printers commanded a 23.6 per cent share by value, 36 per cent by units. Of that market, Canon claimed a 41 per cent share in value, 52 per cent by units. All four manufacturers of core inkjet technology (Canon, Epson, Hewlett Packard and, more recently, Olivetti), hope to benefit from the trend towards colour capable inkjet printing, with Mr Checkley of BIS projecting sales of 6m such units per year by 1998. The potential revenues appeal to Amstrad. Just three years after saying that there was no money in computer peripherals and the only thing to do with existing stocks was to 'throw them in the River Thames', Amstrad boss Alan Sugar announced a collaborative agreement with Jarfalla ICC, ABB, a manufacturer part owned by IBM, to produce a 'a landmark' product in compact, low cost, high quality inkjet printer technology. Both Mr Checkley of BIS and Graham Salmons of Printer Europe, Dataquest point to the rise in the sales of laser/LED printer as an indication that the days of mono (black only) inkjet are numbered. More than 1m laser/LED printers were sold during 1993 and volumes are expected to increase significantly over the next year or two with the advent of Windows GDI (Graphical Device Interface) laser printers, such as the Mannesmann Tally T-Win. The advantages of GDI technology are that it is easier to use, has faster PC-to-print processing speeds and truer WYSIWYP (What you See is What You Printer). It also avoids the need for a complex built-in printer control language and a control panel; hence the low prices. NEC was the first to introduce a GDI printer and it now hopes to set the printer world alight with the second generation series of SuperScript printers bringing GDI advantages to network applications. NEC is not alone, with others, including Brother, hard on its heels. The frenetic activity in the low end personal page printer market could affect the positions of the market leaders. For now though, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, Hewlett Packard continues to dominate this sector with a 51 per cent share (up from 39 per cent in 1992), its nearest rival being Oki with 7 per cent (up from 6 per cent in 1992). A long-promised Microsoft at Work concept, it is said, will provide users with a common graphical interface for click-on access to any function including copying and fax. Although there are about 75 companies involved, the only evidence of developments to date is the Lexmark WinWriter 600 (DPI) launched earlier this year. With no competitors to help drive the market, it could be something of a hollow victory, although 1995 might change all that. Development activity in the networked printer market is just as heady; and no wonder. According to Dataquest, by 1997 more than 70 per cent of European PCs will be connected to Lans, resulting in a tripling of network printers within the next five years. Canon, which has produced 10m laser beam print engines (70 per cent of the total) in the past 10 years, is targeting small groups with the LPB-4i, a 4 ppm Windows printer priced at the same level as a high specification inkjet. The price per user is almost at dot matrix levels. As individuals increasingly run different applications simultaneously, network printers from suppliers such as Mannesmann Tally, Oce-Printing Systems and QMS have been obliged to introduce state-of-the-art simultaneous processing of multiple jobs. At the high volume end of the market, industry analysts such as the GartnerGroup, point to the advantageous features of IBM's strategic architecture (AFP). Information from any source in any form - plain text, graphics, images, bar codes or forms with small print - can be printed out on any printer. Rank Xerox meanwhile has launched a range of network printers featuring intuitive software, called Document Services for Printing. As well as allowing systems administrators to track usage and generate charge-backs and accounting reports for specific departments, it enables users to search the network for the printer that best suits the needs of the job at the time. The advance of colour printing in the general office is also gathering pace, with thermal transfer technology the main contender. Several product launches over the past few weeks, plus some aggressive price reductions of anything up to 50 per cent on existing machines, show that manufacturers such as Kodak, Mitsubishi and Tektronix believe it is a market worth fighting for. But most industry analysts look to laser as the colour technology of the future. BIS Strategic Decisions forecast this sector will grow much faster than colour copiers, with unit sales rising from 130 units in 1992 to 32,500 in 1997. It could be higher if the QMS ColourScript Laser 1000 and the Oce 6460 desktop machines are joined by lower cost units from other suppliers. In September, two months after launching the 4900 colour laser printer, Rank Xerox was predicting that sales would be 50 per cent ahead of target by the end of the year, with distributors already ordering over and above original schedules. The market should be in full swing next year when Hewlett Packard launches its Colour LaserJet in the UK. Already available in the US and Canada, it is interesting to note the use of a Konica colour laser engine. Nicky Ayres, responsible for network printer marketing at Hewlett Packard in the UK, said that the engine has 'excellent colour registration with one-pass (higher speed) printing'. Such developments mean that 1995 could become an even more interesting year for the printer industry than 1994</p>

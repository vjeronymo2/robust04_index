			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'EXPLAIN TRUTH' OF EVENTS, CHINA TELLS ITS ENVOYS  </P> <P> China's premier and Communist Party chief urged their top diplomats Wednesday  to do a better job of "explaining the truth" in presenting the official version  of its suppression of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.  </P> <P> State-run media also highlighted visits by foreigners in a propaganda campaign  to show that diplomatic relations have not suffered from international  condemnation of the June 3-4 military crackdown in Beijing.  </P> <P> Jiang Zemin, newly appointed general secretary of the Communist Party, told 151  ambassadors and senior diplomats they must "help foreign friends get rid of  their misunderstandings" of recent events in China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work to 'Counter Rumors'  </P> <P> Jiang, speaking at the end of a six-day meeting of ambassadors and other senior  diplomats, said the envoys must "increase their work in explaining the truth to  counter rumors of Western reports."  </P> <P> The United States and other Western countries have suspended high-level  government contacts and imposed other sanctions to protest the attack.  </P> <P> China contends that the use of force was necessary to put down what it says was  a "counterrevolutionary rebellion" to overthrow the government.  </P> <P> Premier Li Peng told the diplomats that overseas Chinese students who  participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to China and won't be  punished.  </P> <P> "Because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the Western media,  they didn't understand the true situation and participated in protests and said  some extremist words," state-run TV quoted Li as saying.  </P> <P> Officials said China has lost at least $60 million in tourist revenue in  Beijing because of turmoil in the city. China opened an international  conference Wednesday to seek ways to lure foreign visitors back to such  attractions as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.  </P></p>

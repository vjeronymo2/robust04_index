			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTIVIST GETS MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR BURGLARY  </P> <P> A black community activist who claimed that his prosecution on a burglary  charge was racially motivated was sentenced Wednesday to three years and eight  months in state prison, the maximum term possible, for breaking into a Culver  City beauty shop.  </P> <P> In handing down the sentence, Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James Albracht  criticized Jitu Sadiki as "a coward" who fabricated an alibi and took unfair  advantage of minority rights activists who had rallied to support him without  knowing all the details of the case.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old South-Central Los Angeles man, who was released from prison in  1982 after serving time for murder, was found guilty of the 1988 burglary by  two separate juries. He had won a new trial on grounds that he had incompetent  counsel the first time.  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Miami group launches Cuba fund THE Miami-based fund management group Thomas J. Herzfeld has launched the first closed-end fund to invest in US, Caribbean and Latin American companies likely to benefit when the US trade embargo against Cuba is finally lifted. Although the main purpose of the fund is to allow investors to buy a stake in the future of a post-communist Cuba, the fund - Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund - will also invest in companies that benefit from the development of economies in the Caribbean region as a whole. Current US law prohibits direct or indirect investment in Cuba. However, Cuba's economic problems, the steady deterioration of the economic and social infrastructure on the island and the gradual erosion of President Fidel Castro's popularity and power has led many US politicians and businessmen, especially those in Florida (which is only 90 miles from Cuba) to prepare for the end of communist rule in Cuba and the lifting of the US embargo.</p>

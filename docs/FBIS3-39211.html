Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos announced Mr.  Papoulias' one-day visit, noting that the goal is to seek an  immediate, viable, and peaceful solution to the Bosnian problem.    Milan Milutinovic, ambassador of New Yugoslavia in Athens,  this morning conveyed a request from Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic to former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis to  undertake an initiative for the solution of the Yugoslav crisis.  Last Saturday [12 February], Mr. Mitsotakis had a long  telephone conversation with Mr. Milosevic. After his meeting  with the honory chairman of New Democracy Party, the Yugoslav  Ambassador expressed the hope that Mr. Mitsotakis will finally  undertake an initiative, but did not define the content of this  initiative.    However, a little later, the office of the former prime  minister issued a written statement in which Mr. Mitsotakis  calls upon the Government to undertake an initiative for a  solution to the Bosnian crisis by virtue of the fact that it  occupies the presidency of the European Union. Mr. Mitsotakis  stresses that now, as was the case in the past, Greece must play  its role decisively in defending peace. He further points out  that Greece cannot remain a speechless and weak observer of  historic developments which concern it directly and probably  dramatically.    Diplomatic observers have described this statement as Mr.  Mitsotakis' first move in Slobodan Milosevic's request for  mediation, and they were sure that it will be followed by  contacts between the former prime minister and the Government  and probably by some initiatives abroad.</p>

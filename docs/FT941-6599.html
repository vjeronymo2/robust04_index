			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Only a month to make the refinancing fly: Rescue talks between Euro Disney and its banks After weeks of delay, Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group, has finally started negotiations with its banks on a FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) rescue package. The two sides have a month to reach agreement before the March 31 deadline imposed by Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. Without a deal, Disney threatens to withdraw its financial support thereby forcing the closure of the EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris. 'It looks as though we should be able to meet the deadline,' said one banker. 'No one ever said this deal was going to be easy, but it is do-able. No one wants to see Euro Disney go bust.' The banks' cautious optimism follows an investigative audit by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group, which concluded that Euro Disney could become a going concern if its FFr20.3bn net debt was reduced. It calculated that FFr13bn was needed to stabilise the company's finances. The banks, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, have proposed that the deal should be apportioned on a 50:50 basis with Disney. One element would be an injection of capital from a rights issue and, possibly, a debt-for-equity swap, which could be linked to the underwriting of the issue. Another element would be a cut in Euro Disney's financial costs. The banks might trim the interest rates on part of their loans in return for Disney forgoing or reducing its entitlement to royalties and management fees. Disney has indicated that it will take up its full share of a rights issue, but is intransigent on the royalty front. The banks want extended indefinitely its waiver of a management fee of 3 per cent of Euro Disney's turnover, which would have been worth FFr145m last year. They have also demanded a cut in its royalties of 10 per cent of admissions and 5 per cent of food and merchandise sales, worth FFr262m last year. The US group has privately accepted the need for a degree of compromise, not least because it wants the banks to trim interest rates on the loans, notably the Caisse des Depots which owns Euro Disney's FFr4.8bn 7.8 per cent fixed rate debt. Disney's room for manoeuvre is limited. It is anxious to avoid closing EuroDisneyland, which would not only damage its prospects in Europe but also drag it into a legal battle in France. It has made a provision of Dollars 175m to keep Euro Disney afloat until March 31 and has indicated that, providing an outline agreement has been reached by then, it will continue to support the company until the deal is completed. Yet Disney cannot afford to pour in money indefinitely, nor does it want to raise its stake above 49 per cent. Under US regulations, this would mean consolidating the European company's debt on to its balance sheet. It could, however, buy the five hotels at the theme park and bring in new investors. Meanwhile the banks are struggling to maintain a united front. The main threat to unity is the risk that some may succumb to the overtures of US secondary debt specialists and sell their loans at a discount. Midland Bank is on the verge of completing the sale of a FFr130m loan despite the reported opposition of the Bank of England. Another potential complication is a noisy lobby of convertible bondholders. These investors are threatening to sue Euro Disney and its advisers. The Disney camp claims that the distressed debt sales and the convertible lobby are minor distractions. But as the deadline approaches the financial prospects facing Euro Disney are as sobering as ever. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, calculates that, even if Euro Disney secures its FFr13bn refinancing, it will not move into profit until 1998.</p>

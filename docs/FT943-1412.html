			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Company surpluses break records as profits surge The financial surplus in the corporate sector reached record levels in the second quarter of this year, as profits rose to a new high while investment and dividend payments remained relatively flat. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the level of undistributed income in the corporate sector was Pounds 17.1bn in the second quarter, 5.6 per cent higher than in the first quarter and 52.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The key reason for the rise was a surge in corporate profitability. Company gross trading profits rose to Pounds 21.63bn in the second quarter, 6.2 per cent higher than in the first quarter and 22.7 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Much of the growth was due to the oil and gas sector, where profits were Pounds 2.95bn in the second quarter, 38.5 per cent higher than in the first quarter. The main reasons for the growth, the CSO said, were that new North Sea fields had come on stream and oil prices had risen. Profitability, however, also rose in the non-North Sea sector, with second-quarter total gross trading profits 1.6 per cent higher than in the first quarter and 17.3 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year. In spite of this rising profitability, total investment dipped fractionally in the second quarter, partly because of a reduction in public investment projects. Meanwhile, dividend payments remained below 1993 levels. Although total dividend payments were 6.9 per cent higher in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, they were 18.9 per cent below 1993's second quarter. Company borrowing, however, fell back in the second quarter, indicating that many companies were using their cash to pay back previous debts. The level of corporate borrowing from banks fell to Pounds 2.25bn in the second quarter, 23 per cent lower than in the first three months. Meanwhile, borrowing from other financial institutions fell to Pounds 5.67bn, more than 40 per cent lower than in the first quarter.</p>

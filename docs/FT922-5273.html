			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Belgrade protesters express their shame TENS of thousands of people yesterday staged an anti-war protest in Belgrade, the Serbian capital yesterday. Mr Ivan Vejvoda, a Belgrade sociologist, said: 'We are here with a message of great importance from Belgrade to the people of Sarajevo: We are with you'. The Bosnian capital has been under siege for the past two months. The crowd of some 50,000, which included mothers and children, yesterday demanded an end to the war. They marched through the city centre carrying a black banner symbolising their grief over the killings and destruction in Bosnia. Chanting 'Slobo, Saddam,' they showed their outrage at Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Many expressed shame about Serbia's role in the war. They carried signs saying: 'God does not forgive the sin of murder' and 'In memoriam to those killed in Bosnia', in contrast to the election banners of the ruling Socialists which warned: 'We don't bargain with the dignity of our fatherland' and 'We have faith in our citizens'. Most of the marchers feared the UN sanctions were only a prelude to military intervention. Mr Milan Nikolic, an opposition politician, said: 'Sanctions are better than military intervention. But I am afraid this is a step towards intervention. The main victims of the sanctions will be those already against Milosevic. Scientists, actors, opposition leaders. Military intervention would strengthen Milosevic, by homogenising Serbs in defence of Serbia.' Ms Sanja Sanader, a tourist agent, said: 'Sanctions will punish the average person; It won't destroy those in power. They won't even feel it.' But behind the pride that Belgrade has taken a stand against the violence, loomed the belief that death and destruction will soon engulf Belgrade. 'In the back of everyone's mind is fear the war might spread here,' one marcher declared.</p>

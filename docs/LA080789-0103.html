			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIVERPOOL DOCKWORKERS DECIDE TO END HOLDOUT  </P> <P> Liverpool's 1,200 dockworkers who held out last week after their union ended a  three-week national dock strike voted 3-1 today to return to work. Mersey Docks  &amp; Harbor Co. had warned that it would fire the strikers if they did not  return to work by Tuesday. The workers had been striking over the government's  abolition of lifetime employment guarantees.  </P></p>

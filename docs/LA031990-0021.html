			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPRIATI WINS WHEN INJURY STOPS FENDICK  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati won easily Sunday, and so did Andre Agassi.  </P> <P> Capriati, tennis' 13-year-old sensation, advanced to the fourth round when  Patty Fendick sustained a knee injury while leading, 4-2, in the first set.  </P> <P> "I never want to win like that," Capriati said. "I feel sorry for her. She was  playing great, too."  </P> <P> The fifth-seeded Agassi, 19, who had a first-round bye, needed just 54 minutes  to eliminate Kelly Jones in a second-round match, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> In another men's match, qualifier Mark Kratzmann upset ninth-seeded Yannick  Noah, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (8-6).  </P> <P> In women's matches, No. 3 Monica Seles routed Laura Lapi, 6-1, 6-1, in 42  minutes, and No. 4 Manuela Maleeva trounced Camille Benjamin, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> Capriati, 8-1 since turning pro earlier this month, lost her serve at love in  the second game and fell behind, 3-0. She was ahead, 30-0, in the seventh game  with Fendick serving when the match ended.  </P> <P> Fendick said her right knee locked as she hit a backhand approach shot. She  stumbled while retreating for a Capriati lob and then collapsed along the  baseline.  </P> <P> After a trainer examined the injury, Fendick decided she couldn't continue and  left the court with a bandage wrapped around her knee.  </P></p>

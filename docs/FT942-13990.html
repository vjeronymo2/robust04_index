			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Bank faces Pounds 4m extra damages Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, was yesterday ordered by the Commercial Court to pay a further Pounds 4m in damages to the creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the collapsed financial services group. The judgment by Mr Justice Gatehouse closes the book on the first stage of one of the longest and most complex pieces of litigation in City history. The damages bring the merchant bank's total liability in the case to Pounds 176m - it paid Pounds 172m into court in October after an earlier judgment. Quadrex Holdings, a Delaware corporation owned by Mr Gary Klesch, which had employed Samuel Montagu, was ordered to pay Pounds 2m on top of the Pounds 10m it was ordered to pay last year. The court found the bank and Quadrex jointly and severally liable for Pounds 176m. This made Quadrex's liability more than Pounds 188m. Samuel Montagu and Quadrex were ordered to pay the estimated Pounds 10m costs of the action, which began more than five years ago. Samuel Montagu, a subsidiary of Midland Bank and Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation, confirmed yesterday that it would appeal against the finding of liability and the size of damages. An appeal date has been set for January next year. The dispute arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings. The acquisition relied on an agreement that Quadrex would buy Mercantile's wholesale broking division. After the bid, Quadrex did not have the money and that ultimately helped drive B&amp;C into administration in 1990 with debts of Pounds 1bn. B&amp;C sued Quadrex for damages for breach of contract and also sued Samuel Montagu for negligent mis-statement over assurances given to B&amp;C by Mr Ian McIntosh, the bank's managing director, now deputy chairman. The judge ruled last October that Mr McIntosh knowingly and negligently took a risk in assuring B&amp;C that Quadrex had the funds. Mr Peter Phillips of accountants Buchler Phillips, joint administrators of B&amp;C, said the award, if upheld on appeal, would represent 11p to 16p in the pound for B&amp;C's creditors. He said the Pounds 172m award that the bank had paid into court was earning interest at 6 per cent. Quadrex had yet to pay any of its Pounds 12m and the administrators would be writing to the company to request payment, he added.</p>

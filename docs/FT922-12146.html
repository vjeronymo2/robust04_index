			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Keating treads carefully inIndonesia THE visit by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, to Indonesia had an unsettled start yesterday when President Suharto reiterated concern at foreign interference in his country's domestic affairs. In a banquet speech last night, President Suharto said Indonesia would not accept 'comment and criticism that only exaggerates the backwardness of our national development effort and interferes in our domestic affairs'. 'Every nation and state has a level of dignity that is not open to bargaining,' he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Keating had met Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister. Diplomats in Jakarta said Mr Keating raised the issue of East Timor, the former Portuguese territory which Indonesia forcibly annexed in 1976. Last November, up to 180 civilians were killed in East Timor when soldiers opened fire on pro-nationalist demonstrators. Australia recognises Indonesia's annexation of the territory, but diplomats said that Mr Keating suggested East Timor might be granted special territory status. He also questioned whether East Timorese nationalists currently on trial should be prosecuted under criminal law for their political offences. Such suggestions are likely to be viewed by Indonesian officials as an intrusion in internal affairs. In his banquet speech, Mr Keating adopted a softer line and said he 'respected Indonesia's determination to pursue an independent course in the world'. He praised President Suharto for having 'dramatically improved living standards in your own country, and contributed to wider regional stability'. Mr Keating's four-day trip, his first abroad as prime minister, has been flagged as a move by Australia toward greater economic and political co-operation with Asia. 'Each of us is the other's best test of how effectively we will be able to deal with the social and political diversity . . . which will mark our region in the 1990s,' he told President Suharto.</p>

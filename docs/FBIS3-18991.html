			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Committee of the Regions Is </F> Inaugurated"; as released by the Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 9 Mar (BELGA) -- The Committee of the  Regions, a new European institution which is to represent the  interests of the regions and local government in the European  Union (EU), was formally inaugurated in Brussels on Wednesday [8  March].    The new institution's senior person, the Luxembourger Leon  Bollendorf, said in his opening speech that for the first time  in European history federal states, regions, departments,  provinces and local governments could give shape to their wish  to take part in the decisionmaking process within the EU.    This "decentralization" is intended to close the gap with  European citizens. The Committee should ensure that the EU  became a tangible reality for normal citizens, Bollendorf said.    The Committee of the Regions should give shape to this new  "realpolitik" and involve citizens in its activities, otherwise  there was a danger that citizens would regard the new  institution as a new European administrative body, he said.    The Committee of the Regions has virtually no powers. Member  states are only required to consult the Committee about  legislative work in five fields: Economic and social subjects  related to areas including the cohesion and structural funds,  the trans-European networks (in the energy, transport and  telecommunications sectors), education, culture and public  health.    Bollendorf said the committee should also make a  contribution  toward improving urban living conditions and security. In that  field the situation had got completely out of hand, with every  conceivable consequence for the stability of our democratic  structures, he said. The committee should seek a solution for  this painful problem, he said.    The Committee of the Regions has 189 members who are chosen  for four-year terms. It consists of representatives at regional  and local levels. Both groups have an approximately equal share  in the number of members and deputy members. The Socialists and  Christian Democrats are the two strongest groups in the new  institution.    On Wednesday afternoon the committee will elect a president  and decide on its activities. Flemish Prime Minister Luc van  den Brande is one of the candidates for the presidency.</p>

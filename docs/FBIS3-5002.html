Moreover, procedures for foreign-invested  firms to expand into areas not covered by their initial  investment plans and for foreign investors to sell stocks will  be greatly simplified.    Foreigners may now invest in tourist hotels simply by  registering their investment plans with the government.    These are highlights of the new regulations governing  foreign  investment that the Finance Ministry put into effect on  Wednesday under the revised foreign capital inducement law.    Under the new rules, the government cannot reject foreign  investment in areas where such investment could lead to monopoly  of or encroachment on the domestic market, though it can still  reject foreign investment in areas sensitive to public order and  morals, national security and national health and environment.    The business of handling foreign investment applications  will  be transferred from the Bank of Korea to all domestic foreign  exchange banks, effective July 1.    The new foreign investment rules are expected to increase  foreign investment in domestic industries, ministry officials  said.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): On the air, digitally speaking A programme on working at home ought to be made at home, writes Claire Gooding. So reasoned Peter Day, presenter of BBC Radio Four's In Business, and his editor Stephen Chilcott. A trailbreaking UK programme, to be broadcast on Sunday, has been put together at Day's home in north London, wired by BT with a high-quality ISDN line for voice and computer data. Intel installed an Apricot Zen-PCm multimedia workstation with Intel ProShare videoconferencing products. Day's interview with Intel head Andrew Grove (in Seattle) was carried out via the Video System 2000 from Intel, with a screen-mounted camera, allowing users to see each other on the PC screen. Chilcott edited with a British product, the Sadie real-time audio-disk editor, which reproduces a mixing-desk on screen, replacing tape recorders with a PC and mouse. Sadie sells professional digital editing solutions in competition with US and Japanese vendors. Sadie broadcasters can work at home - or at a desk anywhere - without compromising sound quality, producing full 24-bit digital audio away from a studio. Intel: UK, 0793 696000. BT ISDN Helpline: UK, 0800 181 514. Sadie: UK, 0353 648888.</p>

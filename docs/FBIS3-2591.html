			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wan Dan, a leader of the 1989 student movement, who  was arrested and released by the authorities the day before  yesterday, late last night faxed to the Hong Kong media an open  letter to the two meetings entitled "Safeguard Human Rights,  Enhance Social Stability," urging the two meetings to show  concern for the political rights and natural human rights of the  individual. Wang Dan held that the living standard of the  Chinese people has improved somewhat as compared with the past  and that it is time at present to show concern for the rights of  the individual.    In his open letter, Wang Dan stated that he will  unyieldingly  investigate the human rights situation of the Chinese people and  will, "within the scope permitted by law," "openly" investigate  cases involving human rights. He stated that he is mentally  prepared for being "suppressed" and will never feel "regret."    Wang Dan emphasized that "the democratic movement is not an  antigovernment movement and safeguarding human rights is not  subverting the government."    The full text of Wang Dan's open letter is as follows:    Deputies to the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] and members attending the Second Session  of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC] National Committee:    The Constitution of the PRC stipulates: Citizens have the  right to make suggestions and to criticize any state organ. On  the occasion of the opening of the "two meetings," I, in the  capacity of an ordinary PRC citizen, want to put forward my own  views on some issues in the political life of the country for  the reference of the deputies and members.    I support the reform and opening up policy pursued by the  authorities and agree that in the course of reform and opening  up the living standard of the people has improved somewhat as  compared with the past. It is precisely because of this that I  think that in China today the issue of the right to subsistence  has been resolved and, therefore, the safeguarding of the  political rights and natural human rights of the individual  should naturally be put on the agenda of the meetings.  Respecting human rights is a commitment of the socialist state.  However, it is undeniable that some problems exist in the  course of implementation. I make no attempt to conceal the  truth that on the human rights issue my views differ from those  of the authorities in many aspects, but I do not want to impose  my views on the government. I only hope that the government  will, in enforcing the law, handle affairs strictly according to  law and earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests  of citizens (including those under detention or serving  sentences). Therefore, I am willing to make known to the  authorities my activities. I will, in my own personal capacity,  carry out detailed investigations into specific cases involving  human rights and, with seeking truth from facts and obtaining  the approval of the people concerned as a prerequisite, discuss  with parties concerned some phenomena of serious infringements  of human rights on behalf of the people concerned or their  family dependents. If I fail, I will make appeals in a  legitimate and open manner. I will adhere to two basic  principles in all my activities:    1. Acting within the scope permitted by existing law;    2. Openness.    NPC deputies and CPPCC members, I would like to take this  opportunity to let you know my basic stance on human rights.  Promoting reform and opening up and maintaining social stability  are the main themes of the "two meetings" and are also the  common aspirations of ourselves and the authorities. I think  that promoting social stability and safeguarding human rights  are not mutually opposed; on the contrary, energetically  safeguarding work on human rights and arousing the enthusiasm of  people of various strata is a move which conforms to the wishes  of the people and can strengthen China's international position.  This is an important requisite for promoting social stability.    I fully understand that safeguarding human rights and  developing democracy is a gradual and orderly process.  Therefore, I do not ask the authorities to do anything at once,  but I hope the authorities at least can refrain from anything  such as serious infringements on human rights. I think this is  in conformity with the initial stage of socialism and can be  done at present.    Here, I must emphatically point out:    The democratic movement is not an antigovernment movement.    Safeguarding human rights is not subverting political power.    My going around campaigning on specific human rights cases  proceeds from humanitarianism. I am concerned with whether or  not the rights and interests and the dignity of the individual  are protected and respected. The ultimate goal is to maintain  social stability and to promote the progress of democracy. My  activities are not aimed at the Chinese Government, but at  specific problems. I hope my good and honest wishes can be  understood by NPC deputies, CPPCC members, and the authorities.  At the same time, I am also willing to take responsibility for  them.    I thoroughly understand that in the political environment in  China at present, it is necessary to take some risks in raising  objections to the behavior of the government. I am mentally  prepared for suppression by organs of dictatorship because of  this. However, I will feel no regret. I believe that what I am  doing is just and conforms with the three requirements I set for  myself when I was discharged from prison in February 1993: Not  letting down the people, not letting down history, and not  letting down my own conscience.    Wishing the two meetings complete success!    Wang Dan    10 March 1994    Beijing</p>

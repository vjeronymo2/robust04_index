			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (10): Companies recognise the connection - Christine Tighe profiles Nicholas Wilson, the first professor of credit management Professor Nicholas Wilson, the first holder of the Institute of Credit Management's (ICM) newly created chair at Bradford university, has clear objectives. He seeks to raise the profile of credit management as an academic discipline and as a vital function within companies. His task is to launch an extensive programme of research in credit management, developing its profile in the academic curriculum and professional training and attracting talented young people to work in the area. To some extent, his appointment last summer was in itself a significant step forward; he believes he is the first professor of credit management not just in the UK but in the world. The subject draws from various disciplines, including economics, finance and information technology (IT). 'My function is to bring them together into a credit management discipline,' he says. 'It is an exciting area, fairly new, with a lot of developments. It is coming to be seen as a critical function, whether you are talking about a small business or a multinational body.' His own background includes an undergraduate degree in industrial economics, followed by a PhD thesis on participation and profit sharing in British engineering; research fellowships in West Berlin's Wissenschaftzentrum and at Warwick University; and a nine year stint as a lecturer at Bradford Management Centre in managerial economics. He is now 37. It may seem a long way from small companies' unglamorous but persistent worries about recalcitrant late payers to Nicholas Wilson's high flying academic career and his ambitious use of powerful computer neural networks to produce predictive modelling tools for credit risk. But companies' initial response to his work suggests that they see the connection. There has been an excellent response to a research project he recently set up, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), to collect new empirical evidence on small companies' working capital management policy and practices. Of the 100-strong pilot group approached, 35 per cent responded with full information. Astonishingly - or perhaps not, if you are familiar with the preoccupations of small businesses - some respondents said they spend 85 per cent of their time managing cash flow and chasing debts. 'If you look at figures on failure, it's largely because of cash flow problems in the small business sector,' says Prof Wilson. 'A number of things could help - more prompt payments by larger businesses, better understanding by the banking sector of the difficulties small businesses face, and more training in cash flow management.' Further research launched since his appointment has also found companies willing to co-operate. But he believes there is still a long way to go to achieve his broad aim of raising credit management's status. 'There's an image that the credit manager is somebody who chases debts and that's it - an internal process in the organisation,' he says. 'But that's far from the truth. Credit managers are business analysts; they're closer to the business than anybody else.' Credit management, he says, should now be part of the structure of an organisation, and should begin before an account is opened. 'That is why credit risk modelling has to be more sophisticated, to try to profile risks and understand them.' This does not necessarily mean that credit will ultimately be withheld; rather that it is given on a better informed basis. In some companies the credit management arm is jokily known as the sales prevention team - and yet this should be far from the case. 'It facilitates business rather than preventing it.' In order to produce the more sophisticated predictive tools he has in mind, Prof Wilson is leading research on the modelling of corporate distress and failure, both by devising statistical models and by using neural network computer systems which can predict outcomes, such as credit risk categories, on the basis of recognising patterns in the information fed in. PhD students with backgrounds in mathematics, finance and accountancy are co-operating on this neural network research, funded by the ESRC. He has also instigated research into trade credit, both as a form of short term financing and a source of competitive advantage - an area of academic study he considers relatively neglected. The research will examine why and when non-financial sector companies use trade credit, how they establish terms and how they manage these activities. Initial data is available from companies' own accounting information and from Companies House, but Prof Wilson plans to begin building up from next month a sample of 1,000 companies willing to co-operate in an annual monitoring exercise which will be sustained over a number of years. Other research projects include study of the survival and performance of new start-ups in West Yorkshire, and the Working Capital Management study (which unearthed the would-be entrepreneurs who spend 85 per cent of their time on cash flow management). Research, however, is only one part of Nicholas Wilson's brief. After Easter, the current year's MBA intake at Bradford Management Centre will be able to opt for a module in credit risk management. Out of about 100 students on this year's MBA, at least 15 have so far signed up for the subject. And from next academic year, undergraduates will be able to include a module in credit management in their courses. Because Bradford's degrees are modular in structure, students from a wide range of disciplines will be able to take this option. Prof Wilson will also be laying on, at the Bradford Management Centre, short executive courses on techniques and new developments in credit management. The first of these seminars, aimed at those already working in the field, will be held for two days in November. Bradford, he says, was an appropriate choice for the ICM chair because the management centre has an excellent reputation both for the quality of its research and for its practical orientation. The centre's clients include Unilever, Allied Lyons, Rolls-Royce, Ford and the BBC - and Bradford was the first university to establish a chair in Total Quality Management. The Institute of Credit Management chair has been created initially for five years, at an annual cost of Pounds 50,000. A number of sponsors, including 3M, Cork Gully, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and Infolink, are each contributing Pounds 5,000 for the first five years. The ICM hopes that, thereafter, the post will have become so well established that Bradford University will absorb it within its own structure.</p>

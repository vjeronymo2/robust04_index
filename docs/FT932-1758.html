			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/DM at a 21-month high THE DOLLAR yesterday consolidated Friday's powerful upward move against the D-Mark, touching its highest level against the German currency since October 1991 before falling back amid profit-taking, writes James Blitz. There was no important news affecting the fortunes of the dollar in European or US trading yesterday. But, amid economic weakness in Germany and a serious political crisis in Japan, the dollar is being courted by institutional investors who believe the currency's immediate prospects are very strong. After closing on Friday in Europe at DM1.6800, the dollar moved up sharply in Monday's Asian trading, to peak at DM1.6953 at the start of European trading. The currency later fell back against the D-Mark in Europe, partly pushed down by the figure for May's M3 money supply growth in Germany, which was somewhat higher than had been expected. Last week, at least two Bundesbank council members had led the market to believe that the May figure might fall within the Bundesbank's self-imposed target for M3 of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent on an annualised basis. In the event, the figure came in at an annualised 6.7 per cent, leading some market participants to think that the Bundesbank might not cut its repo rate this week, increasing the return on D-Mark denominated investments. The dollar ended at DM1.6890, up nearly a pfennig on the day, and in New York it finished at DM1.6880. In spite of the setback, Mr Neil MacKinnon, head of currency research at Citibank in London, said the current price action was similar to the dollar's in October of last year, after it had hit an historic low against the D-Mark. 'That was followed by a 20-pfennig move upwards, and we could be on the verge of a similar move again,' he added. The dollar also rose against a yen that has been rocked by the political tremors enveloping Japan after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's resignation as prime minister. Dealers pushed the yen down to Y111.10 to the dollar by the European close after it had traded at around Y110 on Friday night. In New York yesterday the dollar finished at Y110.50. The Japanese currency remains well underpinned by the country's massive trade surplus, although a dealer suggested yesterday that it could soon hit Y115. The French franc softened slightly against the D-Mark after the Bank of France again cut official interest rates. But the retracement was marginal, and the franc finished at FFr3.360, having penetrated this level earlier in the day. Sterling consolidated its strength against the weak D-Mark, closing unchanged at DM2.5125. But the pound weakened against the powerful dollar, ending nearly a cent down at Dollars 1.4875. If the trend continues, it will undermine all thought of a UK base rate cut this summer.</p>

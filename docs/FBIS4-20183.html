			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 27 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry  spokesman Ferhat Ataman said on Wednesday [27 April] that claims  that the United States threatened Turkey on Turkish-Iraqi oil  pipeline were false.    `Threats and blackmail cannot take place between two allies  who have deep friendly relations,' Ataman said.    Speaking at a weekly news conference Ataman recalled Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller's words as saying Turkey has incurred a  loss of 20 billion U.S. dollars because of the Gulf crisis.    `This loss continues to gradually grow,' he said.    Ataman said there is no difference of opinion that the  Turkish-Iraqi pipeline should be rescued as this important  pipeline remained idle there.    `The problem is how this rescue will take place within the  United Nations system,' he said.    He said Turkey worked on several alternatives to rescue the  pipeline.    `We will continue our discussions with Iraq and our  coalition  partners on the issue,' he said.    Ataman said Turkey's aim is to rescue the pipeline within  the  framework of existing principles and a technical operation.    `We have no intention to circumvent the embargo,' he said.</p>

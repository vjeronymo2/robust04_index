			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ACT rise falls short of estimates ACT, the acquisitive computing services company, announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.54m, up 25 per cent on last time but at the lower end of City expectations. The shares fell 9p to 146p. Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 72.1m (Pounds 52.6m) in the six months to September 30. Earnings per share, however, were only 4 per cent ahead at 5.34p, reflecting the acquisition strategy. The interim dividend is raised to 1.75p (1.5p). Cash balances stood at Pounds 21.3m. The outstanding performer among the new acquisitions was Kindle, the Irish financial software house, which turned in a profit contribution before tax of Pounds 4.2m. The figure ensures that Kindle's directors will be paid an earn-out fee of Pounds 5.5m. Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman, said the earn-out payment meant the company had been acquired on a p/e of about 6.2: 'It looks like the most outstanding acquisition we have done'. On the debit side, two of ACT's previously profitable divisions both lost money in the first half. Medisys, which provides financial systems, lost Pounds 150,000 chiefly because of uncertainty among trust hospitals over the general election result. Logsys - whose customers are principally central government departments - lost Pounds 800,000 during its transformation from computer hardware supplier to systems integrator. Both divisions now operate profitably, Mr Foster said. The acquisition of NMW Computers, which would enhance ACT's strength in stock processing and delivering and give cost savings in data processing, has been delayed while the Office of Fair Trading considers ACT's market share in stock processing. Mr Foster said he was confident the deal would go through.</p>

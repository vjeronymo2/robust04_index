			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: ** "FLEETWOOD: MY LIFE AND ADVENTURES IN FLEETWOOD MAC" BY MICK  FLEETWOOD WITH STEPHEN DAVIS WILLIAM MORROW &amp; CO. ($17.95)  </P> <P> OK all you MacRumour Mongers, here's the whole story: the sex, the drugs, the  partner-swapping, the comings-and-goings, the schizophrenia, the bankruptcies  and, oh yes, the great music that is, was and apparently forever shall be the  big Mac.  </P> <P> Fleetwood tells the story as if he was sitting in your living room, which is  good for the intimacy of the tale, but bad for the rambling, sometimes  redundant telling. Like the band itself, the story goes on and on, though  insights and intrigue come frequently enough to keep it moving. And it fleshes  out what MacFans already know: Mick is one of rock's more colorful characters.  STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / BICC pessimistic after 12% fall THE longevity of the UK recession was brought home yesterday as BICC, the cables and construction group, announced a further fall in first-half profits. 'We do not expect any improvement in most of our markets until 1993 and even then volume recovery is likely to be modest,' said Mr Robin Biggam, chairman. No UK recovery was expected for 12 months. There was encouraging news on the Channel tunnel contract, which last year necessitated a Pounds 12m provision. BICC is involved in Transmanche Link, the consortium building the tunnel, and Mr Biggam said no further provisions should be necessary. BICC's interim pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent to Pounds 58m, from a peak of Pounds 100m in 1990. Sales were reduced in every part of the business, leaving group turnover at Pounds 1.77bn, against Pounds 1.9bn. Resilience in infrastructure markets and cost-cutting limited the fall in operating profit to 4 per cent, a total of Pounds 75m. Mr Biggam said operating profit was slightly ahead of the second half of last year. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 9m were taken at the operating level. Factory closures and other cuts were reducing the workforce at the rate of 10 per cent - or 2,000 jobs - a year. Interest charges rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 17m. However, with Pounds 154m of rights issue proceeds arriving in June, net debt was eased to Pounds 15m going into the second half. BICC Cables, the European business, saw operating profit fall by 19 per cent to Pounds 47m on turnover of Pounds 500m. North America - where prices had at last started to firm - made a Pounds 1m profit, a turnround from a second-half loss of Pounds 5m. Australasia improved from Pounds 8m to Pounds 13m. Balfour Beatty, the contractor, increased profit from Pounds 13m to Pounds 15m on Pounds 869m turnover. The 72 per cent of the business in civil engineering and power had remained resilient. The group broke down its property portfolio to show Pounds 110m in projects completed or under construction - of which 40 per cent were rented at a rate of Pounds 4m a year; Pounds 65m in the Spitalfields joint venture; and Pounds 50m in frozen schemes. Earnings per share amounted to 11.2p, against 13.6p. The interim dividend was held at 6p and Mr Biggam underlined the group's intention to maintain this year's total at 19.25p after a strong cash performance. The share price gained 17p to close at 279p, compared with 285p for the rights issue. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Algerians ponder sad prospect of more of the same: Political stalemate and economic stagnation in France's former colony are as entrenched as ever ON JANUARY 11 last year, Algeria was plunged into crisis: the president resigned and the country's new leadership suspended elections, in effect declaring war on the opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was poised to win a second round of voting. One year on, Algeria's problems seem further than ever from resolution. Hardly a day goes by without members of the security forces and Islamic fundamentalists killing each other. The troops and gendarmerie have failed to destroy what the prime minister, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, has called the 'spider's web' of Moslem radical groups - many of whom appear to operate independently of the FIS. Allegations of torture, which have been growing since a law in autumn allowing detention for ten days (often longer in reality) are making Algerians fearful that practices they thought had been abandoned after the bloody riots of October 1988 are back. New special security units are known locally as Ninjas because they operate clad in balaclava-type headgear leaving only their eyes visible. The atmosphere in Algiers is further darkened by tighter government control on the media. Since last summer, articles attacking France, which senior Algerians suspect of taking a lenient attitude towards FIS activists, have become common. Some newspapers have even gone so far as to accuse France of being behind the murder of the former head of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, who was gunned down by a member of his bodyguard last June. This at a time when they they are hoping to convince the authorities in Paris to refinance part of Algeria's FFr30bn (Pounds 3.6bn) debt owed to France. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, is due to arrive today in the first visit by a senior official from the former colonial power since the killing of Mr Boudiaf. Perhaps understandably, western leaders are as confused as ever as to how to deal with Algeria. The view is widespread that a FIS victory would have been both the beginning and the end of Algerian democracy - that it would have been a case, as a senior US official, Mr Edward Djerejian, put it last October, of 'one person, one vote, one time.' Those who lead Algeria today, whether civilian or military, are by no means all corrupt. But for the many ordinary Algerians who have neither home nor job, officials are seen as having enjoyed good jobs, travel and education abroad for their children. The common view of the haves by the have-nots is 'Ils ont bouffe' (they have been eating, or helping themselves). Bitterness has increased by the sight of the middle classes voting with their feet. Even those who fought France between 1954 and 1962 are queueing up for French passports. As for the Lazarus-like resurrection of Mr Abdessalam, who was Algeria's economic overlord throughout the 1965-78 reign of the late President Houari Boumediene and who was appointed prime minister last July, it poses more questions than it answers. A hard-working man who brooks no contradiction and whose personal integrity has never been questioned, Mr Abdessalam was the original architect of Algeria's energy and industrial policies. While the country's gas sector became a success under his guidance, its dash for industrialisation is widely held to have been a failure. Over the past six months, little has happened in the economic sphere Imports are now tightly controlled as Mr Abdessalem sees this as the best way to manage scarce resources. But a 70 per cent debt service ratio leaves his government scant room for manoeuvre to import the raw materials necessary to increase industrial output, currently running at only half of capacity, and cut unemployment. The government has made progress in improving its payments record. Over the past two years, commercial arrears have been reduced from over dollars 800m to as low as dollars 50m and one year credits by half to dollars 900m. Hard currency reserves stand at dollars 1.5bn. This policy has been made possible by the refinancing of commercial bank debt and bilateral debt with Italy completed last year. Algeria has not broken with the IMF as many had feared. But last week's visit to Algiers by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, does not mean the two parties will reach agreement easily. Whatever reforms the prime minister proposes, he faces an uphill task in selling them, complicated by the fact that he is operating in a political vacuum. The national assembly remains dissolved. Most town councils have been suspended. The government refuses to talk to the fundamentalists - and to the two main secular opposition parties, the Front de Liberation National, which until 1988 was Algeria's only political party, and the Front des Forces Socialistes, whose support is drawn from the Kabyle Berbers in and around Algiers. It is a deeply unstable mix, and one that leads some observers to wonder how long the army will sit by and watch. It was the army that gave power to Mr Abdessalam, and the army could take it away. The problem is that the army itself may be as divided as Algerian society.</p>

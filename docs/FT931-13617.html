			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: PTTEP to lead Thai privatisation drive PTT Exploration and Production, part of the state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), will lead a 1993 privatisation drive by Thai companies involved in the oil business when it offers shares to the public over the next few weeks. PTTEP wants foreign investors to buy a substantial number of the new shares, and there will be 'roadshows' in Hong Kong and London in mid-February to publicise the forthcoming flotation on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. 'It's the first privatisation from here in recent years to have a specific portion targeted at the international investor,' said Mr Tira Wannamethee, director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Thailand. BZW and Goldman Sachs are lead co-ordinators and advisers for the offer. On offer are nearly 40m shares, representing 15 per cent of the company's enlarged share capital. Of these, 24m are being set aside for Thai and 16m for foreign investors, although the foreign portion could be reduced by 4m if domestic demand is exceptionally high. The price will not be set until about February 22, but it is thought that PTTEP is seeking to raise between Bt1.2bn (Dollars 47m) and Bt1.5bn, which suggests a price of around Bt35 a share and values the company at more than Bt8bn. PTTEP shares should be listed on the SET in April. Other oil-related companies hoping to come to the market soon are Thai Oil and Bangchak Petroleum, both refiners, and the 51 per cent state-owned National Petrochemical Corp. 'Oil is the biggest industry in Thailand and completely unrepresented on the market,' said Mr Ted Pulling of brokers W. I. Carr in Bangkok. PTTEP has stakes in three projects already producing oil and gas in Thailand, and in the development of the Bongkot offshore gasfield. The company is also exploring another offshore bloc together with British Gas and negotiating with Total for a share in the development of Burma's offshore Martaban gasfield. Another tranche of the company is likely to be sold to the public in a couple of years, as cash-flow improves and debt is reduced with the help of the expected revenue stream from Bongkot. In 1991, total revenue rose to Bt1.32bn from Bt1.29bn in 1990, while net income fell to Bt247m from Bt283m.</p>

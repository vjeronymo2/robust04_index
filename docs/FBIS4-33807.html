			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within italics in Creole] </F>   [Text] For his part, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz  Robert Monde, who has socialist ties, very keenly condemned the  latest sanctions taken by Mr. Clinton, saying that it is a  racist, irrational, and unprecedented decision.    [Begin Monde recording] The international community's  strategy is aimed at punishing the people who voted for  Aristide. As I, Frantz Robert Monde, deputy, do not receive  money transfers; as for you, you do not receive transfers; who  receives transfers? It is those who had the chance to leave by  boat; it is someone who made an effort to buy a visa, it  is someone who made an effort... [pauses] who was working, saved  some money, and then left. It is those people who are sending  $150-200 to their families so they can live.    But you condemn those little people to live on only $50 per  month. I want the U.S. Government to tell me if the poorest  U.S. citizen can live on an income of $50 a week? This is a  racist and irrational decision which does not take the faintest  notion of humanitarianism into account. This is unprecedented.  I went to Washington and negotiated with them. We  agreed on the conditions under which General Cedras would step  down. The problems of Gen. Biamby Colonel Michel Francois were  out of the question. They agreed with me, but have decided  today that the entire Army high command should step down. When  one says high command, one implicitly says the department  commanders as well. Why? For Father Aristide? It is not  true, my dear. You must remember that when they entered  the country in 1915, they destroyed an existing police  corps in order to create the National Guard. Now, they say: Let  us destroy the Haitian Army which is a pure offspring of the  National Guard in order to create a police corps. In fact, let  us imagine that Aristide returns, that the Americans arrive in  the country, and that soldiers are going to be killed. Do you  think they will sit idly by? It is a [word indistinct]  political obligation for the Army high command to have a defense  plan. [end recording]</p>

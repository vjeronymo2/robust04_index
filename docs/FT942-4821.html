			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD study fuels minimum pay row A jobs study carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development triggered a furious election row yesterday as Labour leaders rejected Conservative claims that the study undermines Labour's plans for a statutory minimum wage. With just two days left before polling, Mr John Major said it was 'a great setback for Labour that independent experts have looked at what they wish to do and said it is nonsense'. Mr Major said on LBC radio that Labour wanted to 'interrupt markets and try to regulate them, and the whole thrust of the report is in precisely the opposite direction'. But Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the Conservatives had 'deliberately misrepresented' the report to hide the 'catastrophic economic failure' of deregulation. He said the Tories had created a 'low-skill, low-investment, low-pay economy' which could not protect against 'the onslaught of cheap competition from low-wage economies'. In a concerted attempt to extract maximum advantage from the report, ministers said it demonstrated growing international support for Conservative economic policies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said it supported the government's argument that job creation depends on supply-side reforms focusing on flexible labour markets. 'These policies have helped us to get unemployment down by nearly 300,000 from its peak, while it has continued to rise elsewhere in Europe,' he said. 'They are now being endorsed by every international gathering that addresses the problem of growth and employment.' Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said a minimum wage would be of most benefit to the top 30 per cent of British wage earners because of the large number of families with two incomes. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the report was a 'remarkable endorsement of everything this government has been doing in the 1980s and 1990s'. However, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the report supported Labour's emphasis on job creation through training, education and international economic co-operation. Labour officials said the report left open the option of a 'responsible' minimum wage, even though it recommends abolition in countries which already have such legislation. They pointed to a passage suggesting that the 'adverse employment effects' could be minimised by ensuring regional flexibility and indexing the minimum wage to prices rather than earnings. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Prescott would comment on Labour's criteria for a minimum wage, which are being considered by the party's economic commission. Union leaders have pressed for a flat minimum wage of about Pounds 4 an hour, but Labour said the commission's proposals, due next year, would be 'flexible and responsible'. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the report was 'a direct criticism of the government's policies'. Mr Beith called for decentralisation of wage bargaining and public transport and housing reforms to raise labour market flexibility.</p>

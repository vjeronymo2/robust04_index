			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Property: The lure of life down by the old mill stream - Chaucer and George Eliot wrote about it but prospective owners must have a liking for water the channel that takes water from the main stream to the mill - has dried up, the river will be flowing nearby. Watermills are not for parents who worry about children falling in. But they make satisfying, romantic houses, rich in associations. And there are plenty of them - if often ruined - since, from medieval times onwards, every community wanted its own mill. Like blacksmiths' forges, they were essential to agricultural life. Wind and watermills made cheap power, as hydro-electric schemes and wind farms continue to do. With the Industrial Revolution, the principles of grinding flour by water power were adapted to textiles and other industries, and the word 'mill' took on the extra meaning of a factory. Millers prospered, and often had a reputation for being unscrupulous. The usual way to pay them was a proportion of the flour, which they sold on. Chaucer wrote about a 16-stone miller with a wart on his nose while George Eliot, in The Mill on the Floss, has the stubborn, eager-to-expand and irascible miller Tulliver ruined after losing a case about water rights. But Pedham Mill in Constable's paintings has a peace that greed could never disturb. Few windmills have become houses, since their wood has not survived so well on the exposed sites they need and being round makes them more difficult to adapt. Also, they are colder than watermills, sheltered in the valley. But Gibraltar Mill at Great Bardfield, Essex, a 17th century brick tower mill with boat-shaped cap, has just been sold by Mullucks Wells for close to the asking price of Pounds 195,000. As you would expect, it has splendid views and some internal machinery survives. The stocks, sweeps and fantail outside were renewed in 1988. If you are looking for a watermill, decide if you want one that still has its machinery, either working or derelict. Do you want to restore it as industrial archaeology? Or will it be a relief if only the pond and mill race are left? If the leat is dry, it becomes a curious channel in the garden to remind you of what is no more. If it runs, does it have trout or could you stock it? (If you want to remove machinery and the mill is listed, check with the district council to see if that needs listed building consent because the equipment counts as fixtures). Several West Country mills are for sale. Cheapest is The Mill in the village of Heasley Mill on Exmoor, with the old drive wheel and two sets of granite millstones in what is now the kitchen. Stags in Dulverton offers it for around Pounds 115,000. The South Molton branch of that firm is selling Colleton Mill, near Chulmleigh between Exeter and Barnstaple, making a substantial house for Pounds 138,500. Near the north Devon coast and almost in Cornwall is Docton Mill, at Hartland. It has seven acres of well-known gardens, the head weir to divert water into the leat - which has wild brown trout - and a traditional miller's apple orchard. (These were more to provide wood for the machinery than for fruit). Down the valley, the water from the leat and stream pour over a 60 ft waterfall onto the beach, which is good for bathing, surfing and fishing. Gribble Booth &amp; Taylor offers it at around Pounds 250,000. In Somerset, Sea Mills Farm at Peasmarsh, near Ilminster and close to the A3O3 and M5, comes with 15 acres, a leat stocked with trout and two ponds fed by the river Ilse (from Jackson-Stops at around Pounds 350,000). Near Frome is the 19th century Iron Mill at Oldford, with fishing rights on leat and river and a guide price of Pounds 310,000 from Cluttons. As recently as 1969, Bishopstrow Mill on the river Wylye, near Warminster, was said to be the last working mill in Wiltshire. Now, the mill race is illuminated beneath the drawing room floor. It is new on the market, from Hamptons or Cluttons at around Pounds 270,000. Dearer, and easier for London, is the Old Mill at Hook near Basingstoke, Hampshire, a warm 17th century brick and timber house converted as early as 1910. It has eight acres and trout fishing on the river Whitewater; from Strutt &amp; Parker at around Pounds 630,000. The Sack Hoist is a penthouse flat in the mill at Kintbury, which overlooks the river Kennet and the Kennet and Avon canal between Newbury and Hungerford in Berkshire; the hoist is the projecting loft for lifting sacks of corn to the top floor. The 1982 conversion won an award for architect Paul Palmer &amp; Smith. The flat has two bedrooms, a lease with 88 years left and ground rent of just Pounds 10. John D. Wood is seeking Pounds 120,000 for this unusual abode. Nearby in Boxford, and close to junction 13 on the M4, the Mill House is more conventional. It also has trout fishing - on the river Lambourn - and comes with 18 acres for about Pounds 650,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker. In the Suffolk countryside painted by Constable is Raydon Mill, on the river Brett near Hadleigh. The main room has a glass panel in the floor to see the mill race. With a mill cottage, outbuildings, fishing and four acres, it is on offer for around Pounds 350,000 from Savills in Ipswich. Cheaper at Pounds 295,000, perhaps for being beside the railway line to Cambridge, is the Mill House at Elsenham, a village near Bishops Stortford that gave its name to a range of jams. It is built of brick with a diamond pattern in the roof tiles, and dates to 1668 when a London family settled there after fleeing the plague. Inquiries to Mullucks Wells. Plashet Mill, five miles from Blairgowrie in Perthshire, Scotland, was a derelict woollen mill until converted recently. It has a splendid site above the Black Water at Bridge of Gaily, and offers over Pounds 195,000 are sought by Savills in Brechin. Tomorrow, meanwhile, is National Mills Day when the Wind and Watermill Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (37 Spital Square, London El 6DY) urges a visit to your local mill. This essential group for mill buffs publishes a newsletter which includes a regular list of mills for sale. An Italian proverb says: 'Mills and wives are ever wanting.' At least you can buy a mill on the open market and test this saying's veracity . . .

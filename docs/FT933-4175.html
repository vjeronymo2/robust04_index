			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Swiss economy faces third year of decline SWITZERLAND is heading for a third of year of modestly declining output, with only a slow, weak recovery in prospect next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It forecasts a 0.6 per cent decline in real gross domestic product this year, after a 0.5 per cent fall last year, and sees only 1.6 per cent growth next year. Recovery will be hindered by poor prospects for exports, and by the sharp rise in unemployment, which will limit private consumption, and by the oversupply of commercial buildings, which will dampen private construction investment. The disappointingly slow fall of inflation will limit the central bank's ability to reduce interest rates. Figures published yesterday showed the annual inflation rate in August rose to 3.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent in July. The report is remarkable for its mild commentary on Swiss policies. This is in stark contrast to its 1992 report which made swingeing attacks on the high prices of most Swiss goods and services and on the central bank's monetary policy. The strongest criticism in the new report is of the government's quaint practice of collecting income taxes only once every two years. The OECD also worries about structural government deficits and high farm subsidies.</p>

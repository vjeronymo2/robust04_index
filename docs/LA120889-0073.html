			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOOK-ALIKE TEAMS TO MEET IN SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> The offensive similarities will be pronounced when El Camino Real and Dorsey  highs meet in a City Section 4-A Division semifinal playoff game at 7:30  tonight at Jackie Robinson Field in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Anyone for eight-minute, 15-play, 80-yard drives?  </P> <P> Dorsey running backs Lamont Warren and Larry Edmonds have rushed for 1,658  yards behind a bulky line that averages 250 pounds, and quarterback Chris Cook  has passed for 779 yards and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> El Camino Real running back Jamal Anderson (5-11, 205 pounds) has rushed for  1,099 yards, and quarterback Tony Bordwell has passed for 188 yards and one  touchdown.  </P> <P> "They're a lot like us," El Camino Real co-Coach Mike Maio said. "They don't  throw very much. But when they do throw, they do it effectively."  </P> <P> Defensively, Dorsey (8-3) will attempt to shut down Anderson and Lejon Carr and  Brian Astgen (525 yards rushing combined).  </P> <P> Warren, a junior who has rushed for 1,009 yards, has 22 touchdowns, including  three receiving and one on a kickoff return.  </P> <P> El Camino Real (6-5) is attempting to advance to the final for the first time  since 1980.

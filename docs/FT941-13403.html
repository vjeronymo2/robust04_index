			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour steps up attack on 'bizarre' judicial reform plans Labour yesterday moved to exploit the government's embarrassment over its troubled police and courts legislation by accusing Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, of trying to undermine the independence of the judicial system. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the bill would change fundamental constitutional rights by increasing central government control of police authorities and magistrates' courts, and abolishing the so-called right to silence. In a wide-ranging attack on government policy delivered in a speech at the London School of Economics, Mr Blair confirmed that a future Labour government would incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. This would allow people to take cases direct to the European Court of Human Rights rather than going through the UK courts and then waiting for the European Court to hear an appeal. He said the police and courts bill, which was widely criticised during its second reading in the Lords, was a panicky reaction to the 'patent failure' of the government's law-and-order policies. 'The Tory party is desperate and the dangers are plain. Policy is formulated in panic, announced without thought and pushed through with only the next day's headlines as a guiding principle,' he said. Mr Blair said provisions allowing the home secretary to appoint five of 16 members of freshly constituted police authorities, including the chairman, amounted to 'a dramatic change' to policing. He said Mr Howard's plan to put magistrates' court clerks on fixed contracts linked to performance criteria set by the Home Office had 'spread alarm and despondency'. Mr Blair also criticised plans in the criminal justice bill to require judges to demonstrate the unwillingness of defendants to answer police questions by calling them to the witness box. He said the 'bizarre' proposals, which conflict with the recommendations of the royal commission on criminal justice, would 'compromise the judiciary in a wholly unacceptable way'. The provisions have also been criticised by Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice. Mr Howard is expected to water down the police and courts bill by giving police authorities the freedom to choose a chairman, and by strengthening protection of the independence of magistrates' clerks. However, it is unclear whether this will be enough to overcome the criticism, led by prominent Tories including Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister.</p>

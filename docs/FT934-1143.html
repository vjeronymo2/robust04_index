			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Red Shoes' fails on Broadway - Karen Fricker suggests the cast should have shut up and danced The Dollars 8m musical adaptation of the film The Red Shoes earned a lot of nicknames on its way to Broadway - 'The Pink Slips,' for its numerous staff firings, including star Roger Rees; 'Jule's Last Jam,' referring to the show's venerable composer, Jule Styne; 'The Dread Shoes' . . . but none, it turns out, more prescient than 'The Cement Shoes.' Following universally negative local reviews, The Red Shoes closed on Sunday after five performances and 51 previews. The musical will not sink without a trace, however; it leaves regretful memories of unrealised potential and more than a few flashes of brilliance. Structurally and thematically, the musical strongly resembles its source - the 1948 Powell and Pressburger film which made a star of Moira Shearer as the gifted ballerina, Victoria Page, torn between her love for a young composer and her desire to dance for her charismatic mentor. The main difference in plot between film and musical is the shift of the Red Shoes ballet to the musical's end - an excellent choice, since it is the evening's high point. For when The Red Shoes dances, it is sublime. Lar Lubovich's joyous choreography, set to Styne's remarkably able ballet music, and skillfully danced by a company led by the astonishing Margaret Illmann, a principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada making her stage debut - all are first rate. But when The Red Shoes talks, it is mediocre, and when it sings, it is execrable. Styne has penned some terrific scores in his day, among them Gypsy, Bells are Ringing and Funny Girl, but The Red Shoes' tunes are musically underdeveloped and simplistic, and are matched in banality by the lyrics, by librettist Marsha Norman and 'Paul Stryker' (a pseudonym for Styne's longtime writing partner, Bob Merrill). Stanley Donen, the director of such classic musical films as Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, was brought in to direct The Red Shoes after Susan H. Schulman was taken off the job in August; his work is sturdy but unimaginative. The musical starts out strongly, wasting little time getting to the party scene at which ballet impresario Boris Lermentov (Steve Barton) and Vicky (Illmann) meet; in the first of several exchanges taken verbatim from the film, he asks her 'Why do you want to dance?' prompting her reply, 'Why do you want to live?' - words etched on the consciousness of balletomanes everywhere. Draped in a low-backed, sequined party gown, Illmann is an Erte painting come to life, long and lithe, and her surprisingly deep voice adds an exotic touch to her appeal. If her acting is sometimes nervously forced and her singing weak (blessedly, she is only given half a song), all is forgiven when she dances - her face shining and her limbs unfurled, she seems to embody the spirit of dance itself. So far, everything is twirling along nicely for The Red Shoes: the plot is developing efficiently, the sets, by Heidi Landesman, and costumes, by Catherine Zuber, are sumptuous and splendid, and the performers' talents impressive. Then a musical number comes along, and The Red Shoes' common denominator plummets. George de la Pena, otherwise outstanding as the dance captain, Grisha, is saddled with leading the dancer's thumping sing-along: 'Not sister or brother/we did it for mother/ . . . so that she can say/I have a daughter or son/who's in the corps de ballet.' The songs help no one in the show, but the character they damage most is Lermentov. Part Diaghilev, part Henry Higgins, part Svengali, the film's Lermentov embodies genius run amok, the need to create cruelly interwoven with the need to control. But the musical's Lermentov is nothing more than a lonely, washed-up lecher, in love with Vicky but unable to tell her; the songs he is given to sing reveal his inner life to be as complex as a nursery rhyme. Barton is cookie-cutter handsome, with a fine enough singing voice (the attribute Rees lacked, which reportedly cost him the job), but has not the charisma that Lermentov needs. Any complexity in the character of Julian Craster, Vicky's composer suitor, is also lost. His creative life played down, he becomes just a dopey dupe in love ('I must be where you are/across the room's too far'); as Julian, Hugh Panaro is handsome and rich-voiced, but bland. Poor writing also turns Vicky into the embodiment of an ideal rather than a person in passionate turmoil. In the musical's climactic dressing-room confrontation, after Julian and Lermentov bark out her options - guaranteed stardom or matrimonial bliss - Vicky's choice, to dance, seems at once obvious and arbitrary. Choreographer Lubovich excels throughout, but his piece de resistance is the ballet itself, which retells the Hans Christian Anderson tale of a girl whose new pair of red shoes dance her to a gory death - a tragic end that foreshadows Vicky's own fate. If the ballet's characterisations of villagers and gypsies seem slightly overstated, the story told is moving and involving, particularly the final graveyard scene, featuring a procession of white-haired, white-gowned, red-shod maidens, and a concrete angel who comes to life and floats heavenward, Vicky in his arms. After the ballet, the musical seems to give up; its calamitous ending is sloppily executed. The question that remains after The Red Shoes' quick demise is whether a good musical version of the film is possible - or desirable - at all. After this debacle it will surely be years before anyone has the nerve to attempt it. But were a writer/director team to emerge who could match them, there are a ballerina and a choreographer out there who are up to the challenge.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to  Tajikistan at 1600 GMT on 12 May, in its "Slavyanka" program of  the Russian Defense Ministry, broadcasts a 12-minute segment on  naval affairs devoted to the Black Sea Fleet. An unidentified  reporter begins his report by saying that he has just returned  from Sevastopol, where he saw no sign of "interethnic enmity"  either among the inhabitants of the Crimea or between the  sailors of the Ukrainian navy and the Black Sea Fleet. The  Fleet issue has become a media football, he says, adding: "The  politicians have decided that the Black Sea Fleet is a joint  one."    But the sailors cannot understand this, he goes on. "The  Fleet's traditions," the reporter notes, "like the pro-Russian  leanings in the Crimea, seem to be stronger than political  decisions. For the men of the Black Sea Fleet, and not only for  them, it is clear today that the division of the Fleet will lead  to its destruction. It is clear that the Ukraine cannot  maintain the Fleet." There have been no new ships for years, he  notes, and the youngest vessels are 17-18 years old. "The Black  Sea Fleet is supplied by the Russian Ministry of Defence," the  reporter concludes.    The next item in the Black Sea Fleet program concerns the  patriotic uplift given to the sailors by such measures as the  adoption of individual vessels by Russian cities and the  consequent provision of apartments in those cities for the  sailors. An unidentified reporter notes that both Russia and  Ukraine have their own views on the Black Sea Fleet's future,  but that the opinion of a third party, the Crimean Government,  cannot be ignored. The reporter says that he met with Yevgeniy  Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Crimean Republic. "Our  conversation followed a somewhat unexpected course," the  reporter notes. "It seems that Yevgeniy Saburov regards the  Black Sea Fleet as a factor in the Crimea's economic stability.  Judge for yourselves."    The reporter then plays a recording of Saburov saying: "I  was  very happy about the decision that Russia has its own legal base  for the Black Sea Fleet in accordance with all the agreements.  That is a very good decision. It looks as though it really  will be implemented. We have already become used to promises  being given, treaties being signed, and then nothing being  carried out. Let us hope that this time the decision will be  implemented.    "Apart from that, I must say that a very big part here is  played, in my opinion, not by the military aspect, but by the  economic aspect. Who will be selling any written-off ships?  Who will the rent be paid to? And the reluctance of the  Ukrainian side to allow the Crimea into the talks on the subject  really does suggest a mercenary interest in making use of the  benefits of the Russian proposal. It is only the Ukrainian  leadership that is not allowing the Crimea in.    "In fact, I can see a very large commercial interest here.  It looks extremely unsavory, it must be said, and in a sense  incomprehensible. The point is this: For example, if the Crimea  received the rent, what would it do? It would be a completely  legal matter, since Sevastopol's sewers, water supply and food  supply...[Saburov pauses] This money would not go into anyone's  pocket. It would benefit Sevastopol. It would remain on the  spot. The decisions must be made to be economically justified  and serve to benefit Sevastopol, the Fleet, and the families of  the sailors who live there. Otherwise it will be spent on  incomprehensible purposes and God knows where."    Speaking about the Black Sea Fleet becoming a joint  possession of the Ukraine and Russia, Saburov says: "A joint  fleet is out of the question. Of course, we dreamed of coming  together and of integration. We thought that there would be  close cooperation between the Slav states. But it isn't  happening. As for a Ukrainian fleet, without looking at all the  other aspects of the matter, I just think it is impossible for  the Ukraine to maintain it. There's only one solution here: It  must be a Russian fleet."    The reporter then asks Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov, deputy  commander of the Ukraine's Naval Forces, to explain his  government's actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet.    Kostrov says: "We must not take a narrow view of the  problem;  it needs a broader view. Either there are independent states or  there aren't. If there aren't, then there is no problem. If  they do actually exist, then one can talk about the subject of  the Black Sea Fleet. If the Black Sea Fleet exists, then today  it is legally and politically subordinate to two presidents."    The reporter says: Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov also talked  about the establishment of the Ukraine's naval forces and the  problems of their structural organization."    Kostrov goes on to say: "Our naval forces don't come under  any agreement at all, incidentally. The Defense Ministry passed  nothing on about structures for the forces which have been  formed in a vacuum. There were no structures. There were no  ships. We accepted the ships that came, newly built, from the  shipyards. We took on personnel that came from the Ukrainian  state, and we slowly...[pauses] Russia, unfortunately, is not  helping us and is trying to put pressure on us and to stop us  from emerging, since we seem to be out of favor. There are many  self-seeking things here which transcend the bounds of military  concepts. There are many far-fetched political attributes that  have been imposed on the Black Sea Fleet. It is a problem. It  is all done artificially. Even at the latest meetings of the  defense ministers -- you know their outcome, a very sad outcome,  unfortunately. But one cannot act in this way. We must respect  one another as Slavs. If we have separated, then let us observe  the sovereignty of Russia and the sovereignty of the Ukraine,  and respect the armed forces of Russia and the armed forces of  the Ukraine."    Kostrov continues: "I am Russian by nationality, although  I ws born in the Ukraine. It is my home. I have no other home.  Why must we now quarrel over nationality? We must draw closer  together now. Since we have a real existence within the borders  of sovereign states, we must respect those sovereignties. We  must help one another rather than increase the front of  confrontation."    The program concludes with a recapitulation of April's  events  in Odessa and hope is expressed that the differences between the  two states will, in the future, be resolved peacefully.</p>

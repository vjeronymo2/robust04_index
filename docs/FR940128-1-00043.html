			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, where food-contact surfaces are constructed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic materials (e.g., lead shucking blocks), the product may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly contaminated with the toxic material (Ref. 74).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that it is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that processors take affirmative steps to minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility that any risks will be created by the utensils and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment they use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proper construction of the equipment should be ensured at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time it is received, and whenever it is modified or repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The frequency of subsequent inspections necessary to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitary condition of the equipment has not declined with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time will depend on the frequency of its use, the materials and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction methods, and the nature of its use. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(c)(3) the agency is proposing to require that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls be performed and documented with such frequency as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(4), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that food-contact surfaces are regularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaned and sanitized with cleaning and sanitizing preparations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are suitable for this purpose. Surfaces that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately cleaned and sanitized can be a source of filth to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent products produced on the equipment, an attractant for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vermin, and a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Infrequent cleaning of equipment can result in the formation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biofilms, microscopic films in which microorganisms can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapped, shielded from the action of sanitizers, and physically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bound to the food-contact surface of the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An effective cleaning compound is one that will lower the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface tension of water so that spills can be lifted and flushed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> away. Ordinary soap is generally ineffective for equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing because of its limited ability to solubilize fats, oils,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and proteins. Mildly alkaline detergents are generally suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cleaning seafood processing plants, but high alkaline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detergents are often necessary for heavy buildups of fats and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proteins. Mineral deposits will frequently require the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid cleaners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An effective sanitizing agent is one that has a good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteriocidal effect on the types of pathogens normally present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the plant environment and is safe, stable, and convenient for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. Examples include hypochlorites, iodophors, and quaternary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ammonium compounds (Refs. 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To eliminate the product residue that accumulates on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product contact surfaces during production, FDA is proposing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(a)(4)(i) to require that utensils and surfaces of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that contact food during processing be thoroughly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washed at the end of the day's operations. FDA is also proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(iii) that sanitizing be performed on the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utensils and equipment immediately before the beginning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, so that any recontamination that occurs between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning and production can be eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

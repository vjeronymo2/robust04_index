Admittedly, the U.S. President hinted at the same time that  Tbilisi must not count on U.S. troops being sent under the UN  flag. Other countries must provide men and officers for  "peacekeeping" in Georgia. While Washington will only be ready  to provide moral and material support for this action, the White  House promised.    Having won the support of the U.S. Administration the day  before [7 March], Shevardnadze left Washington for New York  Tuesday in order to persuade the United Nations to send troops  to Georgia. The main purpose of this action, Georgia's  representatives say, is to ensure the return home of around  300,000 refugees from Abkhazia.    THE WASHINGTON POST cited Shevardnadze as saying that  international armed forces will have to be brought into Abkhazia  "to ensure the refugees' peaceful return." "It will be very  hard to envisage a settlement to the conflict...without the  crucial participation of the United States," he said during a  conversation with the editors of THE WASHINGTON POST. In the  newspaper's opinion, the Clinton administration is "trying to  limit Russian involvement in all the former Soviet republics."  "What we want to do is to ensure Georgia's territorial  integrity," a White House spokesman said.    Meanwhile news of Clinton's support for this action has  elicited conflicting comment and reactions in the U.S. capital  itself. On the one hand, both the administration and Congress  are not now averse to showing Russia that Moscow's doctrine of  "nearby foreign countries" and Russia's peacekeeping role in the  former Soviet republics by no means suit everyone here. On the  other, the United States is afraid of the adverse consequences  of, albeit indirect, involvement in the intricate conflicts amid  the ruins of the USSR. Until recently people here were  categorically opposed to sending UN troops (never mind U.S.  soldiers) to the "new independent states" in the grip of  conflict or to conferring the status of UN peacekeeping forces  on Russian units and subunits performing peacekeeping missions  there.    Even now the U.S. Congress is not united on this problem.  Congressmen are particularly worried by the fact that Russian  troops will inevitably form a considerable proportion of the UN  contingent in Georgia. The United States and the United Nations  would thus, as it were, be giving their blessing to Russian  peacekeeping efforts in "neighboring foreign countries." And  there are too many opponents of that prospect here now.    But people are also unhappy that Russian troops are already  in Georgia. And they want to "balance" their presence by  sending the UN troops for which Shevardnadze is now asking. An  anonymous "ranking administration representative" said that UN  forces would not under any circumstances be "Russian troops  wearing blue helmets."    In order to give greater weight to his appeals, the Georgian  leader took every opportunity to scare the Americans with the  idea of the revival of Russian nationalism. With his customary  enthusiasm Shevardnadze described the increase in  ultranationalist forces in Russia as a "great threat not only to  Russia but also to the whole world" during a press conference in  Washington. Speaking about events in Russia, he also declared  that "every honest citizen of the world" fears the revival of  the "cold war."    Shevardnadze did not confine himself to appeals for UN  troops  to be sent to Georgia and laid the foundations for the  development of military cooperation with the United States. He  signed a joint statement on this with U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry at the Pentagon Tuesday. This envisages the two  countries' opening military missions and carrying out a  "military cooperation program" which includes U.S. aid and  financial assistance for the reorganization of the Georgian  Armed Forces.    I would remind you that, according to U.S. press reports,  the  CIA has been involved in training and arming Shevardnadze's  personal guard.</p>

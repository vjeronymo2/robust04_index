			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: MAI The recent news about MAI has been dominated by its media side - in particular Lord Archer's controversial share orders in the run-up to the group's bid for Anglia Television. But that was not what was worrying the stock market yesterday. MAI's media division, which includes Anglia, exceeded expectations. The cost-cutting phase is over and MAI is now moving ahead with plans to build up Anglia's TV production operations. Originally, MAI predicted the Pounds 292m acquisition would be earnings neutral in its first year. Now it says the deal will enhance earnings. What sent MAI's shares tumbling 8 per cent were concerns that its money broking operations - which still dwarf the media side - were running out of steam. There are two things to be said about this. First, it is hardly surprising that MAI is not enjoying the bumper conditions which prevailed before the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in February. Second, the group is responding to the slimmer pickings in the market by emphasising cost-control. Not only are its wage costs variable, as bonus makes up a large proportion of brokers' remuneration, MAI has also benefited from lower international telecoms charges, its other main cost centre. That said, money broking is not a fast-growing business. MAI can be expected to grasp the opportunities to expand its media side whenever they occur.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Division of Energy Regulation, Virginia State Corporation Commission, PO Box 1197, Richmond, VA 23209, (804) 371&hyph;9264  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, PO Box 47250, Olympia, WA 98504&hyph;7250, (206) 586&hyph;1154  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 201 Brooks Street, PO Box 812, Charleston, WV 25323, (304) 340&hyph;0473  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas, Water &amp; Federal Intervention Division, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, 4802 Sheboygan Avenue, PO Box 7854, Madison, WI 53707, (608) 266&hyph;8128  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wyoming Public Service Commission, 700 West 21st Street, Cheyenne, WY 82002, (307) 777&hyph;7427 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Operation and Maintenance Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice proposes to require gas distribution operators to advise customers of any information that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers. This information could include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Excavation damage prevention: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Excavation damage is the largest single cause of gas pipeline incidents. Section 192.614 currently requires gas pipeline operators to notify the public in the vicinity of their pipeline on how to prevent damage to the pipeline from excavation activities. Section 192.614 currently exempts pipelines in class 1 and 2 locations and pipelines in class 3 locations which are marked in accordance with &sect;192.707. However, in a pending rulemaking (``Excavation Damage Prevention Programs for Gas, Hazardous Liquids and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines'', Docket 101, 53 FR 24747, June 30, 1988), RSPA has proposed removing these exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Type of pipe: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Different pipeline materials require different maintenance procedures. An operator's knowledge of the environmental conditions affecting the service pipe connected to the customer-owned service line may assist the owner in the maintenance of the customer-owned service line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Age of the pipe: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The installation date of customer-owned service lines, installed by individuals other than the operator, may not be known. However, many operators will have a record of the date gas service was initially established to the customer. In such cases, operators may reasonably assume that the installation date of the customer-owned service line is approximately the date of initial gas service. This information may then be relayed to the customer to assist in estimating the condition of the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Potential Hazards: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice proposes to require an operator to inform customers of the potential hazards of not maintaining a customer-owned service line. Improper maintenance or lack of periodic maintenance of customer-owned service lines may result in corrosion of metallic pipeline materials, separation of piping components, gas leaks, property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, and even death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''), and does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would apply to operators of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems. Small gas distribution systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include master meter systems, which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects and apartment complexes, and public, private, and municipal natural gas distribution systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Master meter systems, as defined in &sect;191.3, are pipeline systems for distributing gas within, but not limited to, a definable area, such as a mobile home park, housing project, or apartment complex, where the operator purchases metered gas from an outside source for resale through a gas distribution system. The gas distribution pipeline system supplies the ultimate consumer who either purchases the gas directly through a meter or by other means, such as by rents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

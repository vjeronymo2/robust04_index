			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: In Shops' shares rise 30p on bid from Birkby Birkby, the managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment credit company, yesterday announced the proposed takeover of In Shops, a listed retail space management company. In Shops' share price rose 30p to 113p on the news. The acquisition will double the issued share capital of Birkby, which is confident it can achieve significant rationalisation benefits, and reduce vacancy rates at the 66 retail centres managed by In Shops. Birkby, which is advised by Charterhouse Tilney, is offering 5 new shares for every 12 In Shops shares, valuing the target company at Pounds 58m, based on Wednesday's closing share price. This represented a 33 per cent premium to its market value. There is a part cash alternative, whereby shareholders can accept 3 shares plus 480p cash, for every 12 In Shops shares. The deal would result in the issue of 21.8m new Birkby shares, giving it a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 120m. In Shops' management has unanimously supported the offer, and Birkby has received irrevocable acceptances from shareholders representing 19.4 of the company. Birkby was formed through the reverse takeover of listed shell company Finlan in August 1992, when it had a market capitalisation of Pounds 13m. It has built up a portfolio of low cost properties, primarily redundant textile mills, and converted these into light industrial business centres, with small low cost units. It has also expanded commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit businesses, aimed primarily at servicing the workspace customer base. Birkby weathered the recession with occupancy rates above 90 per cent, and minimal bad debts. The company is forecasting pre-tax profit for the year to March 1994 of at least Pounds 3m (excluding discontinued operations). COMMENT Birkby has expanded at a breathtaking pace, but its management has yet to put a foot wrong, achieving 20 per cent annual returns on new premises acquired. Based on official forecasts for the current year, it is trading on a p/e of 18. The takeover is expected to succeed, and the enlarged Birkby would have to achieve profits of about Pounds 8m to equal this figure in 1995. This represents the combined forecasts for the two companies, plus about Pounds 800,000 rationalisation benefits. This should be easily exceeded and the shares should have further to go in the longer-term.</p>

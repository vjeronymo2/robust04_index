			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS IN POLAND GET BOOST;  </P> <P> MAZOWIECKI TO GIVE 'OUR NEW PARTNERS' MORE CABINET SEATS  </P> <P> Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is expected to be confirmed today as prime minister of  Poland, said Wednesday that he intends to broaden the first Solidarity-led  government by appointing more than two Communists to the Cabinet.  </P> <P> "Our new partners must not feel like secondary partners," Mazowiecki told a  meeting of Solidarity deputies in the National Assembly, acknowledging  Communist demands for a larger role in his government.  </P> <P> In a clear note of conciliation, Mazowiecki conceded that an angry Communist  Party could sabotage Solidarity's reform efforts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Would Be a Trap'  </P> <P> "The Communist Party in total negation would be a trap for the country," he  said. "No opposition in the world that . . . has the army and the security  services . . . remains the opposition."  </P> <P> Under the arrangement arrived at by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and President  Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communists were guaranteed control of the two Cabinet  ministries -- Defense and Interior -- that control the military and the police.  There are about 20 major Cabinet posts to be filled. The Communists'  parliamentary majority vanished last week when Walesa lured their former  coalition partners, the United Peasants' and Democratic parties, into the  Solidarity camp. Jaruzelski then gave the green light for the formation of a  Solidarity government and the Communists, for the first time in 45 years, were  forced to bargain with the opposition for a role in government.  </P> <P> Solidarity, after elections in June, rejected Communist appeals to join a  "grand coalition" headed by the Communists. On Wednesday, Mazowiecki spoke of  the need for a "broad coalition."  </P> <P> "One cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broad coalition  having the support of all forces sitting in the Sejm (the lower house of  Parliament)," he said.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki's gesture Wednesday followed the unusual step by the Communists of  making public a telephone conversation between Mieczyslaw Rakowski, first  secretary of the Polish Communist Party, and Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> According to party spokesmen here, Gorbachev told Rakowski that it is  impossible to have a government without Communists.  </P> <P> The party spokesmen said that in a "friendly conversation" that lasted 40  minutes, Gorbachev "expressed confidence that the Polish (Communist) party  would successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest of  socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems is impossible  without the Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's words, as quoted by party officials here, appeared to stop short of  a directive. But it is generally believed here that Jaruzelski's agreement on  the formation of a Solidarity government could not have come without  Gorbachev's assent. In that light, Solidarity leaders could be expected to  weigh carefully Gorbachev's views on the Polish situation. His comments to  Rakowski were the first attributed to him on the shift in power.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki did not indicate how many Cabinet seats he might give the  Communists, but some deputies in the Sejm said Tuesday that the party is  pushing for the post of deputy prime minister plus three or four ministries.  </P> <P> In addition, the Communists are trying to retain control of state radio and  television. This is likely to generate heated contention, because Solidarity's  activists are equally eager to get the Communists out of executive positions in  radio and television.  </P> <P> What Mazowiecki said Wednesday may be read partly as a response to Gorbachev  and pressure from the Communists, but it also reflects the moderate core of the  Solidarity leadership, which he represents.  </P> <P> Solidarity moderates have cautioned that change in Poland should come about  "not by revolution but by evolution" and have urged a gradual transition from  the Communist system. And although the change to a Solidarity-led government is  taking place peacefully, a sharp upending of power alignments could bring  difficulties for Solidarity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inexperienced in Governing  </P> <P> Solidarity moderates have been saying since the elections in June that they are  inexperienced in running a government. Some have expressed concern that  Communist bureaucrats, faced with political and professional oblivion, could  obstruct the new government.  </P> <P> On the other hand, some of them argue, the reform-minded elements of the party  could be helpful.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki touched on the issue in his remarks to the Solidarity deputies. He  said there would be "no witch hunts" by his government and that the criteria  for employment would be "competence and loyalty to the new government."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki said he had Jaruzelski's assurance that army and security forces  would cooperate with Solidarity. He said "there is a feeling of danger" within  those forces that must not be aggravated if the democratization of Poland is to  be successful.  </P> <P> "This is political wisdom not to increase this feeling of danger and not to  create a feeling of aggression," he said.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki spent most of Wednesday meeting with Solidarity leaders and  representatives of the United Peasants' and Democratic parties. The discussions  centered on appointments to the new government. The United Peasants' Party is  hoping for at least four ministries and the Democrats for two.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki told the Solidarity group Wednesday that he hopes to have the  government organized within a week.  </P> <P> GORBACHEV PRAISED -- Bush salutes Soviet Leader's Poland advice.

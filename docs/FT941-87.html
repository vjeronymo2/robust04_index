			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hit Grampian - Profits fall 50% after Pounds 2.98m exceptional charge and sports loss Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, yesterday blamed heavy restructuring costs for a 50 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.63m. The Glasgow-based pharmaceutical, sporting goods, transport and retail group, said its results were hit by exceptional charges of Pounds 2.98m to cover redundancies and reorganisation costs and a Pounds 398,000 operating loss in its sporting business. As part of the restructuring, the group has closed its pharmaceutical factory in Glasgow, relocated the division to Leyland in Lancashire and cut the workforce by 12 per cent to 440. It made a further 42 workers redundant at Patrick International, its sporting goods subsidiary which closed down operations in Germany and made stock write-downs elsewhere. Total closure and restructuring costs of Pounds 6.6m were offset by a Pounds 3.62m exceptional profit on the disposal of Grampian Woollen Mills, which was merged last year with the Edinburgh Woollen Mill. Despite the problems, Grampian said an improved performance by the transport division, which saw profits increase 85 per cent to Pounds 2.7m, lifted profits on continuing group operations to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.3m). The increase was also underpinned by a Pounds 1.6m profit derived from its retained 25 per cent stake in Grampian Woollen Mills. Mr David McGibbon, finance director, said group turnover had declined slightly to Pounds 137.1m (Pounds 137.3m) as the pharmaceutical business struggled to maintain sales during its restructuring. 'Some sales are bound to be lost when you're putting through a reorganisation of this size,' he said. The restructuring costs also forced the group to increase net borrowings from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 32m, representing gearing of 74 per cent compared with 58 per cent last time. Although exceptional items led to a 50 per cent decline in earnings per share to 7.35p (14.71p), the previous year's figure was distorted by a profit from the sale of Mitre, the sporting goods company. Pre-exceptional earnings increased to 10.53p (7.18p). An unchanged final dividend of 3.8p leaves the total payment for the year at 5.5p (same). COMMENT Although the restructuring of the pharmaceutical division has only just been completed, Grampian has decided to take all the costs in 1993 in the hope that pain now will pay off with a recovery later. There are, however, reservations about the strength of a balance sheet which is still labouring under heavy borrowings. Nevertheless, profits this year are expected to bounce back to around Pounds 11m, putting the shares on a forward multiple of 15. Although that is a discount to the market, there are some concerns that the slimmed-down businesses can generate the necessary cash to strengthen the balance sheet.</p>

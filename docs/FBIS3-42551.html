An orbiting vehicle will probe the surface with radar  in the frequency range of 0.5-5 MHz with the emission of pulsed  radio signals and measurement of the strength of the signals  reflected off the nightside surface. Interpretation of the  signals will be unusual in that the cryolithosphere is a  multicomponent medium with a nonuniform structure that results  from, among other things, considerable depth variation in ice  content and the possible presence of saline ice and briny  solutions. In light of that, the work reported here involves a  technique for calculating the depth profiles of the dielectric  permeability of the mixtures of the various materials in the  cryolithosphere based on the temperature and frequency  relationships of the dielectric permeability of ice. The  technique assumes that the frozen ground can contain either  freshwater ice or saline ice, and it enables calculation of the  dielectric permeability of two- and three-phase  ellipsoidal-particles mixtures, depending on the volumetric  content of the soil components and their dielectric  permeability. The dielectric permeability of ice is calculated  in the context of the theory of orientation polarization of  dielectrics with typical relaxation times. The researchers  concluded that the skin layer may be hundreds or thousands of  meters thick, depending on the soil composition. Figures 4,  references 13: 6 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

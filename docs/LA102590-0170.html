			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S PREP FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR TACKLES UNBEATEN TUSTIN  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor High School football team has been lurking in the shadows of  the Sea View League for the past four seasons. Neither a champion nor a patsy,  the Sailors have walked the fine line between mediocrity and consistency.  </P> <P> "We've been in the hunt just about every year," Sailor Coach Jeff Brinkley  said. "There were a couple times we were either going to be in first or fourth  after the last game of the season. We just haven't gotten that one big  victory."  </P> <P> The Sailors will have another chance to win the big one at 7:30 tonight when  they play at Tustin in a crucial league game. The Tillers (7-0, 2-0 in league  play) are ranked third in Orange County.  </P> <P> A victory tonight would keep Newport Harbor (5-2, 1-1) alive in the league  race. But a loss not only would end those title hopes, but also put a playoff  berth in jeopardy.  </P> <P> The Sailors already have lost to Corona del Mar, the two-time defending  Southern Section Division VI champion. They still have to play Saddleback, with  which they are tied for third place.  </P> <P> "To be champions, we know we have to beat Tustin," Brinkley said. "That's the  bottom line."  </P> <P> Newport Harbor has not won a league championship since it shared the title with  Saddleback in 1985, a year before Brinkley took over the program.  </P> <P> The Sailors have reached the quarterfinals of the Division VI playoffs twice in  the past three seasons. But they have come up short in the league race.  </P> <P> In 1987, Newport Harbor needed only to beat Corona del Mar in the last  regular-season game for the championship. The Sea Kings won, 6-0.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Sailors needed a victory in their final league game for a  co-championship. They lost to Corona del Mar, 27-8.  </P> <P> Even last season, the team's best since 1985, wasn't good enough. Newport  Harbor finished 8-2 during the regular season, but lost twice in league play  and finished tied for second with Tustin.  </P> <P> "We kind of get overlooked now," Brinkley said. "We don't mind. In fact it's  become our personality. We sneak in, do our job and get out."  </P> <P> The Sailors have the talent for it.  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve Walker has completed 70 of 124 passes for 764 yards and seven  touchdowns. He has three solid receivers in George Greenwalt (26 receptions for  313 yards), Michael Stripe (17 for 203) and Branon Coluccio (16 for 182).  </P> <P> Running backs Russ Olshefski (575 yards) and Marc Tagliaferri (390) keep  opponents from keying on the passing game.  </P> <P> Even when the offense stalls, the Sailors have a formidable weapon. Kicker Josh  Klein has six field goals, 18 in his career.  </P> <P> "I think if someone overlooks us, we can come up and bite them," Brinkley said.  </P> <P> Other games tonight:  </P> <P> Century League: Canyon vs. Villa Park at El Modena High School; Empire League:  Loara vs. Katella at Glover Stadium; Garden Grove League: Kennedy vs. Santiago  at Garden Grove High School, Los Amigos vs. Rancho Alamitos at Bolsa Grande  High School; Orange League: Anaheim vs. Savanna at Western High School; Pacific  Coast League: Century vs. Laguna Hills at Mission Viejo High School; South  Coast League: San Clemente at Irvine; Nonleague: Paramount vs. Mater Dei at  Orange Coast College.  </P></p>

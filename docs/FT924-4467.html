			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Taming the overmighty boss: The Cadbury report hopes to makes UK companies better run, but will it make them more profitable Watching the members of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance file into their press conference yesterday - all men, all middle aged, all wearing grey suits - it was easy to understand the air of mild disappointment that greeted their first conclusions, six months ago. Worthy enough stuff, no doubt, said the world - but how much good would it do in practice? Where was the magic bullet that would rid the world of future Robert Maxwells? And wouldn't the specific proposals the committee had in mind lead to the creation of two types of directors - 'the doers and the checkers', as Peter Morgan of the Institute of Directors put it? The committee has reacted to these specific criticisms by watering down some of its proposals. On the face of it, that might lead you to expect the final draft to be more disappointing than the earlier one. Reading the report, however, gives rise to a rather different impression, somewhat at odds with the committee's air of cautious incrementalism. The proposals could well mark a watershed in the relationship between the boards that supervise the activities of UK quoted companies and the managers who run them day to day. Companies that comply fully with the spirit of the Cadbury report will find themselves establishing a markedly more structured, formal role for the board. For the very largest companies, this may not come as a great surprise; for the typical mid-sized UK company, the change will be much more noticeable. Suppose that, a few years hence, you are just about to join the board of MidCo plc, as a non-executive director. This entirely ordinary mid-sized company has embraced the Cadbury principles fully. You have thus been chosen not because you bumped into the chairman on the golf course, but through a selection procedure dominated by existing non-executive directors. At your first meeting, you are given a list of subjects reserved for a formal decision of the full board. The list includes any acquisitions or divestitures material to the company, along with investments, capital projects, treasury policies and risk management policies. This should mean that before the bright young man the corporate treasurer hired from Megabank's dealing room commits the company's entire net worth to a short position in the Omani riyal, you'll hear about the procedures in place to stop him - and get a chance to decide if they're strong enough. Because you're an independent director - you have no involvement with the company except your fees - you are rapidly pressed into service on the audit committee. That means choosing the auditors, supervising the audit process, keeping an eye on internal controls, and getting a once-a-year private meeting with the auditors at which you and your fellow non-executives all eye each other nervously. Eventually, though, it becomes clear that the eager new audit partner - just rotated into the task, in line with Cadbury - isn't going to accuse the management of looting the company, and you all breathe a sigh of relief. Times have been hard for MidCo, and you've had your doubts about next year's cash flow. That means that the last few weeks before the annual report is signed off are rather nerve-wracking. You must satisfy yourself that the business will still be afloat at the end of the new financial year, and then put your name to a statement to that effect which the auditors will comment on. Eventually, after a lot of agonising, the board agrees on an unqualified 'going concern' statement, and the auditors concur - but you decide to keep a closer eye on cash flow in future. When it comes to approving the words that accompany the annual results, you manage to make your first small impact on the company. The narrative presented by the executives rather glosses over that nasty business when the widget subsidiary lost a bundle on a Nigerian export contract. Picking up your battered copy of the Cadbury report you read the following sentence into the board minutes. 'Balance requires that setbacks should be dealt with as well as successes,' you quote - and the next draft of the narrative comes a bit cleaner on just what went wrong. Each of these changes is a small one, and some of them reflect policies that are already being carried out on the best boards. But as a whole, and taken together with recent changes in accounting standards and the growing mood of interventionism among institutional investors, they add up to a significant strengthening of the board's formal role. This strengthening will take place even though the final Cadbury report makes some concessions to critics who accused it of going too far. Both versions of the report say that, in principle, it is a good thing to separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive. The two versions differ, however, on what should happen if the jobs are combined. The draft called for a senior non-executive director to play a formal role in representing shareholders' interests; that has become noticeably weaker in the final report. The suggestion in the draft that the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees should speak as of right at a company's AGM has also been watered down; it is now up to the chairman to pass them relevant questions. And the final report stresses the shared obligations of both executive and non-executive directors, to head off criticisms that the draft went too far to create two classes of directors - 'the goodies and the baddies', as one company chairman called them. Now that the final report is published, two big questions remain: will its recommendations actually get put into effect, in the spirit as well as the letter? And if they do, will it make any difference? On the first question, opinion is divided. Sir Adrian Cadbury believes that the existence of the new checklist of procedures and policies will give ammunition to shareholders and board members. The requirement, to be imposed by the London Stock Exchange, that companies state in their annual reports which bits of the Cadbury code they apply, and which ones they don't - and to explain the omissions - will act, Sir Adrian says, as an effective stick. Others are less optimistic. 'When I've talked around among captains of industry,' said one well-connected critic, 'they all say 'we're doing it already' or 'it doesn't make much difference anyway'.' That means, he said, that the code might only be given lip-service. The good boards will continue to put shareholders' interests first; the bad boards will let strong-minded chief executives go off on the rampage. Another influential financial figure, who has had personal experience of trying to restrain a dominant chief executive, was more sanguine. Cadbury rules would have made it easier to mobilise the board to act as an effective check on the management, he said; it was the absence of strong non-executives which had created much of the problem. But where are the strong non-executives to play the new, more onerous role? Significantly, one member of the Cadbury committee has recently turned down an offered board position, because he felt the company's management style might give it problems in complying with the spirit of the new code. Yet such boards are precisely the ones that need strong non-executives. Sir Adrian talked rather hopefully yesterday about non-executives from among the divisional managers of large companies; and perhaps from public service and the universities. Still, the non-executive gap may not be easy to fill. Even if the gaps are filled and the procedures in place, will this add a single penny to the earnings of UK quoted companies? 'Yes, absolutely,' said Sir Adrian yesterday, quoting the benefits of tighter internal controls for improving efficiency. One of his supporters among the corporate community talked, perhaps more realistically, about the way in which the report would lessen the downside, rather than increase the upside. 'It is more a set of safety nets to protect a company from disaster, rather than something that would enhance performance,' he said. But even this view was regarded as optimistic by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR. 'I don't think it will change the number of failed or failing companies,' he said. One committee member supplied his own criteria by which to judge the success of the venture. 'Does this report pass the 'M' Test?' he said yesterday. 'Would it have stopped Robert Maxwell? No.' But, he said, that was not really the right question to ask: Maxwell-proofing the UK probably required such a high level of oversight and scrutiny that the financial system would have buckled under the strain. A more relevant question, he said, is: 'Does it pass the 'L' Test?' - would it have brought Lonrho more into line with accepted norms of corporate governance. Judged by that test, he said, the report would probably pass. Lonrho is an unusually vivid example of a not-so-unusual phenomenon: it is dominated by a powerful chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who has presided over successes as well as recent setbacks. In the end, however, shareholders will care little whether such larger-than-life characters become rarer. Their concern will be whether the average British company will be more consistently profitable. It is hard to judge; just as it is hard to say whether the current interest in proper procedures, good governance and involvement by institutional shareholders will outlast the memory of the excesses of the 1980s. At the moment, the shortage of takeover bids means that institutions feel trapped in underperforming UK companies, and can only raise share prices by improving the companies' management. This enthusiasm for involvement in companies' affairs may last no longer than the recession. The real verdict on whether Cadbury will improve the performance of UK industry will therefore come in the upswing. If boards, by then bristling with powerful, newly confident non-executive directors, can avoid even a 10th of the mistakes that companies made in the 1980s, shareholders and the public will have reason to thank Sir Adrian and his team. And even if, when the time comes, the Cadbury recommendations fail to pass that test, they will certainly change the way many boards run in the meantime. KEY POINTS OF CADBURY REPORT Companies to say whether they comply with Cadbury code, and if not why not Division of responsibilities at head of company Strong non-executive directors, most truly independent Key matters reserved for full board decision Audit committee composed solely of non-executives to scrutinise figures and appoint auditors Board to monitor company's internal controls Directors to say publicly each year that company is a going concern, with qualifications if necessary Auditors to report on 'going concerns' statement Legislation needed to limit directors' contracts, strenghthen internal controls, let auditors blow whistle on possible fraud</p>

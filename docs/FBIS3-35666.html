The announcement was made by Sandro Kavsadze, Georgian  leader  Eduard Shevardnadze's envoy, after the talks with Abkhazia held  at the Russian Foreign Ministry and mediated by a representative  of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Friday.    "The Georgian side categorically refuses to differentiate  between the refugees as to who took part in the war and who did  not because the bloody conflict has involved almost the entire  population, including Georgians, Abkhazians and other nations,"  Kavsadze said.</p>

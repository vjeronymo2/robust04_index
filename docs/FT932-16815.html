			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz drops takeover shield DAIMLER-BENZ is to abandon its main protection against an unwelcome takeover by dissolving a special holding company that owns 25 per cent of its shares. Mercedes Holding was set up in 1975 to stop the Shah of Iran from buying a big stake in Germany's biggest industrial company. The Mercedes Holding shares will be converted into Daimler shares later this year on a one-for-one basis, Daimler said yesterday. The holding company has no connection with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary and, although quoted, its sole purpose is to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler. The announcement prompted a sharp drop in Daimler's share price and is likely to lead to a significant increase in the price of Mercedes Holding shares on Monday. They are on a 20 per cent discount to Daimler shares. The move will be seen as a victory for shareholder rights activists who last January launched a campaign for the abolition of the holding company. Analysts said the move was linked with Daimler's decision to list on the New York Stock Exchange later this year, where such shareholding structures are viewed as anachronistic and contrary to the interests of institutional investors. The break-up of the company will also help Daimler in its long-frustrated plans to hold a DM2bn rights issue, originally intended for last year but postponed due to poor conditions on the German equity market. For technical reasons, the holding company makes it difficult to raise equity capital, as Daimler intends to do next year. Mercedes Holding was put together at the initiative of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank and biggest shareholder in Daimler with a 28 per cent stake. In the mid-1970s, Mr Friedrich Karl Flick, the industrialist, wanted to sell the bulk of his 39 cent stake in Daimler to Iran. Deutsche Bank objected, fearing that the crown jewels of German industry would end up being controlled from the Gulf. The bank bought 25 per cent itself, before selling it on to the newly-created special holding company. Half of its shares are owned by two holding companies, Stella Automobil and Stern Automobil, which are in turn owned by a number of banks and industrial companies, including Allianz, the insurer, as well as Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, Germany's second and third biggest banks, and Robert Bosch, the car components company. The remaining shares are owned by around 60,000 individual and institutional shareholders, which collect a dividend from Daimler but have no direct vote in the industrial conglomerate's affairs. Daimler refused to comment yesterday on what would happen to the shares owned by Stella and Stern. Analysts speculated that some of the shares could be used to sell to US investors in connection with the New York listing. Some explained the fall in the Daimler share price yesterday as reflecting perceptions that large blocks of shares would now come on to the market.</p>

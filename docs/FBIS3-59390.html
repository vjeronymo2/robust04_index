Industrial enterprises  at and above the township level in the province turned in a  gross output value of 51.156 billion yuan for the period from  January to November, an increase of 15 percent over the  corresponding period of the previous year. It is estimated that  the gross industrial output value of enterprises at and above  the township level in Shaanxi for the whole year will reach 56.3  billion yuan, and the gross industrial output value contributed  by all the industrial enterprises in the province will reach  75.4 billion yuan, an increase of 22.4 percent over the previous  year.    Industrial production in 1993 shows the following principal  special characteristics: 1) The nonstate-owned industrial  sector grew drastically. For the first 11 months of 1993,  nonstate-owned enterprises at and above the township level  turned in a gross industrial output of 11.377 billion yuan, an  increase of 38 percent over the corresponding period of the  previous year, and 28.3 percent points higher than the growth  registered by state-owned industrial enterprises. Of these  non-state-owned industrial enterprises, industrial enterprises  under collective ownership recorded a growth of 32.9 percent,  while other nonstate-owned industrial enterprises enjoyed a  growth of 90.7 percent. 2) Central-government-owned enterprises  enjoyed a growth higher than province-, prefecture-, city-, and  county-owned enterprises did. In the first 11 months of 1993,  central-government-owned industrial enterprises turned in a  gross industrial output value of 15.344 billion yuan, an  increase of 14.6 percent over the corresponding period of 1992,  whereas the province-owned industrial sector and its  prefecture-, city-, and county-owned counterparts only enjoyed  an increase of 10.3 percent and 4.7 percent respectively. 3)  The growth in heavy industry was apparently higher than the  growth in light industry. Pulled by the increase in investments  in fixed assets, heavy industrial production led light  industrial production all the way in terms of growth in  production output. From January to November, the gross output  value of heavy industry increased by 19.7 percent over the  corresponding period of the previous year. In addition, the  production and market sectors coordinated with each other quite  well. From January to November, the sale volume fulfilled by  industrial enterprises at and above the township level totaled  47.579 billion yuan, an increase of 16.1 percent over the  corresponding period of the previous, and 1.1 percentage point  higher than the growth in the gross industrial output value.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Jurisdictional Coordination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-two commenters addressed the issue of jurisdictional coordination between Federal, State, Indian tribal, and local governments in the routing designation process. These commenters included ten members of the shipper-carrier industry, eight States, two local governments, one Federal agency, and one consulting firm. Fourteen commenters expressed concern about the role of the Federal government versus State and local governments. Many of the commenters did not recommend changes to the regulation but expressed their concerns about the administration of this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven commenters discussed the potential for conflicts between States, between local jurisdictions, and between States and local jurisdictions. Eight commenters were concerned that the required communications between States, Indian tribes, and local jurisdictions would not be adequately coordinated. The FHWA revised &sect;397.71(b)(3)(i), dealing with consultation with others, to provide for better interagency coordination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments from shippers and carriers recommended increasing the State, Indian tribal, or local governments' burden in establishing and administering a routing designation. For example, their recommendations included requiring States to produce a risk analysis for each class of NRHM for a specific route designation and for each route designation that transfers risk from one jurisdiction to another. They also recommended that States develop consistent standards to be used by all local jurisdictions. State and local governments, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the proposed requirements that would be imposed on them in establishing and maintaining routing designations. These comments focused on the administrative burdens associated with the proposed requirements, such as those involving records maintenance, public hearings, and those that would require a finding that any routing designation would enhance public safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA believes that the increased requirements proposed by the shipper and carrier industries would unduly burden State and local governments without producing a corresponding safety benefit. Similarly, the FHWA believes that the requirements proposed in the NPRM are the minimum necessary to ensure that States or Indian tribes adopting routing designations fully and fairly consider all of the factors required under the law. Accordingly, the FHWA is promulgating this final rule without a change in the proposed coordination requirements for establishing and administering route designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters recommended that States or local governments be allowed to have varying standards which could differ based on the type and quantity of material involved. The FHWA believes that no changes are necessary since States are already provided the latitude to determine how the standards in this regulation or any additional standards a State or Indian tribe select are to be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Dispute Resolution, Preemption, and Waivers of Preemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Preemption, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution procedures were discussed by fourteen commenters. These commenters included nine members of the shipper-carrier industry, three States, one Federal agency, and one citizens' group. Four commenters addressed eligibility or standing to petition under the dispute resolution process, with three commenters recommending the local jurisdiction be eligible to participate in the dispute resolution process. The FHWA decided not to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA authorizes the FHWA only to resolve disputes between States and between States and Indian tribes. The FHWA believes that States will consider the views and concerns of local jurisdictions in formulating their positions on preemption and preemption waiver determinations. Additionally, the dispute resolution procedures provide affected local jurisdictions with notice and the opportunity to participate, through their State, in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters addressed waiver of preemptions. Two suggested that local governments could use this process to circumvent State administration of routing designations, another recommended the FHWA prevent local governments from seeking a waiver of preemption when the State has disapproved the designation, and one remarked that the waiver of preemption process provides protection for jurisdictions where unique circumstances justify extraordinary routing measures. The FHWA has decided not to adopt these recommendations because it believes that the finding required by 49 CFR 397.219 (that the waived routing designation provide an equal or higher level of highway safety to the public without unreasonably burdening commerce) is sufficient to ensure that the waiver process is not used arbitrarily. Additionally, States are able to express their views as part of the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

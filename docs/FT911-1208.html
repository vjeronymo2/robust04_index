			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Cyrano - Covent Garden A second look at David Bintley's new Cyrano on Monday night did not bring any greater pleasure than at the premiere. Indeed, once the element of novelty has gone, there is even less to recommend about a piece whose vulgarity of means and choreographic weediness are very worrying. This Cyrano is ballet for people who can't be bothered with ballet. It is ballet as production ideas and mime; ballet as vampire, feeding from its interpreters; ballet as knock-about farce to a knock-about score. It is, ultimately, ballet on the terms of indifferent musical comedy - not Cole Porter, but Lloyd Webber. Wilfred Joseph's score does not stand up to a second hearing, with its fragmentary air and its blatancies - exact though it is in matching the choreography's failings. The design by Hayden Griffin succeeds in clouding the action in cloaks and ballooning breeches and long dresses whose tedious verismo is in marked contrast to the balletic savoir-faire shown by Nicholas Georgiadis in Mayerling and Manon. In a curious and disquieting way, this Cyrano places ballet - and the Royal Ballet in particular - in an aesthetic limbo, far removed from the obvious lineage which led from Petipa to Ashton and thence to MacMillan. It denies ballet as an art concerned with movement expressive or brilliant. Cyrano is production as justification for jokiness, posturing and sentimentality. Monday night's performance brought the debuts of Irek Mukhamedov as Cyrano, Viviana Durante as Roxane, and Stuart Cassidy as Christian. The young lovers were as beguiling as their roles allow, and I admire their artistry very much. Mukhamedov cannot give an indifferent performance, and he seeks to show Cyrano's inner life, but throughout the evening I was conscious that this was the great artist who could storm in glory as Ivan the Terrible, and Spartacus, and play with consummate sensitivity as des Grieux or Albrecht or Lescaut. His Cyrano is the merest shadow of these, and the fault is not Mukhamedov's. This week's performances mark the 20th anniversary of the Midland Bank Proms at the Opera House. Long may they continue, and long may the bank have our gratitude for such enlightened sponsorship.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian wool market drifted down a little from last week's slightly firmer levels, although again there was very little change in prices in terms of the local currency. Of dominant importance outside Australia was weakness in that currency against the US dollar, and the renewed weakness in the US dollar itself. Wool therefore again became cheaper to buy for practically all overseas users. The situation involves slow and very competitive trading throughout the trade. Recession continues to play a part, as do the final days of the main European holiday season.</p>

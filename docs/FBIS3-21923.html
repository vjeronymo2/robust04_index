During 1992, the  Mexican alkaloid accounted for approximately 23 percent of the  drugs circulating on the U.S. black market: a proportion lower  than 33 percent, the number reported in 1988. This announcement  was made yesterday by Manuel Quijano, vice chairman of the UN's  Internal Narcotics Inspection Board, upon submitting that  agency's annual report.    At a press conference, he added that, during the past three  years, a control program in Mexico also has reduced the illegal  opium poppy crops to their lowest index in 10 years. During  1992, the Mexican authorities reported the eradication of 11,583  hectares of opium poppy plants. According to reports, opium  production declined from seven tons in 1989 to four tons in  1992. [passage omitted]    The Mexican authorities seized 38.8 tons of cocaine in 1992.  It is estimated that 60 percent of the alkaloid entering the  United States from Colombia passes through Mexico. [passage  omitted]</p>

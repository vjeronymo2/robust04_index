			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / British Gas may opt for demerger BRITISH GAS's shareholders may be given shares in a new gas trading company, if the government forces the utility to adopt the recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that its trading business be divested. Mr Philip Rogerson, the group's finance director, said such a demerger was the most likely option, though British Gas had yet to carry out a detailed feasibility study. 'Other possibilities are a trade sale or a flotation to raise cash,' he said. He said the company would probably carry out any divestment much earlier than the MMC's deadline of the end of March 1997, provided this did not impose excessive costs. However no decisions will be taken until after the company holds negotiations with the government. These are not expected before September 6. Mr Rogerson expected Schroders, the merchant bank, would advise the company on the divestment strategy. Schroders advised British Gas on its submission to the MMC enquiry, whose conclusions were published last week. Other MMC proposals were that British Gas's monopoly over gas supply should be reduced in 1997 and removed no more than five years later. It also recommended a change in the pricing formula for household customers and said the company's pipelines should earn a return on assets of 4 to 4.5 per cent. Consumer groups have warned that implementation of the proposals could lead to higher prices. The company said they would lead to the loss of at least 20,000 jobs.</p>

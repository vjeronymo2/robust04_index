			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 25 May carries in its  regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the military  situation in the republic over the last 24 hours. Reception is  fair.    Reporting from Kalesija, Abdulah Ridjanovic says that  "yesterday evening the entire commune came under attack,  particularly from the direction of (Borogovo), from where  (?Cetkovice), Gornji Rajinci, and Lazarevici were shelled with  large-caliber howitzers. From the direction of (Dolina) and  Djukanovic Brdo the enemy fired 82-mm mortars at Kalesija and  the district of (Brdo). A fierce artillery attack was also  launched from the infamous Mt. Majevica on (?Vozuca) and Gornja  Hrasnica."    Muriz Kreho reports from Kladanj that "during the last 24  hours the southern and southeastern parts on this front came  under Chetnik artillery fire. From their strongholds in the  temporarily occupied areas of Olovo, Han Pijesak, and Vlasenica,  the Chetniks pounded our defense positions east of Karaula with  howitzers, tanks, and mortars. Their long-range artillery also  targeted the center of Kladanj. Dozens of large-caliber shells  were fired between 1620 and 2000, but fortunately there were no  casualties."    Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that  "during the night the united [Serbian and Fikret Abdic's  paramilitaries] aggressor kept firing with small arms and  antiaircraft weapons in the entire theater of operations of the  5th Corps and the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. On several  occasions they shelled the defensive positions on the  Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. During the night several artillery  shells were fired at Cazin and the outskirts of Bihac, while  members of Abdic's traitor paramilitaries attempted an infantry  breakthrough at Pecigrad."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "over the last 24  hours the Serbian aggressor fired with small arms, trying to  provoke the defenders' response. Yesterday evening the  aggressor fired a dozen 82-mm mortars from (Rogozar) at  (Jagodnjak). Our fighters, who have suffered no losses during  the last 24 hours, did not respond to the enemy fire."</p>

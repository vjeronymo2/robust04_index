			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Macedonia poll boycott urged Macedonia's nationalist opposition parties have called for a boycott of tomorrow's second round of parliamentary elections, accusing the government of electoral fraud in the first-round vote two weeks ago. Both the hardline Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement (VMRO), which lost support in the first round, and the newly founded Democratic Party are pressing for new elections. International monitors have said fraud was not widespread, but the official electoral commission admitted that 10 per cent of Macedonia's 1.3m voters were not included in constituency registers but said they would still be able to cast ballots. President Kiro Gligorov, comfortably re-elected in the first-round ballot, appealed to voters to participate, saying the former Yugoslav republic's record of a smooth transition to democracy was at stake. The former communist Alliance for Macedonia, backed by Mr Gligorov, said it won 32.1 per cent of the first-round vote compared with 14.4 per cent for VMRO and 11.2 per cent for the Democratic Party.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Prospect falls slightly to Pounds 4.02m Prospect Industries, which provides specialist engineering services to the power generating and process industries, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.44m to Pounds 4.02m for the year to end-September. The outcome was struck after a Pounds 283,000 charge relating to an abortive acquisition and a Pounds 713,000 loss arising from disposals and was struck on increased turnover of Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 52.5m) - including Pounds 594,000 (Pounds 6.69m) from discontinued operations. Comparatives have been restated to comply with FRS 3. At the operating level, profits from continuing operations showed an advance from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 5.42m. The interest charge fell from Pounds 588,000 to Pounds 366,000 and tax took Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.26m). The proposed final dividend of 0.525p (0.5p) makes a total of 0.8p (0.75p) and comes from fully diluted earnings of 1.12p (1.95p) per share. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 6m, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of about 10.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Investors reject Japan Tobacco in partial float Two thirds of the Japan Tobacco shares allocated in a partial privatisation of the monopoly cigarette company have been rejected by investors, further embarrassing the ministry of finance as it struggles to find the right formula for pricing equity offerings. Ministry officials said subscriptions to 284,037 shares, or 66.2 per cent of the 429,339 on offer to retail investors, were cancelled following a lottery for the right to subscribe. A second subscription round is now to be offered. The ministry runs the risk of falling up to Y408bn (Dollars 4.1bn) short of the Y958bn it had hoped to raise from the share issue. It is offering a total of 666,666 shares to individuals and institutions, representing a one-third stake in the company. At the issue price of Y1.438m per share, Japan Tobacco is valued at Y2,876bn. Trading in the shares is due to start on October 27. During the past two weeks, it became apparent that the issue was likely to run into trouble. The snub from investors has put the ministry under fire for the way it has managed initial public offerings. Last year's listing of East Japan Railway triggered a 20 per cent fall in the Tokyo stock market as mass sell orders depressed the stock, while Japan Telecom, the most recent public offering, has been trading 17 per cent below its IPO price. Payment for the second round of Japan Tobacco subscriptions is due on October 20, but brokers expect many of the stocks to remain unsold. Although the ministry's initial plan was to offer the unsold stock on the market on the day of the listing, it is now unlikely to do so for fear of further disruption to the stock market. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, yesterday tried to avert criticism by insisting that Japan Tobacco would be listed as scheduled on October 27. However, The ministry, which still owns a two-third stake in NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, is likely to postpone the planned sale of 500,000 shares in that company. The ministry had hoped to raise Y340bn.</p>

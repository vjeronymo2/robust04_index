Filatov and Akbulatov met in Moscow on Monday. According to  sources from Groznyy, arrangemenrs for a meeting between  presidents Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev were discussed.  The two presidents' meeting has been so far postponed for an  indefinite time, the sources said.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on mounting interest in Yuriy Skokov:  "Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Commodity Producers  (FCP), has makrkedly increased his activity of late. His  activity and particularly the FCP efforts aimed at softening a  sweeping production downturn, it seems, wins support not only  among industrialists and trade unions but also among  entrepreneurs, who until recently viewed him rather sceptically.  Interest in Skokov is also mounting in view of his intention to  run for the presidency in 1996".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the unlikelihood of a  Crimean-Ukrainian war.    "It is unlikely that there will be a war between the Crimea  and Ukraine in the coming days. At any rate, this is how it  looks like on the 45th day of Yuriy Meshkov's presidency in the  Crimea, although Defence Ministry officials in Kiev, in their  interviews with Ukrainian news media, increasingly often speak  about the need to stabilise the situation in the Crimea and  their readiness to restore order there by force.    "At a time when people are concerned about their future and  living standards disastrously decline, politicians often dream  about a war."    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the spectre of civil war in Russia:  "The spectre of civil war has been roaming Russia for several  years now. Presistence with which it is evoked is little  connected with the real living conditions but is closely linked  with the actions of some or other power and social structures.    "This time the phantom of civil war has arisen from the  State  Duma's political amnesty decision. The Duma was also the first  to try to neutralise the consequences of its own decision with a  memorandum of accord -- well aware, most likely, that peaceable  rhetoric will be just rhetoric but that political struggle will  gain in keenness, which would be dangerous to the country's  tranquility but beneficial to certain social forces.    "This is traditional for Russian life: a problem is brought  about and then everyone rushes to find a solution".    TRUD on businesses' disagreement with Russian state customs  committee decision to raise import duties.    Directors of 12 major commercial organisations engaging in  the import and marketing of food from abroad, have expressed  their disagreement with the state customs committee decision to  raise import duties.    "The reasons for such rejection are understandable: the  import of food has long become an indispensable condition for  the functioning of the consumer market in large cities".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an exclusive interview with U.S.  Secretary of Defence William Perry in Moscow.    The newspaper quotes Mr Perry as saying that he encountered  scepticism among some members of the State Duma about the  sincerity of the U.S. desire to maintain equitable cooperation  with Russia. In view of that, Mr Perry told Duma members that a  businesslike pragmatic partnership must be the two countries'  common objective.    PRAVDA runs an interview with prominent publicist Boris  Oleynik.    "Any provocateurs, hired under any contract, can march under  various banners -- red, golden-blue or other ones. The banners  are not to blame, but those who brandish them bear special  responsibility," Oleynik pointed out.</p>

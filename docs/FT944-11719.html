			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 27m buy for Jarvis Porter Jarvis Porter Group, the specialist label printer, yesterday announced a Pounds 27.2m acquisition alongside a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to August 31. Jarvis is to acquire Donprint, the Glasgow-based label printer which specialises in 'intelligent' or barcoded labels used in the computer and electronics industries. The consideration will be Pounds 24.7m, of which Pounds 13.7m will be financed through a placing of 5.17m shares at 265p each with a 3-for-23 clawback, Pounds 5m through the issue of 1.89m shares to the vendors, and Pounds 6m in cash. The shares closed up 1p to 283p. The cash will come from the company's own resources and existing banking facilities. There will be a deferred balance of up to Pounds 2.5m comprising Pounds 500,000 payable in cash on April 15 1995, Pounds 1m cash on August 7 1995, and up to Pounds 1m to be satisfied by the allotment of further ordinary shares to the Donprint Employee Trust. Jarvis, which supplies the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceuticals industries, reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.68m (Pounds 3.42m). Turnover rose 19 per cent to Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 28m), underpinned by a Pounds 4.13m contribution from three Dutch labelling companies acquired in May. Group operating profits rose to Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 3.54m), including Pounds 838,000 from acquisitions. Margins on continuing operations rose slightly from 12.6 to 13.4 per cent. Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, said the group was increasing market share in the current period as its multinational customers reduced the number of smaller suppliers. Cash flow had been strong, Mr Brewster said, and the group had ended the period with net cash funds of some Pounds 1m. Earnings per share emerged at 8.9p (7p) and the board announced an interim dividend of 1.9p (1.65p).</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dell seeks return to notebooks A year after withdrawing from the market for notebook personal computers, Dell Computer has introduced new products with which it aims to make a comeback in the fastest growing segment of the PC market. The products are critical to the future of Dell, which has been struggling to keep pace with larger competitors in the PC business. Last year, the company was forced to pull out of the notebook sector when quality problems emerged in its products. In a significant change of strategy, Dell put together an in-house design team, headed by a former Apple Computer executive. The first results of these efforts, unveiled yesterday, are two lines of notebook computers that look remarkably like Apple's popular Powerbook models. The new Dell notebooks offer longer battery life than most competing products and are aggressively priced. By using new lithium-ion battery technology, Dell's top-of-the-line Latitude XP, which is designed for corporate users with a starting price of Dollars 3,199, can work for six to eight hours before recharging, rather than three to five hours with conventional batteries. A lower-priced product line, available only in the US at present, will start at Dollars 1,399. The basic Latitude uses conventional notebook-computer batteries but allows users to pull out the floppy disk drive and substitute a second battery, offering six to 10 hours of use. Dell has an opportunity to make a comeback in the notebook market because leading suppliers, such as Compaq and IBM, are unable to keep up with demand, analysts said. However, Dell's re-entry may be hampered by the company's recent withdrawal from retail sales channels. It now sells only via mail and telephone orders.</p>

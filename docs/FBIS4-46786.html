			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Furmanyuk: "Who is Conducting the Orchestra"] </F>   [Text] One of the local newspapers, referring to the  results of parliamentary elections in Donbass, headlined that if  Ukraine wants to conduct an independent policy it will have to  separate itself from the eastern region. To wit: it is not  Donbass that should demand independence, it is Ukraine that  could be free of its obligations to the industrial region which,  if one is to believe the press, feeds and clothes itself, "it is  at the same time both the orchestra and the audience."    Such a super-radical view of the issue is gaining popularity  among the increasingly lumpen population mass. An eloquent  indication of that consist not only of the outcome of the oblast  referendum on the entry of Ukraine (read: Donbass) as a  full-fledged member into the CIS and a certain European Economic  Community, on a federative land structure of an independent  state and on the granting of the status of a second state  language for the Russian language, but also of the tactic that  was selected on the eve of new elections by leaders of the local  national-democratic organizations. For example, the kray Rukh  firmly decided to boycott elections to local organs of power  since there are no chances even for episodic breaks in the  communist party nomenklatura blockade. Therefore let the Reds  bear responsibility for the state of affairs in the stagnant  preserve. Igor Laponogov, a member of the presidium of the  oblast organization of social democrats and a former candidate  for people's deputies, was even more frank at one of the  democratic meetings: "We have no serious grounds for objecting  to the separation of Ukraine from Donbass if power there will  belong entirely to the communists."    Observers, however, are not in any hurry to assert that  after  elections to the local soviets from rural regions to the oblast  center the East is now colored in red. Yes, Vadim Chuprun,  chairman of the oblast soviet, in announcing his candidacy for  the post of chairman of the oblast soviet, made a point of  declaring restoration of membership in the Communist Party of  Ukraine, but his more sober-minded colleagues, heading the power  organs, so far have preferred not to hover up in the clouds, but  to stand firmly on the ground and rely on tested means:  executive structures, trade unions, state enterprises, and local  business. It is likely that they will be the ones able to  realistically count on victory, the more so since the so-called  "new" communists, whose ranks are swelling with pensioners  languishing for old prices, readily vote in the electoral  districts not for a bright tomorrow, but for the trash heap that  was removed and for several kilograms of charity food today.    That is why considerably greater interest is aroused not by  the reincarnated communist V. Chuprun, but by the outcome of the  duel between two other contenders for the governor's seat, two  people's deputies of Ukraine who are well-known businessmen in  the region, two individuals with the same name--Vladimir and  Yevgeniy Shcherbanya. It is unlikely that their programs will  differ any more than their names. The issue is something else:  who has the money and connections that will prove to be  strongest.</p>

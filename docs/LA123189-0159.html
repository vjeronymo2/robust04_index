			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MEMPHIS STATE GETS GILLED BY ILLINOIS  </P> <P> Kendall Gill scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds Saturday as fourth-ranked  Illinois defeated No. 15 Memphis State, 83-71, in the championship of the Old  Style tournament at Rosemont, Ill.  </P> <P> But it was Gill's defense that kept Illinois (10-0) undefeated.  </P> <P> Gill, a 6-foot-6 senior, was instrumental in holding Memphis State's Elliot  Perry to 17 points in a matchup of two of the country's best guards. Perry had  scored 33 in Memphis State's overtime victory over Ball State Friday.  </P> <P> "I don't think Perry hurt us that much," Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "We  did as good a job on Perry as you can do."  </P> <P> Gill said he wanted to keep Perry on the perimeter.  </P> <P> "I tried to not let him drive too much," said Gill, who was voted the  tournament MVP. "He's a good ballplayer. . . . I think he hurt himself a  little."  </P> <P> Memphis State Coach Larry Finch said Perry was fatigued after playing 43  minutes in the first-round game late Friday night. Perry, a junior, had to  leave the game with a leg cramp for 2 1/2 minutes in the second half as the  Tigers were trying to rally.  </P> <P> "We were a little tired . . . but that is no excuse for not playing up to our  ability," Perry said. "No matter how tired you are, you still have to go out  and play hard."  </P> <P> Marcus Liberty scored 25 points and Illinois held a 44-33 rebounding edge as  6-foot-7 center-forward Ervin Small had 17 rebounds.  </P> <P> Gill scored 16 points in the first half and Liberty added 12 as Illinois took  control early.  </P> <P> Memphis State's only lead came at the start on Todd Mundt's two free throws.  Illinois scored the next nine points before Memphis State closed to 18-13. The  Illini then went on a 14-5 run over the next six minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> No. 2 Kansas 83, Stanford 61 -- Jeff Gueldner sparked a 22-7 run as the  Jayhawks ended the Cardinal's nine-game winning streak by winning the BMA  Holiday tournament title at Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> Five minutes into the second half, Kansas (13-0) was ahead, 54-35.  </P> <P> No. 5 Michigan 107, E.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / EC stays on course for enlargement THE European Community yesterday said it was sticking to its optimistic schedule of bringing Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the Community by January 1995, just as it became clear at ministerial negotiations in Luxembourg that the hardest part of the enlargement talks has yet to begin. EC foreign ministers said they expected the negotiations with the four applicants to be concluded by next March at the latest, for entry by 1995. They have called an extra ministerial session with the four for next month, to try to make this date feasible. Privately, however, EC officials acknowledge that dates may slip. A conclusion by March would in any case be very tight, since all four countries have to hold referendums on entry. 'It's a question of political will,' one EC negotiator said, and of the applicants 'defining a decent period of resistance' to EC demands, for fear that their increasingly Euro-sceptical peoples will see their governments as a push-over in the negotiations if they settle contentious issues too quickly. Sweden is so far top of the class, having closed 10 of the 29 negotiating chapters for accession; Norway, which joined the negotiations some months after the others started in February, has only settled seven chapters. The areas agreed concern issues such as company law, social policy, and freedom of movement for workers. They mark the conclusion of a second round in the talks, after the four-month review of applicant country legislation concluded in June. In the third round, the Commission is expected to come up with draft proposals to resolve the most difficult issues in the next four to six weeks. All four want special regimes to continue paying lavish subsidies to their Arctic and alpine farmers, and in the Scandinavian case, to finance regional policies to keep their northern territories populated. All four also want to retain restrictions on foreigners buying holiday homes in their countries and to keep their generally higher environmental standards, which the EC may argue could constitute barriers to trade. Norway, in addition, has made clear it intends to keep control of its rich energy and fisheries resources, while Austria wants to carry over unchanged into its accession accord to the transit treaty regulating environmentally the flow of EC trucks through its alpine passes, agreed for the European Economic Area. If all these issues are resolved, the 12 and the four still have to agree on how the applicants fit into the foreign policy, security and home affairs arrangements of Maastricht, and on how much they should pay into the EC budget.</p>

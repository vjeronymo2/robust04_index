			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Duty should encourage LPG use in the UK Sir, The European Commission has accepted the case made by the European Autogas Association and has proposed minimum excise duties on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) of Ecu50 ecus per thousand litres compared with Ecu337 for leaded petrol, Ecu207 for unleaded and Ecu245 for diesel. These rates reflect the relative environmental damage caused by the respective fuels. I offer two examples of good practice which reflect this: i) In the UK LPG is the only fuel that fork-lift trucks powered by internal combustion engines are allowed to use when operating in a confined space. ii) In Tokyo taxis are supplied with factory fitted LPG tanks and gas carburettors by law. Petrol and diesel engines are not allowed. In many EC countries - France, Belgium and the Netherlands being the nearest examples - LPG is the cheapest road fuel available. Until Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, or his successor, reduces duties on LPG, in order to encourage its use, it will be difficult not to conclude that the environmental justification for across-the-board increases in road fuel duty is being used rather cynically.

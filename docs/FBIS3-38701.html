			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday was another [word indistinct] day in the  senseless war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 60 persons died  following a mortar explosion in Sarajevo's central market.  Another 150 persons were injured, many of whom are in critical  condition. Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alia Izetbegovic  accused the Serbs, whereas Radovan Karadzic, leader of the  Bosnian Serbs attributed the attack to a Muslim provocation in  order to establish a negative climate against the Serbs.    This murderous attack against noncombatants has been  strongly  condemned by the United States and other countries. In a  written statement yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher notes that his country will press for the United  Nations to specify soon who is responsible for the deadly attack  in Sarajevo. He also warned that air strikes by NATO should not  be ruled out once it is determined who is responsible. He  announced that he had a telephone conversation with his British  counterpart on the issue and will hold more deliberations with  other allied countries.    The French Foreign Ministry condemned yesterday's massacre  in  Sarajevo, saying that France feels horror and disgust. The  Italian and Belgian foreign ministers asked for specific  measures in reaction to the attack.    In the meantime, talks on ending the hostilities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will resume again. The Muslims will finally  participate in the talks, despite expressing reservations  yesterday.    Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators  on the Yugoslav dispute announced yesterday that the foreign  ministers of Greece, Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania,  Hungary, Italy, and Austria will meet Wednesday [9 February] in  Geneva to enforce the peace efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a  statement regarding the Geneva meeting, the Greek Foreign  Ministry notes that the Greek presidency of the European Union  [EU] intends to examine along with its partners at the EU  Council of General Affairs meeting, which will take place  Monday, the reason and usefulness of this meeting at this time.  According to the statement, Greece will insist on the principle  that only countries which have borders with the former  Yugoslavia should participate.</p>

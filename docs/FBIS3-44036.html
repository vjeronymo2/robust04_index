There has been a lull in fighting between the rival army  factions, but the situation in the capital remains tense. Five  soldiers have been killed so far.    The prime minister of Lesotho, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, confirmed  before the cabinet meeting that his government was considering  asking South Africa to intervene militarily, but said no final  decision had been taken yet.    A senior Commonwealth official is on his way to Lesotho to  assist the United Nations in finding a diplomatic solution to  the problem.</p>

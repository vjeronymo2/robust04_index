			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, patron of the Union  Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], chairman of the  State Law and Order Restoration Council, and commander in chief  of the Defense Services, addressed the opening ceremony of the  USDA executives management training course No. 2/94 held at 0900  today in the Union Hall of the Training Department of the  Central Public Relations Corps in Hmawbi. [passage omitted on  attendance]    Than Shwe expressed his pleasure at meeting the trainees and  said that the trainees need to act as full-fledged USDA members.  He explained in establishing an organization, the structure,  procedures, rules and regulations, and programs of the  organization have to be drawn up. He said if these structure  and procedures only exist on paper and the organization members  do not understand these procedures and structure, they will not  be able to successfully implement organization programs. He  said the training course on objectives, rules and regulations,  and programs, of the organization is to enable the executive  members to systematically implement, manage, and organize USDA  programs.    Than Shwe said the central level of the organization would  not be able to operate extensively at the grassroots level, and  that the course is to enable regional leaders to extensively  operate as full-fledged members at the grassroots levels. He  explained that the training course is being held to enable  executive members to coordinate work systematically among  themselves at various levels so that they would not carry out  programs on their own initiative. He said the course will  systematically train them in office and organizational work.  The trainees would also be taught in areas of general  knowledge, he said.    Than Shwe explained that the courses would be conducted by  cabinet ministers, directors general, and managing directors and  called on the trainees to study and observe subjects to be  taught and to ask questions if they do not understand. [passage  omitted]    He said once the course is completed, the trainees are to  carry out organizational work in their regions and that they  need to study in order to master their tasks. He explained that  although the USDA is a social organization, they need to master  organizational work because if they cannot effectively carry out  organization work, their organization would fall apart.  Therefore, he urged the trainees to study the curriculum  seriously so that they can put it into practice.    Than Shwe explained that following the events of 1988, there  has been a switch from a one-party system to a multiparty one,  and the economic system has been changed to a market economy.  He said the USDA is a social organization, which together with  the Defense Services, will provide guidance to ensure that the  union, which is formed by all national races, remains stable and  peaceful.    He said the SLORC is currently holding the National  Convention, which is aimed at developing a firm state  constitution. He said the new constitution would emerge when  the time comes and a new nation would then emerge. He added  that the SLORC is working for national reconciliation. He  explained that there had been no national solidarity and  stability and peace in the country since independence. That was  why armed organizations in the jungle are being invited to  return to the legal fold. The invitation is being extended not  because we have difficulties, but because we would like to carry  out development projects in areas where the armed organizations  have returned to the legal fold and where national races  previously had no rights to economic development, health,  education, and social development.    He said there has been considerable success in introduction  of the market economy and that the rate of economic growth was  10.9 percent in 1992-93 and 6 percent in 1993-94. He said  efforts would be made to maintain this growth to improve the  living standards of everyone, including workers and peasants. He  said that while we should strive for political stability and  national unity, we should also work for economic progress.    He said there should be harmony at the executive  organizations at various levels under the leadership of the  central organization, in striving to successfully implement the  objectives of the organization.    In conclusion, he called on the trainees to seriously study  the subjects taught in the course. The ceremony ended at 0925.  [passage omitted]</p>

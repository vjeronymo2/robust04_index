			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Opec agrees output ceiling to reverse fall in prices THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a new production ceiling yesterday which it hopes will reverse declining oil prices and persuade markets that members are determined to curb severe overproduction. The 12 oil ministers agreed that output in the fourth quarter of this year would be 24.5m barrels a day, slightly less than Opec's third-quarter peak, but well above the present official ceiling of 23.5m b/d. But they left the difficult issue of individual country quotas to further talks which yesterday were adjourned overnight. Oil markets reacted to the news with a modest price increase. Brent blend for November was about 20 cents higher at Dollars 16.45 in late London trading. The higher output ceiling reflects the expected increased demand toward the end of the year with the onset of the northern hemisphere winter. Analysts say the ministers also needed to set a higher figure to balance conflicting demands including: The need to set a ceiling which accommodated at least some of the demand for additional output by countries which have been overproducing, such as Iran and Nigeria. The desire to bring Kuwait back into the production ceiling mechanism, which it left earlier this year because it wanted a much higher quota. The need to send a signal to the markets that Opec has set a realistic production level at which any cheating could be kept to a minimum. The agreement on overall output came after Tehran Radio reported that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran had spoken by telephone yesterday on the need for higher oil prices. The two countries have long been at odds over quotas and market shares. But in common with other Opec states, they are suffering from sharply reduced revenues and have set a priority on reaching an agreement which the markets will see as credible. 'We are thinking in dollars and cents rather than in percentages,' said one Gulf Arab delegate. But there were signs last night that the task of allocating individual quotas could prove difficult. Mr Ali Ahmed Al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said his country had rejected an offer of 1.9m b/d. 'We want to be re-integrated, but not on any basis,' he said. Iran and Nigeria were also understood to be holding out for higher quotas. Saudi Arabia is understood to be sticking to its present output of 8m b/d while some smaller producers have agreed to a formula in which they receive only modest quota increases.

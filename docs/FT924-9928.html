			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The devil they know IT IS make-up-your-mind time for the American people. They are finding it difficult. A small minority will avoid the issue by plumping for Mr Ross Perot, who has no chance of winning. For most voters, however, the hard choice lies between President George Bush, the devil they know, and the still relatively unknown Governor Bill Clinton. Four more years of the former would differ from the past four years only if Mr Bush achieves effectiveness in domestic affairs. The outstanding characteristic of Mr Clinton is that no one can be certain of how he would behave in the White House. The principal distinguishing feature of a Clinton presidency is that it would be activist. The notion that government in general and the US federal government in particular should get itself involved in the revitalisation of the US has been predominant in the challenger's campaign. This is a promise  - some might say a threat  - that Mr Clinton would be well-placed to make good. If he becomes president he will be supported by a Democratic Congress. He will be able to get bills through. There would be an end to the 'gridlock' that has so stymied the efforts of the Republican President Bush. This has made it difficult for Mr Bush to get a fiscally prudent budget agreed, but the disadvantage is not all one way. The president is by inclination a minimalist; he wishes to reduce the role of the federal government. He has vetoed damaging interventionist bills originating in Congress. The danger is that a Clinton administration would do too much, and veto too little. Budget deficit Neither contender has a convincing programme for reducing the budget deficit. President Bush has once again taken the pledge against increased taxation. To renege twice would be careless. His proposals to cap social spending, such as on healthcare, are unconvincing. Governor Clinton's health reforms and reconstruction plans for the city centres can only be expensive. He would increase taxes on higher incomes, but that alone would be insufficient to reduce the overall deficit. Yet his underlying message is not that of a 'tax-and-spend liberal'. His proposed welfare reforms and his attack on the health industry's earnings sound tough. He has exercised tight control of the Arkansas administration. There is a clear choice on the environment. President Bush has led his government in a crusade against global green policies, as shown by the US stance at the Rio conference. Mr Clinton speaks of a more positive approach, and the enthusiasm of his running-mate, Senator Al Gore, is well-known. It may be assumed that under a Clinton presidency the US would become a positively inclined leader of international efforts to reduce future global warming. As to domestic pollution, US voters have to decide whether to vote for or against more extensive environmental regulation. Trade and security On matters of trade and security the differences are finely drawn, but not insignificant. President Bush rightly promoted the North American Free Trade Area and has tried to salvage the Uruguay Round. Some of Mr Clinton's advisers have protectionist instincts; the Democratic challenger has prevaricated over Nafta. The spirit of aggressive mercantilism stalks the Democratic party. It would be one of Mr Clinton's most important, most difficult and most unpopular battles to keep it at bay. The populist side of Governor Clinton also proposes to increase taxation of foreign-owned companies, although it is difficult to see how this squares with his experience of encouraging inward investment in Arkansas. Foreigners do not vote, except with their feet. In foreign affairs, there is usually a strong line of continuity in Washington but, compared with the president, Mr Clinton is pro-Israeli, overtly tougher on human rights in China, more supportive of Russian reform, and likely to cut US forces in western Europe more sharply, and sooner. From the outside world's point of view neither candidate seems like a potential Roosevelt, Truman or Eisenhower. The choice is between two professional politicians, neither with a wholly coherent programme. Clinton offers vigour, Bush continuity. It may not be an exciting choice, but nor is it a dangerous one.</p>

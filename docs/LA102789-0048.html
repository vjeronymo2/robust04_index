			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Keith Haring and William Burroughs? A partnership that sounds like Spy magazine  shenanigans actually makes a lot of sense. The 31-year-old artist's street  smart art turns out to be just the ticket to accompany brief works by the  75-year-old author known for his nightmarish visions of the drug underworld and  experimental prose style. The works in question are "Apocalypse," a breathless  prose poem studded with quotes from T. S. Eliot, and "The Valley," a chapter  from "The Western Lands."  </P> <P> Haring's 10 silk screens for "Apocalypse" achieve a blend of jejune  fancifulness, wild posturing and impudent borrowings from high culture -- much  in the same vein as Burroughs' contribution. On a sheet illustrating a passage  with the phrase "the Piper pulled down the sky," a figure whose head is the  "Mona Lisa" reworked into a staring, zonked-out face reaches up to pluck a  black net of scribbles from overhead.  </P> <P> "The Valley" is about a colony of people with great musical talent who are  trapped in a valley. They live largely on radioactive corn, which makes them  die horrible deaths -- a tacit invocation of the specter of AIDS. In his suite  of etchings, Haring's "graffiti" style gives the figures a rude, comic  book-mythic quality that is as transparently effective as Burroughs' fable.  (B-1 Gallery, 2730 Main St., to Nov. 15.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

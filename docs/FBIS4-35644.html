			<p>BFN     [Text] The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has reiterated  that the country should be firm in its stand on the Prithvi  missile test. The party spokesman, Mr. K.L. Sharma, said in New  Delhi today that there should be no question of shelving the  test. Referring to some reported remarks by the U.S.  ambassador-designate to India, Mr. Frank Wisner, Mr. Sharma  accused the United States of adopting double standards. He said  while the American Government helped Britain in carrying out its  Trident missile test, it is opposing India's Prithvi tests.</p>

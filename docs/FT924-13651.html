			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Rise in university student numbers EVIDENCE of the growing pressure of increased student numbers on universities comes with the publication today of the latest management statistics from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the Universities Funding Council, John Willman writes. The ratio of students to staff rose to 11.89 in 1990-91, almost 19 per cent higher than in 1984. The ratio varies considerably between subjects, ranging from an average of 9.4 in physics to 19.4 in accountancy. The figures cover the 52 'old' universities in the UK, excluding polytechnics that became universities this year. The proportion of university income that comes from student fees has increased from 9 per cent in 1989-90 to 16 per cent in 1990-91, while the direct grant from government has fallen from 48 per cent to 39 per cent.

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HORRIFIED' AT SIDEWALK GUN SALE  </P> <P> After the tragic shooting of the school children in Stockton, I found myself  seriously questioning the sanity of a society where people line up to buy the  type of weapon used in the shooting and (where) gun dealers brag about selling  out of these deadly weapons and having to order additional shipments.  </P> <P> Now I read that a sidewalk sale of these assault weapons was held in Pasadena  (Times, Feb. 16). As a resident of that city, I am horrified.  </P> <P> So this is what our "civilized" society is coming to? Surely this kind of  situation would not be tolerated in any other country. Can you imagine sidewalk  sales of assault weapons in London or Paris, Rome or Tokyo? But little Pasadena  is going to set an example for the world of what real freedom is -- the right  to buy something for which there is no use but murder!  </P> <P> I realize there are gun collectors who probably don't intend to use the guns.  However, at the risk of sounding paranoid, I must admit I sure wouldn't like to  live next door to someone who is heavily into collecting assault rifles.  </P> <P> I suggest that before we start having weekly sidewalk sales of semiautomatic  weapons, the concerned, responsible citizens of Pasadena get the message to  their city officials that we won't tolerate such a situation.  </P> <P> By passing the buck and saying that states, not cities, should be responsible  for banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons, our city  officials are catering to the greedy gun dealers who don't care where or to  whom they sell their deadly goods.  </P> <P> Until such time as state (and hopefully federal) legislation is enacted, let's  pass municipal legislation banning semiautomatic weapons. Let's also notify our  representatives and senators in Sacramento and in Washington that we've had  enough of this barbarity disguised as freedom.  </P> <P> One of our basic freedoms is the right to live without fear, and I feel that in  a society that condones sidewalk sales of assault rifles I'm being denied that  freedom.  </P> <P> CONNIE HASKELL  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley section of The Times welcomes all viewpoints from  readers about issues in the San Gabriel Valley.

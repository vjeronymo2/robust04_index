			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour move against VAT on fuel defeated Labour's attempt to overturn the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel was defeated by a government majority of 17 (321-304) in the Commons last night. Tory backbenchers who have criticised the new impost refused to join with Labour MPs in voting against it on the grounds that their amendment to the finance bill would have wrecked the entire Budget introduced in November. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast that Labour's campaign to discredit the Conservative party's claim to be the party of low taxation would boomerang by the time of the next general election. He told jeering Labour MPs that while they were 'sitting pretty' now, they would not be feeling so clever later on when they had to face the voters with their plans for increasing public spending on health, education and other projects. Mr Portillo insisted: 'There is an unbreakable link between what governments spend and what they must raise in taxation.' He met a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when he refused to accept that the Conservatives had won the last general election on a false prospectus, involving promises of further tax cuts. Mr Portillo condemned the refusal of Labour leaders to follow normal practice by negotiating a voluntary timetable for the discussion of the 417-page bill - the longest ever introduced to the Commons - and left little doubt that the government would use the parliamentary guillotine to curtail debate on its line-by-line committee stage. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said that the bill increased 12 significant taxes and represented a historic moment in British politics. It marked a decisive turning point against the Conservative party, clearly demonstrating that its pledges on tax cuts had been betrayed. To Labour cheers she told Conservative MPs that their integrity lay 'in tatters' and that they had nothing left. She firmly rebuffed Tory backbenchers who challenged her indictment by quoting the promises to cut taxes which they had made to their constituents. Ms Harman called on Tory backbenchers who had attacked the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel to vote for the Labour amendment. Mr Portillo argued that it was the natural instinct of the Conservative party to control public expenditure and reduce taxation, while Labour had a perpetual desire to increase spending and raise taxes. He said: 'Nothing since the last election changes the validity of that choice put before the British people.' Appealing to the loyalty of Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo warned: 'Our recovery will depend on a clear, sustained determination to take difficult decisions now in order to provide the basis for long-term prosperity.' Mr Portillo, pressed about the impact on the economy, endorsed the judgment of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that the recovery was strong enough to be proof against any pressures imposed by tax rises. The bill was given a second reading by a majority of 31 (327-296).</p>

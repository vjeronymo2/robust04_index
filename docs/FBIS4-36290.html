			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Dammam, 8 Jun (WAKH) -- [Former Yemeni Prime  Minister] Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has announced that  his country will ask the Sanaa government to pay war  reparations. He said that the northern Yemeni troops have  damaged the infrastructure in south Yemen and made thousands of  Yemenis homeless.    In a statement to the Saudi newspaper AL-YAWM published  today, al-'Attas expressed total amazement over the announced  number of losses among the northern troops, which was put at  613. Al-'Attas wondered whether this figure can be reasonable  [words indistinct], given the use of various kinds of mass  destruction weapons.    Al-'Attas welcomed the final statement issued by the  Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council, saying that  this statement reflects the GCC members' eagerness to safeguard  the security and safety of the Yemeni people in particular, and  those of the region in general.    Al-'Attas affirmed that Sanaa has no control over the  cease-fire decision [la tamluk qarar waqf itlaq al-nar]. That  is why it has procrastinated over the implementation of the UN  Security Council resolution, which demanded an immediate  cease-fire, and failed to honor it since it was announced the  evening before last.    Al-'Attas noted that the international recognition of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] will make Sanaa observe a  cease-fire.    He added that some 60,000 persons have been killed, while  the  number of people made homeless has exceeded 100,000.</p>

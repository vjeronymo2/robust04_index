			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> 3 MEN ARRESTED IN BANK ROBBERY  </P> <P> Three men were arrested Friday on suspicion of robbing a Bank of America branch  after a chase through North County, the Orange County Sheriff's Department  said.  </P> <P> Arrested were James H. Poland, 35, of Long Beach; George L. Heigel, 34, of  Carson; and driver Harold Jengins, 40, address unknown, said Sheriff's  Department spokesman Lt. Bob Rivas.  </P> <P> Rivas said that, according to witnesses' accounts, one of the three men  allegedly went into the bank about 9:25 a.m. and gave a teller a note demanding  money. Police did not disclose how much money.  </P> <P> After getting the money, the robber jumped in a 1985 Ford sedan and the three  suspects fled north along Beach Boulevard. As sheriff's deputies arrived at the  bank, Buena Park and Anaheim police spotted the getaway car and pursued it,  Rivas said.  </P> <P> At the intersection of Brookhurst Street and La Palma Avenue in Anaheim,  Jengins dropped off his two partners, who tried to run from police, Rivas said.  Poland, who was captured by Anaheim police, allegedly threw a bag of money as  he took off running. Heigel gave himself up to Buena Park police and turned  over another bag of money, Rivas said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Jengins had driven to the Santa Ana Freeway. While exiting the  freeway at Valley View in La Mirada, Jengins spun out of control and hit a  truck. Additional money was found on the floorboard of the truck, Rivas said.  </P> <P> No weapons were found either on the men or in the vehicle, Rivas said.  </P></p>

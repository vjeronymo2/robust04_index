			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lawyers galore - Ballot Box No fewer than 160 lawyers are standing for parliament this time round - surely a record no other profession can match. As has traditionally been the case, 'M'learn'd friends' outnumber 'Messrs Inter Alia'. There are 91 barristers standing (61 Tories, 20 Labour and 10 Lib Dems), compared with 69 solicitors (42 Tories, 14 Lib Dems, 11 Labour and two Plaid Cymru). Why so many? The Bar has always been regarded as a sound platform for a career in politics - largely it seems because the courts rise at 4.30pm, allowing just enough time for the aspiring politician to nip down from the Temple to Westminster for important debates. Advocacy in one place goes with advocacy in another. It is less obvious why so many solicitors are attracted. Still, the Law Society is taking full advantage. It has produced a 46-page election special covering a range of issues from legal-aid pay to the role of solicitors in developing legislation. Prospective legal parliamentary candidates are expected to take them up.</p>

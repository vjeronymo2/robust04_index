			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Sonic boost for Rocket Rocket Science Games has moved onto the multimedia scene as one of the most promising start-up companies in the growing market for interactive computer games, writes Louise Kehoe. This week the Silicon Valley company got cash backing from Sega Enterprises, the Japanese video games company, Sega's venture firm CSK Ventures, and Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), the German music and entertainment group. Together these have invested Dollars 12m. Rocket's launch team exemplifies the trend to splice Silicon Valley with Hollywood. The company's game developers are drawn partly from the computer industry and partly from the movie business. Steven Blank, Rocket president and chief executive, is quick to point out, however, that the much talked about notion of blending talent from these disparate cultures is easier said than done. 'The 'Hollywood type' is potentially the kiss of death (for an interactive entertainment developer), if you find the wrong one,' he says. 'We don't have fancy Hollywood directors or actors. The people we have are out of the special effects business.' Rocket will introduce its first two games in time for Christmas sales this year. Its games will combine the rich graphics of CD-ROM - the computer cousin of the music CD - with the fast action of cartridge video games, Blank says. Until now, these attributes have been mutually exclusive because CD-ROMs are relatively slow and video game cartridges have limited capacity to store complex graphic images. Rocket has developed technology it calls 'Game Science' that speeds up the performance of CD-ROMs by organising the layout of data on the disk so that the next image required in a game can be quickly located. Unlike most game developers, Rocket will offer games to run both on personal computers and on Sega CD video game machines. Sales of games that play on video game machines reached Dollars 5.3bn last year, while sales of computer games were only about Dollars 800m, so the dual approach is a necessity, Blank says. Even before it launches its first products, Rocket is winning wide attention. 'The best buzz in Silicon Valley at the moment is about Rocket Science,' says Lee Isgur, a multimedia analysts with Volpe, Welty in San Francisco.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Liffe plan for lira futures THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) is developing a futures contract on Italian government bonds. If plans to launch the contract later this year go ahead, it will be the first futures contract denominated in lira. The exchange has completed a feasibility study, according to Mr Michael Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive. 'Our aim is to have some sort of co-operation with the Italian authorities,' he said. The contract would be based on Buoni del Tesoro Poiennali (BTPs), domestic government bonds of a type with maturities between four and 10 years. The Italian government bond market is the third largest in the world, after Japan and the US. However, it ranks much lower in turnover, as much of the market is held by small domestic investors, and high proportions of instruments are short-dated and floating-rate. However, the Italian government has begun to extend the maturity profile of its debt. Since the beginning of March, the government has issued L10,000bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of 10-year BTPs in three tranches. The Italian authorities also last month eased procedures for the reclaiming of withholding tax for foreign investors. It is expected that the tax will eventually be abolished. The Italian bond market has attracted considerable overseas investment this year, partly due to such measures. Total turnover in BTPs is believed to be in the region of L3,000bn daily. About 40 per cent of that business is believed to be conducted in London.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, the ruling coalition's candidate to succeed Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, said Friday [22 April] that if elected  premier, he wants to create a country that could win  international trust.    Hata told a joint press conference with leaders of coalition  parties that he will do his best to make Japan a nation of "high  quality" which could be internationally trusted, understood and  loved.    Calling himself "an inexperienced person" who hesitated to  shoulder the burden of leading the nation, the 58-year-old Hata  said, "but considering the support and the hardships of  everyone, I decided to accept the recommendation, feeling my  body tremble."    Prior to the news conference, the heads of the coalition  parties endorsed a policy platform for a new cabinet and chose  Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as their  candidate for prime minister.    Hata is expected to win the election for the premiership in  plenary session votes of the House of Representatives and the  House of Councillors on Monday.    The second coalition administration, led by Hata, will be  launched later Monday.    The coalition agreement to field Hata, who is also deputy  prime minister in the Hosokawa administration, followed weeks of  wrangling over two vital policy issues -- tax reform and  national security.    On April 8, Hosokawa, who became premier last August,  abruptly announced he will resign to take responsibility for  stalled Diet business over his alleged involvement in financial  scandals.    Hata said he does not think there are cracks in the ruling  coalition although the parties took two weeks to narrow  differences over policies. The two weeks of debates were  "meaningful," Hata said, because discussions on such matters as  tax reform had to be done anyway by the end of June.    Hata also pointed out the need to enact the fiscal 1994  budget as early as possible.    He said that although the ruling parties come from different  backgrounds, the Hosokawa government was able to overcome  various difficult problems, such as those involving the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks and electoral reform.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party,  said he recommended at the meeting of heads of parties earlier  in the day that Hata is the "most suitable" person to succeed  Hosokawa. The leaders of the parties unanimously agreed to  field Hata as the candidate, he said.    Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, said  Hata is the most suitable considering his personality, knowledge  and ability.    Komeito chairman Koshiro Ishida said the new government's  main theme is to push ahead with reforms and an early enactment  of the budget.</p>

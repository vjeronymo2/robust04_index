			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Italian party looks to past for new image THE leader of Italy's Christian Democrats (DCs), Mr Mino Martinazzoli, has managed to paper over internal splits in the party as it prepares to adopt a new, but as yet ill-defined, identity. A four-day assembly, ending in Rome on Monday night, gave Mr Martinazzoli full authority to organise a congress before the end of the year at which the Christian Democrats are expected to approve a new name: the Popular party. This harks back to Italy's first mass Catholic party, dissolved in 1926 with the onset of fascism and internal divisions. The change, while maintaining the old party symbol, underlines Mr Martinazzoli's attempt to 'renew without denying the past'. The assembly provided few clues as to how the party, formed in 1942, intended to recover the allegiance of voters disillusioned by the Christian Democrats' long-standing abuse of power. Partial local elections in June showed their vote at below 20 per cent. Preserving unity and ignoring the large number of prominent members involved in corruption scandals seemed more important than agreeing a political platform. The assembly dodged the issue of the 'renewed' party's place in the political spectrum. Mr Martinazzoli, leader since last October, argued that the new party should be centrist with strong Catholic roots. Italian independent road hauliers yesterday called off a strike which had threatened to throw the country into chaos, Reuter reports. They accepted a package of tax breaks and tariff increases at a meeting with the prime minister.</p>

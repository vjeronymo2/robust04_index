			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Travellers on a well-trodden road to ruin: In the wake of yet another tour industry failure, FT reporters investigate pitfalls facing the holidaymaker AS police and liquidators sift the records of the Land Travel coach company, which collapsed last week, one thing is certain: it will happen again. If not this summer or autumn, then next year or the year after. As long ago as 1871, the British newspaper, The Graphic, observing the beginnings of package tourism, prophesied: 'A time will come when vast numbers of the population will be carried enormous distances for ridiculous sums.' Today, the British buy 20m foreign holidays every year, many for sums so ridiculous that the companies offering them go out of business. The system that delivers this service is inherently unstable, making periodic collapse inevitable. The cost of setting up as a tour operator is low and the temptation to cut prices is ever-present. The effects of war, epidemics and hurricanes drive some out of business. Fraud and foolishness account for some others. Systems could be devised to ensure that travellers and would-be tourists do not lose their money, as an estimated 50,000 Land Travel customers have done. Even under Mr Michael Heseltine, however, the Department of Trade and Industry is too averse to intervention to license all tour operators and ensure proper monitoring. Land Travel was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) or of any other organisation offering a money-back guarantee. The government says it intends to require companies like Land Travel to arrange guarantees for their custo-mers. Companies taking customers by road and ferry will be able to subscribe to a reserve fund, along the lines of the existing fund for air passengers. But belonging to the surface travel reserve fund will not be compulsory. Companies that remain outside the fund will have their customer guarantees monitored by trading standards officers rather than experienced travel organisations. Those who remain in the travel business fear collapses almost as much as those who fall victim to them. The business is concerned with management of two things: cash and confidence. Wreck confidence in the travel business or in a particular company and the cash will disappear. Customers will no longer provide it, and previously indulgent hoteliers, airlines and coach operators will come knocking at the door, demanding payment earlier than previously envisaged. A travel company on the point of collapse exhibits characteristics which many in the business recognised in Land Travel. In its last two months, it appeared to be taking in customers' payments with the sole objective of paying off immediate debts. Mr Noel Josephides, a director of the operator Sunvil Holidays and chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, says: 'They were selling for Pounds 59 a tour that was probably costing them twice that. They were getting cash to pay debts they already owed.' Land Travel's reputation was not high even before the troubles of recent months. Coach and Bus Week, a trade publication, began reporting in 1990 on the company's tendency to pay suppliers late. Land Travel's brochures were adjudged to contain substantial inaccuracies. That is not unique to Land Travel. A report in Holiday Which? magazine earlier this year criticised the brochures of the UK's three biggest travel companies  - Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours. A common deficiency was an inability to gauge accurately the distance between hotels, beaches and shops. Complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about Land Travel, however, disclosed an inventiveness remarkable even by the standards of the holiday industry. One traveller complained that a tour of central and eastern Europe was to have included optional excursions to Prague and Krakow, but that those had not been available. Land Travel, the ASA said, 'stated that the hotel location had been found to be too far for the excursion to Prague and that it had not been possible to arrange visas in time to offer the excursion to Krakow'. Land Travel did not own any coaches, relying instead on outside contractors. In spite of the company's reputation for late payment, coach companies continued to work for it. Some coach operators who worked for Land Travel are reluctant to admit that they lost money and asked for their names not to be mentioned. One who agreed to talk was Mr Keith Davies, a partner in Pat's Coaches of Wrexham. 'We worked for them for two months,' he said. 'Their reputation preceded them in the industry. A lot of people didn't trust them. We told them we wanted cheques up-front, post-dated for 10 days. A lot of others were working on the basis of 30 days or 45 days. Two of our coaches were out at the time (of the collapse). Three of their cheques bounced.' Liquidator Grant Thornton is still not sure what precipitated the final crisis at Land Travel. What is clear, however, is that, as rumours of trouble grew, they became, to some extent, self-fulfilling. P&amp;O European Ferries demanded that Land Travel pay it in advance. When it became clear that the company did not have the money, P&amp;O refused to take any more bookings. The likelihood of further Land Travels has increased rather than decreased in recent years as a result of changes in booking patterns and traveller preferences. One of the attractions of the business has always been the favourable cashflow. Customers generally pay for their holidays before the operator has to pay for airline seats and accommodation. Travel has traditionally been a good field for an under-capitalised entrepreneur. Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, points out that all a new tour operator needs is a computer reservation system and some telephones. If the operator can get a charter airline or coach company to allocate him some seats and can find the customers to fill them, he is in business. As long as the customers keep booking, the business can carry on growing. The period between customers paying and suppliers demanding payment meant new companies could earn healthy amounts of interest. Over the past decade, that opportunity has diminished as customers have begun to book later, waiting for discounts. Ten years ago, a third of all package holidays for the following year were already sold by Christmas. The proportion has now dropped to less than a quarter. British holidaymakers also show a growing preference for self-catering accommodation rather than hotels. Tour operators generally pay for hotel beds only if used. Self-catering accommodation usually has to be paid for whether used or not. Mr Rothwell believes that efforts to protect the holidaymaker could, in fact, make operator failure more likely. Companies that belong to the reserve fund will know their customers are fully protected, he says, and that might encourage them to take even bigger business risks. The new trust fund, he adds, 'could just be a bigger pot for people to go bust in'.</p>

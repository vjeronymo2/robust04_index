			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, hounded by a controversy over his financial deals and  a stalemate in the Diet, announced Friday [8 April] he is  stepping down to take responsibility for the current political  confusion.    Hosokawa officially offered his resignation to an emergency  cabinet meeting after he made a surprise announcement to the  hastily summoned leaders of the coalition partners, coalition  officials said.    Hosokawa, explaining his decision to the coalition leaders,  cited the stymied Diet business due to scandal charges over his  two dubious financial deals.    He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his  personal financial management. He did not specify the issue.    It is not known when the cabinet will resign en bloc, the  officials said.    Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to  clean up corruption, has been under attack over a shady loan  from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm,  and the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  [NTT] Corp., a telecommunications giant.    The row over the deals have led to a stalemate in  parliament,  paralyzing the deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994,  which started April 1.    Hosokawa's public approval rate, which hit 70 percent  immediately after he took the helm, has been plummeting in  recent weeks, according to various media surveys.    Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is  viewed among many coalition members as the most plausible  candidate to succeed Hosokawa.    Hosokawa made the announcement only two days after a media  frenzy over reports on his joking about quitting, which Hosokawa  strongly denied.    The dogging corruption charges concerning the financial deal  makings have taken a heavy toll on Hosokawa's public support and  undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party  coalition, political sources said.    Hosokawa reiterated at a meeting with the coalition leaders  that he repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and  dismissed any corruption charges over an NTT share purchase,  which the premier has claimed was a deal by his late  father-in-law.    But he said he should take the responsibility for the  current  Diet turmoil that has been caused by his personal affairs.    The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has been boycotting  the debates at the House of Representatives Budget Committee,  demanding a Diet testimony of Hosokawa's former aide, who was in  charge of his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from  Sagawa.    Revelations that Sagawa was at the center of a  money-and-mobster scandal involving some LDP members helped  topple the party from power after nearly four decades of  often-corrupt rule, and paved the way for Hosokawa's alliance of  conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional opposition  parties like the Social Democratic Party (SDP).    Pursuing his avowed goal of cleansing the nation's politics  of corruption, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform  package in January that replaces multiseat districts with a  combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation seats.    But his political standing was weakened after he was forced  by strong opposition from within his own coalition to withdraw  his announced plan to introduce a new value-added tax to replace  the current consumption tax.    Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco  and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the  hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura.    Hosokawa's announcement Friday took both coalition partners  and the opposition camp by surprise although speculation has  been rife over his resignation.    Foreign Minister Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), told reporters he had heard nothing about Hosokawa's  intention.    Asked if he was surprised, Hata said, ''of course.''    Michio Watanabe of the LDP, a former foreign minister, said  he was surprised at the prime minister's abrupt decision.    Coalition leaders are still uncertain about the issue of  Hosokawa's successor, but some Shinseito officials mentioned  Hata.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said the coalition partners  will immediately start discussing a replacement to avoid any  political vacuum.    Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election  affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa.    "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's  premiership," he said.</p>

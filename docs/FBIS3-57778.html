			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Britain is on the road to more jobs and prosperity  and "it is time to put the pessimists in their box," the Prime  Minister said in an upbeat New Year message today.    John Major, in a wide-ranging letter to the chairmen of  constituency Conservative parties, also underlined the  Government's determination to crack down on crime, to reform  education and to bring peace to Northern Ireland.    He insisted that the Tories remained the only party of low  taxation and vowed that criminals would be made to pay for their  crimes.    He also denounced those with "fashionable attitudes" about  education which were light years away from common sense.    On the economy, he said: "As we start the New Year we can  look forward with far greater confidence to a strengthening  recovery -- and to the steady growth in jobs and prosperity that  will come with it.    "After a difficult period for many people, we now have a  tremendous opportunity before us. We are seeing  stronger-than-expected growth combined with lower-than-expected  inflation.    "It is time for us to be more confident as a country. To put  the pessimists in their box. And to look at the opportunities  before us and how to take them."    He added: "The plain fact is that we are leading Europe out  of recession and we must build on the advantages that gives us.    "I want to build our recovery on sound foundations. I want a  recovery that lasts."    He said the Government had to bring the books back into  balance and although it had to raise revenue it had not put up  income tax rates.    "The Conservative Party remains the party of the lowest  possible tax and the only party whose instinct is to cut tax and  leave money with individuals and families and not take it for  the state.    "We raise taxes only when we have to. They (opposition  parties) raise taxes whenever they want to."    The Prime Minister said there would be tough new measures  against crime and legislation to return to traditional teaching  methods.    "Never before has such a comprehensive effort been launched  to ensure that we prevent crime, that we catch criminals and  that the guilty are convicted and punished."    He added: "Our intention is to ensure that crime won't pay  --  but criminals will."    Mr Major said children had to learn at school the basic  skills they would need in later life.    As well as lessons to read and write and do sums, "they have  to learn self-respect, respect for others and respect for  authority."    "Every child at school should be taught good discipline and  good self-discipline. Good order brings good learning," said Mr  Major.    "Orderly classrooms, clear timetables, regular tests,  homework, team sport and uniforms -- all these have a part to  play in giving a sense of purpose and self-discipline to pupils.    "I do not believe such ideas are old-fashioned. I believe  they are essential -- and so do millions of parents."    He stressed that children had to learn the difference  between  right and wrong. "If children are brought up in a moral vacuum,  can it be any surprise if they later go off the rails?    "If we spend more time making excuses rather than  apportioning blame, is it any wonder if young people can no  longer tell right from wrong, but see everything through a kind  of haze?"    He said many of the attitudes that took root in the 1960's  and 1970's were very tolerant. "I admire tolerance...but if  taken too far it does destroy standards. I believe there is a  danger of that.    "Many fashionable attitudes are light years away from the  common sense instincts of the British people -- and those we now  have to challenge.    "And with our campaign to go Back to Basics, that is what we  will be doing -- in our schools, criminal justice system, our  welfare system and in the field of social work."    On Northern Ireland, Mr Major repeated that so long as the  majority wanted to remain within the UK they had a rock-solid  constitutional guarantee that they could do so.    "We also sent a clear message to the men of violence -- `If  you lay down your arms -- and prove you mean it -- then the way  will begin to open for Sinn Fein to come to the negotiating  table.'    "We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus  is on Sinn Fein to pick it up. There is no excuse and no  justification for them not to choose the path to democracy."    The Prime Minister added: "I do not know whether the coming  year will bring peace in Northern Ireland. But I hope and pray  it does."    He claimed that in local government Labour and Liberal  Democrat councils were getting away with monumental waste and  incompetence, and said this year's elections to the European  Parliament were especially important.    "We must send a signal that we want to carry on with the  kind  of agenda in Europe that Britain has been pushing.    "After June 9, I want to see more Conservative MEPs  representing Britain's interests in the European Parliament.  That is why we will fight these European elections harder than  we ever have before."</p>

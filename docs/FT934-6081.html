			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / It's make or break time The Budget on Tuesday will have little to do with the economy. It will be about political survival. So do not search this space for money-making or money-saving tips about what will be in the chancellor's package, let alone the likely market reaction to this tax or that spending cut. If I could divine these things I would not be here; I would be George Soros. Economic forecasting is impressive when its author makes billions out of it. The rest is guesswork. Politics is another matter. We can safely assume that what Mr Kenneth Clarke has to say on Tuesday will, if he gets it badly wrong, break the government. Getting it right may not save the present administration, but it would at least make political recovery possible. In short, the chancellor has direct responsibility for carrying out part 'B' of Mr John Major's plan to regain his authority and stay prime minister. Part 'A', has been to survive, by whatever means necessary, until the Budget. This has succeeded, albeit at the cost of some unpleasant tacking towards the hard-faced Right. The second part of the strategy will be revealed next week. Our Cheeky Chappie chancellor will try to look the part as he reads out familiar polysyllabic phrases whose real meaning will not be lost on anyone. He will talk about reducing the public sector borrowing requirement, and possibly even about rebalancing fiscal and monetary strategies. You can ignore all that. Concentrate on the overall performance. 'We are not fools,' his jargon will be saying. 'The government is not incompetent,' his elaborate analyses will imply. Many audiences - his own backbenches, economic analysts, the markets - will be expected to concur. The purpose will be to recover the Conservatives' lost reputation for superior economic management. Mr Clarke knew when he took the job at the beginning of the summer that this would take some doing. Yet if the trick can be managed, both the chancellor and Mr Major will be on firmer ground. We are assured by a clutch of indicators that we can look forward to at least a year or so of steady growth and low inflation. If so, the Conservatives might begin to recover popular approval. It would be wrong to take Tory optimism too far, but perhaps the party might even unite in support of the government. Well, most of the party anyway. Its performance in next year's local and European parliamentary elections could in consequence be less awful than is currently anticipated. Mr Major, written off so often since Britain's ejection from the exchange rate mechanism, would be safer. It is against this background that the pre-Budget arithmetic should be rehearsed. Mr Clarke has consistently intimated, in both public and private, that a deficit of Pounds 50bn is unacceptably high. Not everyone, least of all the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, goes along with this, but let us stick with the chancellor's known opinion. He has also maintained, without wavering, that the public spending ceilings agreed before he took the job are low enough - that there is little if any room for a squeeze on expenditure greater than was envisaged by his predecessor. If these two Clarke propositions remain constant until next week, and if no sudden improvement in the PSBR is detected by a compliant Treasury computer, taxes must be increased. At this point the government's nerve will be tested. If it fails to raise taxes by a convincing amount the economic competence argument will be lost, at least to those for whom 'sound money' is an article of faith. If it does increase taxation the new imposts will be piled on top of the mountain of tax imposed by Mr Norman Lamont in the March Budget. The Conservative election campaign of April 1992, already exposed as bogus, would come to be fixed in the public mind as the shamelessly misleading undertaking it was. In March, within a year of promising low taxes, Mr Major's government imposed the biggest single wallop of extra taxation anybody can recall. Pile on more agony next week and people may begin to ask a fatal question - if Tories, like Labour, devalue the currency and balloon up taxes, why not elect Labour in the first place? The question would have less force if the Budget had been preceded by proper public debate. The necessity for this or that measure might then be more widely understood. The move to a 'unified' tax and spending statement is merely a piece of camouflage. This year's spending negotiations were, as ever, Treasury-led. The new procedure introduced last year has not produced serious debate among colleagues about priorities. It was designed to ensure collective responsibility for cuts forced on departmental ministers. Taxation is not directly related to spending plans, but to the Treasury's perception of what is needed to steer the economy, as amended by what is required to keep the government in office. The real decisions are made in secret by a handful of ministers and officials. Supposed moves towards open government are not to be taken seriously. Treasury ministers do now appear in public ('ending pre-Budget purdah'). The governor of the Bank of England can decide when to announce the chancellor's decisions. A committee of outside economists is 'consulted' by Mr Clarke. These are gestures. They do not affect the substance of decision-making. They do not allow for the additional wisdom that might accrue if the Budget was issued as a green paper in advance of the real thing. The chancellor is merely flashing an ankle, revealing nothing. The same principle, incidentally, is being applied to Britain's spies, whose existence, headquarters, and directors have recently been named - without making us much the wiser. In a rational world we would have seen the back of the Tories by now. In reality they have nothing to fear but a Labour party led by Mr John Smith. Voters know that Labour stands for spending. That is its attraction. Mr Smith says that closing tax 'loopholes' would bring in Pounds 10bn to the Treasury. This, he would have us believe, is not like the Conservatives' additional taxation. The government can punch aside such complicated and disingenuous notions without visible effort. When assessing the Tories' chances of staying in office, and winning again, ask yourself this: which party is the better liar?</p>

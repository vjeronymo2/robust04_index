			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central  Committee Propaganda Department, the Press and Publications  Administration, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General  Administration of Customs, the State Administration for Industry  and Commerce, and the State Copyright Administration recently  issued a joint circular urging strengthened control over the  duplication of audio and video laser discs, as well as strict  investigation into and severe punishment for copyright piracies.    In light of the current rather chaotic situation in China's  audio [compact disc] and video laser disc production and market,  which see copyright infringement to a certain extent, the CPC  Central Committee Propaganda Department and the six other  departments demand that the audio and video laser disc  duplication business be put under the jurisdiction of  departments directly related to the industry. All audio and  video laser disc duplication businesses must go through the  Press and Publications Administration's examination and obtain  its approval and be put under day-to-day administration by the  Press and Publications Administration as well as local  administrative departments charged with the overseeing of the  audio and video industry. Audio laser disc production lines  already set up without the Press and Publications  Administration's examination and approval are subject to a  full-scale check conducted jointly by the relevant departments  and the provincial, regional, and municipal administrative  departments in charge of the audio and video industry which are  supposed to simultaneously submit their inspection comments to  the Press and Publications Administration and those specifically  on foreign-invested enterprises to the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation by the end of May 1994. Those which  are found to be operating without the necessary conditions or  seriously violating laws and regulations will be given a  deadline for rectifying their mistakes, and those failing to  meet the requirements by the deadline will be ordered to stop  production in accordance with the law. The seven departments  demand strict investigation into and severe punishment for  piracies; the conscientious protection of the legitimate rights  and interests of copyright holders, publishers, and consumers;  and the immediate organization of a force to seriously clean up  the audio and video market. After copyright piracy or illegal  duplication is exposed, joint efforts should be made along with  local copyright departments and administrations for industry and  commerce to immediately rectify or investigate and punish the  wrongdoing in accordance with the law. Various customs  departments should strengthen the examination of imported  modules for audio and video laser discs and of their finished  products exported in bulk.</p>

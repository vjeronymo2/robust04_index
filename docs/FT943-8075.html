			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / M4 weakness may help delay base rate rise Mixed figures on bank lending yesterday gave a confused picture of the strength of credit demand. The annual growth rate of M4, the broad measure of the money supply, fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent in July from 5.6 per cent in June, according to the Bank of England. This is well towards the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range for M4. Between June and July M4 grew a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent. M4 growth is one of the leading inflationary signs monitored by the Bank and its weakness may further tilt the argument against an imminent increase in the base rate. However, sterling lending to the M4 private sector, which consists of all UK residents apart from banks, building societies and the public sector, was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.4bn in July. That is higher than the Pounds 1.6bn average recorded during the first six months of the year, although down from Pounds 2.9bn in June. British Bankers Association figures, which are compiled on a different basis from the Bank of England statistics, showed that UK banks had increased their lending in July to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 982m in June. The association said consumer credit grew a modest Pounds 51m in July. The increase meant, however, that consumer credit had risen for four consecutive months for the first time since 1991. Lending continued to be strong to the financial sector, which borrowed Pounds 687m in July. Securities dealers, which borrowed heavily late last year but which have been repaying debt since the collapse of the bond market in February, borrowed Pounds 392m last month. Non-financial companies, however, continue to be reluctant to take on debt. The manufacturing sector repaid Pounds 255m of debt in July after borrowing Pounds 148m in June. Mr Don Smith, economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'Lending appears to be recovering at last but the progress looks very tentative. These figures do not yet exude the confidence they should for this stage of the economic cycle.' Sales of machine tools rose in the second quarter but were below their pre-recession peak, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The volume of machine tools sales in the three months to June was 11 per cent higher, on a seasonally adjusted basis, than in the first three months of the year. Compared with the second quarter of 1993, however, sales were only 2.8 per cent ahead, and about one-third below their 1990 levels. Export sales rose 13.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in volume terms, while home sales increased 9.6 per cent. Total orders on hand for machine tools showed a 2.4 per cent increase over the quarter but were 20.2 per cent down on June 1993. Letters, Page 12</p>

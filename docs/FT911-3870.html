			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Technically Speaking - Software directive makes users losers Computing policy is undoubtedly too important to be left entirely to the technical experts, but problems arise when officials and politicians try to resolve arguments between differing computer factions without fully understanding the implications of their actions. Look at the current state of affairs resulting from Brussels' seemingly meritorious efforts over the past couple of years to protect suppliers of computer software from piracy, a mess compounded by the peculiar procedural requirements of the European Parliament. To recap briefly. Two years ago, an EC directive was drafted with the aim of harmonising measures to outlaw software piracy across the member states. It specifically forbade unauthorised reverse engineering - analysing a piece of software to understand what its does and how it does it. That proposal was flawed in that while reverse engineering is used by software pirates, it is also a key technology for computer manufacturers. They need to be able to attach their equipment to that of their competitors; computer users have to be able to modify and extend their existing software. It is unlikely the authors of the draft fully understood the implications of their work. The directive suited PC software suppliers and the larger manufacturers - namely IBM and Digital Equipment - but outraged their smaller competitors and customers. The competitors, including Groupe Bull and Olivetti, formed a lobby called the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS); users formed the Computer Users of Europe. There was a second dimension. IBM and Digital saw the directive as a way of defending their software against the Japanese. The issue became a war or words fought between the US and Japan in the cockpit of Europe. Commissioners in Brussels and Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg are by now no doubt heartily sick of the issue. They have been lobbied mercilessly by representatives from all sides of the dispute for the past 12 months. A compromise solution or 'Common Position' was reached in December which proved satisfactory to the software suppliers and the big computer manufacturers, but left ECIS together with computer users across Europe concerned about the legitimacy of reverse engineering for maintenance or to facilitate the interconnection of one maker's computer with another. These issues were addressed in a series of amendments which came before the European parliament last week. Some 235 MEPs voted for the amendments, 89 voted against and 197 abstained. But under EC rules a minimum of 260 MEPs have to vote in favour of an issue for it to pass. The directive now goes back to Brussels for final ratification later this year. Some nations - the Netherlands, Italy and Spain among them - are expected to adopt the measures as they stand; France, Germany and the UK will have to modify their existing copyright law. The overall result is that the big manufacturers and the software suppliers seem to have all they wanted; the smaller manufacturers are discontented but prepared to live within the terms of the directive while users are confused and angry. What is now likely to happen is a series of court battles in each member state as users squabble among themselves to define the exact interpretation of the directive with regard to reverse engineering. There is still the possibility that new proposals can be put to the Commission after the effects of the directive have been assessed in practice. Perhaps the commission's own drafting mechanism would benefit from a spot of reverse engineering?</p>

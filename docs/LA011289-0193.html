			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME COMPUTER MOTION ATTACKS MAI FINANCING PLAN FOR TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Prime Computer, the target of a hostile takeover bid from MAI Basic Four of  Tustin, has filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Boston claiming that MAI's  proposed financing for its $970-million offer violates Federal Reserve Board  margin requirements.  </P> <P> Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer manufacturer, claimed that MAI's  $20-a-share tender offer violates Federal Reserve margin requirements because  it pledges more than 50% of Prime's stock as security for funding the takeover.  MAI has proposed purchasing Prime's outstanding shares by using $20 million in  cash, $875 million in high-yield "junk bonds" to be raised by the investment  firm Drexel Burnham Lambert and $650 million in bank loans.  </P> <P> Prime's motion, filed Tuesday, is an effort to bolster its suit aimed at  blocking MAI's acquisition bid.  </P> <P> MAI, a computer manufacturing and service company, called the Prime motion "a  meritless claim aimed at blocking Prime's owners from maximizing the value of  their holdings."  </P> <P> In an order issued Dec. 29, U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone in Boston said  the highly leveraged MAI offer raised a "serious question" of whether it  violated federal margin requirements.  </P> <P> Mazzone issued an injunction barring the MAI offer until the Tustin firm could  provide additional details about its financing of the offer.  </P> <P> MAI launched its takeover offer on Nov. 15. Prime has rejected the offer, which  was scheduled to expire at midnight Wednesday, as inadequate. DAVID OLMOS  </P></p>

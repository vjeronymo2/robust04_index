			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Cost of trial estimated at Pounds 35m THE COST of the Blue Arrow case is estimated at almost Pounds 35m, making it the most expensive trial yet, John Mason writes. The Guinness trial, the previous record-holder, cost about Pounds 10m. The only published figure for Blue Arrow has been the Pounds 2m disclosed by the Serious Fraud Office, covering costs of both investigation and prosecution. This figure would not include the costs of police attached to the SFO. Defence costs were easily the largest item, and lawyers calculated that Pounds 30m would be a minimum figure. These bills were all met initially by the companies involved - National Westminster Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and City solicitors Travers Smith Braithwaite. Following the corporate acquittals, each is negotiating for substantial refunds from public funds. Court costs are thought to have reached a further Pounds 1m.</p>

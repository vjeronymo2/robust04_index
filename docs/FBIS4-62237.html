			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Interests of Developing </F> Promising Technologies"]    [Text] The first sitting of the presidium of the Russian  Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences (RARAS), recently  reinstated by a Russian Federation presidential edict, has taken  place in Moscow. Taking part in the sitting was Andrey  Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense minister.    The Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, he  underlined in his address, is supposed to be an important body  bringing together leading scholars in various fields. Its main  task is to develop promising technologies for weapons systems  using artillery and rocket arms. Among these are a series of  baseline military technologies that occupy an intermediate  position, as it were, between basic research and applied  development.    In the words of the first deputy defense minister, among the  Russian military technology priorities is the creation of  intelligent weapon systems capable of striking primarily the  "nerve centers" of the opposing side's armed forces, and putting  out of commission the enemy's combat equipment.    Despite the enormous difficulties of financing the defense  needs, the Defense Ministry is doing all it can to ensure  progress in these priorities. And here we have, in the past two  years, a whole range of world-level achievements, Colonel  General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces, pointed out in his address.    The RARAS presidium also discussed a range of specific areas  of scientific research and development in line with the  decisions made by the Russian Defense Ministry Council on  Military-Technical Policy.</p>

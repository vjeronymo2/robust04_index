The author of the article says:    The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address declared that the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the  DPRK Government would consistently adhere to the foreign policy  of independence, peace and friendship to meet the requirements  of the present situation.    This year, too, the WPK and the DPRK Government will  consistently adhere to the foreign policy of independence, peace  and friendship.    The DPRK is a dignified country that regards independence as  its life and soul.    To maintain independence is an invariable position and  policy  of the DPRK. The DPRK deems it the basic principle of its  activity to think and judge all things independently, act in  accordance with its faith and solve all problems in a  self-determined manner.    The idea of independence in the foreign policy is based on  the chuche idea, the guiding idea of the DPRK.    We never allow others to infringe on our sovereignty,  interfere in our internal affairs and dominate and control us.  We also object to violating other country's sovereignty.    We will judge and deal with all problems in the  international  life with independence as the yardstick and fight on against  infringement on independence.    To avert war and preserve peace is a very urgent problem to  the Korean people.    Out of the sense of obligation to preserve peace in our  times, we will actively fight to terminate the tension and  military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, denuclearize  this part of the world, check and foil the acts of aggression  and war on the part of the imperialists and reactionaries and  safeguard peace in Asia and the world.    Our people value friendship with the world's people.    On the principle of independence we will make positive  efforts to unite and cooperate with the socialist and nonaligned  countries and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations  with the capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of  our country.</p>

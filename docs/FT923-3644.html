			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Fat rascals rescue the US dollar AMERICAN tourists worried that their currency will not stretch to three meals a day in over-priced Britain can rest assured: a thin dollar still buys a fat rascal. Hungry Americans can find the cake-cum-scone at Taylors Tea Rooms in York, where they sell for only Pounds 1.85 each. A mere Pounds 3.20 will buy a Palace Ploughmans (bread, cheese and salad) at the Crystal Palace pub in Bath. With American tourists wincing at British prices, the British Tourist Authority has come up with some less-than-overwhelming illustrations of how affordable Britain is. The culinary bargains cited above appear in a book called Amazing Britain - How to have an amazingly affordable holiday in Britain this year. The BTA is handing out 250,000 free copies in the US. The book sings the praises of Norwich ('An amazing corner of East Anglia'), Stratford-upon-Avon ('Where the Bard comes amazingly to life') and Glasgow ('An amazingly cultural city'). But it is London which is the main UK attraction. The BTA says it has carried out a survey of 17 cities which found that London was only the eleventh most expensive, being cheaper than cities like Tokyo, Rome, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. When it came to shopping, the BTA claimed London was the cheapest of the lot. Mr William Davis, the BTA chairman, said yesterday that London 'is still one of the greatest capitals in the world.' But he wrote in the authority's annual report: 'There is no doubt that people's desire to visit Britain is largely determined by their image of London, which regretably, has become more than a little tired, even tarnished.' Amazing Britain invokes DH Lawrence, who once said: 'The English . . . are the nicest people in the world . . .' but says this now applies equally to the Scots and Welsh. Amazing.

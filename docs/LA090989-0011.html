			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS  </P> <P> President Bush's drug package doesn't even begin to address the social issues  related to drug addiction and abuse. He is basically asking Congress to take  money from already existing social programs and spend it to fight the war on  drugs. Most of the states like New York and California are already plagued with  other serious problems (crime, poverty, homelessness, etc.).  </P> <P> Bush is taking a big risk by waging a war he may not win with this modest  package. I don't think Americans would object to a surtax to be used only for  the war on drugs, including education. Certainly it would be money well spent  and it would cost us less in the long run.  </P> <P> Leadership means making tough decisions during tough times. Yes, we've read his  lips. It's time he read ours.  </P> <P> SAMIN HAFZA  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

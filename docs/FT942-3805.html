			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Intel and Hewlett-Packard seek best of both worlds / A look at the implications of a new power axis in the computer industry Intel's alliance with Hewlett-Packard to develop a new generation of microprocessor chips could, if it lives up to the companies' expectations, become the most important computer industry partnership of the decade, defining the direction of computer technology for years to come. The Intel-HP partnership links the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer and dominant supplier of microprocessor chips with the second-largest US computer company, creating a new power axis in the computer industry. Intel plans to collaborate with HP in a broad joint research and development project 'aimed at providing advanced technologies for end of the decade computers'. The companies will together design 64-bit microprocessors, related semiconductor production technology and software. For both companies, microprocessors are a critical technology. The chips are the 'brains' of computers and determine, to a significant degree, the speed and power of a computer and what types of software it will run. The new partnership could, therefore, prove to be a decisive factor in the success of both companies. For Intel, the HP technology alliance signals a shift of loyalties. Since the late 1970s, Intel has been closely linked to IBM, still its largest customer, as the developer and supplier of microprocessor chips for IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers. Intel's relationship with IBM has been frayed, however, by IBM's adoption of PowerPC, a new microprocessor architecture jointly developed by IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer, as the foundation for many of its future products. IBM and Motorola are promoting the microprocessor as an alternative to Intel chips in PCs. Apple has launched several Macintosh PCs based on the PowerPC chip and IBM is expected to introduce its first PowerPC 'personal systems' in a few months. By working with HP, Intel aims to expand its market into microprocessors for use in higher performance computers such as workstations, network servers and mainframes, while also defending its leadership in microprocessors for PCs. HP brings several strengths to the partnership. The computer company has its own microprocessor architecture, called PA-Risc, which has helped to make it a leader in the market for computers that are linked by networks. HP is also an expert in 'open systems' software, which has become an important standard for distributed computing. Unlike IBM and Digital Equipment, HP is flourishing. Its sales rose 24 per cent last year to Dollars 20.3bn, overtaking Digital to become the second-largest US computer company. HP and Intel aim to combine the 'best of both worlds'. Their jointly developed chips will draw on Intel's expertise in high volume chip manufacturing and its dominant role in the PC arena and HP's experience in very high-performance Risc (reduced instruction set computing) microprocessors and its understanding of the 'open systems' field. The HP-Intel chips will run both PC software and open systems software without modification, the companies said. If they can achieve this without sacrificing the performance of existing software, Intel and HP will have a clear advantage over all competitors. However, HP and Intel do not expect to see the first fruits of their collaboration until late in the decade, giving PowerPC and other rival microprocessor architectures such as Digital Equipment's Alpha time to consolidate their positions. Competitors characterised the alliance as an attempt to catch up with their technology. 'We have a six-year lead on them,' said Mr Willie Shih, vice-president of Digital Equipment. 'Intel and HP are endorsing our technology direction by developing 64-bit microprocessors, but we have already sold Dollars 1bn worth of computers based on our Alpha microprocessor.' IBM similarly maintains that Intel's plans are a defensive move. 'This (partnership) affirms our view that Risc is the current and future answer for high performance microprocessors,' IBM said. 'While HP and Intel are entering the research phase we already have chips and products on the market.' However, by merging their long-term research and development efforts, HP and Intel will bring huge resources to their efforts to create a new generation of microprocessors that, they say, will leap-frog their competitors products. Although the companies declined to discuss financial arrangements, they indicated that both expect to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the effort. Such resources can only be matched, at present, by the IBM, Motorola, Apple Computer PowerPC team. This raises questions about the future of rival microprocessor standards from Digital Equipment, Sun Micro-systems and others. Analysts have long predicted that only two or three microprocessor architectures will have a significant role beyond the end of the decade. Now it appears that consolidation may be under way. Still, Intel and HP face significant technological and management challenges. Their partnership holds great promise but - like many other alliances in the computer and semiconductor industries - it could prove barren unless both sides prove willing and able to collaborate fully.</p>

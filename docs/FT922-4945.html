			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Cajoling the former Soviets NO NEWS is bad news in the former Soviet Union. The lull in the storms of the past year does not mean reforms are going well: it means they are running into great difficulties, where they are still running at all. Internal conflicts are the visible part. Russia and Ukraine dispute ownership of Crimea with increasing bitterness: foreign leaders who listen to the cases of both liken their rhetoric to that passing between Slovenia and Serbia before the blood began to flow. It remains hard to imagine a war between them, but easier to imagine lower-level fights. Baltic-Russian relations are no healthier. Talks between these three states and Russia on the pulling out of Russian troops have gone badly: the Baltic states insist on rapid removal, but Russia says that it does not intend to complete withdrawal until 1999. Economic links between the republics and their enterprises continue to weaken. This is partly due to a breakdown of the distribution and planning mechanisms, which affects everyone: but it is also due to blockades, embargoes and barriers deliberately erected by one state against others. This short-term safeguarding of assets hurts everyone, and slows reform. Or it would, if reform were happening. Only Russia and the Baltics have a programme of economic reform - although Kazakhstan is trying to adopt a far eastern model of a guided market economy. Russia's reform overshadows all others, because of its size and its resources: here, there are distinct signs of faltering. On a range of reforms - energy prices, privatisation, rouble convertibility - the government has either delayed, or had delay forced upon it by parliament or president. Malign twist The resignation on Monday of Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the Russian Central Bank, and his forecast yesterday that credit would now explode, adds a malign twist. Mr Matiukhin was not an ideal chairman - but he appears to have been forced out because of the right things he was doing, not the wrong ones. Yet Russia is ahead of most. Ukraine, the next largest state, is still at the stage of talking. Some are not even that far. The composite picture is of states struggling to come to terms with the collapse of the union - and doing so, in many cases, by setting nationalist agendas above economic ones. At the same time, most of them appeal for aid from abroad: many of them criticise the major foreign countries for tardiness in providing the aid; and all say that they are getting tired of answering questions put to them by experts and officials - for no apparent return. Mr Yeltsin, meeting Mr Jacques Delors, the European Community president, at the weekend, told him that 'the people's patience has its limits'. Convincing conditions Mr Yeltsin should be told that foreign countries also have their limits, even if they recognise that it will be hard for them to set convincing conditions. As they gear up for the Group of Seven summit in Munich next month, they do realise that, for states that have had 70 years of communism and centuries of autocracy before that, reform is not a matter of a short sharp shock. Shocks there will be, but they will take years. Nevertheless, lines must be drawn. Assistance depends on the ability of the former Soviet states to help themselves - in the first instance by reducing the levels of hostility and tension between them; by observing the human rights and border agreements they have signed within the context of the Helsinki Process; and by keeping up the pace of economic reform, even if the latter is necessarily flexible in the face of popular discontent. Without privatisation and a credible commitment to monetary and fiscal control, substantial levels of western assistance would offer little more than complicity in disaster. Western investment would, in any case, not be forthcoming. The case for western assistance to Mr Yeltsin's government, in particular, has to be more than that it is not Mr Gorbachev's. It is rather that it will not act like Mr Gorbachev's. Thus the mooted return of Mr Gorbachev's central banker would be a disturbing sign. The states of the west should reconfirm their desire to pay part of the bill for reform; but also that it is reform they will pay for, not its simulacrum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] was studying Friday the meaning of North  Korea's request for IAEA inspectors to be "present" when nuclear  fuel rods are changed at its five-megawatt reactor.    The IAEA specifically wants to find out whether "presence"  means simple "observation" or activity that would allow the  collection of samples, a senior South Korean Government official  said.    The IAEA will not accept the North Korean proposal if it  just  involves observation or limited participation.    In their negotiations in Vienna, the IAEA is demanding that  its inspectors be allowed to collect samples of the waste  material produced during the changing of nuclear fuel rods, the  official said.    If the IAEA could collect samples of such waste material, it  would be able to estimate how much plutonium North Korea had  extracted since the five-megawatt reactor went into operation in  1986.    "The IAEA is in contact with North Korea in order to find  out  the exact definition of the word 'presence' of IAEA inspectors,"  the official said, adding that the nuclear watchdog is expected  to make a decision soon on Pyongyang's proposal after analyzing  its political and technical intentions.    North Korea has not made its position clear on additional  IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, requested by the  U.N. Security Council president's statement.    The official also denied press reports that North Korea had  offered conditions to the United States on further IAEA checks.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Breakthrough for a broken land / Assessing the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina drawn up at the weekend The United Nations at the weekend signalled a breakthrough in the search for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina when Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic grudgingly endorsed a broad framework for a settlement. The plan, unveiled by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, claims to preserve Bosnia's sovereignty as a union of three constituent republics. In reality, this plan amounts to Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines. Serbian and Croat leaders welcomed the constitutional agreement as the means to end the 16-month war which has killed tens of thousands of people and driven 2m from their homes. The agreement if it sticks - and even last night Mr Izetbegovic was threatening to pull out - sanctions a Serbian victory. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his main backer, have won their war. They have succeeded in destroying Bosnia and replacing it with a loose confederation of ethnic states. The war was about territory. First the Serbs, then the Croats and finally the Moslems tried to grab as much land as possible. Mr Izetbegovic finally succumbed to international and domestic pressure, abandoning his insistence on preserving a united, federal state. At the weekend he told Radio Sarajevo that the 'younger generations will be left to realise the dream of Bosnia'. Serb forces currently claim to control 72 per cent of Bosnia and the Croats about 19 per cent. They expanded their territory at the expense of the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, which comprised 44 per cent of the pre-war 4.35m population. Mr Karadzic calls the war 'inevitable' because Serbs could not live under Moslem rule after 500 years under the Ottoman empire. He claims the war was the combustion of centuries of suppressed ethnic hatreds. But the jumble of mosques, Orthodox and Catholic churches - many of which are now in ruins - reflected the centuries of co-existence. 'If everyone really hated each other so much, why were (there) so many mosques left to destroy?' asks Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister. General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has masterminded the Serbs' path of destruction - burned villages, looted houses, and bombed-out factories. The Bosnian Serbs have tried to erase any vestige of Moslem heritage in Bosnia. Hundreds of mosques and graves have been systematically destroyed. When the war began in earnest, Serb fighters, then backed openly by the Yugoslav People's Army, expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia. But their campaign passed nearly unnoticed as international outrage focused on the Serbian encirclement of Sarajevo. Few Moslems remain in eastern Bosnia, where they once comprised a majority. They are confined mostly to isolated government strongholds: Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa. These towns, three out of six 'safe areas' proclaimed by the United Nations, are at the mercy of their Serb besiegers. The war was waged mainly in towns where Moslems, according to the 1991 census, comprised the majority. Mr Milosevic and his proxies have nearly succeeded in achieving the ethnic division of Bosnia. This was unthinkable when the war began in April, 1992. Moslems, Serbs and Croats lived together in apartment blocks. In Sarajevo, the cosmopolitan capital, one-third of all marriages crossed ethnic lines. But the international community, under the stewardship of the peace envoys, has now sanctioned the creation of ethnic states by force. Even Mr Izetbegovic at the weekend publicly admitted he was now defending 'the Moslem nation'. Pushed into a corner, Mr Izetbegovic had little choice. The mediators first re-invented Bosnia's multi-ethnic 'presi dency' (the collective leadership elected in 1990), and then exploited already existing divisions within it. The 10-member body now remains split over the agreement. The three Serb representatives oppose any division of Bosnia, fearing the new Moslem state will have no place for ethnic minorities. Many fear that the future that awaits each mini-state of the new Bosnian union is one of ethnic dictatorship and violent racism - the opposite of the harmony promised by the peace envoys. The west, which so pompously adopted the principle of a multi-ethnic Bosnia at last August's London conference, has now unceremoniously abandoned it. The document adopted in London pledged to end the violence and reverse 'ethnic cleansing', reaffirming Bosnia as a sovereign independent state. Bosnian politicians, except for the three Croat members of the presidency, have criticised the new agreement. 'Europe is abandoning the struggle to stop the rise of fascism, be it from any ethnic group,' said Mr Selim Beslagic, the mayor of Tuzla, who is struggling to preserve his democratically elected multi-ethnic leadership. 'It rewards the aggressors and punishes the victims,' he adds. Lord Owen has been opposed to the republic's partition, saying it is not an ideal solution. While he has promised to fight on behalf of the Moslems to secure a viable state for them, he has so far failed to come up with the goods. Mr Milosevic hailed the agreement because it 'totally affirms Srpska republika', the self-styled Serb state. Mr Izetbegovic stressed that the agreement was 'preliminary', explaining that the fate of Geneva talks hinged on negotiations over the maps. The biggest challenge remains. In their relief at breaking the impasse, Serb and Croat leaders appeared to forget that all three sides in January also endorsed the constitutional principles of the Vance-Owen plan. If Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to salvage any pretence of negotiating a fair and stable settlement to the war, then they will have to ensure that the Moslems are granted, as promised, at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory in future negotiations over the details of a peace settlement. They must also ensure that the Moslems have guaranteed access through hostile territory to vital ports on the northern River Sava and the Adriatic. In the current phase of negotiations, which produced this weekend's plan, there have been some ludicrous offers, among them Mr Karadzic's suggestion to build a tunnel out of Sarajevo, besieged and heavily bombarded since the beginning of the war, for the 380,000 inhabitants to travel to other parts of their 'state'. The co-chairmen reportedly are upset that Mr Karadzic has so far refused to withdraw heavy artillery, and break the siege of Sarajevo. The Serbs have not offered to make any concessions. If the Moslems, are to have any chance of preserving a Bosnian state, then they must have control over the corridor leading to strategic ports and not be at the mercy of their Serb and Croat adversaries. The plan does not give control over the external borders of the entire new Bosnian union to the weak central government. It also leaves open the number of currencies to be circulated. The plan calls for demilitarisation of the Union, but it does not specify how this will be achieved. 'There are huge armies in Serbia and Croatia that are directly involved in the conflict,' says Mr Nijaz Durakovic, an opposition deputy who is part of the Bosnian delegation. The recognition of the collapse of a multi-ethnic Bosnia means the passage to ethnically-based states. Anti-nationalist Serb leaders are now asking where will they live. Partners of mixed marriages are wondering where they will go. Mr Milosevic is in a hurry to reach a settlement, with the firm conviction that it will undermine the logic of the sanctions regime. Mr Karadzic has time on his hands. The remarkable lack of panic about the US plans to launch air- strikes reflects the Bosnian Serbs' belief that they have won the war.</p>

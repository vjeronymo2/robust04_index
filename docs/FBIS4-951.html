			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] on Monday [18 April] established a Public Service  Forum to ease civil servants into post-election administrations.    Members of the TEC's management committee made the  announcement after a day long meeting with public servants from  central government, the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda,  Ciskei] states and the self-governing territories. Public  sector unions were also represented.    The forum was formed to "ensure that in all matters relating  to the public service during the transition period there will be  transparency, consultation and employee participation". The  forum would deal with issues like promotions, pensions and  salary parity, TEC Management Committee Member Pravin Gordhan  said.    He was speaking after a plenary session which followed 11  separate meetings of public sector workers in Pretoria. The  meetings were held following continuing discontent among public  sector workers, in particular in the homelands where vital  sectors of public service provision have broken down by striking  workers demanding their pensions and job security in future  administrative arrangements.    The TEC's task force on the public service, comprising trade  unionist Philip Dexter and Administration Minister Sam de Beer,  was mandated to attend to a number of issues in which disputes  have arisen, among them the threatened breakdown in health  services and outstanding allowances.    The forum will meet for the first time on Wednesday this  week.    Speaking after the plenary session, Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the reorganisation of  South Africa's civil service structure was going to require hard  work. "The transition is going to require rationalisation of  the various administrations into one central and nine provincial  governments. It is going to require good management. We all have  to work hard to achieve these goals," Mr Meyer said.    He said the TEC was the one body that was in a position to  give civil servants valid reassurances on their future.    African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  said civil servants would be in the forefront of a new  government.    "The new government of national unity will be able to rely  on  the civil service of our country serving under a new flag and a  new constitution," he said.    He said South Africa was entering a "very trying period".    "The election is really going to have to rely on you if it  is  going to succeed," Mr Ramaphosa said.</p>

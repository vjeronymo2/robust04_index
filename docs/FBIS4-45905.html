			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sverre Dalland: "The Military Attacks Sexually </F> Transmitted Diseases"]    [Text] The military estimates that as many as 1,000  soldiers might have the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia  without being aware of it.    A survey taken at Sessvollmoen six months ago showed that as  many as four percent of the soldiers were healthy carriers of  the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia. This does not affect  their ability to fight, but they could infect others, and there  is a danger of complications later. This is why the military is  trying to find an inexpensive and painless test that can  identify those who are infected with the disease. Chlamydia is  simple to treat.    "Those being inducted into the military are men who only  seldom visit a doctor. For them the military offers excellent  health service. In view of the results of the survey at  Sessvollmoen, we feel that the soldiers should be examined for  chlamydia. Such an examination could be included in the overall  health care program for the soldiers. We expect the test to be  included in an ordinary urinalysis. It is probably not necessary  to use a painful test involving the urethra. At present various  tests are being examined both as to practicality and price,"  explains Bjorn Petter Bardal, a doctor at the Military  Laboratory of Microbiology.    The military paper FORUM discusses the chlamydia problem in  its March issue. Captain Reidar Mundal of the Military Medical  Service informs us that tests done on recruits indicate that one  out of 25 might have chlamydia without being aware of it. If the  disease is not treated, they might infect others and they might  also become sterile.    "During the last few years the number of cases of sexually  transmitted disease in Norway has gone down considerably. There  is no reason to believe that there has been a different  development among the soldiers, who represent the average of the  male population of their age group. Gonorrhea and syphilis have  been practically eradicated in Norway, while chlamydia and  herpes are still a problem," Mundal says to the Military's FORUM.</p>

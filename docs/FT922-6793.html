			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall slightly in absence of monetary easing US TREASURY prices languished yesterday at lower levels as the market waited in vain for a signal that the Federal Reserve had eased monetary policy. The Fed indicated that monetary policy was on hold by abstaining from operating in the open market during its usual intervention time, when Fed funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the rate. By late afternoon, the Trea sury's benchmark 30-year note had extended its loss to  7/16 at 102 7/32 , yielding 7.801 per cent. The two-year note was off  7/32 to yield 5.066 per cent. Expectations of an imminent interest rate cut were sparked by Tuesday's report of an unexpectedly steep decline in April's housing starts. Prices rose steeply, and, in spite of yesterday's losses, many players still expect an imminent rate cut. LONGER-dated gilts jumped a third of a point yesterday as poor retail sales figures pointed to the slow pace of any UK economic recovery. Most market predictions had been for month-on-month consumer spending to more than recover the 1 per cent decline in March, but in the event the April sales growth was just 0.8 per cent (or 1.2 per cent higher than April last year). The Bank of England took advantage of a rally in index-linked gilt prices - driven in part by an expectation that the Bank will have to buy back existing stock if the calculation of the retail price index is changed - to announce two tap issues, each of Pounds 150m. The two index-linked issues, each with a coupon of 2.5 per cent, mature in 2013 and 2020. Meanwhile, most of yesterday's gains were at the longer end of the yield curve. The yield on the benchmark 9 3/4 per cent gilt maturing in 2002 fell from 9.04 per cent on Tuesday to around 8.99 per cent, while the yield on the 9 per cent bonds due 2011 fell around five basis points to 8.85 per cent. GERMAN government bond prices moved higher yesterday as traders adopted a more optimistic view of money supply figures due to be released in the next few days. The rally was led by the futures market, with traders reporting a number of large professional buyers. The June bund future on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened at 87.52 but rose strongly through the morning session to hit 87.80. In the afternoon the best of the gains were maintained and the contract stood at 87.77 by the close. Volume was healthy at around 65,000 contracts, but not exceptional. Cash bunds also rose, although institutional investors were more cautious. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity fund bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.34-42 for a yield of 7.94 per cent, from 7.96 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. The rally was sparked by a reduction in the Bundesbank's official measure of money supply growth during March, which was revised from the 9.7 per cent previously announced to 9.4 per cent. This led analysts to scale back predictions for April M3 growth, which is expected to be released either this week or early next. THE RALLY in the Japanese government bond market continued unabated, in part on the back of comments made by prime minster Mr Kiichi Miyazawa that the economic recovery was taking longer to materialise than had been expected. With the yen remaining firm, this gloomy view helped to push the yield on the benchmark bond No 129 down to 5.43 per cent by the close in Tokyo.</p>

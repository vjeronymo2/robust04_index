			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Profit-taking affects pound Sterling suffered a late sell-off in traditionally thin end-of-week trading ahead of the Budget while the French franc was boosted by a reduction of central Bank debts, writes Peter John. The pound fell two pfennigs from its high against the D-Mark and more than a cent against the dollar as speculators and some UK corporate selling took advantage of its recent strength. Currency moves are generally exaggerated on Fridays and more so yesterday when cash flows were further reduced because many US dealers were still away from their desks following Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. Also, some economists said the enthusiastic response to Tuesday's cut in UK base rates and subsequent rise in the pound was overdone. Chart analysts saw DM2.54 as a significant ceiling for the pound and yesterday the selling began after it hit a high of DM2.5442 against the D-Mark. There was a sharp slide in the early afternoon and a second fall an hour or so later. By the close of dealing in Europe sterling was down to DM2.5325 against the German currency from DM2.5425 previously. The pattern was mirrored against the dollar and sterling dropped to Dollars 1.4800 from Dollars 1.4885 previously. However, the Irish punt, seen as a cheaper version of the UK currency, continued to strengthen and closed above the D-Mark in the European Monetary system for the first time in recent weeks. The French currency hit its highest level since the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism which led to a widening of ERM currency fluctuation bands on August 2. The franc was buoyed by news on Thursday that the Bank of France had repaid 80 per cent of the debts incurred at the end of July when it tried to ward off speculative attacks on the currency. It closed yesterday at FFr3.4560 to the D-Mark against FFr3.4650 previously. The Finnish markka held ground in spite of a reduction in one of the country's key lending rates. The Finnish tender rate was reduced by 0.23 percentage points to 6.65 per cent but economists said the cut was anticipated. The Portuguese escudo fell steeply in thin afternoon trade on reports that financing for the purchase of Pego power station had been largely completed. A British-led consortium signed an Es155bn escudo contract on Thursday to buy the half-built thermal power station from the state utility, EDP - Electricidade de Portugal. The financing involved a swap of around DM1bn into escudos, dealers said. Outside Europe, the Japanese yen finally weakened on heavy selling of Japanese equities while the dollar was resilient ahead of employment data next week. The yen had survived the previous onslaught on the Nikkei because investors were repatriating funds to compensate for their losses. But economists said the persistent weakness of the Japanese stock market was finally affecting the currency which eased to Y108.65 against the dollar from Y108.30 previously. The dollar has been recovering against the yen as the US economy shows signs of picking up. It has remained within a tight range against the D-Mark and economists are looking towards the key non-farm payroll data at the end of next week for an excuse to push it above it its current ceiling of DM1.72.  ---------------------------------------            POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------------- Nov 26          Close      Prev. close  --------------------------------------- Pounds spot    1.4790        1.4885 1 mth          1.4761        1.4855 3 mth          1.4720        1.4811 1 yr           1.4573        1.4670  ---------------------------------------</p>

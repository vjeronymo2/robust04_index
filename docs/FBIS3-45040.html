			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by staff Reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F> 1627): "Lu Ping Talks About Principle of Right of Abode,  Stressing That Beijing Welcomes Return of Hong Kong Migrants"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said today the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), which adopts a welcoming  attitude toward the influx of Hong Kong emigrants, is studying a  flexible method to solve the problem of the permanent resident  status of non-Chinese residents of Hong Kong.    At a friendship tea party today, Lu Ping told reporters that  the above-mentioned principle had been clearly laid down by the  relevant panel under the PWC. Although the method has yet to be  finalized, he said that the panel is working hard to formulate a  very flexible method which tallys with China's nationality law  and which will enable most returnees to enjoy permanent right of  abode in Hong Kong.    Lu Ping said: Even now, many Hong Kong residents have not  been granted an identity card with "three stars" [denoting  permanent resident status] on it although they have lived in  Hong Kong for several decades. The Chinese side has repeatedly  suggested to the British Hong Kong government that Hong Kong's  existing migration regulations should be amended according to  the Basic Law.    After listing several possible solutions to the problem, Lu  Ping said: The suggestions raised so far are not well  considered. For instance, some people suggested solving the  problem on the basis of the place of residence. According to  the common law, there are two types of residences. One is the  original dwelling place, namely, the place where one's father  lived and is considered one's permanent residence, the status of  which will never become null and void; and the other is the  selected place of residence, the status of which will become  invalid. According to this principle, the status of the  original place of residence will become null and void if the  status of the selected place of residence is chosen, while the  former will be restored if the latter is given up. Such a  principle can only solve the problem concerning Chinese citizens  born in Hong Kong as opposed to Chinese citizens who were not  born in Hong Kong or who have resided in Hong Kong for seven  years or more, or non-Chinese residents.    Lu Ping continued: Other people maintain that since Chinese  citizens born in Hong Kong and Chinese citizens who have lived  in Hong Kong for seven years have been given permanent resident  status, and the Basic Law does not say that these people's  identity cards will be invalid once they change their  nationalities, the problem of whether or not these people should  enjoy right of abode should be given consideration. Non-Chinese  residents who have lived in Hong Kong for seven years will be  required to express a desire to regard Hong Kong as their  permanent place of residence before they are granted right of  abode, but their right of abode will be forfeited if they leave  Hong Kong for a long time because this shows that they do not  treat Hong Kong as their permanent place of residence. The  Basic Law does not set conditions under which right of abode  will be forfeited, so the relevant problem must be placed on the  agenda. He stressed: The foregoing solutions are tentative  ones and remain immature. The issue is in fact not as serious  as claimed by the British Hong Kong Government. Our approach is  to explore a flexible solution which will not contravene China's  nationality law and which will make the right of abode  obtainable to most Hong Kong people returning to Hong Kong from  abroad. When talking about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong  residents, Lu Ping said: China's nationality law considers dual  nationality illegal. According to the nationality law and the  Chinese Government's consistent stand on the Hong Kong issue,  those Hong Kong Chinese holding BDTC (British Dependent  Territories Citizen) and BNO [British National Overseas]  passports and those who have been given right of abode in the  United Kingdom but do not settle there are all Chinese citizens.    Lu Ping also revealed today that the Hong Kong SAR (Special  Administrative Region) passport is being designed. To make  travel convenient for Hong Kong people after 1997, Lu Ping  added, the Chinese side has asked the Hong Kong side to provide  materials about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents so  that SAR passports will be given to them before 1997.    When asked whether he had seen the design of the SAR  passport, Lu Ping said he had. The design is similar to the PRC  passport except for a bauhinia [the flower of Hong Kong] design  on it. We are now designing the SAR passport; as soon as the  passport is ready we will make representations to relevant  countries through diplomatic channels over the matter. We will  try our best to obtain mutual visa exemptions to make things  convenient for Hong Kong travelers, said Lu Ping. He continued:  The way to issue SAR passports to Hong Kong people before 1997  and the technicalities of the SAR government discharging its  responsibilities related to the passports issue is under  discussion. For instance, some people have suggested issuing  SAR passports to Hong Kong people through certain channels. But  the passport will remain invalid until it is endorsed by the SAR  government putting its stamp on it in 1997.</p>

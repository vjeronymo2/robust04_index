			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tax-related activity Turnover in London was inflated late in the day by a spate of very large deals believed to represent tax-related activity ahead of the Budget. Transport group NFC gained a penny at 172p in turnover of 22m. Volume in Reuters was boosted by a block of 8.9m shares placed at 470p one minute before the close of trading. The underlying shares closed 3 up at 470p. Tightly traded Smith &amp; Nephew rose 4 to 151p, one of the best Footsie performances. Shortly before the close, large blocks of shares were placed, sending turnover to 6.7m. Engineering shares had a mostly negative day, overshadowed by profit-taking and mixed results. Precious metals group Johnson Matthey was a clear victim of the former, closing 7 lower at 550p, having risen to 561p immediately after strong interims. The results were ahead of analysts' expectations and so was the 4.2p interim dividend. BZW upgraded its full-year profits estimate, adding an extra Pounds 5m at Pounds 95m, where the propective p/e of 16.5 is what the investment bankers feel is a 'fully justified' 20 per cent premium to the market. Energy engineer Babcock International, which has been bumping along within a whisker of its low for the year all this week, barely blinked when the interim results weighed in woefully short of brokers' estimates, closing marginally easier at 26 1/2 p in turnover of less than 1m shares. Analysts have been progressively lowering their sights on Babcock's earnings since late summer and they were again hard at it yesterday. BZW reduced its full-year estimate from Pounds 19m to Pounds 13m - a figure which compares starkly with the Pounds 56m Babcock notched up in 1991-92. A boardroom shake-up and a warning about full-year losses pushed precision engineer J. Billam down to 115p at one point during the day, before ending a net 19 off at 123p. High street retailer WH Smith fell 14 1/2 to 447 1/2 p after Cazenove, the company's broker, cut current year profits estimates. The house was said to have reduced profits expectations by Pounds 7m to Pounds 138m and to have cited a lower than anticipated pension credit and worries about trading during the upcoming Christmas trading season. Those concerns about Christmas period trading were also heard around Storehouse, which pleased the market with its full-year results. Traders also said the figures had already been discounted and the stock ended the day 5 lower at 214p. Sears managed to resist the poor sentiment surrounding Christmas trading and the shares hardened 3 to 106 1/2 p amid heavy trading of 13m. The reduction of profits estimates by several brokers hit shares in Allied Domecq after the group posted disappointing interim figures. Profits rose from Pounds 266m to Pounds 310m but fell short of market expectations, and analysts were particularly disappointed by what one called the 'flat trading performance'. It was the second time this week that brokers had cut profits forecasts and the shares tumbled 19 to 555 1/2 p in heavy trade of 6.6m. BZW reduced its 12 months' forecast by Pounds 8m to Pounds 714m, while NatWest Securities cut by Pounds 28m to arrive at the same figure of Pounds 714m. The poor sentiment in Allied Domecq was said to have spread to several other stocks in the sector, Bass losing 5 at 522p and Whitbread declining 8 1/2 to 538 1/2 p. BT firmed 3 1/2 to 372 1/2 p, helped by an upbeat presentation to analysts by the group's Cellnet mobile phone joint venture. Good increases in usage was the main thrust of Cellnet's message. Manchester United's virtual elimination from the European Champions Cup competition saw the shares slide 14 to 625p. News that the parent of the Telegraph had been buying back shares in the newspaper helped the stock rise 8 to 354p. Other statistics, Page 37</p>

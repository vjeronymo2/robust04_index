The inquiry was announced last  week by the foreign affairs minister Senator Gareth Evans after  allegations of illegal behavior by ASIS agents were made on  television by two former members of the organization. Mr.  Samuels has been asked to report back to the government by the  end of this year. The inquiry will look into the control,  accountability, and management of ASIS as well as its methods  and the protection of its sources.</p>

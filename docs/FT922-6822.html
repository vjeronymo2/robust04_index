			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Fiat in deal with Polish carmaker FIAT HAS signed a preliminary agreement to acquire a 90 per cent stake in Poland's Fabryka Samochodow Malolitrazowych (FSM), the country's largest producer of small cars, in the largest ever foreign investment in Poland. The deal will lift the Italian carmaker's investment in Poland to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), but in terms of investment in eastern Europe, it remains far behind the Dollars 6.9bn which Volkswagen is investing to aquire a 70 per cent stake in Skoda, the Czechoslovak carmaker. Formal approval between the Polish government, which will retain a 10 per cent stake, and the Italian group is expected by May 28. Last October Fiat signed a memorandum committing it to take a 51 per cent stake in the company. Under this scheme up to 30 per cent of the shares would have been allocated to the company's 20,000 employees. During negotiations between the two groups since the October accord, the Polish government has argued that Fiat should absorb the group's substantial domestic debt, believed to be more than Dollars 100m. In return, the Polish government offered a higher stake and larger financial commitment. Of the Dollars 2bn committed to the project, some Dollars 800m has already been spent, mainly on bringing into production the Cinquecento, Fiat's new small car which is being built by FSM at a rate of 160,000 cars a year. Under yesterday's agreement, signed between Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the caretaker Polish finance minister, Mr Renato Ruggiero, Fiat's deputy chairman, and Mr Paolo Cantarella, Fiat Auto's managing director, production of the Cinquecento will be expanded to 240,000 units a year. Fiat will also invest in a new model to replace the Fiat 126, another small car built for Fiat by FSM. Fiat believes that if it did not sign while Mr Olechowski was still acting finance minister the future of the deal would have been in doubt. Mr Olechowski, a former trade minister and central banker, resigned as finance minister earlier this month in protest against a parliamentary vote that would have increased government spending and pushed up the budget deficit.</p>

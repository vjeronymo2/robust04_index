			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Australia boosts business immigrants Australia is significantly to broaden its business immigration programme, in the hope of attracting wealthier individuals prepared to invest in the country. Individuals will be asked to make a three-year investment of at least ADollars 750,000 (Pounds 357,000), to be placed in government securities, although applicants will still have to demonstrate 'business or investment achievement' and pass a points test, in which age and English language ability will be examined. Temporary residents who have 'a record of substantial financial commitment to their own business in Australia, and who have been actively involved in its operation and management for at least one year, will have the opportunity to remain in Australia permanently from 1995,' for example. The new class was designed for business people who did not want to commit themselves immediately to hands-on business activity in Australia as previous rules had stipulated, Mr Nick Bolkus, immigration minister, said. Immigration levels have been the subject of heated debate in Australia. One school of thought argues that the additional supply of labour is detrimental when the country is facing double-digit levels of unemployment. However, a number of academic studies have suggested the additional demand within the economy tends to offset this negative factor. Yesterday, the opposition attacked the business skills changes as questionable. 'This is nothing more than a buy-a-visa scheme to enable the government to fund its budget deficit,' Senator Jim Short said. Total number of permitted immigrants will rise by 10,000 to 86,000 for 1993-94.</p>

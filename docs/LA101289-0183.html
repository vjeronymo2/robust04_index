			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE OKS UCI BRAIN SCAN OF RAMON SALCIDO  </P> <P> A Sonoma County judge has cleared the way for accused mass murderer Ramon  Salcido to travel to UC Irvine this month for a state-of-the-art brain scan  that could aid his defense -- if the university will accept him.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge R. Bryan Jamar on Tuesday denied a motion by Deputy Dist.  Atty. Peter Bummerts that Salcido not be removed from the Sonoma County Jail  without a special court hearing. Bummerts had warned that flying Salcido to  Southern California could be a security risk.  </P> <P> However, Salcido's defense attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, said  Wednesday he believes a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan, a  brain-imaging technique that can detect subtle brain malfunctions, could reveal  that Salcido has suffered organic brain damage.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old winery worker could face the death penalty if convicted of  killing seven people in the April 14 rampage. Salcido allegedly killed two of  his three daughters, his wife, her two sisters, his mother-in-law, and his boss  at the winery. He also is accused of slitting the throat of the third daughter,  who survived, and sexually assaulting his wife's sisters. The killings shocked  Sonoma County and prompted a manhunt that ended with Salcido's capture in  Mexico.  </P> <P> A finding of brain damage might help persuade a jury that Salcido lacked the  willfulness and premeditation required for a first-degree murder conviction, or  sway a judge toward leniency if Salcido was convicted, Miller said.  </P> <P> However, officials at the UC Irvine Brain Imaging Center, located on the  outskirts of the campus, haven't decided whether to accept Salcido as a  patient, according to Miller.  </P> <P> The center's director, Dr. Monte R. Buchsbaum, "indicated he didn't want to use  this as a fishing expedition to try to find something" abnormal, Miller said.  </P> <P> "He wanted some definitive data that there is some brain dysfunction, then he  would go in and explore it further," Miller said.  </P> <P> Dr. Buchsbaum was out of the country and could not be reached for comment  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Miller said he has evidence that Salcido may have suffered brain damage -- an  electroencephalogram, or EEG, showing some disturbance in the right temporal  lobe, and the fact that Salcido had suffered injuries, including electrical  shock, as a child.  </P> <P> The university's PET scanner, operated by the College of Medicine, already has  been used by defense attorneys in two other trials. In 1985, Buchsbaum  performed a PET scan on mass murderer Barry Wayne McNamara, who later told  psychiatrists that he had been told to kill his family by voices on television.  The psychiatrist testified that McNamara's PET scan was consistent with other  testimony that the defendant was schizophrenic.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Bummerts, however, said defense attorneys will have "a long row to  hoe" in making such claims for Salcido.  </P> <P> "We have a statement from him that to me is clear that he knew exactly what he  was doing, that he had a purpose and that he tried to succeed in accomplishing  his purpose" by the shootings, Bummerts said. "Proving this claim now that it  wasn't premeditated is going to be a difficult proposition."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Sonoma County sheriff's office is preparing to keep Salcido  under tight security during the trip to Irvine. Sgt. Norm Hardin said even the  date of the PET scan will be kept secret.  </P></p>

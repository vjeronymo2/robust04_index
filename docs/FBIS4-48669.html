			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 23 May (AFP) -- Zairian television  reported yesterday evening that the homes of two members of the  High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament were  attacked with grenades on 22 May. The television report blamed  these attacks "on Etienne Tshisekedi's extremist supporters."  Tshisekedi was prime minister until dismissed from office by  President Mobutu in February 1993, however, he remains a  candidate for the post. The report's accusation was criticized  in this morning's issue of the opposition daily REFERENCE-PLUS,  which condemns "this gruesome storyteller's rubbish, which is  not based on any inquiry." The two personalities targeted by  the attacks belong to Rally of Forces of Democratic Change  [RFCD], a member of the radical opposition's "Allies" coalition,  which did not back Mr. Tshisekedi's candidacy for the  premiership. The RFCD endorsed the candidacy of Mulumba Lukoji,  who held the post in 1991.</p>

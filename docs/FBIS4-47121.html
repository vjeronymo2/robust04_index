			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text, under the rubric "Banks," of Summary Document of the </F> International Banking Conference: "The Search for an Effective  System of Mutual Settlement of Accounts"]    [Text] On 23-24 April, a banking conference devoted  to the problem of interstate settlement of accounts within the  CIS and the entire zone of economic influence of the former USSR  was held near Moscow at the Bor vacation hotel. Among the  participants of the conference "The Establishment and  Development of an Efficient System of Mutual Settlement of  Accounts on the Level of Central (National) and Commercial Banks  of the States of the Former USSR" were: the Association of  Russian Banks, representatives of central and commercial banks  of the former USSR, and scientific figures. In view of the  importance of the problem, NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] is  publishing the conference's summary document, which appeared in  May, in unabridged form.    After analyzing the situation which has now developed in the  sphere of mutual settlement of accounts on the level of the  central (national) and commercial banks of the states of the  former USSR, the participants in the conference observe the  following:    1. The failure, for objective and subjective reasons, to  preserve the common monetary system of the states of the former  USSR resulted in those states introducing their own national  currencies, which commercial banks are supposed to use in  international settlement of accounts for the trade-economic  transactions of their clients.    The absence of convertibility and the "softness" of their  currencies and the limited potential to use the national  currencies to acquire goods resulted in the fact that settlement  of accounts in national currencies entails substantial  difficulties and conceals a possibility of material losses.    In these conditions, settlement of accounts of Russian  commercial structures with partners from the states of the  former USSR has been done primarily in rubles, spontaneously  forming a zone of use of the Russian ruble, which, compared with  other monetary units, is a harder national currency and for many  participants in the Eurasian market has the same significance as  the dollar does for Russia.    In payment relations with non-Russian commercial structures,  the participants in trade-economic exchange with other CIS  states use typically a freely convertible currency or the  Russian ruble as the currency for settling accounts among  themselves.    The shortage of freely convertible currency and Russian  rubles means that trade-economic partners try to prevent  stoppages and the breakdown of production in their countries and  so resort to bilateral deals based on physical and cost  indicators and the simplest forms of barter and clearing on the  level of enterprises and banks. Those commercial banks which  offer their clients methods of monetary settlement of accounts  with partners in Eurasian space in "soft" nonconvertible  currencies, methods which are acceptable to those clients and to  themselves, play a positive role. Carried out without the  support of the central (national) banks under the full  responsibility of the commercial banks, these settlements of  accounts have not yet been markedly developed. And certain  central (national) banks are not systematizing data on  commercial banks working with "soft" currencies and so do not  always possess the quantitative and qualitative details which  permit the impact of these settlements to be assessed correctly.  Thus it does not seem possible to determine to what degree the  system of interstate settlement of accounts affects the process  of restoring disrupted economic ties on the territory of the  former USSR.    The condition of accounts on nontrade operations, especially  those related to monetary transfers of citizens' capital from  one state of the former USSR to another, is unsatisfactory. A  considerable number of difficulties arise in connection with the  migration of the population. The procedure for determining the  currency exchange rate needed for nontrade settlement of  accounts and the mechanism for linking nontrade turnover with  trade turnover and for coordinating norms for citizens to carry  cash in and out of the country are unclear.    Many commercial banks do not deal in exchanging cash in  "soft" currencies.    2. A search is underway in the states of the former USSR for  ways to establish an efficient system of mutual settlement of  accounts in the economic space of the former USSR.    Many participants in the conference drew the conclusion that  it is important that all participants in accounts--the central  (national) and commercial banks and their numerous  clients--conduct this search along the lines of the Blueprint  for By-stage Establishment and Development of an Efficient  System of Mutual Settlement of Accounts developed by  Mezhekonomsberbank [Intereconomic Savings Bank]; this document  provides a strategic vision of a new payments system.    Most of the participants in the conference believe that in  accordance with the political and economic realities which have  become established in the states of the former USSR, the new  payments system may in principle be formed in two ways: 1) by  combining the monetary systems of the interested countries  modeled on a new type of ruble zone, and 2) by consistently  developing settlement of accounts in the national currencies  from simple bilateral to more complex multilateral settlement of  accounts through the organization of a payments union. In the  opinion of the participants in the conference, neither way  contradicts the other. The development of settlement of accounts  in national currencies is supposed to promote their mutual  convertibility, which provides the basis for an effective  payments system. We must develop a procedure for mutual  settlement of accounts in "soft" currencies which most fully  promotes using them under the set of rules for convertibility,  providing equal opportunities for all national currencies to  participate in this system of rules.    Because of the different conditions which have become  established in the CIS states, it is impossible to combine their  monetary systems all at one time and include all the states in  the unifying process right away. But in places where the  necessary prerequisites have matured to a significant degree, in  the interests of speeding up the creation of a common economic  space it seems necessary to support the states' desire for  unification of their monetary systems in a new type of ruble  zone.    In connection with this, many participants in the conference  believe that the signing by the heads of governments of Russia  and Belorussia [Belarus] of the Treaty on Unifying the Monetary  Systems of these states is making an important contribution to  the general process of development of the economic integration  of the CIS countries and serves as a manifestation of the  centripetal tendencies which have objectively emerged on the  territory of the former USSR.    3. After exchanging opinions, the participants in the  conference expect that stronger cooperation between the central  (national) banks of the interested states of the former USSR  could help speed up the process of creation of an effective  system of mutual settlement of accounts on the Eurasian market.  The process of creating currency markets in these states, which  is essential for establishing a contemporary system of mutual  settlement of accounts, is occurring at different speeds. As a  rule the currency markets are distinguished by a low volume of  transactions and significant disproportions in supply and  demand. The impact of the "black" market is substantial. All  this impedes the development of settlement of accounts in "soft"  currencies and reduces the economic potential of commercial  banks to have a positive effect on the restoration of economic  ties. The lack of coordination and reconciliation of the actions  of the CIS states and their central (national) banks in the  sphere of currency regulation is a serious obstacle. One of the  reasons for this is the lack of a general coordinating and  methodological organ.    Taking this into account, the participants in the conference  believe it is important to specially study the question of the  wisdom of creating such an organ, for example one like the  Standing Commission on Currency-Financial Questions, which  operated quite successfully in the former CEMA structure for  many years and played a positive role in the establishment and  development of payment-accounts relations among its member  states.    Within the framework of the CIS, the Currency Committee  under  the Interstate Bank could perform similar functions, and its  recommendations could be realized through the council of this  bank. Developing a mechanism for a new payments system could be  among the first tasks of the Currency Committee. The start of  the activity of the Interstate Bank should be stepped up.  Delaying its work may discredit its potential in the work of  improving interstate settlement of accounts.    4. In the interests of the work, increase interaction of  central (national) banks with commercial banks in the sphere of  organizing their currency-financial cooperation. As analysis  shows, the problems of accounts settlement and payment relations  are derived from the main problem: the mutual imbalance of  commodity turnover of the former USSR republics, above all with  Russia, which causes the participants in the market to have a  great need for rubles. Inasmuch as the national currencies of  the near abroad are not convertible, they frequently wind up in  the accounts of enterprises in commercial banks. Russian  entrepreneurs have little interest in settling accounts in the  "soft" currencies of their partners, which ultimately deters  settling accounts in them and does not promote the development  of a mechanism for mutual convertibility of those currencies.    A certain solution could be found if commercial banks were  included in the activity of the Interstate Bank. As the process  of liberalization of foreign-economic ties progresses,  settlement of accounts on the level of commercial banks will  become predominant. In these conditions it is important that  commercial banks cooperate with central (national) banks and the  Interstate Bank. Prominent commercial banks are prepared for  such partnership in any form.    5. The future of the currency-financial cooperation of the  commercial banks of the former USSR states is seen not only in  their participation in establishing an effective payments  system. Commercial banks must mobilize their influence on the  processes of normal movement of goods, services, labor, and  capital in the space of the former USSR. The participants see  overcoming the isolation and separateness of commercial banks  from one another as the way to do this.    6. The participants in the conference also link the  prospects  of currency cooperation with the possibility and need to  establish close contacts with commercial banks of the states  which were members of CEMA, in particular concerning the topic  of joint development of a mechanism for mutual settlement of  accounts in national currencies, as well as the creation of  joint banks when there is mutual interest.    The readiness of commercial banks of the states of the  former  USSR to actively interact with banks of the countries of Central  and Eastern Europe is the result of their desire to help restore  the economic ties in this region which were largely destroyed.  Scientific-technical cooperation in the area of industrial  cooperation has virtually ceased. In trade the main type of  transaction is barter, which does not suit entrepreneurs of any  form of ownership now. Commercial banks consider currency  cooperation with their partners from China and Vietnam promising  for them; the many years of experience with those partners has  confirmed the profitability of economic cooperation with them.    7. The conference considers speeding up solving the problem  of nontrade payments, especially monetary transfers of citizens  of different countries, one of the urgent tasks. The  participants in the conference are making a request of the  Association of Savings Banks, the Savings Bank of Russia, the  Savings Bank of the Republic of Belarus, Mezhekonomsberbank, and  the specialized credit institution Western Union DP-East,  created with the participation of Mezhekonomsberbank, to take  the initiative to prepare the government's proposals on a  possible mechanism for transferring personal capital and the  conditions of its operation.    8. The conference believes that development of all forms of  banking cooperation on all levels from the central (national) to  commercial banks requires that the information vacuum be  eliminated and measures be taken to improve the system of mutual  information on the activities of commercial and central  (national) banks of the states of the former USSR.    9. Based on the fact that the economies of the states of the  former USSR are the transitional economies from a planned  economy to a market economy, and that many cadres, including  bank cadres, lack the proper experience in managing market  relations, the participants in the conference believe it is  important to increase scientific support of cooperation and  enrich it, above all with basic theoretical research. For this  purpose, it is considered wise to prepare a fundamental  scholarly work "Money and Banks in the Transitional Economy of  the States of the Former USSR (Theory and Economic Pragmatism)."  To publish it, interested banks could create a fund to finance  research work and assign the Association of Russian Banks to  handle it.    Along with this, it is considered important to expand  applied  research in the area of international accounts-payments and  currency-credit relations. The conference is asking the RAN  [Russian Academy of Sciences] institute of foreign-economic  research, which specializes in problems of international  relations within the CIS, to study its potential to regularly  service the scientific needs of central (national) and  commercial banks, together with other similar scientific  institutions of the Commonwealth countries. The above-indicated  fund is to be used to finance scientific research.    10. Attaching exceptional importance to the systematic  exchange of opinions on pressing problems of the international  activity of central (national) and commercial banks, the  participants in the conference believe it is wise to conduct  meetings regularly (as a rule, once a year), and for this  purpose rename the conference the standing congress "Cooperation  of Banks of the CIS States" and decide the appropriate  organizational questions on a working basis. Questions of the  interaction of commercial banks with central (national) banks,  complete development of a system of mutual settlement of  accounts, conduct of joint analysis of the economic situation  and monetary-credit and currency policy, and changes in banking  legislation can be topics of discussion in order to develop  possible proposals for joint initiatives and projects.    [Ordinal number 11 missing in text]. The conference is  asking  the Association of Russian Banks and Mezhekonomsberbank to  remain the headquarters where interested central (national) and  commercial banks can send their ideas temporarily, until the  organs of the congress are formed.    12. The conference is asking the organizing committee to  summarize the proposals and ideas suggested during the  conference and to prepare an analytical report and send it to  the governments and central (national) banks of the CIS states.    Chairman of the conference, S. Yegorov, president of  the Association of Russian banks; Cochairman of the  conference, V. Kolbayev, president of Mezhekonomsberbank;  chairman of the conference organizing committee, V.  Khorkin, member of the Mezhekonomsberbank council.</p>

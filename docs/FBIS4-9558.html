			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- A bomb blast  destroyed a mosque in Croat-controlled Livno in southwestern  Bosnia early on Monday morning, Croatian radio confirmed. In  addition to Zepce, Kiseljak, and West Mostar, Livno is now the  fourth town in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, the state of  Bosnian Croats, in which Croats have destroyed all Moslem  religious objects. Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who fought  bitter battles for territories since the spring of last year,  especially in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed an  agreement on a bi-national federation early this year under  strong pressure of Washington. As agreed, the federation would  later enter into a confederation with neighbouring croatia.    Despite the signed agreement, Croat-Moslem relations are  still tense. This is evident also in the limited freedom of  movement for Moslem civilians and Moslem-owened vehicles in  certain parts of Croat-controlled Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two  sides also disagree on the issue of who will be the first  president of their common state, although the deadline for this  has long passed. The Croatian side demands that the first  president be a Croat, but is willing to agree to a compromise  solution -- that the president be a Moslem (Haris Silajdzic) but  not Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who has been  nominated for this office.</p>

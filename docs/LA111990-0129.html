TACKLE TO MISS FINALE  </P> <P> Illinois All-American nose tackle Moe Gardner broke his right forearm and will  miss the season finale against Northwestern, an Illinois trainer said.  </P> <P> The senior -- one of four finalists for the Lombardi Trophy, given annually to  the best defensive lineman in the country -- broke the arm in Saturday's 24-10  victory over Indiana.  </P> <P> "I don't know exactly when it happened, but it was late in the game," Gardner  said. "It was bothering me then, but I wasn't quite sure whether or not it was  broken. But when I woke up (Sunday), it hurt pretty bad. I knew something was  wrong."  </P> <P> Gardner will be in a cast for three weeks. Trainer Al Martindale said Gardner  could be ready for the Hall of Fame Bowl on Jan. 1.  </P></p>

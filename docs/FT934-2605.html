			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fund managers shift investments Fund managers are increasing their investment in UK and US equities at the expense of Japan and continental Europe, according to the latest Smith New Court/Gallup survey released today. In a poll conducted last week of 85 institutions, 27 per cent said they would be increasing their holdings of UK equities in December, compared with none when asked in November. The proportion planning to increase investment in US equities was 17 per cent, the first positive figure since February this year. Those institutions intending to raise their Japanese equity holdings fell from 17 per cent in November to 8 per cent this month. Just 1 per cent said they would increase continental European holdings, compared with 21 per cent in November. Increased investment was most likely in French equities, and least likely for German shares. The fund managers on average believed there would be further improvements to the UK economy over the next year, with the UK economy growing at 2.6 per cent and 2.7 per cent in 1995. They forecast inflation of 3.3 per cent by the end of 1994 and expected base rates to be further reduced to 5 per cent in the same period. They predicted earnings per share would grow by about 15 per cent in 1994.</p>

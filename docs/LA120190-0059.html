			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> STUDENTS TO GET FREE TRIPS TO MOUNTAINS  </P> <P> About 7,000 underprivileged Oxnard students will get a free trip through the  Santa Monica Mountains during the next year thanks to an $80,000 grant from the  Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.  </P> <P> A pilot program designed to encourage students to care about the environment  will be kicked off next Wednesday, when the first busload of about 70  second-graders from Kamala School is scheduled to visit Sycamore Canyon  Campgrounds in Point Mugu State Park.  </P> <P> Students will be greeted by Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, Oxnard  City Councilman Manuel Lopez and officials from the conservancy.  </P> <P> During the first year, students from second, fourth, sixth and eighth grades  will visit the mountains and go on two-hour hikes led by naturalists.  </P> <P> The one-year pilot program is part of the Mountains Conservancy Education and  Recreation Program, which has been busing poor inner-city youths from Los  Angeles schools for hikes in the mountains since April. The Oxnard students are  the first Ventura County students to participate in the program.  </P> <P> Students from Oxnard were chosen because "they may live close to the  campgrounds, but they're not in the habit of visiting the mountains," said Hugh  Maher, an outreach coordinator for the conservancy. Many of the students cannot  afford the $6 fee charged at state parks, he said.  </P> <P> "We also give them information on how to get back to the parks," he said.  Naturalists will also teach the children about the fauna and flora of the  mountains through games.  </P> <P> Starting in January, bilingual naturalists will accompany the students to help  interpret for Spanish-speaking students, Maher said.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials are seeking to extend the life of the one-year program  through financing from the County Board of Supervisors, Maher said.

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The gilts market was short-sighted to rally on the basis that the forthcoming auction will be for Pounds 2.5bn rather than the Pounds 3bn that some had feared. Before long the auctions will become considerably larger. Yesterday's PSBR figures confirm the trend towards a larger deficit. Stripping out the distortions caused by monthly VAT payments adds around Pounds 1bn to December's deficit. Central government revenues thus fell slightly in the first nine months of 1992-93 while expenditure increased by almost 15 per cent. Having largely funded this year's deficit, the authorities may want to avoid premature alarm about 1993-94. But investors should be wary.</p>

Many of the prized  automobiles were confiscated in drug seizures. Seven of the cars belonged to  Rudy Henderson, a millionaire imprisoned on drug charges. One of the seven  vehicles included a 1968 Chevrolet Corvette that went for $24,500, the highest  of the sale. Henderson has an unpaid tax bill of $512,000 and the sale of his  seven cars came to $96,900, the IRS said.  </P></p>

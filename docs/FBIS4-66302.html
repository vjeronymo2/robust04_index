			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Han Shujun (7281 3219 0689), Director of the </F> Financial Planning Office, Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation: "Several Opinions on Causes of, Methods  for Resolving Disparities in Bilateral Trade Statistics"]    [Text] [Editor's Note] There have been rapid  developments in China's foreign trade since reform and the  open-door policy. Concurrently, there are ever larger  discrepancies in statistical data between China and the world's  major trading partners which create more trade friction.  Towards this end, the author explores the causes of and methods  for resolving statistical discrepancies produced in  country-to-country trade from the perspective of international  trade statistical theory and methods. In awaiting a correct  conclusion, this publication welcomes manuscripts from many  statistical experts and scholars in hopes of further discussion  and research on the issue.    Following rapid development of China's foreign trade in  recent years, there have been ever larger disparities in  statistical data between China and the world's major trading  partners. The trend is increasing. The issue of bilateral  statistical figure disparities is common worldwide in  inter-country trade, for example, between the United States and  Japan, Japan and Germany, Germany and the United States, or  France and Canada. Many reasons account for the disparities,  such as different trade statistic principles, the scope of trade  statistics, trade record systems, ad valorem standards, currency  conversion standards or different statistical time periods.  Trade statistic principles are the fundamental cause of  bilateral trade statistic disparities.  <H5>  I. Trade Statistic Disparities Created by Using </H5> Producer-Consumer Country Statistical Accounting Principles    At present most countries and regions in the world use the  country of origin as the import statistical accounting principle  and the end-user (destination) country as the export statistical  accounting principle (abbreviated as producer-consumer country).  China's import and export statistics published overseas also are  like this.    A. Implications of producer-consumer country statistical  principle.    Country of origin generally refers to the producing country  of agricultural products, the country extracting mineral  products (entirely or partially), or the manufacturer of  manufactured products. For example, with partial manufacture it  usually is understood that country of origin refers to the  country responsible for the final stage of the manufacturing  operation before a commodity takes final form. Consumer country  refers to the ultimate consuming, using or further processing  country of a said commodity at the time of transport, including  commercial transactions which occur in intermediary countries.    B. Advantages and disadvantages of producer-consumer  statistical principle    1. According to country of origin statistical analysis of  imports, it is advantageous to indicate the direct relationship  between the producing and importing countries. Such material is  essential for managing import quotas and implementing  differential duties. The basis for determining country of origin  comes from the regulation of place of origin. Countries which  use place of origin regulations both must determine exported  commodities from their own country and also utilize place of  origin regulations to determine the place of origin of imported  commodities. The role of country of origin statistics is more  prominent under current conditions of emphasizing fair trade and  stronger trade protectionism. Place of origin regulations  themselves are a type of trade policy or means of trade  management. They are preferential treatment given by one country  to another or standards for determining quantity restrictions on  imported commodities (such as textile quotas and other commodity  quotas). As for some developed countries, they also restrict  foreign investment enterprises which produce, process or  assemble products from using its status in the country to seize  its markets. For example, the EC strictly regulates Japanese  processing and assembly enterprises (which are called  "screwdriver factories") on its territory; certain products are  only considered EC products when more than 50 percent of added  value is done in the EC. The United States has established  automobile parts enterprises in Canada and Canada has stipulated  that products must have a relatively high proportion of added  value before they can be considered to be Canadian products. The  aim of such practices is to reduce situations where the country  itself has no foreign exchange income but wants to assume a  trade surplus. To a certain extent such practices naturally  restrict the inflow of foreign investment. Used for export  statistics, the concept of "consumer country" mainly is to  understand the relationship between producer country and  importing country.    2. The main disadvantage of the producer-consumer country  principle. Considered from the aspect of country of origin,  country of origin regulation standards differ in stipulations  because various countries have different degrees of  industrialization and different trade policies. There is still  no binding international pact. For example, regarding country  of origin, besides tallying with the definition of country of  origin stated by the United Nations, the major developed  countries, in particular with regard to determination of country  of origin for countries partially manufacturing finished  products, stipulate that processed products should have a rather  high proportion of added value (varying 40 to 60 percent). That  is to say, country of origin must at the same time possess two  conditions: responsibility for the final stage of manufacturing  and added value proportion (actual proportions of various  countries differ). Some countries take the country responsible  for a commodity's final stage of manufacture just prior to its  ultimate form as the major determinant. A commodity's added  value proportion (generally speaking, the added value proportion  is comparatively low, at around 25 to 30 percent) is the  determinant only when it is impossible to determine the final  manufacturing country. Ordinarily, country of origin  determination for an imported commodity is based on the customs  declaration form filled out by the importer. The importing  country uses its own country of origin regulations to determine  only when questionable. Obviously, although use of country of  origin principle statistics for imports accords with  international custom, it actually has created difficulties in  comparing statistics between countries. Considering the  consumer country's perspective, a country often cannot determine  a commodity's ultimate consuming country because it is extremely  difficult to record accurately, particularly when goods are not  directly shipped to the importing country from the producing  country. A country often cannot determine a commodity's ultimate  consumer country. It is also difficult to make determinations  from statistical origin evidence (customs declaration forms).  Furthermore, one country's statistical boundaries may not extend  to other countries and regions. Therefore, material on consumer  country statistics on exports actually are very incomplete and  inaccurate.    3. The serious insufficiency of adopting the consumer  country  principle for statistics also lies in that if goods are not  imported directly from the producing country, there is no way  for the exporting and importing countries to have corresponding  statistics for the same goods. Thus it is harmful to comparing  statistics among partnering countries. Analyses of trade  conditions with such statistical information, in particular  analyses of international income and expenditure situations,  will play a harmful role.    An example of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade statistics:  According  to Chinese statistics , if it is known that the consumer country  of a batch of goods is the United States at the time of export,  it is listed as U.S. export statistics. If a batch of goods is  known to be headed for Hong Kong at the time of export, it can  only be listed as Hong Kong export statistics. As for this  batch of products later being transshipped from Hong Kong to the  United States without China's knowledge, then naturally there is  no way to list it statistically as exports for the United  States. According to U.S. statistics, if a good is produced in  China, regardless of whether it is directly imported from China  or via Hong Kong, country of origin import statistics uniformly  list it as an import from China. Thus, U.S. export figures  greatly exceed Chinese statistics to the United States. Likewise  this applies to goods flowing in the opposite direction.  Obviously the more Chinese commodities in entrepot trade through  Hong Kong, the greater the disparity in figures with countries  concerned.    2. Comparatively large added value of Chinese  commodities in entrepot trade through Hong Kong expands trade  statistic disparities with countries concerned.    Chinese commodities have comparatively large added value  after entrepot trade through Hong Kong; information indicates  that added value rates are higher than 50 percent. Because  entrepot trade belongs to the category of third-country  (region) trade activity, it does not cause "an increases or  decreases in the quantity of material resources" of the  exporting country (the UN definition of trade). Thus the added  value portion is not entered into the trade statistics of the  exporting country. However according to the importing country's  origin standards, they are still considered to be commodities of  China. Thus they actually are considered imports from China in  importing country statistics, producing figure discrepancies.  Chinese commodities transshipped via Hong Kong mainly are headed  for the United States, Germany and Italy. It clearly is  irrational that entrepot commodity added value artificially  enlarges trade surplusses with these countries.    3. Suggestions for resolving the matter    Of the above two major causes for discrepancies in trade  statistics between China and countries concerned, the  producer-consumer country statistical accounting principle is  the fundamental cause. The issue of bilateral trade statistic  discrepancies presently complicates bilateral trade  negotiations. It is imperative to resolve the issue. I believe  that the following are considerations.    1. Reappraise standards for belonging to trade partnerships  and select more scientific and rational statistical principles  differing by country. Regarding trade partner countries, the  United Nations book, Concepts of International Trade  Statistics, notes that one can select country of origin,  dispatch country, or country purchased from for imports, and  consumer country, destination country or purchasing country for  exports. For imports and exports together there are nine types  of trade partnership country combinations in all. Except for  "country purchased from/purchasing country," which is denied by  the United Nations, all the other combinations are recommended  by the United Nations. At present relatively many countries in  theory use the "country of origin/country of consumption"  principle because of economic system and trade management needs,  ease of statistical accounting, or tradition. From the analysis  above, it is evident that although the "country of  origin/country of consumption" principle is convenient for trade  management, it is harmful to international comparability of  trade statistics. Moreover, 70 years have passed since proposal  of this principle; it is unsuited to the contemporary  ever-increasing growth of international entrepot trade. For  export statistics of "country of consumption" in particular,  since it is difficult to track and determine the country of  consumption, actually some countries gradually have begun to use  the "destination country" concept. That is, for imports they  use country of origin and for exports, "destination country."  However, this principle is unable to eliminate the matter of  poor international comparability. Besides recording a country's  international import and export situation, an important role of  international trade statistics is in making international  comparisons. At present the issue of international  incomparability weakens the role of trade statistics. Thus it is  necessary to reappraise and select criteria for belonging to  trade partnerships.    Use of "dispatch country/destination country" criteria can  eliminate the incomparability of international trade statistics.  In the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the  first refers to the country which sends goods to an importing  country under conditions where there is no intermediate  commercial transaction whatsoever. Destination country refers  to the ultimate destination of goods destined for export under  conditions where there is no intermediate commercial transaction  whatsoever. Arranging trade statistics by this principle accords  with the United Nations' definition of international trade:  namely, bringing about the movement of an increase or decrease  of the stores of goods of a country (or region). According to  the "dispatch country/destination country" principle, the  importing and exporting countries of goods both can record the  same transaction of goods. If an importing country resells the  goods to a third country thereafter, the importing country and  the third country both have a record. The third country's  statistical information can reflect the entire course of the  goods. In this way, both the import and export transactions of  the goods can be accurately recorded, allowing rational  comparability between the trade statistics of the exporting and  importing countries.    3. The "dispatch country/destination country" statistical  accounting principle should be used as soon as possible. After  analysing and comparing several criteria for belonging to trade  partnerships, I believe that this principle is most suited to  international trade statistic comparisons. Use of the  producer-consumer country principle to reflect trade surplus  conditions between countries is unacceptable, incorrect and  irrational. Use of the "dispatch country/destination country"  principle can accurately reflect the international income and  expenditure situation of a country or region. Basing trade  statistics on it also is beneficial to bilateral trade  negotiations. For example, if Chinese commodities are sent to  Hong Kong, then China considers them Hong Kong export  statistics. Hong Kong statistics will reflect if Hong Kong  transports them to any country at any additional value. For  example, if a Chinese commodity is sent on to the United States  via Hong Kong, at 50 percent added value, Hong Kong uses the  "dispatch country/destination country" statistical accounting  principle as an export to the United States, tallying with that  of the United States' imports from Hong Kong. Therefore, use of  this principle should be established as soon as possible. It is  beneficial to managing international trade affairs. Of course,  simple use of the principle cannot meet the needs of managing  imports. Thus, while using it as a basis for comparisons  between countires, country of origin records also have to be  kept as the basis for ways to manage implementation of trade.    4. Establish bilateral or multilateral trade statistic  coordinating organizations. At present the trade statistic  discrepancy issue exists worldwide. Most countries use the  producer-consumer principle which lacks comparability. Each  country steadfastly believes that its own statistical figures  are correct and it is difficult to resolve the matter of  different figures. Towards this end, some countries have  established bilateral trade statistic coordinating  organizations. For example, the United States and Canada, Japan,  and the ROK. In particular the United States-Canadian  coordinating organization is arranged very well; it has a nearly  two decade operation and improvement. Bilateral or multilateral  trade statistic coordinating organizations could be established  to resolve the matter of discrepancies in trade statistics  between China and relevant countries. Specific analyses and  comparisons of these differences allow both sides to attain a  common understanding.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / As They Say in Europe: Taking a fight to the Finnish - The importance of balls, scandal and cake in Austria It was only two weeks ago that I completed an exhaustive and, I thought, scholarly, comparative study of attitudes towards sex scandals in Britain and Germany. I hoped that I would not have to return to this unsavoury topic, but the pressure of events in Austria has forced me to reconsider matters. My first inkling of trouble to come appeared in an article in the conservative Vienna daily, Die Presse. On January 12 it published what should have been a boring report on postings in the Austrian foreign ministry. Buried in the item was this note: 'On account of the talk about his contacts with Romanian prostitutes, the former People's Party deputy, Herr Ettmayer, has been named ambassador in Helsinki.' There was no further explanation, and no reaction to what some Finns might have thought to be an insensitive move on the part of those who mastermind Austrian diplomatic initiatives. The two countries have, after all, stood shoulder to shoulder for three decades and are negotiating simultaneous entry into the European Union. My assumption that this story might reflect a relaxed attitude towards such matters in Austria was not wholly borne out by subsequent events. For then there was the revelation that President Klestil, 61, was conducting an affair with his 39-year old assistant, Margot Loffler. In an interview in News magazine, he admitted he and his wife had parted company. That emerged only after lengthy questioning on such matters as Austria's entry into the European Union, the state of broadcasting and so on. Then the interviewer diffidently said: 'Mr Federal President, there is a story going the rounds in Vienna that there is a problem in your private life. You have always said you believe in speaking openly and that you want be honest with the people. Are you ready to talk about your private life?' President Klestil gave a crafty answer which, I thought, heralded evasions common to politicians: 'I shall not flinch from your frank question. I'll just state one thing first: a politician is also a human being.' But Klestil admitted his wife had left the offical villa and gone to their old home. By this time the interviewer realised he or she had stumbled on a nation-shattering story, always troublesome for a journalist, and clearly had no idea how to deal with it. After a while the questioning became flustered: 'Why are you answering so frankly?' 'Because you asked the questions.' There was a typically Viennese conclusion: 'Did your absence from the New Year balls, with the exception of the opera ball, have anything to do with your problem?' The reply was that there were too many balls and he, Klestil, had decided months ago to attend none but the night at the opera. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung is alone among outside commentators in recognising the importance of such items as balls and scandal (and cake for that matter) in Austrian public life. Under the attention-grabbing headline 'Shadows over Klestil's presidency,' it reported that Mrs Klestil attended the more prestigious philharmonic ball where she was greeted with a 'prolonged ovation.' That was after Mrs K had disclosed that Ms Loffler was the Other Woman, which caused the tabloids to explode. 'Sue or quit,' Kronenzeitung told the president. Not only was the mistress on the presidential staff, she was also a career diplomat and had requested a posting abroad. 'Send her to Finland,' wrote a columnist in the paper which rather charmingly translates as Daily Everything. There were any number of issues which served to inflame feeling. The president had to make a UN conference speech on family values, sponsored by the Vatican. There he pointed out that his experience had heightened his own awareness of such questions. Then, having said he was giving up his wife and his mistress, it was announced that Loffler was to accompany Klestil on next week's official visit to Egypt. 'She belongs to the president's team and she organised the Egypt trip,' explained the president's office. But that resolution did not last long. On Wednesday officials said she would leave the presidency and 'take a long holiday.' Curiously, that marked the anniversary of another Viennese tale of starcrossed lovers. Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the imperial throne, and his mistress, Maria Vetsera, were found dead at the hunting lodge at Mayerling 105 years ago. It was supposed to have been suicide but the Habsburgs offered little evidence. It is a strange thought that that tragedy could have been averted had Finland gained its independence a generation earlier. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

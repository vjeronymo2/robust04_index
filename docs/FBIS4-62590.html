			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov report: "Peace Plan for </F> Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov Proposes Phased Settlement  of Conflict"]    [Text] The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which was never  resolved under the Union, is our most difficult legacy. The six  years of confrontation have accounted for around 30,000 lives.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been turned into refugees.    Time has also been lost today. Literally the entire world --  through the efforts of representatives from Russia, the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, the CSCE Minsk Group, and the  United Nations -- is trying to resolve the conflict. But there  has been little success. It is hard to change anyone's mind --  there is too much distrust, toughness, and hatred in the  confrontation zone.    What is happening needs to be recognized in the natural,  usual way, this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by  Vladimir Kazimirov, official representative of the Russian  Federation president and leader of the Russian mediation  mission, in the realization that recognizing reality and turning  toward peace is an exceptionally difficult process that is made  harder -- apart from anything else -- by propaganda.    Russia's actions should be particularly balanced and wise --  and this is what it is striving for, campaigning above all to  organize good and effective relations (this is its sole aim)  with both Azerbaijan and Armenia.    There is constant advice and counsel on offer, but only  Russia has a conceptual approach, Boris Yeltsin's representative  believes. The essence of the Russian plan is to give preference  to a phased settlement of the conflict without undermining the  elaboration of package measures. We are proposing three phases,  V. Kazimirov said, which could either be superimposed on each  other or come one after the other.    Phase one includes a cease-fire, the cessation of  hostilities, and a reliable consolidation of this state of  affairs. Like any first step, this phase is the most difficult.  Appeals to political, legal, moral, or any other criteria will  be useless. All our hopes will be pinned on military-technical  measures envisaging the suspension of hostilities, the  observance of the cease-fire, and the disengagement of the  forces. Implementing this will take just six days.    Phase two envisages the liberation of all captured  territories (apart from Shusha and Lachin), the rapid exchange  of prisoners and hostages, the restoration of communications,  and the return of refugees to their homes. This phase will be  of immense importance, in both humanitarian and psychological  terms. All this will take 34 days.    Phase three will be the negotiating phase, during which the  question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be examined.    Are the sides ready for the measures proposed by V.  Kazimirov? The meeting in Bishkek and the talks with Armenian  and Azerbaijani parliamentarians have shown that a number of  politicians are hesitating when they take a closer look at  implementing the move toward peace. And it is not hard to  understand that. After all, peace poses a threat to the careers  of certain political leaders. Consequently, it is of little  concern to them if the continuation of hostilities costs  thousands of lives. Only a full appreciation of this fact can  make politicians ignore career considerations. Will they have  enough sense and willpower to do so?</p>

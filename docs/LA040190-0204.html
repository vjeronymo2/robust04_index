			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YES ON MEASURE D ADVOCATED IN SAN JUAN  </P> <P> The issue in San Juan Capistrano is simple. Save farmland from development. I,  and many like me, have worked at it for 16 years.  </P> <P> Finding a solution has been difficult. We're not there yet. Now it's again come  down to a vote. And this time it's for money: Shall the city of San Juan  Capistrano incur a bond debt of $21 million to preserve open space, save  farmland and provide recreation areas?  </P> <P> I say yes, by all means. Here are a few reasons why: countywide gridlock, empty  land poised for cramming with more wall-to-wall houses, disappearing  ridgelines, more cars, more traffic snarls, fewer trees; in short, less  goodness, less freedom to enjoy life.  </P> <P> Too expensive? I say, it's cheap at 10 times the cost. Measure D (in San Juan  Capistrano) on April 10 needs a yes vote. The choice is paying a specific  amount and preserving open space or paying for the consequences of development  if the bond issue fails.  </P> <P> DOUG NASH  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

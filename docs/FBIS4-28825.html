			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  called for lower domestic prices Monday [13 Jun], saying the gap  between prices in Japan and overseas should be narrowed.    "To make our lives richer, we have to directly address the  issue of rectifying the gap between domestic and overseas  prices," he told a private advisory panel, urging it to come up  with specific recommendations for that purpose.    It is the 13th meeting for the panel, an advisory body on  prices to the prime minister.    The panel has 44 members, including economic experts and  people in the industrial, labor, and consumer fields chosen to  give their opinions on bringing down Japan's prices to  international levels.    Sources close to the panel say it remains to be seen what  specific measures it will be able to recommend, since policies  so far have been unable to tug domestic prices lower despite the  appreciation of the yen.    The panel is likely to base its discussions on a report  compiled by a research committee that was set up last fall.    Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa  and  other cabinet members also attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- New information about a  concentration of Ukrainian troops on the Crimean peninsula  reached ITAR-TASS this afternoon.    The agency has learned from sources at the headquarters of  the Black Sea Fleet that special-purpose units which may be used  to seize Black Sea Fleet units deployed in the port of Izmail  are being concentrated around the town of Izmail.    According to the same reports, a Ukrainian armed forces  military field hospital is being set up in the village of  Chernobayevka in Kherson Oblast. Those working there, the same  sources reported, apparently do not conceal from the local  people that they are preparing to receive wounded people from  Crimea in the near future.</p>

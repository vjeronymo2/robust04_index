			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By economic reporter Yoichi Takita] </F>   [Text] The agreement to resume Japan-U.S. trade talks  appears to have brought a "temporary halt" to the unilateral  decline of the dollar. The reason is that coordinated buying of  the dollar and coordination on interest policy by Japan, the  United States, and Europe has been followed by a rapprochement  on resumption of the Japan-U.S.trade talks. Doubt about the  recycling of capital into the United States with its  international balance-of-payments deficit has caused turmoil in  the securities markets and authorities have assumed a  coordinated position. The strong yen outlook is now subject to  slight relaxation until the Naples summit in July and should  have a favorable impact on Japanese stock prices.    The breakdown in the Japan-U.S. trade talks after the  Japan-U.S. summit in February triggered the rapid rise in the  yen. In that sense, the decision to resume the talks should  serve as reason for a cheaper yen. The yen underwent only slight  fluctuations around 104 yen to the dollar in trading on the  Tokyo market on 24 May as the trading had already reflected the  pending Japan-U.S. compromise.    The strong yen coupled with fear about incipient inflation  functioned like a boomerang in triggering a loss of confidence  in the dollar and a widespread decline in the dollar amidst  rising U.S. interest rates. Shigetada Nakajima, chief economist  of the foreign exchange-securities department of Itohchu,  comments, "It was a case where the United States had no choice  but to recognize that use of foreign exchange rates to draw  concessions from Japan was inadvisable." The change in the  posture of U.S. authorities has deprived the markets of an  excuse to go on a major dollar-selling offensive.    Whenever the United States moves to cause a strong yen with  the aim of correcting the trade imbalance, some temporary  successes are realized, but a gradual widespread decline in the  dollar follows, which imposes the inevitable need to shift to  dollar-defense actions such as monetary tightening. Actions to  cause a strong yen by the Carter administration, which was  inaugurated in 1977, and the 1985 Plaza Accord for a weaker  dollar are actions that are being repeated by the Clinton  administration.    The skepticism of the U.S. bond and stock markets after the  United States shifted to monetary tightening policies in  February 1994 testify to the tenacity of fears originating in  such a chain of events. Whether it is Japan's recurring  balance-of-payments surplus or the U.S. balance-of-payments  deficit, imbalances for either nation can become the focus of  attention. The sense of an overheating U.S. economy has  ironically focused market attention on the expansion of the U.S.  balance-of-payments deficit.    Normally, the favorable U.S. economy in comparison to Japan  and Europe and the higher U.S. interest rates would be favorable  for buying dollars, but investors have failed to react favorably.    Investors do not react favorably is that they assume that an  excess of dollars will persist as long as the U.S.  balance-of-payments deficit continues to expand and that the  supply and demand balance will eventually result in a cheaper  dollar. Officials at major investment firms admit, "Ever since  the strong yen trend began in the 1990's, we have not succeeded  in making a profit on U.S. Government bonds."    Even if the series of U.S. Government policy changes have  quieted the turbulence in the markets, the existence of  imbalances in payments between Japan and the United States will  cause hesitancy in investing in dollar assets. Market  participants have reached the analytical assessment that "a  dearth of news affecting the markets until the Naples summit  will limit movements in the yen's value." However, any delay in  mollifying concerns about an overheated U.S. economy could  result in the potential for an explosive upward movement in the  yen which will call for full-scale dollar defense actions.</p>

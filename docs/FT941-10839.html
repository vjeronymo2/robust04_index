			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Broad ban on smoking proposed by US bill The US administration yesterday endorsed a bill to ban or restrict smoking in virtually all commercial and public buildings because of the health hazard to non-smokers, especially children, Reuter reports from Washington. Ms Carol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency 'firmly believes that the scientific evidence is sufficient to warrant actions to protect non-smokers from involuntary exposure to second-hand smoke.' She was testifying to a health sub-committee of the House of Representatives. Ms Browner emphasised her special concern over 'the very serious respiratory effects on young children.' The bill would ban smoking in all non-residential buildings used or visited by at least 10 people a week, except in specially ventilated smoking areas. In the case of buildings which lacked such areas, smokers would have to go outside to light up.</p>

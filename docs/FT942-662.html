			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach in Pounds 27.5m offer for Busways Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus group, has made a recommended share offer for Busways, the main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear. The deal, which would be Stagecoach's biggest acquisition since its flotation in April 1993, values Busways at Pounds 27.5m, to be met by the issue of new Stagecoach shares with a cash alternative and a loan note election. Busways, bought from the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority by its management and employees in 1989 for Pounds 14.4m, operates more than 600 buses and has a workforce of 1,750. In the year to March 31 it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.3m on turnover of Pounds 42.5m. Both companies described the proposed acquisition as a 'win win' deal. Mr Brian Souter, Stagecoach chairman, said he did not expect any referral to the Office of Fair Trading since his group did not currently have any presence in Tyne and Wear. If the acquisition of Busways and of Western Scottish, announced earlier this month, go through, Stagecoach will have a Pounds 285m annual turnover, 5,300 buses and 16,000 staff. It is offering 246 new Stagecoach shares for every 100 Busways. Irrevocable undertakings have been received from shareholders, including directors and management, in respect of 51 per cent of Busways' share capital. Busways' employees hold the remaining 49 per cent. The offer is conditional on valid acceptances being received in respect of not less than 75 per cent of Busways shares by July 21. Because of its size, the deal requires the backing of a Stagecoach EGM. Mr Souter expects approval. Accepting Busways shareholders can opt for cash, at an aggregate of 186.4p per share; employees' pay-outs would be worth between Pounds 4,500 and Pounds 13,500. Noble Grossart has conditionally agreed to purchase or procure purchasers for the new shares in respect of which elections are made for the cash alternative. To fund the Pounds 4.51m loan note commitments already known and meet the expenses of the offer, 3.36m Stagecoach shares are being placed at 173p apiece. This placing, underwritten by Noble Grossart, will be issued whether or not the offer proceeds and will raise Pounds 5.8m before expenses.</p>

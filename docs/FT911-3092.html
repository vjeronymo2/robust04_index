			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: N Brown placing as profits rise 12% N BROWN Group, the home shopping concern, joined the long list of companies seeking funding from the stock market yesterday when it asked shareholders for a net Pounds 16.4m to finance the development of a centralised warehouse and distribution centre. The placing and open offer, which represents the first time the company has sought equity finance since 1971, is on a 1-for-8 basis at 209p per share. The issue was well received in the City and the shares closed 3p higher at 228p. Sir David Alliance, chairman, and his family trusts, have bought an additional 1m shares in the company, taking their total holding to 65 per cent, and have agreed to take up their full entitlement of shares under the issue. The balance has been conditionally placed with institutional investors by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, subject to clawback from existing shareholders. N Brown also brought forward its annual results yesterday to coincide with the rights issue. These showed that pre-tax profits had advanced by 12 per cent to Pounds 14.01m on sales of Pounds 140.17m (Pounds 126.57m). Earnings per share rose from 13.95p to 15.67p and a final dividend of 4p is recommended for a total of 5.65p, a 7.6 per cent increase. The proceeds of the rights issue will help offset the Pounds 20m cost of developing the company's warehouse at Shaw, near Manchester. By the end of the year N Brown had already spent Pounds 18m on the project. Following the rights issue, the company's gearing level will fall from 119 per cent to 56 per cent, helping to reduce its interest charge, which last year amounted to Pounds 5.65m. The company's core catalogues, targeted mainly at niche markets, were said to have contributed a satisfactory performance. During the year N Brown also launched another three catalogues including one for the disabled. 'There are 4m people from the wheelchair-bound to those with rheumatism who are classified as disabled. The high street does not look after them so we launched a catalogue for them,' said Mr Jim Martin, managing director. He said he remained unconcerned by the recent consolidation of the UK mail order industry which had seen Otto Versand, of Germany, snap up Grattan from Next and Redoute Groupe, of France, buy Empire Stores Group. But he added that in due course N Brown would look to develop its presence in continental Europe.</p>

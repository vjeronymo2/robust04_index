			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (11): The price has to be right - A look at the world's emerging markets The doomed Dollars 1bn offering last May by Videsh Sanchar Nigam, India's international telecommunications carrier, marked a turning point in relations between international investors and companies in the emerging markets of Latin America and south-east Asia. During 1993 and the start of 1994, international investors were willing to pay demanding prices in order to get exposure to emerging markets, India in particular. But they drew the line at VSNL's offering because in their view the pricing was excessively high. The backdrop to the event was also inauspicious. Uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the US and other leading industrialised nations caused profound volatility in financial markets and discouraged investors from making fresh investments. The buyers' strike inevitably led to an oversupply of equity issuance from emerging markets which has taken several months to clear. Mr Harry Hampson, head of the equity syndicate at JP Morgan in London, says sentiment has been much improved now that the market has digested the backlog of issues. 'People have come back to their desks after the summer holiday with a more positive outlook,' he says, noting that stock markets in south-east Asia had also strengthened over the summer. Some fairly large deals are expected from the region in the autumn, such as offerings from telecommunications companies in Malaysia and Indonesia, he adds. Nevertheless, investors are expected to be far more selective about offerings than in the past. 'I will be looking at each issue individually,' says Mr John Legat, senior emerging markets portfolio manager at GT Management. He is more optimistic about prospects for Latin America, especially Brazil. However, he is cautious about Asia, which in his view offers less value. 'Malaysia is looking expensive, it's at the end of its interest rate cycle and the next move is up,' he argues. Companies from the more-established emerging markets will also have to be more realistic about pricing because of the increased competition for funds. Political events in the Middle East and South Africa have turned the attention of international investors to markets in those regions. Mr Hampson says there is a growing interest in what he describes as 'near-emerging markets', such as Israel and South Africa, where investors have very low portfolio weightings in relation to the developed nature of their economies. After years of obscurity, Israel is emerging as a serious candidate for international investment now that the Arab boycott has been lifted. Mr Ron Lubasch, the head of Lehman Brothers' recently-opened Tel Aviv office, says investors are attracted by Israel's highly-developed infrastructure and fast-growing economy. It is possible that Israel's credit rating will be upgraded to A minus from triple-B plus in the near future, he suggests. Bankers expect a series of international equity offerings from Israel over the next year as the government seeks greater foreign participation in the sale of its stakes in the country's leading companies. At present, only 2 per cent of the Israeli stock market is estimated to be owned by foreigners, a significant proportion of which is made up of BZW Investment Management's Israel Fund. The Israeli government has appointed Wertheim Schroder, part of the UK merchant bank and fund management group Schroders, to advise it on the sale of shares in Israel Chemicals (ICL). The government plans to sell 32 per cent of ICL, currently valued at around Dollars 850m, through an international public offering and 15 per cent to a single investor or group of private investors. Morgan Stanley has been selected to advise on the international offering of shares in Bezek, the telecommunications company. The government hopes to sell 25 per cent of Bezek, which would lower its stake to 51 per cent. The sale, which is likely to go ahead by May next year, could raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m. Another candidate for privatisation is El Al, the state-owned airline. The government, which intends to sell 51 per cent of the company through the Tel Aviv stock exchange and through an international offering, has appointed BZW to conduct a valuation of the airline. El Al's privatisation is being held up by three problems: namely, the government's desire to keep a golden stake to protect state interests; the issue of the airline's Dollars 55m annual security costs, 80 per cent of which are currently met by the government; and the fact that El Al is not allowed to fly its aeroplanes on the Jewish Sabbath. Nevertheless, officials say these issues should be resolved in time for El Al to be floated by mid-1995. In the meantime, bankers involved in these offerings are busy hiring staff to provide much-needed research on Israeli equities. Although Israel has a sophisticated broking community, the majority of the research is in Hebrew and the stock market is still perceived to be driven by sentiment rather than by fundamentals.</p>

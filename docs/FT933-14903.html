			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: University computing facility The Leeds office of MOWLEM NORTHERN, a division of John Mowlem Construction, has been awarded contracts together worth Pounds 8.6m. The largest, worth approximately Pounds 4m, is to convert a listed mill into a school of computing and mathematics for the University of Huddersfield. The nineteenth century mill, a six-storey building which remained in working order until 1988, will be completely stripped and refurbished, together with an adjacent single-storey weaving shed. Scheduled for completion in August 1994, the refurbishment will preserve the character of the mill by cleaning and exposing original features such as cast iron columns, roof trusses, brick arched floors and solid masonry walls. It will allow students from the school of computing and mathematics to relocate under one roof with new facilities such as computer laboratories, seminar rooms and lecture theatres, including a sunken theatre for 270 people in the weaving shed. Other work won by Mowlem includes three design and build projects: a Pounds 1.2m contract from English Industrial Estates for a factory at Hellaby lane, Rotherham, a Pounds 1.5m contract for a two-storey office development which will incorporate Hull Housing Action Trust's new headquarters and a production facility extension for Arco Coatings, both in Hull.</p>

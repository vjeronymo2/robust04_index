			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR'S SUMMER SPLASH;  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CHOICES;  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> With only two of the summer's entries out of the starting gate, "Indiana Jones  and the Last Crusade" and "Pink Cadillac," almost everything remains  unpreviewed. I am most looking forward to: "Dead Poets Society," "Batman,"  "Distant Voices, Still Lives," "Do the Right Thing," and "Great Balls of Fire."  </P> <P> For those who prefer to look back in pleasure, the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art's summer program is Fridays and Saturdays through July and is one of  popular demand. It will include "Around the World in Eighty Days," "The  Uninvited," restored or re-struck prints of "King Kong," "Gone With the Wind,"  "A Star is Born" and the first showing in 25 years of "The High and the  Mighty."  </P> <P> For those who like to be on the crest of the wave of the future, the Academy of  Motion Picture Arts and Science's 16th annual Student Film Awards June 11 will  present the winners of its national competition. Most times this is bracing; at  others, when you feel that students are using television as reality, it's  dispiriting; there's no way to know but to see and judge for yourself. (This is  free and open to the public, but tickets must be obtained by contacting the  Academy: (213) 278-8990, ext. 233).  </P></p>

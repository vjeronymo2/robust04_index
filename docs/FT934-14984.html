			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US attack on copyright curbs THE US Congress is launching a direct attack against Canadian and EC restrictions on US 'creative materials', raising yet another potential obstacle to the timely conclusion of the Uruguay Round. In a move to bolster growing US exports of copyrighted materials such as films, television shows and computer software, 199 members of the House of Representatives are co-sponsoring a resolution insisting that Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, gain 'fair and equal access' to international markets. The resolution implicitly targets both Canada's cultural restrictions and the EC Broadcast Directive, which urges member states to ensure that at least 50 per cent of programming is produced in Europe. The latter was on the agenda in talks between Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade negotiator. European officials have been hoping the US would, in the end, not make a 'round-breaker' of France's requirement that at least 60 per cent of its programming be European. An aide to Congressman Richard Gephardt, who introduced the measure, predicted the resolution soon would attract more than a majority of the 435 members of the House. The resolutions are non-binding, but they exert strong pressure on Mr Kantor, who knows he must negotiate a Uruguay Round package that Congress will pass. One trade strategist noted that they 'make our position much less flexible, and that can be good or bad'. The French, he added, have been 'incredibly provocative' with threats to boycott US films to protect their movie industry. Both resolutions cite trade in copyrighted goods as among the fastest growing sectors of the US economy, accounting for about Dollars 34bn (Pounds 22.5bn) in export revenues in 1990. The proportion of US workers employed in the copyright-based sector grew from 3.3 per cent in 1970 to 4.8 per cent in 1990, the resolution says.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Andean Pact nations in tariff accord The five countries of the Andean Pact have agreed to a common external tariff, 25 years after the formation of the group. Officials agreed in Lima last week that a four-tier external tariff should come into force at the start of next year, with some exceptions. Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador agreed to a four-tier external tariff structure of 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent. For Colombia, according to Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, the weighted average tariff will be 11 per cent. Ecuador has negotiated a list of 600 exceptions for which it can, for a four-year period, set a tariff of 5 per cent either side of that agreed for other countries. As the least developed country in the group, Bolivia will stick at its current two-tier tariff level of 5 and 10 per cent. Peru will accept the 5 and 10 per cent tariff, but its acceptance of other tariff levels is still not settled and will depend, for example, on concessions from Colombia over its free trade zone. 'We have come further in two years of negotiations that in the previous 23,' Mr Santos said in an interview. He said the reasons for the success were the involvement of the private sector in the negotiations, and the concept of 'open integration', meaning the group remained open to trade with the outside world. He said Colombia was moving ahead with other free trade negotiations. The Group of Three accord with Venezuela and Mexico should be signed in mid-June at an Ibero-American heads of state meeting in Cartagena. Negotiations with the Caribbean Community resume on June 5 with a view to a free trade deal, and he expected an accord with the Central American Common Market before the government of Mr Cesar Gaviria quits in August.</p>

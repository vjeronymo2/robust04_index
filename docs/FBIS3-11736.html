			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reactions within Mexico to the assassination of Luis Donaldo  Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Mexican  Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, which occurred on 23  March in Tijuana, Baja California.    A report by Mabel Montoya indicates that the PRI's future  has  become uncertain following Colosio's assassination. According  to the law, the party's National Executive Committee has the  authority to hold another extraordinary convention to select a  new candidate. Political analysts are saying it is too early to  discuss this issue because the assassination has caused  considerable consternation within the Mexican community and  people are hesitant to mention possible candidates. The  country's eight remaining parties have unanimously condemned the  assassination and have suspended their campaigns until the  situation normalizes. Meanwhile, Popular Socialist Party  candidate Marcela Lombardo has accused the conservatives of  promoting incidents like Colosio's assassination to hinder  Mexico's "return to the path of the revolution." Mexican  business representatives have pointed out that the assassination  is the result of efforts to destabilize the country, and warn  that it may disrupt Mexico's political life. Political  commentators are saying that Colosio's death will have  repercussions in every sphere of the country's political and  economic life, affecting its stability and credibility. (Madrid  EFE in Spanish 1635 GMT 24 Mar 94)    Economic analysts questioned by EFE say that Colosio's  assassination does not pose a political or legal threat to  NAFTA. They say, however, that it may slow down the flow of  foreign investments, which is one of the main requirements of  NAFTA. Our sources said the assassination will cause a panic in  the stock market, which will stabilize once a new candidate is  chosen. They add that if the PRI loses the elections, NAFTA  will not be threatened by the opposition parties, which have  said they will not annul it but will modify it. However, if  instability increases, NAFTA opponents in the United States may  request a revision of the agreement or even its annulment. Some  experts believe the exchange rate may also decrease due to a  lack of investments. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1922 GMT 24 Mar 94)</p>

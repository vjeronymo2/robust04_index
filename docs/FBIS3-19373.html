			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hasan Yalcin from the "Cuneiform Script" </F> column: "Can They Create More Division Than This?"]    [Text] I listened to the impressions of lawyer Nusret  Senem, who only yesterday returned from a visit to Diyarbakir  where he attended the court case against our Diyarbakir  correspondent Ahmet Sumbul, who was detained for simply being  AYDINLIK's correspondent.    Senem particularly stressed that he gathered his impressions  during extensive meetings with people from Hakkari, Van, and  many other places. This is what he said in short: "There is no  election atmosphere or campaigning in most of the southeastern  provinces."    Lawyer Senem's impressions are similar to the ones gathered  by Mehmet Bedri Gultekin, deputy leader of the Labor Party (IP)  and candidate for the post of mayor of Diyarbakir, who toured  Diyarbakir and a number of other cities in the region at around  the same time. Gultekin told AYDINLIK: "A depressing atmosphere  prevails in the region. People are afraid to talk about the  issues. Their primary concern is personal security. Everybody  is worried if he will be able to return home safely at night.  The masses have been sidelined from politics; there is no  debate on choices or any exchange of views."    Ostensibly, they [the Turkish authorities] are opposed to  the  division of Turkey and, according to their claims, are doing  their utmost to prevent division.    What are they doing?    They allocated almost one-sixth of the budget, that is 150  trillion Turkish lira, to procure arms, cannons, rifles,  bullets, helicopters, warplanes, and radars. They have  mortgaged Turkey's budget to the slogan "We will not allow  division." It is calculated that 20 percentage points of the 70  percent inflation is due to military spending.    The government acted with such devotion that it even threw  the parliament into flames and reshaped it as the 12 March  Parliament.    The number of yearly unsolved murders stands at 150. The  counterguerrilla has been given the tools to destroy society's  moral fabric.    The shadow a coup is getting thicker and hangs over the  regime.    And all this is being done to prevent the division of  Turkey!    Result: a geography of empty rural regions and cities with a  flood of street vendors and people. We now have Diyarbakir,  Batman, Bismil, and many other cities that are on the verge of  population explosions and explosions of misery and poverty; we  have mountains cleaned of villages, people, and forests.    How fortunate that they are against division! It is  fortunate that they have taken so many measures to prevent  division! Imagine what would have happened had they been  separatists!    It is the free-market policy that is dividing Turkey. We  have always been defending this truth. We always said that two  different laws and administrations are in force in the two  regions [western and eastern] of Turkey. Who can claim anymore  that the state of emergency regime in the region is simply a  temporary "emergency" measure? Millions of people have been  under martial law and the state of emergency for the last 10  years.    To put it figuratively, the existing economy-based division  creates the same economic contradiction that one would observe  between Greece and Bangladesh were they placed next to each  other within the same borders.    Now Turkey has entered an election atmosphere. The country's  western part is vibrant with American-style shows, whereas there  is no sign of this atmosphere in the east and southeast. "No  election campaign is going on in most southeastern provinces."    Any person traveling from Turkey's west to east could  clearly  see the minute-by-minute deepening psychological rift and the  changing atmosphere. There is no need for further analysis!  Now, even the elections are divided! There are elections in  the west and only silence and indifference in the southeast!    This is where the emphasis on a policy of violence has  brought the country. The state can now watch its masterpiece  with delight and pride.</p>

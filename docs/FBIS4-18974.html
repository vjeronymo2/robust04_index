			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gadi Sukenik, political correspondent] </F>   [Text] Turkey will intercede with the Syrian president to  arrange for secret contacts between Damascus and Jerusalem.  This was agreed on in talks held in Ankara today between  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his Turkish counterpart  Hikmet Cetin. A giant deal to purchase drinking water from  Turkey to supply water for the Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza  Strip was concluded in the course of the visit. Our  correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports from Ankara:    [Begin recording] [Sukenik] All signs indicate that a real  chemistry has emerged between Israel and Turkey. Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller told Peres this evening that her country will  become much more involved in our peace process and will  participate in any international presence in the territories,  and Peres welcomed her announcement.    The Turks will soon waive visas for Israelis and will sign a  series of cooperation agreements this year, first and foremost,  concerning a free trade zone with Israel. They are also  interested in partnership in the gas deal, if it goes through,  between Israel and Qatar.    In their news conference, the two foreign ministers did not  disclose the contents of their tete-a-tete talks in which it was  agreed that the Turks would attempt to help arrange secret  contacts between Israel and Syria, a rather problematic neighbor  of the Turks as well.    I sought comments on this information from the horse's  mouth,  Cetin. Incidentally, he believes that Israel will give back the  Golan in exchange for full peace.    [Cetin, in English] We will do our best, and we are doing  and will do our best in practical and to help. [sentence as  heard]    [Sukenik, in English] Trying to discuss it with the Syrians,  maybe?    [Cetin, in English] Well, at this moment, let's keep it like  this. We do our best in every arena, in every meeting, in every  talk, and we will continue to do that.    [Sukenik] Water was a key issue in the talks. At stake is  the purchase of huge quantities of drinking water from Turkey,  initially through international funding to meet the needs of the  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and in the second stage to meet  the needs of the State of Israel. The water would be  transported by sea, either in tankers or by huge water-borne  plastic containers known as medusas.    Peres pressured the Turks not to suffice with promises on  the  water issue. This evening he is scheduled to confer with  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and will return to Israel  tomorrow. [end recording]    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at  1700  GMT on 11 April carries a recorded passage from the joint news  conference held by Cetin and Peres, in which the latter states  in English: "As I understand, now in Cairo we have agreed that  the target date will be the end of this month, April. Then, I  think, there won't be needed much time to implement the  agreement. The agreement can be implemented in a very short  while."]</p>

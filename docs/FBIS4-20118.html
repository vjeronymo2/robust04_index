			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Upswing Came in the Fourth </F> Quarter"]    [Text] According to preliminary results of the national  accounting done by the Economic Research Institute (WIFO), the  Austrian GDP amounted to 2,109.7 billion shillings in current  1993 prices. This was nominally 3.6 percent more than last  year, but 0.3 percent less after adjusting for inflation.    The increase in overall labor productivity (real GDP per  working person) was again 0.2 percent lower than the year  before. In the course of the year the economy picked up  steadily, as we have already reported, and grew by 0.8 percent  during the fourth quarter. The fact that the recession was at  least partly alleviated in Austria is shown by the growth of  private and public consumption (plus 0.8 percent and 2 percent  respectively in real terms). In foreign trade with goods the  national economy lost 3.3 percent in real terms in exports and  3.5 percent in imports. Including services as well as  "invisible goods," the exports undercut the level of 1992 by 1.7  percent in real terms; imports, on the other hand, rose by 0.2  percent.    Prices for the available volume of goods and services rose  by  3.2 percent in 1993, which was again less than those for the GDP  at 3.9 percent. Given slightly declining import prices and  slightly rising export prices, the terms of trade for domestic  foreign trade once again improved compared with 1992.  <H5>  Construction Sector Experiences Revival </H5>   The Association of Austrian Industrial Construction  Enterprises (VIBOe) sees feeble signs of a recovery. While in  1993 they registered only a nominal increase in turnover of 1.7  percent to 123.875 billion, 1994 started out well. In January  turnover amounted to 5.198 billion schillings, thus being 10.8  percent higher than in January 1993. Of that 2.91 billion  schillings went to crafts and 2.288 billion to industry.    The "traditional" winter unemployment in the construction  sector continued to decline. At the end of January 1994 75,686  persons were employed, which is 2.4 percent more than during the  same month last year.</p>

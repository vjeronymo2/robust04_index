Representatives of the local governments of the Coastal  Region, Khavarovsk, and Sakhalin, and the central government's  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Fisheries Committee, and  the Chamber of Commerce are attending the meeting from Russia.

The working-level meeting held in the suburbs of Sapporo is  a  continuation of positive Russian-Japanese exchanges begun at  various levels last week.

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Business gives broad welcome to 'deregulatory measures' - Industrial reaction The chancellor's pledge to deliver a 'strong and thriving business economy' while keeping a tight reign on public spending was taken on trust by much of British industry yesterday. But while there was a broad welcome for his package of 'tax relief and deregulatory measures', there was some grumbling over particulars. There was disappointment, for instance, that Mr Clarke had refused to increase capital allowances as a way of boosting investment further. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the Budget 'scored well' by keeping tight control of public spending and borrowing and holding interest rates down as a basis for sustained economic growth. Mr Davies welcomed the chancellor's 'imaginative measures' for the long-term unemployed, particularly the reductions in national insurance contributions, and the extension of in-work benefits. Both measures are in line with CBI recommendations. At the Engineering Employers' Federation, which groups many companies hit by the recession, director-general Mr Graham Mackenzie expressed delight with the chancellor's plan to get people back to work through national insurance 'holidays' for employers taking on people from the unemployed register. In an early detailed estimate of what it could mean for the shop floor, the EEF estimates that on an average engineering salary of Pounds 17,000, the NI 'holiday' could allow an employer to invest approximately Pounds 1,700 a year on retraining. The EEF also said that the international competitive support which it had been seeking had been met in part by the cut in export insurance premiums and enhanced terms for export insurance for developing markets. The usually more hawkish Institute of Directors welcomed the chancellor's focus on the transition from unemployment to work. However, its head of policy Dr Ann Robinson said Mr Clarke had not gone far enough in effecting a much broader reduction in NI contribution rates and employment regulation. 'It's a missed opportunity. . . it's just bits of tinkering without getting to the heart of the problem.' Along with other organisations representing manufacturers, the Machine Tool Technologies Association's positive response to several measures was overshadowed by disappointment that a campaign for increased capital allowances failed. It said the chancellor had missed a valuable opportunity to take decisive steps to tackle the UK's structurally low levels of manufacturing investment. Elsewhere, it welcomed lower export insurance premiums, and proposals for handling corporate insolvencies - although it pointed out that these would have been more significant if they had been introduced in 1991. The Chemicals Industries Association broadly welcomed the Budget's emphasis on job creation and the control of public spending. But it expressed concern about a proposed tax on waste disposal in landfills and the likely increase in business rates in the north of England where many of its members have manufacturing sites. Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief executive said that the measures to help industry were 'understandably limited'. He added that he was 'disappointed the chancellor did not see scope to provide greater incentives for productive investment'. In the information technology sector, Mr Javaid Aziz, chief executive of the UK subsidiary of International Business Machines, was encouraged by a budget which he thought would stimulate investment: 'The government is firmly committed to a trend reduction in its borrowing. This means that interest rates will not rise as much as they might.' The motor industry was 'pleased' that the chancellor was continuing to seek to maintain stability in the economy with sustainable growth. Vauxhall said that it was a 'steady as she goes budget', and it left its forecast for the UK new car market unchanged for 1994 at 1.9m, an increase of 6.9 per cent, and 2m for 1995. The computing services business expects to benefit from measures to help small and medium-sized companies, while the introduction of electronics methods to pay social security benefits at Post Office represents a Pounds 300m opportunity for the industry.

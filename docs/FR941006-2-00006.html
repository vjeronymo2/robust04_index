Field service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A representative of the plant shall arrange to promptly visit the farm of each producer whose milk tests positive for drug residue, exceeds the maximum somatic cell count level, exceeds the maximum bacterial estimate, or does not meet the requirements for acceptable milk. The purpose of the visit shall be to inspect the milking equipment and facilities, to offer assistance to improve the quality of the producer's milk, and eliminate any potential cause of drug residue. A representative of the plant should routinely visit each producer as often as necessary to assist and encourage the production of high quality milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Sec. C11. is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A laboratory examination to determine the level of somatic cells shall be made on each producer's milk at least four times in each 6-month period at irregular intervals. Samples shall be analyzed at a laboratory approved by the State regulatory agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A screening test may be conducted on goat herd milk. When a goat herd screening sample exceeds either of the following screening test results, a confirmatory test shall be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) California Mastitis Test_Weak Positive (CMT 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Wisconsin Mastitis Test_WMT value of 18 mm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Milk shall be tested for bacterial estimate by using one of the following methods or by any other method approved by Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Milk shall be tested for somatic cell content by using one of the following procedures (confirmatory test for somatic cells in goat milk):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LETTERS;  </P> <P> LOTUS LAND OR LOCUST LAND?  </P> <P> Fifty years ago two slim novels appeared that put Los Angeles on the national  literary map. Nathanael West's savage portrait of Hollywood, "The Day of the  Locust," and the first of Raymond Chandler's seven hard-boiled L.A. detective  stories, "The Big Sleep," appeared within months of each other in 1939.  Chandler's achievement was to adapt the crime novel to the peculiar geographic  and psychic terrain of Los Angeles. West's achievement, the larger one, was to  transform and deepen the long-established but still crude Hollywood novel.  </P> <P> In the 1930s, when the talkies were invented, studio heads were scouring the  East Coast (and Europe) for writers who could construct dialogue -- as they  were for actors who could speak it. Nathanael West, one of the eager recruits,  made the first of his two sojourns to Hollywood in July of 1933.  </P> <P> A shy, lonely New Yorker ironically nicknamed "Pep," West had at the time two  books behind him, both commercial failures. He had been working as a night  manager in a Manhattan hotel owned by his father when "Miss Lonelyhearts," his  second novel, was purchased by Darryl F. Zanuck. Hired to do the screenplay,  West boarded a train for the coast, hoping to earn enough money in Hollywood to  enable him to continue as a novelist.  </P> <P> His brother-in-law, the humorist S. J. Perelman, was already in Hollywood,  having scripted the brilliant dialogue for the Marx brothers' films "Monkey  Business" and "Horse Feathers." West's first Hollywood encounter ended before  the year was up. His screenplay never materialized, and the novel was assigned  to a team of hacks who managed, alchemically, to transmute a brilliant gem into  a piece of innocuous fluff. When the picture, renamed "Advice to the Lovelorn,"  opened, the disheartened "Pep" West was on a train heading back to New York.  </P> <P> In 1935, he was back in Hollywood working as a salaried writer for Republic  ("Repulsive," as it was called by the writers) Studios, scripting B movies,  living in the tawdry Pa-Va-Sed apartment house on North Ivar Street and storing  up the material for the Hollywood novel he had been thinking about. His Ivar  Street neighbors were an assortment of Hollywood discards: has-been comics, bit  players, stunt men and prostitutes.  </P> <P> One night he came home and saw a prostitute kick what appeared to be a bundle  of laundry in the corridor. The bundle moved and a midget emerged from it. The  incident found its way into the beginning of the novel. The surreal ambience of  "The Day of the Locust," the grotesque "half world" of Hollywood outcasts and  hangers-on West painted, was grounded in observed reality.  </P> <P> West never harbored the illusion that what he did at the studio had anything to  do with art. Nor, he discovered, was the hack work to which he was assigned  easy. He wrote in a letter that "this stuff about easy work is all wrong. . . .  There's no fooling here. All the writers sit in cells in a row, and the minute  the typewriter stops someone pokes his head in to see if you are still  thinking."  </P> <P> West separated the two realms, working days in the "dream factory" and nights  on his novel. It was completed in 1938 and published in 1939. Despite the  praise of friends like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Dashiell Hammett, the book sold  exactly 1,464 copies. A year after its publication, West was killed along with  his wife (Eileen McKenney, of Ruth McKenney's "My Sister Eileen") when his car  ran a stop sign in the Imperial Valley and struck another car. He was 37.  </P> <P> The Hollywood that West constructed out of the materials of observation,  experience, and imagination was the symbolic center of an entire culture  cheated and robbed by the puerile fantasies of the dream factory. He said in an  earlier work on Hollywood that "everything that is wrong with the United States  is to be found there in rare purity." Hollywood was source and symptom of a  malady that was more than local. The novel is the severest literary indictment  of the Hollywood dream we have and the most far-reaching in its implications  for American culture. More relentlessly than other writers who were mining the  materials of Hollywood for fiction, West traced the tangled connections between  the fantasies produced by the studios and the fantasies so desperately pursued  by the masses of dream seekers.  </P> <P> The landscape of West's novel is littered with illusion. Whole neighborhoods  resemble movie sets, look like leftover props from completed or abandoned  movies. The studio back lot is the "dream dump," the "Sargasso of the  imagination." Beyond the studio walls the city appears as a vast annex to the  lots. It's as though the sets had spilled over onto the surrounding landscape.  Tod Hackett, West's spokesman, climbs to his apartment in the Hollywood Hills  past a melange of "Mexican ranch houses, Samoan huts, Mediterranean villas,  Egyptian and Japanese temples, Swiss chalets, Tudor cottages, and every  possible combination of these styles that lined the slopes of the canyon."  </P> <P> In this movie-like landscape, West's characters act out their roles. Teen-age  would-be starlet Fay Greener, dreaming of fame and glamour, shuffles her deck  of dream cards and draws a different role daily, playing everything from  Daddy's girl in a white sailor suit to tough whore. Meanwhile, her father,  Harry Greener, ex-vaudeville performer, tap-dances his way to exhaustion,  collapses, fakes his own heart attack and then dies from it.  </P> <P> The line here between living and acting has disappeared. Life has been reduced  to a series of roles. One becomes what one pretends to be. All the world is a  sound stage. Even the natural landscape is rendered in terms of a movie set.  The setting sun against the edge of trees appears like the "violet piping" of a  neon tube. The moon puts in a cameo appearance as a "bone button" poking  through a "blue serge sky." The organic world has been preempted, upstaged, by  the inorganic. Nature is the work of well-placed props, technical skill, and  effective lighting.  </P> <P> But illusion breeds disillusion, and disillusion breeds violence. While the  performers play out their roles, all those tired, jaded Midwesterners who "had  come to California to die" stare with resentment and burn with rage. They are  the cheated, the ones who have been fed on the dream and find that oranges and  sunshine are not enough to satisfy their palates. They are the ones who hang  out at airports hoping to see a plane crash and attend the funerals of  strangers hoping to witness some extraordinary display of grief.  </P> <P> When Hollywood dreams fail to materialize, a feeling of betrayal sets in, and  with it the kind of fury that erupts in the orgiastic mob violence that brings  the novel to a screaming halt. The thousands of bit players, those without  speaking parts, the locusts of the title, become, in the final reel, the  leading performers, tearing the Hollywood props down. It is one of the most  devastating last scenes in American fiction. If the American Dream is ever shut  down the way the Soviet Utopia recently has been shut down in Eastern Europe,  Nathanael West may turn out to have written the script.  </P> <P> Like Chandler but more profoundly than Chandler, West gave us a way of  "reading" the West Coast Metropolis -- a mythic, symbolic reading that stands  in direct opposition to the California-as-Eden myth fabricated in those same  years by the railroad companies, real-estate developers, city boosters, Chamber  of Commerce and the movies themselves.  </P> <P> California was not simply the land of the fresh start and the happy ending.  There was a dark, shadow side to the American Dream and to the intensified,  California version of it -- to the dream that one can escape the past, reinvent  one's life at will, be what one wishes to be.  </P> <P> The writers who would write about Los Angeles in the decades ahead -- Evelyn  Waugh, Budd Schulberg, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Alison Lurie, John Gregory  Dunne, Stuart Kaminsky and others -- all took their starting point from the  same sense of the dream gone haywire. The promise of new beginnings can be an  elusive one, can in fact sour into an invitation to sure disaster. One can lose  as well as find oneself in the fluidity of Southern California.  </P></p>

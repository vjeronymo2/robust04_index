			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Rich seams in a Wild West war  -Plans to revise an 1872 law on mineral excavation rights are fuelling a row between the US mining industry and the green lobby A battle is raging in the US Congress over legislation which could determine the future of the country's mining industry. At the heart of the debate is a law which allows miners to gain title to public lands for a nominal fee: a maximum of Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) per acre. Under the law anyone, from individuals to international conglomerates, is guaranteed the right to excavate, as long as proof of substantial hardrock mineral deposits is furnished. Mining industry proponents believe the sector should continue to receive breaks in the interest of maintaining and creating jobs. 'What's at stake here is nothing less than the survival of mining in this country,' says Jack Gerard, representative for the Mineral Resource Alliance, an industry organisation. 'If we make mining too expensive, we will drive the sector overseas.' Environmentalists, however, accuse the industry of hitching a free ride on the back of taxpayers and wreaking ecological havoc. They want a revision of the law which will demand compensation for use of the land and enforce tougher environmental regulations. At least some modification to the law is expected by early next year. Two versions are currently being floated in Congress. The Senate bill, favoured by the mining industry, would impose royalties of 2 per cent on minerals extracted. The House bill, favoured by environmentalists, would impose royalties of 8 per cent and impose stricter ecological standards. The law which has environmentalists on the warpath was created in 1872, when the US was a very different country. The federal government wanted to speed up settlement of the Wild West and created the mining law to encourage prospectors to try their luck on the great frontier. Visions of how western lands should be managed in modern America, however, diverge dramatically between environmentalists and the mining industry. Environmentalists see corporations ravaging the land without paying the government just compensation. 'Pollution from a copper mining site in Butte, Montana, extends 100 miles downstream in the Clark Fork river,' says Philip Hocker, president of the Mineral Policy Centre, an environmentalist group in Washington DC. 'The mining company left the tailings sitting there and every time the river rises, it kills off fish,' Hocker says. 'Or take Summitville, Colorado, where the mining company Galactic Resources poisoned 17 miles of river. It went bankrupt and US taxpayers had to pick up a Dollars 100m clean-up bill.' Proponents of the law, however, see entire communities being revived by mining activity. 'In Challis, Idaho, a molybdenum mine has just opened up again, and turned what was a modern day ghost town into a thriving community,' says Idaho's Senator Larry Craig, who has sponsored the 2 per cent royalty bill. 'The new school will open this fall, houses that sat idle for years are being sold, and the mine has created about 350 to 500 new jobs.' The storm over the mining law is part of a wider debate over the use of some 500m acres of land owned by the federal government in the western part of the country. The Clinton administration has launched several attacks on commercial use of public land since it came into power, including attempts to raise grazing fees for livestock and the blockage of lumber extraction. The president's approach on the public lands issue has met with mixed success. Industry is outraged over attempts to prevent the use of public land, while environmentalists are furious that the administration has not gone further to protect the areas. The Clinton administration's first attempt to throw out the mining law failed. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit had tried to prevent Canadian-based Barrick Goldstrike Mines from gaining title to 1,800 acres of public lands containing about Dollars 10bn in gold deposits in Nevada. On May 16, a federal judge, citing the mining law, ordered the secretary to hand over the title. 'This is the biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy,' says Babbit of the court rule. 'But these folks stole it fair and square.' Environmentalists are particularly concerned about damage to water sources. Substances like mercury, which can poison fish supplies, are often used to extract the metals. Toxic acid mine drainage, triggered by the exposure of ores to air, can also cause severe problems, especially if it reaches the ground water. Ecologists also complain about the air pollution created by smelters and the surface devastation mining can cause. Mining proponents say ecologists are hitting the industry at a time when it has already been weakened by slack metals prices. 'At a time of low world prices, the mining sector cannot afford onerous royalties,' says Linda Findlay, director of government relations for the copper mining group Phelps Dodge. 'We need to go where it's most advantageous to mine, and if it gets too costly in the US, we'll move our business overseas.' Other supporters of mining on public lands cite the need for metals and minerals supplies for national security reasons. 'We cannot afford to be entirely dependent on other countries for our mineral supplies,' says Senator Craig. The mining industry's trump card, however, is jobs. The 8 per cent royalties which would be imposed by the House bill would cost between 35,000 and 45,000 jobs in the sector, say proponents of the 1872 law, and more jobs would be shed in support sectors. Environmentalists claim these figures are bloated, but there is no question that the jobs issue has garnered much support for public land mining from western state representatives and senators. 'The 8 per cent royalty bill is a save-the-environment-to-heck-with-the-jobs approach,' says Craig. The Congressional battle which will ensue over the next few months is expected to be fierce. Royalties are only part of the debate. The House bill would give the federal government the right to block mining entirely, if activities cause more than 'minimal disturbance to the environment'. Mining companies are also nervous about tougher reclamation standards and the bill's insistance that cutting-edge technology be used whenever possible to minimise ecological damage. Although industry is solidly opposed to the House bill, it may emerge victorious. Public opinion has been rallying behind the revision. 'Our strategy is to try to create public indignation over the issue,' says Kathryn Hohmann, director of public lands of the Sierra Club, an environmentalist group. 'We're trying to get the message out that these people are tearing up public lands, and they're doing it for free.' The mining industry believes it has been the victim of misinformation. 'The propaganda doesn't take into account that a lot of public lands are already protected through the national park system,' says Jack Knebel, president of the American Mining Congress. 'This is not about mining Yellowstone.' However, Knebel concedes that the sector may be losing on the public relations front. 'It will be an uphill battle for us as far as public opinion goes,' he says. That the 1872 law will stand as it is seems doubtful. Mining companies will almost certainly be forced to pay something for the use of public lands in the future. What is uncertain is how high royalties will be and whether tougher environmental standards will be enforced.</p>

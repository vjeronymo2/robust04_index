			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel warns of lower revenue and outlines fares Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has been hit harder than expected by delays to the start of rail services. It said yesterday it expected its revenues for 1994 to be only a quarter of the Pounds 135m (Dollars 213m) figure which it was predicting as recently as May, at the time of its Pounds 858m rights issue. Analysts in London had predicted revenues might be cut to Pounds 90m-Pounds 100m. Eurotunnel shares fell 7p to 221p. Eurotunnel faces tough negotiations with its bankers when it starts to draw down its loans early next year. But it expects they will continue to provide backing, according to Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman. Analysts expressed surprise at the revenue shortfall and predicted the group would fail to meet its banking covenants next year. Mr Richard Hannah of UBS Securities said: 'To miss first-year forecasts by this kind of margin is upsetting to say the least. One wonders how accurate their future figures will be.' But Eurotunnel's main lenders said they remained supportive and were unlikely to force a cash crisis in the spring ahead of the peak holiday season. One leading bank lender, however, said: 'All we can do at this stage is sit and pray'. Sir Alastair commented: 'We have had a grim and very hard nine months and we have not delivered all the expectations in our (rights issue) prospectus. But we believe were are getting into a position of delivering the goods.' Eurotunnel announced yesterday that high-speed Eurostar services through the tunnel would start on November 14. This represents the final stage in the introduction of passenger and freight services and will bring the tunnel into direct competition with the airlines on short-haul routes. Eurostar fares for London-Paris will range from Pounds 95 return, provided a booking is made 14 days in advance, up to Pounds 195 for first class travel including a hot, three-course meal for an initial 'discovery' period lasting until next spring. Eurotunnel reported a Pounds 47m loss in the first six months of the year, most of it resulting from interest and financing charges and with a contribution of only Pounds 2m from the limited freight services which began in late May. But tight control on costs and savings made because services were started late had meant cash flow was Pounds 3m better than was expected at the time of the rights prospectus. Eurotunnel expects that by the end of 1994 its cash position will be Pounds 50m worse than planned. In spite of these setbacks, 'there is no actual or potential breach of our loan covenants let alone a default,' said Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer 'These estimates could pose technical problems when we draw down our bank loans but this situation is quite familiar to us and our bankers.' Sir Alastair denied there was any need for another cash call. 'No way will there be another rights issue', he said. 'We don't need one. Our way forward is with our banks and with our warrant holders later.' Eurotunnel expects to raise Pounds 200m if warrant holders exercise their rights. Cross-channel fares, Page 8; Lex, Page 18</p>

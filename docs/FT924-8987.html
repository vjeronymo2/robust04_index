			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: Dream turned to fiction - Anthony Curtis enters the private world of Graham Greene A WORLD OF MY OWN: A DREAM DIARY by Graham Greene Reinhardt Books Pounds 12.99, 116 pages 'I CAN only express a hope that readers of this book will put themselves in my difficult situation and treat me with indulgence, and, further, that anyone who finds any sort of reference to himself in my dreams may be willing to grant me the right of freedom of thought - in my dream-life, if nowhere else'. That was Freud speaking - in the preface to the first edition of The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) - and his sentiments are echoed by Graham Greene in this selection from Greene's dream journals. The choice of extracts was carefully made and ordered by Greene in the last few months of his life. Like Freud, and ever mindful of frontiers, Greene explains in his introduction that he felt a blessed sense of release in crossing from what he called the Common World to that private self-centred world - A World of My Own as this little volume is titled - the world of the sleeping dreamer. Readers of Norman Sherry's first volume of The Life of Graham Greene will remember the chapter 'Psychoanalyzed' where it was revealed that after his nervous breakdown, provoked by his sufferings as a public schoolboy, Greene underwent a course of analysis from Kenneth Richmond. Although basically a Jungian, Richmond believed in making his patients recall their dreams. If a patient had no dream to recount during a session he or she was asked to invent one. What better training could there have been for a future novelist? The result was that Greene began to keep dream diaries. None of these early diaries has survived but accounts of some of his dreams have. We read in Sherry of a Princess of Time with a troop of black-skinned girls who haunted Greene's sleep; and of nightmares involving sinister Chinese agents from whom Greene took refuge in a hut with an armed detective. The schoolboy crisis passed, but left its mark as Greene matured into a novelist with a highly developed sense of narrative. The nightmares were re-cycled as plots, especially the one about a man on the run, the obsession with pursuit. Through constant creative distillation into fiction, they were ultimately exorcised. But the habit of recording his dreams remained and itself became a kind of obsession. Greene suffered, unnecessarily, from the recurring fear of many novelists that he would one day run out of material, and he clearly felt that no potential source should be neglected. His companion Yvonne Cloetta, to whom he bequeathed the task of seeing the book through the press, writes in a foreword: '. . . he always had a pencil and paper at hand on his bedside table so that when he awoke from a dream, which happened four or five times a night, he could jot down key words that in the morning would allow him to reconstruct it'. Although there are still elements of terror, it is often as a bland, urbane, traveller to foreign parts, a remorseless globe-trotter that Greene emerges here. Greene the adult dreamer seems not so much a defenceless quarry being pursued by evil forces, but himself a pursuer - a latter-day Stephen Crane - hot on their trail. The dreamer frequently hob-nobs with politicians and world-leaders - Edward Heath, Mitterand, Castro, Yuri Andropov, Ho Chi Minh, even Oliver Cromwell - and he speaks his mind to them freely. He bandies words, for instance, with Khrushchev at a banquet in one of those dream exchanges that seem wittier at the time than in the cold light of day. As one might expect, religion is a frequent presence. Greene goes for a stroll around the Vatican garden in 1984 with John Paul II who was 'in turn very amiable and then very impatient'. That might, surely, be from real life. More in the realm of fantasy but highly revealing, was the dream in 1973 when Greene read in a newspaper that he had been appointed Archbishop of Westminster. 'I knew that I was quite unsuitable, but all the same I was rather attracted by the idea of taking part in some royal occasion a few days later, with the Archbishop of Canterbury'. The dreamer regularly up-stages everyone he meets, however eminent. It seems only natural that the contemporary theatre with which Greene had a love-hate relation should be another frequent source of dream-encounters. He was fascinated by a convivial figure like Ralph Richardson, wondering went on behind the facade of bonhomie. Charlie Chaplin, Peter Ustinov, Paul Scofield, Michael Meyer, and Peter Glenville, who directed Greene's plays, are all here. Farce frequently obtrudes, as in a dream about the performance of a play called The Game of Croquet in which Scofield slices a ball into the stalls, blooding a member of the audience in one eye. The work, containing quite a few laughs of that kind, is by no means the most significant book in the Greene canon; even so it contains a side of him not to be found elsewhere.</p>

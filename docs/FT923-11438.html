			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / 'Weak and fragile' upturn is claimed: Chambers of commerce find concern on interest rates - Growth forecasts revised down / Carmakers fear low August sales THE ECONOMY is slowly improving but the recovery is weak and uninspiring, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. The latest quarterly survey by the chambers provided a glimmer of good news on the economy following a series of pessimistic figures earlier this week. It found that order books in the domestic market for manufacturing and service companies grew, on balance, in the second quarter. 'The recovery is here, but it is extremely weak and extremely fragile, and it would take very little to knock it off-course,' said Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the chambers. A slowdown in the growth of exports and a flattening out in the rate of improvement of the service sector in particular raised questions about the sustainability of the recovery. During the second quarter, all 12 indicators of the survey - which covers 8,813 responses from across the UK - were either positive or less negative than they were three months ago. The survey suggested that small to medium-sized companies were leading growth in the manufacturing sector. 'There is room for cautious optimism that the economy is at least continuing to move in the right direction, albeit at a slower pace than could be hoped for,' said the report. According to the survey, high interest rates remained the biggest concern of business. Other fears included inflation, the price of materials and pay settlements in manufacturing industry. Only a third of manufacturing industries and a sixth of services industries said the exchange rate was a big concern. The survey also highlighted the continuing problem of skills shortages, with about a quarter of employers experienced recruiting difficulties in the second quarter. 'The potential for skill shortages to act as a brake on recovery remains, and underlines the dangers of complacency with regard to continuing training and development of the workforce,' the report says. The main points are: Home markets. More groups reported an increase in UK orders than a decrease but the performances of regions differed widely. The north-east and east Midlands continued to perform strongly, while order books in London did worse than in the previous quarter. Exports. Overseas trading conditions were increasingly difficult, especially for smaller companies. There were signs of a slowdown in exports, particularly for the service sector. Employment. Heavy job-shedding continued, but the rate slowed. For the first time in two years a small balance of service-sector businesses said they anticipated increasing the size of their workforces over the next quarter. However, the chambers warned that employer expectations often turned out to be too optimistic. Investment. On balance, companies revised their intentions to invest in plant and equipment upwards for the first time in 18 months. Capacity utilisation. Fewer than one in five companies worked to full capacity. Business confidence. This grew during the second quarter. British Chambers of Commerce Quarterly Economic Survey.

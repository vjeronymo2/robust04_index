			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: The picture of success - Tony Stone Images sells photographs around the world A picture may be worth a thousand words, but sometimes it can be worth thousands of pounds. Tony Stone Images, a photographic stock library, sold one image - which pictured the silhouettes of a group of business men walking across a map of the globe - 300 times in 1992 for a total of Pounds 30,000. Tony Stone, which supplies photographs to the advertising, design, publishing, travel and printing industries, has built its business on multiple sales of a core collection of 20,000 images, a fairly small number for an international photo-library. 'We determined that the best thing to do was to understand what subjects our clients wanted and find the very best possible examples of those images,' said Mr Simon Thornley, group managing director. With 75 per cent of its revenue earned outside the UK, Tony Stone is one of the few non-manufacturing, creative services companies to win a Queen's award for export this year. The company is among the top five photolibraries in the world, and the largest in the UK. Tony Stone's 1993 turnover was Pounds 18.5m and the company expects to bring in more than Pounds 20m in 1994. Its growth from an annual turnover of Pounds 3.6m in 1988 is primarily due to international revenue. When photographer Tony Stone founded the company in 1969, he peddled pictures around Europe, where the market was primarily for photos on 'chocolate boxes and greeting cards'. He began thinking about expanding the company's international market about 10 years ago. In 1984, Tony Stone acquired a small Paris-based photography agency. Since then, acquisition has been the company's international strategy. This strategy really took off in 1987 when Mr Stone sold 20 per cent of the business to 3i, the venture capital enterprise. In 1988 Tony Stone used the money from 3i's investment to buy a Chicago-based photo agency which serves the publishing industry in the mid-west of the US. 3i has since made four more investments in Tony Stone. From Chicago, Tony Stone built up its North American business which is now the company's most competitive single market. It has a turnover of Dollars 10.6m (Pounds 7.1m) The company now has wholly-owned offices in London, Paris, Munich, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Seattle and Toronto, and agencies that represent it in 15 other countries. Five hundred photographers actively take pictures for the company, while another 500 are on the books. Tony Stone recruits photographers who are willing to take the photographs that the company's clients demand, and the photographer earns 50 per cent of the profit of the sale of an image. Clients actually buy specific reproduction rights of the pictures they select, and must use them only for the purpose designated. Looking to the future, Tony Stone plans to invest in digital technology to enhance its products and its distribution to clients. With such technology, along with a software programme designed especially for Tony Stone, the company hopes to expand its products to include other intellectual property, such as film, illustrations and music. On the expansion front, the company is also looking eastward. 'We are not as strong as we would like to be in Asia,' said Mr Stone. 'We are now committed to an Asian strategy whereby we become a major presence from Korea to Japan.'</p>

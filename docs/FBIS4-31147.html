			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksa Crnjakovic: "Instead of Mesic -- </F> Mihanovic?"]    [Text] It went exactly the way we forecast it: Dr. Franjo  Greguric, Croatian parliament deputy and INA managing director,  managed to convince all those whom it concerned that he would  not be the right man in the right place, that is, the man to sit  at the president's desk in the parliament's House of  Representatives as a replacement for Stipe Mesic, who is now its  president, but who is to leave that post since he has switched  parties and cannot represent the parliament majority. Some other  honorable deputies also had their names in the pot along with  Greguric's, but, from what we have learned, the list has now  been shortened to one man -- Nedeljko Mihanovic, member of the  Academy.    Although Stipe Mesic has let it be known that he will not  leave the post of president of his own volition, since he feels  that as a member of another party he can defend the interests of  the state, some parliamentary analysts nevertheless forecast  that there will be a gentlemen's agreement. The fact is that the  majority party has the right to choose the president of the  parliament everywhere in the world.    As matters now stand, Mesic will withdraw, but he will not  drop out of the race. It is assumed, that is, that his new party  will nominate none other than himself as its candidate to oppose  the probable candidate of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] --  Mihanovic. There are also those who think that the strongest  opposition party, the HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party], will  offer its candidate as well, so that there would be three in the  race. The winner would be whoever got 70 votes, or, if two are  left, the one who gets one vote more than his rival.  <H5>  Balloting -- Open or Secret? </H5>   The fight for votes would be interesting. But the collection  of signatures to qualify to run in the race would be equally  interesting. The candidates must collect at least 30 signatures.  In addition to his own 17, the Liberal candidate might perhaps  also get two IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] signatures,  perhaps even a dissident or two from the HSS [Croatian Peasant  Party], and an independent like Vladimir Bebic. In addition to  his own 11, Mesic would also get six signatures of the SDP  [Social Democratic Party], perhaps even a few votes from the HSP  [Croatian Rights Party], and a few HND [Croatian Independent  Democrats] members "if needed."    If there are several candidates in the running, the  balloting  may be secret. Nevertheless, if nine deputies seek an open  ballot, the decision could be made to that effect. In that case,  the opposition might demonstratively withdraw from the chamber,  blackmailing the incumbent party and forcing it to accept a  secret ballot. They are not after all electing the president of  a soccer club, for God's sake, but the president of the  parliament!    And in that case everything becomes uncertain for the simple  reason that now the likely HDZ candidate does not enjoy enough  confidence and prestige among the oppositionists for the outcome  to be certain. If Mesic had been opposed by Dr. Greguric, there  would not have been that uncertainty.    Dr. Nedeljko Mihanovic is not a politician; as he himself  acknowledges, he simply wandered into politics because of his  strong desire to help in bringing down the Yugoslav state, which  he had always been against, and to help build Croatia, which had  always been his dream. He entered the elections out of  enthusiasm, simply in order to help the HDZ, in which he  enrolled at the very beginning, in whose program he placed  absolute trust, and whose leader he has followed. So, since he  never had political aspirations, nor was he ambitious, and since  he was pushed into political waters, Dr. Mihanovic, as they say,  is not comfortable there.    Which is no wonder when you realize that he has spent his  entire working life in the tranquil, shaded and apolitical  chambers of the Institute for Literature and Theater of the HAZU  [Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts], as a consulting  scholar. If he is nevertheless elected president of the  parliament, he will not have an easy time of it. Academician  Mihanovic is not young, and even by temperament he has always  been known as a tranquil man attached to books, not a potential  agile politician.  <H5>  Life Among Books </H5>   He was born on 16 February 1930 in Sitno Donje, near Split,  to father Marin Mihanovic, a farmer, and mother Marija. His wife  is a lawyer, they have a daughter. He has a Ph.D. in philology.  In 1958 he went to the Institute for Literature, where he became  director of the section for literature. "If I searched the world  over for a better position than this one, I never would have  found it. From this warm pillow of aesthetics and art, I put my  head on the very volatile political pillow," he was to sadly  acknowledge. He has been a reader of Croatian language at  Hamburg University.    He has published a number of essays, criticism, and  lexigraphical contributions, he has edited critical editions of  the works of Croatian writers, for example, the poetry of Stanko  Vraz, the poetic works of Vladimir Nazor, Govor Umjetnosti  (The Language of Art), Oblikotvornost i smisao  (Form and Meaning), Mjera i vrednost (Measure  and Value).    He won on the slate of the HDZ in Medvescak Opcina in Zagreb  and became a deputy in what then was the Chamber of Opstinas. He  is today a deputy in the House of Representatives. "I tried to  withdraw from politics right at the outset, but they said that  the interests of the Croatian state and the Croatian people were  at stake, and I am simply disarmed by that argument. I have an  aversion to politics, to officialdom, but I would never stand in  the way," says this literary historian, who is only afterwards a  deputy. Will this man of the pen get his bearings behind the  president's desk?    When you talk to Academician Mihanovic, you are aware of  having a poetic soul opposite you. If he becomes president of  the House of Representatives, how will he deal with the  political wolves and foxes? Will he be able to react quickly,  using every possible means? Or perhaps, that moderateness will  have a good effect on the hot passions in the parliament?</p>

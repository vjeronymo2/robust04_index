"We are supporting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks  on  the Patriot deployment plan," Pak said in a statement.    Foreign Minister Han, who is in Washington to meet with U.S.  officials, said Thursday that Seoul was reconsidering whether it  still wanted Washington to send Patriot missiles now that  tensions with Pyongyang have abated as a result of the North's  decision to allow inspections of its nuclear installations.</p>

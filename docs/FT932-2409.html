			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Long gilts surge as UK inflation stays at 33-year low LONG-DATED UK government bonds shot ahead yesterday on a combination of encouraging inflation data and the yield attractions for overseas investors. The benchmark 25-year gilt lifted  13/16 to 103 3/4 and dragged up the other long-dated maturities. Investors were inspired by the latest economic data showing retail inflation at its lowest for 33 years. However, it was a different story for short-dated gilts as the announcement of the latest unemployment figures pushed back hopes of an interest rate cut. The market had expected a reversal of the recent encouraging trend, and was presented with a fall of 26,000 in the month-on-month jobless level. The latest figure prompted investors to sell short-dated bonds and move out along the yield curve, which continued to flatten out. Since the beginning of the year, long gilt yields have fallen by around half a percentage point, while the short end has eased by only 20 to 40 basis points. This reflects the growing optimism for low inflation and the international perception of sterling's attractions. Economists said the UK offered the highest yield for very long-dated issues. They were sufficiently liquid to trade viably and 'duration' was increasingly the buzz word as investors moved to long-dated issues for the high returns. There are widely-held expectations of a gilts auction announcement today, probably of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 3.5bn of stock in the 2000-2003 maturity range, but possibly with a longer maturity considering the current trend. FRENCH government bond trading was enlivened by continuing interest rate cut optimism and a well-received auction. A belief that France will once again reduce short-term lending rates independently of Germany enabled dealers to shrug off any disappointment at the Bundesbank's inaction yesterday. Consequently, the yield curve steepened with two-year maturities firming slightly and the longer maturities easing. Dealers said an auction for FFr16.4bn of two-year and five-year paper yesterday was 'very aggressively bid'. There were FFr8.4bn of two-year bonds on offer, against FFr37bn of bids, and the auction for five-year paper was covered more than 3.5 times. GERMAN government bonds fell after the Bundesbank failed to cut its key interest rates. However, hopes had already been eroded before the close of dealing on Wednesday. Yesterday's reaction was perhaps more a petulant gesture than a heart-felt reaction. There was also an acknowledgment that the continuing strength of the dollar against the D-Mark had tied the Bundesbank's hands and rendered unfeasible a reduction in the Lombard and discount rates. On Liffe, September bunds ended the day only 7 basis points lower, at 94.83, with turnover relatively thin at 53,500 contracts. SPANISH government bonds saw early gains, but ticked back later on disappointment that the Bundesbank did not ease. Ten-year bond futures on the Meff traded as high as 91.50 at one stage, as Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, offered Catalonia's main nationalist party a place in a coalition government, thus easing worries of political in-fighting. However, the contract slipped back to close only 9 basis points higher at 91.24. US Treasury prices firmed at the long end in the wake of a downbeat report on economic conditions from the Phila-delphia Federal Reserve. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 104 3/32 , yielding 6.799 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent. Buying of longer-dated securities by both retail and dealer accounts was sparked by the Philadelphia Fed's report that business activity in its region declined sharply in June. The report indicated that the economy had slowed significantly from the end of 1992. The day's other economic data was also broadly bullish for bonds. Weekly unemployment claims were unchanged and the April trade deficit widened to Dollars 10.49bn, a substantially larger trade gap than expected. The widening in the deficit reflects the weakness of overseas economies, which means the US economy can not rely on expanding exports as a source of growth over the year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Following is a summary of  a draft of the ruling coalition's fundamental policy accord  proposed Saturday [16 April] by the Japan New Party of outgoing  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The ruling parties hope to  agree Monday on their policy accord to be carried out under a  new government led by Hosokawa's successor.    (Budget and Financial Reform)    Ruling parties will endeavor to speedily enact 1994 budget  bills on which the Diet has not even begun deliberations. The  ruling parties will endeavor to swiftly agree on drawing up of  1995 budget bills that should be consumer-oriented.    (Political Reform)    The coalition will swiftly submit bills to the Diet on  locations of 300 single-seat constituencies for House of  Representatives elections, based on advice to be made in six  months by a panel.    After enacting the bills, the coalition will carry out a  lower house general election under a new electoral system under  which 300 of the 500 lower house members will be elected from  single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through proportional  representation.    (Korean Peninsula and Japan's Security)    The situation on the Korean peninsula, including North  Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, is a quite serious  matter for Asian and Japanese security. The international  community should cooperate to impede the development of nuclear  arms on the Korean peninsula.    The coalition also thinks it important to resolve the issue  through persistent negotiations, in cooperation with such  countries as the United States, China and South Korea, not to  make North Korea isolated in international society.    Japan will secure peace and stability on the Korean  peninsula  and in Japan, abiding by the policy of the United Nations and  preparing for emergencies.    The coalition recognizes that Japan's Constitution has an  ultimate ideal based on the international collective security  under the UN. In order to secure world peace and Japan's  security, Japan will adhere to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty  and actively participate in UN peacekeeping activities.    (Japan-U.S. Relations and International Cooperation)    As a premise for solidifying friendly relationship between  Japan and the U.S., Japan will endeavor to reduce its trade  surplus step by step to an appropriate level.    Japan will swiftly enact international agreements and laws  related to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks under  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    (Aging Society and Tax Reform)    The coalition will establish welfare policies to tackle the  problems of the aging society. The coalition will promote  constructing infrastructures for higher standards of living.    On condition that bureaucracy and finance will be reformed,  the coalition will endeavor to secure a source of revenue to  offset a tax reduction. Japan will carry out by the end of the  year a drastic tax system reform which will center on reviewing  the balance between direct and indirect taxes.    (Deregulation and Other Economic Reform)    The coalition will adopt thorough measures to make the  recovery of the economy more certain. The coalition will change  economic structures by promoting information and communications  industries, new industries and small- and medium-sized  enterprises.    The coalition will loosen regulations in order to foster  international cooperation in the field of economic activities.    (Decentralization and Other Administrative Reform)    The coalition aims to simplify and streamline the  administration and positively promote decentralization.    (Development of Rural Areas and Agricultural Reform)    The coalition will endeavor to promote agricultural,  forestry  and fisheries areas in order to raise Japan's self-sufficiency  rates. The coalition will help introduce market methods for  production, distribution and sales system of agricultural  products and aid reform in agricultural cooperatives.    (Constructing Foundation of People's Lives)    The coalition considers education as the basis of the  country  and will endeavor to realize a society where men and women live  harmoniously and equally and where people can lead a fulfilled  life.</p>

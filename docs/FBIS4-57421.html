			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (DPA)-- The Dominican  Revolutionary Party (PRD) political commission has initiated  legal steps to challenge Monday's general election results.    A PRD delegation and a delegation from the Santo Domingo  Accord lodged an appeal this morning in the predawn hours with  the Central Electoral Board [JCE] requesting the vote count be  stopped, no more bulletins be released, and no winners be  declared in this election. The appeal to the JCE also demands a  new vote tally sheet count.    The Santo Domingo Accord is the name of the alliance that  nominated Jose Francisco Pena Gomez for president and Fernando  Alvarez Bogaert for vice president.    The PRD says there were serious discrepancies in these  elections ranging from switched voter lists to an illegal  increase in the number of voting tables at some polling centers.  The PRD also claims there are discrepancies between the numbers  published in public bulletins and those on diskettes [preceding  word in English] distributed to the parties.    The JCE scheduled a meeting for this afternoon to evaluate  the PRD's claims, particularly the alleged list irregularities  and the results given.    The last JCE bulletin shows Joaquin Balaguer ahead with  42.76  percent of the votes counted. Pena Gomez is in second place  with 40.95 percent. These results are for 80 percent of the  electoral tables throughout the country.</p>

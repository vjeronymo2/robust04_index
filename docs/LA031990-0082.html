			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE BRINGS TO LIFE AMERIKA'S LINK TO DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Amerika voted Sunday in its first free elections in more than 50 years.  </P> <P> Amerika, East Germany, that is.  </P> <P> Voters in this tiny Saxon village, population 131, filed into a bowling alley  converted to a polling station to choose among the 24 candidates contesting the  first free vote here since the 1932 elections that paved the way for Adolf  Hitler's rule.  </P> <P> Amerika, about 30 miles from Leipzig, got its name in 1832 when the owner of a  spinning mill that still employs most of the inhabitants sold some of his land  to the railway on condition that it build a station for his factory.  </P> <P> Some of the construction workers came from the United States, and thus the  village got its name.  </P> <P> The village has only one tiny food store, providing just the basics. For  anything else it is a 2 1/2-mile drive to the next community.  </P> <P> The only bar closed two years ago.  </P></p>

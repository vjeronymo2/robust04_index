			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / President's loose talk worries Guyana businessmen: The former Marxist is confusing investors THERE is peace, for the moment, between the office of Guyana's President Cheddi Jagan and the city council of Georgetown, the capital, which is dominated by the opposition party. Mr Jagan recently referred to the councillors as 'rascals'. The councillors said they did not fit the dictionary's definition of the word, and asked for a public apology from the president. They got it. But some of Mr Jagan's public statements are leaving a more lasting and confusing impression. He has described his own administration as a 'working class government guided by the ideology of the working class, which is Marxism-Leninism . . . and not the philosophy and practice of capitalism'. The statement created some consternation among local and foreign business, which had happily accepted Mr Jagan's undertaking to continue with the open market economic policies which he inherited a year ago when his People's Progressive party won an election and ended 28 years of government by the People's National Congress. Mr Jagan's later elaboration  - to the effect that while the PPP was guided by Marxism-Leninism, the government which it had formed was not - did not temper concerns about the real direction of economic policy in the English-speaking country of 850,000 people on the north-east shoulder of South America. 'We in Guyana understand President Jagan, and we do not take this statement seriously, but people outside the country will,' said Mr Hans Barrow, president of the Chamber of Commerce. 'We have simply elected a leader who speaks like this.' Mr Barrow said, however, that local business leaders would understand why foreign investors and potential investors would be worried, and would wait before commiting themselves when the president made such statements about ideology. He said there must be a two-way flow of business confidence. Dr Jagan, a 74-year-old dentist and once an avowed Marxist, moved towards moderation just before taking office. The concern among local business leaders is that, although such statements about ideology might not reflect the government's economic policy, they could derail the expansion of an economy which, by any standard, has been doing remarkably well. Several consecutive years of contraction ended in 1991 with growth of 6 per cent. According to Mr Asgar Ally, the finance minister, the growth continued into the first half of this year, and he has forecast expansion of 7.8 per cent for this year. Mr Ally said this was the result of expansion in mining and agriculture. Once-billowing inflation is projected at 6 per cent this year, helped mainly by stability of the currency following a 64 per cent depreciation which followed the floating of the currency in 1991. Mr Ally said higher export receipts, foreign investments and funds for balance of payments support had led to an improvement of Dollars 52.4m in net international reserves in the year ended last June. All this has not impressed the opposition PNC, which described the government's first year as 'a failure'. Mr Desmond Hoyte, the opposition leader, said the economy had lost its momentum and vibrancy. 'Business confidence has receded, there has been no new major investment, vital development projects initiated by my administration have been stalled, and . . . there is a marked paucity of disbursements from international financial institutions,' he said. 'There have been 33 new private investment projects valued at Dollars 26.1m in agriculture, mining and financial services since the government took office,' argued Mr Ally. There is continuing uncertainty, however, over the government's commitment to the programme of divestment of state enterprises inherited from Mr Hoyte's administration. It suspended the programme soon after taking office, saying it would investigate earlier deals. Mr Ally has since said the government is committed to divestment, and has listed 30 companies, including the national airline and the sugar company, which it wants to sell.</p>

Anti-Dumping Requirements for Conventional Gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(k)(8) of the Act requires that average per gallon emissions of specified pollutants from non-reformulated (i.e., conventional) gasoline use must not deteriorate relative to emissions from 1990 gasoline, on a refiner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis. Compliance is measured by comparing emissions of a refiner's conventional gasoline against those of a baseline gasoline. An individual baseline, consisting of fuel parameters and emissions, is developed for each refiner based on the quality of its 1990 gasoline, although under certain circumstances the individual baseline is the statutory baseline fuel parameters and emissions. To implement this requirement, EPA is promulgating requirements known as the anti-dumping provisions for conventional gasoline producers and importers. These requirements apply to all conventional gasoline producers and importers whether or not they also produce or import reformulated gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For ease in discussion, the term ``refiner'', as used in this discussion of the anti-dumping program, will hereafter include refiners, blenders and importers. Where appropriate, blenders and importers will be mentioned specifically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes the key features of the anti-dumping provisions (excluding the compliance and enforcement provisions applicable to conventional gasoline which are discussed in Section IX). The requirements discussed in this section are detailed primarily in &sect;80.90 to &sect;80.93 in the accompanying regulations. This section also highlights major comments received on EPA's proposals in this area and how this final rule differs from those proposals. Additional supporting information can be found in Section VII of the associated Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Emission Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(k)(8) of the Act requires that EPA promulgate regulations ensuring that, for each refiner, average per gallon emissions of VOC, CO, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and toxic air pollutants from its conventional gasoline do not increase over emissions from the gasoline introduced into commerce by that refiner in calendar year 1990. Emissions are to be measured on a mass basis, and each of the four pollutants is to be considered separately. Increases in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions due to oxygenate use may be offset by equivalent or greater mass reductions in the other pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations promulgated today address exhaust benzene, total exhaust toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from conventional gasoline use. In addition, under the simple model, refiner specific caps are set for sulfur, olefins and T90. EPA is not promulgating specific requirements for emissions of VOCs or CO, as EPA believes that the regulations promulgated herein, in conjunction with various other agency regulations and Clean Air Act requirements, will adequately meet the emissions limits for all four pollutants specified in section 211(k)(8). A detailed discussion of EPA's reasons for adopting this approach may be found in the Agency's July 9, 1991 proposal and, in summary, in the RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(k)(8) authorizes this approach as that provision requires that EPA promulgate regulations ``ensuring'' that conventional gasoline meet certain requirements on a refiner specific basis, but does not mandate that EPA promulgate regulations for each of the four pollutant categories. This provision therefore provides EPA with the discretion to fashion a regulatory program that ``ensures'' these results. While a relatively straightforward approach to this would involve emissions requirements for each of the four pollutant categories, it need not if the regulatory program otherwise achieves the required result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the language used by Congress in section 211(k)(8)(A) supports this interpretation, there are several other provisions in section 211(k) where Congress clearly specified that EPA promulgate various requirements, and such language is conspicuously missing from section 211(k)(8)(A). See, for example, section 211(k)(8)(D) (``The Administrator shall promulgate an appropriate compliance period *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(1) (``regulations shall require the greatest reduction in emissions *&blank;*&blank;* taking into consideration *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(2) (``regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall require that reformulated gasoline comply with paragraph (3) and *&blank;*&blank;* each of the following requirements *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(4)(A) (``The regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall include [certification procedures] *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(7) (``The regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall provide for the granting of an appropriate amount of credits *&blank;*&blank;*''). While EPA received several comments on the proposed conventional gasoline requirements, no one disagreed with the above interpretation of EPA's authority under section 211(k)(8)(A). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / SFO dismayed at lenient sentences The Serious Fraud Office has been disappointed by some sentences imposed by judges on convicted fraudsters, Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, said yesterday. He stressed in evidence to the Commons home affairs committee that the SFO had no role in the sentencing process but said officials had personal views about the kind of sentences that were appropriate. 'Our expectations are not always met,' he said. Mr Staple was being questioned over the outcome of prosecutions such as that of financial salesman Mr Roger Levitt, who received a community service order after pleading guilty to deceiving Fimbra, the regulatory body. Mr Staple denied that the SFO had contributed to convicted fraudsters receiving sentences that were over-lenient. He said prosecutors did not accept guilty pleas to only minor offences in order to secure a conviction and avoid a trial. Nor did they accept pleas in exchange for fraudsters avoiding imprisonment. He also defended the SFO against accusations that it could ruin a company by investigating its affairs and this becoming public knowledge. Search warrants were a normal investigative tool, he said. Damage to a company's reputation could be 'repaired' because, if nothing came of the investigation, most people would reach no adverse conclusions about the company.</p>

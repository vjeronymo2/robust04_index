			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Observer: So near, Sofia Jacques Attali - president of the London-based European Bank of Reconstruction and Development - is a man accustomed to getting his own way. He will be pleased therefore at the EBRD board's recent support - lukewarm though it was - for his wish that the bank's 1994 annual meeting be held in St Petersburg rather than Sofia. The Bulgarians had formally asked to host the meeting, but Attali is, for some reason, more enthusiastic about St Petersburg. The 23-member board has the final say-so, and it has voted to accept St Petersburg; but it is understood that the vote proved to be less than a ringing endorsement. Two members - the US and, understandably, Bulgaria, voted against; 11 abstained, and 10 voted in favour. So St Petersburg it is. Meanwhile, the Bulgarians have been asked to invite the EBRD to Sofia in 1996 (every other year the meeting is held in London), by which time Attali's first term as president will be over. Of course, he may always try to extend his presidency. But the Bulgarians may have something to say about that.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Tashkent Memorandum of International Congress of </F> Industrialists and Entrepreneurs": "From Economic Slump to  Stabilization of the Economy"]    [Text] The participants of the sixth meeting of the Council  of the International Congress of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, which assembled in Tashkent, the capital of the  Republic of Uzbekistan, to consider the prospects and mechanisms  of economic integration, believe that the greatest event in  recent times was the decision of the CIS states to create an  economic union. This qualitatively new step in international  relations opens up the real possibility for the Commonwealth  states to move away from economic slump toward stabilization of  the economy under market conditions. This opportunity must not  be missed, as has occurred more than once.    Unifying processes are supreme and predominant in the modern  world. New economic associations are arising on practically all  continents. An integral economic space of countries of Central  Asia is being formed. The Maastricht agreements are establishing  a higher level of integration of the Common Market in Europe. A  break in economic relations between our countries not only  weakens their position in the world, not only impacts on the  destinies of the people, creating the threat of degradation for  new generations, but also contradicts world trends.    Constructive calls for peace, harmony, and cooperation have  been heard from Tashkent more than once. Now, heading toward the  turn of the 21st century, the industrialists and entrepreneurs  who have assembled in this city, who united two years ago in the  International Congress, perceive with satisfaction both the  Moscow and Ashgabad (1993) agreements of the heads of states and  governments of the CIS countries concerning the creation of an  Economic Union, and firmly declare the intention to create a new  economic community step by step.    It is perfectly obvious that the Treaty on Creation of an  Economic Union denotes only the first stage of long-term and  multifarious work. Its effectiveness will in many ways be  determined by the quality of the mechanisms of the Economic  Union that are created and the actions of all the participants  in their implementation. The role of effective interaction with  the states and interstate organs of associations of  industrialists and entrepreneurs will be exceptionally great in  these processes. However, frequently there is no desire to  listen to them, or they are simply ignored.    The direct participation of industrialists and entrepreneurs  in the activities of the structures of the Economic Union that  are being formed would make it possible in a timely way to  coordinate decisions being made with the interests of the main  subjects of economic management--enterprises and organizations.    National associations-participants of the International  Congress of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs will actively  promote setting up civilized trade and forming a customs union,  a common commodity market, services, capital, and manpower for  the development of a mutually interrelated investment policy and  cooperation in the field of investment activity.    The paramount tasks are normalization of monetary and  settlement relations, consistent movement toward a currency  (monetary) union, organization of direct relations between  product producers, commercial and banking structures, and  development of production cooperation.    The Council of the International Congress of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs appeals to the heads of states and parliaments  that are members of the Economic Union not to delay ratification  of the signed treaty and to complete it in accordance with  existing constitutional norms by mid-1994. This will give a new  impetus to the intensification of economic reform and will  promote the acceleration of industrial production, the  stabilization and development of other vitally important  branches of the economy, and, on this basis, the strengthening  of the sovereignty of each state.    The emergence of a new nucleus of Eurasian economic  integration will stimulate the revival of economic relations  among the states of Central and East Europe, the Baltics, and  other countries, and responds to the basic interests of their  industrialists and entrepreneurs, and of all people.    Today the foundations of a unique economic community are  being laid at the juncture of Europe and Asia. The realization  of opportunities--this is the call of the times, the true path  to the formation of the economy of the 21st century that will  ensure for our countries and people peaceful development and  well-being and a suitable life for future generations.    The Tashkent forum of business people is for real  integration  processes and mutually beneficial cooperation!</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Rail union may be probed over discrimination claim THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality has told the RMT transport union that it must take action before September to prevent race discrimination or face a full investigation. Allegations of discrimination were made during a dispute two years ago between British Rail and Asian guards at Paddington station in London. Eight guards complained to the commission that they experienced discrimination in their attempts to become train drivers. It was also claimed that the union failed to take adequate action to support them in spite of repeated requests. BR has since been working on selection procedures with the commission, which has also been examining evidence of discriminatory practices by the union. The union said it would monitor the ethnic origin of its officials and members, take action to deal with under-represented racial groups and train officials to tackle discrimination in the workplace. The commission has agreed to suspend its investigation but said that if the union did not make satisfactory progress by the end of September, it might be issued with a legally enforceable non-discrimination notice. Ms Mary Coussey, the commission's employment division director, said the complaints by the Asian guards were 'a reminder that both sides in employment - management and the unions - have an equal responsibility' to work to eliminate discrimination. Mr Vernon Hince, RMT senior assistant general secretary, said the union welcomed the opportunity to work with the commission.</p>

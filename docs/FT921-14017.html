			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bear Stearns surges 400% THE DRAMATIC improvement in Wall Street's fortunes in the past year was reflected yesterday in the latest figures from Bear Stearns, the New York securities house, which announced a 400 per cent increase in fiscal second quarter profits to Dollars 77.4m, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The huge rise in quarterly profits, earned on revenues of Dollars 479m, up from Dollars 247m in the second quarter of 1990, was achieved on the back of buoyant equity markets and intense activity in the corporate stock and bond issue business. The most impressive performance came from Bear Stearns' investment banking division, which thanks to a sharp jump in earnings from the underwriting of equity and fixed-income issues, reported a 330 per cent increase in profits to Dollars 98m. Income from principal trading was also significantly higher compared to a year ago. Profits from trading mortgage-backed securities, Treasuries, corporate bonds and securities in the high-yield and bankruptcy sectors more than doubled to Dollars 238m.</p>

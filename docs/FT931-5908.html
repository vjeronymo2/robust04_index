			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Brussels to clear Perrier takeover THE European Commission is about to approve the takeover of Perrier, the French mineral water company, by Nestle, the Swiss foods group, write Andrew Hill in Brussels and Ian Rodger in Zurich. Brussels' competition authorities signalled yesterday they were broadly satisfied with the proposed sale of part of Perrier's assets to the French beverage company Castel for FFr750m (Pounds 94m). A formal go-ahead will have to wait until the French government, and the French town of Thonon-les-Bains have approved Castel as the new operator of the Vichy and Thonon water sources under their control. The Commission approved the Nestle-Perrier deal last July after a five month inquiry, but on condition the rights to certain mineral water brands and springs were sold to a single buyer. The Commission wants to encourage a new 'third force' on the French mineral water market, apart from Nestle and BSN, France's biggest food company. Commission officials said yesterday they did not think the sale of Thonon and Vichy would pose particular problems. Under the original deal with Nestle, Castel would have acquired the rights to Vichy, Thonon and Saint Yorre, but not Pierval, the fourth brand specified in the Commission's decision last summer. However, under pressure from Brussels, Nestle persuaded Castel to buy Pierval as well, and announced an amended deal last week.</p>

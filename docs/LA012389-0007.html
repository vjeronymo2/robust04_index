			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SEX ABUSE LINKED TO BRAIN  </P> <P> Half of sexual abusers of children have damage to the right temporal lobe of  the brain, and 40% of sadistic rapists have similar damage to their left  temporal lobe, according to psychiatrist Ron Langevin of the Clarke Institute  of Psychiatry in Canada.  </P> <P> The temporal lobes are the portion of the brain that mediates actions from  conception to execution, including the assessment of potential consequences. In  effect, Langevin said, they control the more primitive instincts of the central  nervous system.  </P> <P> Langevin performed computed tomography scanning and electroencephalography, as  well as conventional psychiatric assessment on more than 400 sexual aggressors  to reach his conclusion. He speculated that the damage was due to trauma before  or shortly after birth, but cautioned that interpretation of the results is  difficult because as many as half of the men he studied also abuse alcohol or  drugs.  </P></p>

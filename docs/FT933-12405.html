			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sideshow waits patiently for its moment in the spotlight - David Butler samples the mood and opinions of the people of Christchurch, the next jury to judge the prime minister CHRISTCHURCH knew yesterday that it was only a sideshow to Westminster. But it showed, in its own quiet way, the national relief at the end - if it is the end - of the Maastricht saga. Indifference rather than excitement marked most reactions. The politically active were, of course, entranced by Thursday night's drama and yesterday's votes, but chance encounters revealed boredom and disillusion. 'I don't know where Maastricht is,' complained a housewife. 'It's not Europe, it's pensions that worries me,' said an oldster. 'I can't stand these silly games in parliament,' was the barman's comment. The parties in Christchurch tried to campaign seriously. Each brought in a big gun. Virginia Bottomley came to support the Conservative candidate Robert Hayward. She and he agreed, unconvincingly, that all was well and that, once yesterday's business was out of the way, the electorate would face the real issues and stay with their traditional Tory loyalty. Mrs Bottomley tried vainly to persuade journalists, whose eyes were on the parliamentary drama, that health care in Dorset was especially excellent. Gordon Brown dutifully came to support Labour's hopeless campaign. Thursday's events, especially the 'bribing' of the Ulster Unionists and the wooing of Nicholas Winterton, provided a useful text. But even Mr Brown's eloquence may not be enough to prevent Labour's 12 per cent vote in 1992 from being squeezed into a lost deposit. For the Liberal Democrats Alex Carlile troubled the local party by predicting a landslide. He had forgotten the new campaigning wisdom - 'always understate your expectations'. But plainly everything in this, the 13th-safest Conservative seat, is going the way of the Liberal Democrats. They have far more posters in front gardens and far more helpers in the committee rooms and on the doorsteps. Although they have had to build their organisation from scratch the result is impressive and in Diana Maddock they have an adequate standard-bearer. Christchurch is the epitome of a comfortable Tory seat with pleasant villas and busy shops and a New Forest fringe. An afternoon canvassing with Robert Hayward revealed a multitude of unopened doors as well as a handful of Tory loyalists, a few civilised 'don't knows' and one Labour activist. Mrs Maddock was making a significant haul of Tory and Labour deserters willing to go public about their defection. A TV producer noted that Mr Hayward had become reluctant to be filmed canvassing because the doorstep reactions too often proved embarrassing. It seems that the landslide threatening the Conservatives in Christchurch owes little to Maastricht - but much to domestic issues and the sense of government disarray. Mr Major may have transformed the national situation by his well-whipped success in the Commons yesterday persuading his rebels not to vote for an early election. But, granted the phlegmatic, even indifferent attitudes evidenced in Christchurch, it does not seem that yesterday's outcome in Westminster will greatly affect the prospects for Thursday's by-election.

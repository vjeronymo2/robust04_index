			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Penalties proposed for late payments The government is proposing to introduce clauses in contracts covering more than Pounds 5bn of public-sector building work to ensure that construction companies and their subcontractors are paid on time. A consultation paper detailing the proposals, published yesterday by the Department of the Environment, received a mixed response from the building industry. At the heart of the proposals are procedures to ensure that payments made by the customer to the main contractor are passed on to sub-contractors which do the bulk of the work. Sub-contractors have complained that main contractors are delaying payments to improve their own financial position at the expense of specialist builders. The environment department is proposing that government building contracts include clauses requiring subcontractors to be paid within 17 days of architects issuing payment certificates. Payment periods for government departments and agencies to pay main contractors would also be fixed, the department said. The Specialist Engineering Contractors Group, representing sub-contractors, welcomed the proposals - but said it was concerned that there was no system to adjudicate when there was disagreement over the amount to be paid. It said main contractors often queried prices as a means of delaying payment.</p>

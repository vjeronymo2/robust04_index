			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 3 Jun (EFE) -- The press and an Ecuadoran  Socialist deputy expressed today their doubts about the real  existence and importance of the "Red Sun" ("Puka Inti" in  Quechua) Maoist group, which without prior notice decided on  Thursday to surrender its weapons to the Armed Forces in a  surprising capitulation ceremony.    Without stating it was all a farce but suggesting that the  group, allegedly linked to Peru's "Shining Path," was perhaps  formed by members of state security, the Ecuadoran press  reported today on the ceremony without commenting on or  addressing the issue in its editorials.    "Many doubts emerged following the surprising surrender of  weapons, which seemed to have been withdrawn from the armory,  for they don't have scratches or stains. Everything has taken  place so quickly that there are doubts about the veracity of the  ceremony and the true involvement of `Red Sun' leaders in acts  of war," the newspaper EXPRESO said.    "Red Sun: debut and farewell," was the headline of the  newspaper "HOY," while "EL UNIVERSO" recalled that the group  "appeared on the national scene three years ago with various  acts of urban violence without any repercussion." The only  actions staged by the group have been the hurling of dynamite  explosives at public buildings and some parties offices, causing  minor damage and no casualties. In addition, they painted  slogans on walls calling for the elimination of popular  organizations' leaders, whom they accused of treason, and  others, stating: "Be patriotic, kill an Indian."    During the ceremony, "Red Sun" Secretary General Ramiro Celi  congratulated the Armed Forces' military investigative work that  defeated his group, denied responsibility for the attacks or the  slogans on walls, and thanked among others, Socialist Deputy  Diego Delgado for his contribution to the peace process.    Hours before the ceremony and at the request of relatives of  "Red Sun" members, Delgado denounced before the press the arrest  and disappearance of these members. Nevertheless, the deputy  stated today that "the whole thing seems very strange, a real  trick to give the impression that supposedly an alleged  political-military organization had repented without ever firing  a single shot, not meaning that it would have been better  otherwise."    "All of this calls for deep reflection, and personally I am  not convinced. Their social and political origin, their  ideological and practical beliefs, and a host of other aspects  are completely foreign to guerrilla movements that have existed  elsewhere," Delgado repeated. Delgado then asked: "Does `Red  Sun' exist or did it ever exist as an organization of such a  size, which certain media presented in order to project a  peaceful image by other interests?"    An "Ecuavisa" commentator agreed with Delgado and was also  of  the opinion that "there are questions that remain in the air  that raise doubts whether in fact the group really existed."</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Water meter trials fuel debate NEARLY one household in 10 with a water meter has difficulty in coping with water bills according to a study published yesterday by Ofwat, the water industry watchdog. The findings are likely to inflame debate over the benefits of water metering. The report into the social impact of water metering also finds that 41 per cent of homes fitted with a water meter make no effort to curb use. Ofwat, together with the Department of the Environment, has thrown its support behind wider household metering to help cut demand for water in regions suffering shortages. Consumer groups say that poor families would pay more. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, pointed out that 91 per cent of those surveyed had no difficulty in affording their metered water bills. He said: 'Overall, the trials do not appear to have caused difficulties for many customers, and this is encouraging.' Advocates of metering will also derive support from Ofwat's finding that 35 per cent of households used less water under metering. Nevertheless, the National Consumer Council said the results bolstered its opposition. Ms Wendy Toms of the council said: 'The hardship of saving water will fall most on the poorest people.' The survey was based on more than 6,000 homes in England and Wales where trial meters have been fitted. Only 3 per cent of the 21m homes in England and Wales have a water meter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the scientific press conference in Berlin this  week, Post Office board member Dr. Guenter Tumm, Prof. Dietrich  Wabner of Munich Technical College, and experts from the  Bavarian Federation for Technical Control (TUeV), and the Energy  Management Research Center explained the technical advantages of  an innovative battery technology that the German Federal Post  Office wants to use in electric vehicles in the parcels service  starting in 1995. Developed by Jerusalem firm EFL, the battery  uses zinc-air electrodes and has successfully completed a  practical test with the Bavarian Federation for Technical  Control.    Whilst a 900 kilogram lead-gel battery gave a Post Office  electric van a range of only 54 kilometers, with a 650 kilogram  EFL battery it can travel 300 kilometers. Apart from the new  battery's drastically increased storage capacity, Professor  Wabner stressed in particular the system's operational safety in  the event of a short circuit. By contrast, some electric  vehicles fitted with sodium sulfide batteries had gone up in  flames when a short circuit occurred.    The remarkable thing is that even when cooled to minus 18  degrees the EFL battery can still give full power within  millionths of a second. Wabner described the EFL energy system  as the best battery in the world at present. Initially,  starting in 1995, not more than 70 vehicles owned by the Post  Office and various firms and municipalities will be fitted with  the new batteries. The field trial will serve to clarify not so  much technical as operational questions. Dr. Tumm said the  running costs of an EFL vehicle were initially 1.40 German marks  [DM] per kilometer, whereas a diesel vehicle today costs only 42  pfennig [0.42 DM] per kilometer. But Post Office experts  calculate that once the EFL batteries have been introduced the  price per kilometer could fall to 54 pfennig [0.54 DM] by the  year 2000.</p>

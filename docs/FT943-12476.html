			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): A brighter hue despite patchy paint finish - ICI Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest chemicals group, reports second-quarter results on Thursday, with estimates ranging from Pounds 110m to Pounds 130m against Pounds 96m for the same period last year. Most observers are bullish about prospects. ICI is benefiting from its exposure to the buoyant US and Asian markets, and the recovery in the UK. The only fly in the ointment is continental Europe, but US groups that have already reported second-quarter results have noted some upturn in demand there. Bayer, the German group, also issued bullish forecasts this month. The continuing improvement in demand will mainly help the industrial chemicals division and regional businesses. Prices for some of ICI's important products - such as PVC, titanium dioxide and PET - have been rising strongly in recent months. Brokers Kleinwort Benson expect the industrial division to post operating profits of Pounds 35m to Pounds 54m, with the regional businesses registering about Pounds 15m. Analysts will be listening out for chairman Sir Denys Henderson's comments about whether the upturn is driven mainly by rising demand. Another explanation is that the recent strong growth has partly been the consequence of stock-building, with customers buying supplies in advance of possible price rises. The only business that could report lower operating profits is the paint division. Brokers Kleinwort Benson are expecting flat results at Pounds 32m, but James Capel is predicting a fall year on year, because of a squeeze on prices in the UK decorative market. Raw material prices, essentially pigments, have also been rising, putting pressure on margins. Most analysts expect the interim dividend to remain unchanged at 10.5p.</p>

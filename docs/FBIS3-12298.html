			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>   [Text] Brothers: There is no doubt that the hideous crime  perpetrated by a clique of Zionist settlers, in collaboration  with Israeli military commanders, against our people in the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a natural outcome of the  continuation of occupation and the continuation of genocide  against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland. Within  this context, the crime puts the peace process at a serious  crossroad. This requires urgent measures to uproot its causes.    The ugly crime -- in which many martyrs and injured fell at  the hands of the herds of settlers who enjoy official Israeli  protection and support -- shows that peace will remain fragile  as long as the settlements are still there and as long as the  herds of settlers do whatever they want, carry out systematic  killing against our people, and encroach on their sanctities in  front of the international community which is turning a deaf ear  to its own calls on human rights and liquidation of colonialism.    The crime, which has shaken the conscience of official and  popular world public opinion, [break in transmission for 3  seconds] just denunciation, condemnation, and regret. It is a  warning to all those who are involved in the peace process to  review their stands and prove their credibility toward the  Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to their land and  homeland.    What took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque was not an accident,  but an organized crime for which the Israeli leadership -- which  is still alleging that it is concerned about security and peace  in the region -- is responsible. It is an ugly crime in which  the Palestinian blood was shed to put everyone to the test,  particularly the United States in its capacity as the main  sponsor of the peace process. The crime has dealt a severe blow  to this process and warns of dangers whose future dimensions  cannot be predicted.    The Ibrahimi Mosque crime shows the consequences of not  providing international protection for the Palestinian people  under the yoke of occupation. This issue does not tolerate any  indifference or postponement under the pretext of giving the  Israeli authorities enough time to look into the matter.  Experiments showed that the Israeli authorities only aim at  repressing and annihilating the Palestinians. They are far away  from the truth regarding their claims to provide them with  security and safety. Colonialists are only concerned about  their own security, entrenching their occupation of land,  annihilating its people.    It is time for the international community, particularly the  Security Council, to look into the bare facts and take urgent  measures to provide international protection for the Palestinian  people. It is also time for the United States -- if it is  really interested in rendering the peace process a success -- to  practice its influence on the Isareli leadership to bring it to  the right path. The Palestinian people have made great  sacrifices, but they never weakened. Palestinian blood was  never cheap and will never be so.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Women 'should retire at 65'  - At A Glance The state retirement age for women should be raised to 65, the same as for men, according to the recommendations of the Social Security Advisory Committee this week. The committee, which advises the UK government on pensions policy, said that the estimated Pounds 3bn in cost savings should be used to help the poorest pensioners, who are mostly women penalised by low pay and interrupted service in their working lives. The SSAC rejected pensions industry suggestions that the government adopt a so-called flexible decade of retirement between 60 and 70.

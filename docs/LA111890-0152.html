			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'UFO' WITH A MESSAGE  </P> <P> Dozens of startled San Diego County residents called police to report a UFO,  which turned out to be a blimp on its maiden advertising voyage.  </P> <P> Lighted brightly in the night sky to attract attention, the blimp did exactly  that Friday night.  </P> <P> Police in Chula Vista, National City and San Diego say they got a number of  calls from residents worried about an invasion from outer space.  </P> <P> "People think they are seeing UFOs and it's weird," a Chula Vista police  dispatcher said. "They see a big thing glowing in the sky and then want to call  us."  </P> <P> The suspected flying saucer is owned by San Diego-based Virgin Lightships,  which is part of the London-based business group that includes Virgin Atlantic  Airways.  </P> <P> It arrived this week at its new base at Brown Field in Otay Mesa, and was  making its first voyage through the area as an advertising ploy.  </P> <P> Company officials say up to 23 of the blimps are scheduled to be built within  five years to advertise for clients throughout the United States and Europe.  They rent for about $250,000 a month.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Nothing specific has been  decided between Japan and the United States on ways to resume  the stalled trade "framework" talks, a senior ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said Monday [9  May].    But Tokyo will use "every level of communication tools" to  break the impasse over the bilateral trade talks, Hideaki  Kumano, vice MITI minister, told a press conference.    Kumano said Tokyo and Washington have yet to fix a timetable  and other details for an early resumption of the deadlocked  framework negotiations.    Kumano denied speculation that vice MITI minister for  international affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu, the chief Japanese  trade negotiator for the framework talks, will meet high-ranking  U.S. trade officials during his ongoing visit to the U.S.    Okamatsu is in the U.S. only to deliver a speech at a  Chicago  college, and will return home Thursday, Kumano said.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Some poll tax bills 'distorted' INACCURATE estimates of councils' debt-repayment liabilities are seriously distorting poll-tax bills, the Local Government Information Unit claimed yesterday. A report into the calculations for last year's government grants to councils says that in several cases  - Manchester, Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and Woking in Surrey are three examples  - bills are more than Pounds 100 higher than they would have been if accurate figures had been used. In other areas such as Westminster, Croydon and Portsmouth, bills would have been up to Pounds 100 more than those issued after government Standard Spending Assessments were calculated. 'Every council in the country is affected by these miscalculations to some extent, ' the unit, a research body supported by trade unions and some councils, says. 'For some, they may be the difference between being capped and not being capped.' The poll tax has cost Scotland more than Pounds 1.6bn, becoming 'the most appalling waste of money in recent Scottish history,' Labour said yesterday.</p>

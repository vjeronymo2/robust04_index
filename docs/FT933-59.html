			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Revision fails to boost dollar A SMALL upwards revision to second-quarter gross domestic product figures in the US did little to enhance the dollar's fortunes yesterday, writes Emma Tucker. The revision, from 1.8 per cent to 1.9 per cent, was welcome but not enough to dispel market views that the economy is recovering only slowly. Dealers noted that even after the revision, the US economy would need to grow by around 2.7 per cent in the second half of the year to achieve the official 1993 forecast for growth of 2 per cent. The continuing strength of the D-Mark further hindered the US currency. The D-Mark was buoyed by the unwinding of political tensions in Russia, and by the Bundesbank's recent money market oper-ations, in particular its decision to set a fixed repo rate at 6.70 per cent, unchanged for three weeks. This signalled that an early German rate cut is unlikely. The dollar closed at DM1.6135, down from a previous DM1.6175. It was also slightly weaker against the yen, ending at Y105.15 compared with Y105.25. In New York the US currency fin-ished at DM1.6135 and Y105.05. European currencies were sluggish against the D-Mark, with the market still pushing for interest rate cuts to spur growth. The Portuguese central bank intervened to support the escudo, which was suffering from rumours about a change in the Portuguese government's foreign exchange policy. The escudo closed slightly firmer at Es102.8 from a previous Es103.2. Sterling opened lower and remained weak. D-Mark strength had much to do with its lacklustre performance, although next week's Conservative party conference is keeping prospects for an interest rate cut alive. However, many dealers are sceptical that Mr Kenneth Clarke is ready to cut the cost of borrowing. 'Thoughts of a politically motivated rate cut are remote,' said Mr Stephen Hannah of IBJ International, the Japanese securities house. Mr Brian Martin of Citibank, the US bank, agrees: 'A rate cut would damage the anti-inflation credibility of Eddie George and Kenneth Clarke, and they would not want a rate cut to look so obviously politically motivated.' The pound finished 1 1/4 pfennigs down at DM2.4400. Against the dollar it was little changed at Dollars 1.5125. With movement in European currencies slight, the troubles of the Canadian dollar caught the attention of some London analysts. They said the Canadian dollar had reached critical levels and was hovering close to CDollars 1.33 against the US currency. 'A drop to this level could signal a much bigger depreciation,' said one analyst. The Canadian currency's weakness has been prompted by concern over the budget deficit and the prospect of federal elections next month. It closed at CDollars 1.3285 against the US dollar.</p>

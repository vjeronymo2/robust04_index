Any process in that direction should be inseparable from a  democratic, participative, and pluralist summons [convocatoria],  Haroldo Dilla stated in his article "Cuba: The Crisis and New  Articulation of Political Consensus," published recently in  CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA.    He explained that any plan for development bears a cost,  while its viability depends to a large extent on the  establishment of a national consensus on the advisability of the  proposed objectives and the appropriate means of achieving them.    In this respect, he noted that the "capacity of the Cuban  socialist program to guarantee strong popular support has been  conditioned by diverse factors that cannot be solely or chiefly  attributed to charismatic mediation of historical leadership  summarized in the person of Fidel Castro."    The goals contained in the original revolutionary program --  public honesty, economic development, social justice, national  independence, substantial democracy -- left little room for  capitalist options, the expert from the nongovernment  organization recalled.    He indicated that for over one decade (1959-70) popular  political consensus was based on the implementation of measures  to redistribute income and power and got off the ground through  a system of extensive participation in national defense and the  revolutionary program in the face of U.S. hostility.    Later, the fate of Cuban socialism was linked to the  progress  of the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance,  which Cuba joined in 1972.    At the beginning of 1987, the process to correct errors and  negative trends, spearheaded by the Communist Party of Cuba, had  as it most novel element the attempt to articulate the return to  what was homegrown, with greater democratization and  institutional improvement of the political system.    Beginning in 1990, he noted, an emergency plan known as the  special period was implemented throughout the country, which  meant above all "guaranteeing national survival in an severely  hostile international environment given the permanent U.S.  aggressiveness against the Cuban socialist program."    Therefore, Cuba is facing, as are other Third World  economies, the so-called "export challenge" under  disadvantageous and contradictory conditions.    According to Dilla, the latter is seen at the international  level in an abrupt end of what was for almost three decades its  preferential markets and, at the same time, in the introduction  "into a world market that is competitive and economically  exclusive, politically conditioned by Washington's obsessive  hostility."    Internally, he stresses, it presupposes a costly and gradual  technological reconversion process and a vast reorganization of  relations among economic factors like production, distribution,  and consumption.    With regard to the latter, he believes that in order to  maintain liquidity within manageable limits (the excess money  supply is estimated at 10 billion pesos, which is the same  amount in dollars in accordance with the official exchange  rate), it will be necessary to disrupt traditional consumption  policy by reducing demand.    A basic principle of consumption policy since the 1960's was  the preservation of a rationed basic family basket at very low  prices, which presupposed subsidies that between 1976 and 1981  amounted to 2 billion pesos.    Furthermore, in spite of the virtues of such a projection,  under current conditions its modification is a basic premise for  economic takeoff, even if it means ethical-ideological  discrepancies.    The Cuban economic-financial situation was widely discussed  in late December by the parliament, which decided to meet again  in a special session early this year to study the possibility of  implementing measures aimed at solving the crisis and preserving  the conquests of socialism.</p>

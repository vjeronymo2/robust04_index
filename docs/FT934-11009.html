			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Warning over Somalia pullout Ethiopia and Kenya said yesterday that a pullout of US troops from Somalia before a peace settlement could plunge the country back into anarchy, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi and Ethiopia's President Meles Zenawi, ending two days of talks in Nairobi, called for an urgent African solution in Somalia. Washington has 10,000 troops in the UN-led multinational force of about 30,000, sent to Somalia to disarm rival warlords. President Bill Clinton plans to pull troops out by March. Mr Robert Oakley, the US envoy in Mogadishu, began meeting clan leaders yesterday.</p>

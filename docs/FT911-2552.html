			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Granada holders urge shift at top INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Granada, the television, leisure and computer services group, have warned the company that top-level management changes are needed before a planned Pounds 150m rights issue can go ahead. In particular, the position of Mr Derek Lewis, the company's chief executive, is under threat. He was told yesterday that shareholders and the group's merchant bank, SG Warburg, believe the changes must accompany the rights issue. Non-executive directors, such as Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed International, and Mr Alan Clements, former ICI finance director, are understood to believe Mr Lewis should go. Granada is planning the rights issue and substantial disposals - which could amount to as much as Pounds 200m - to cut its heavy debt. This stood at Pounds 436m at the end of last year, apart from the off-balance sheet commitment to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture. On Friday, Reed announced that it would not put any more money into BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake. Granada's bingo business, which has been doing well despite the recession, is a possible candidate to be sold off. The problems come at the worst time for Granada, which must submit its financial bid on May 15 to retain its north-west commercial television licence. Apart from recession, Granada has been affected by several doubtful diversifications over the past few years, including moves into electronics retailing and travel. The company also invested about Pounds 200m in computer services, which have not yet produced significant profits. Granada has also committed more than Pounds 130m to BSkyB. Group pre-tax profits last year fell from Pounds 164.1m to Pounds 121m and analysts are expecting something closer to Pounds 80m this year. From a 1989 peak on March 31 of 396p, shares now stand at 195p. Mr Lewis was closely identified with Granada's involvement in BSkyB and the move into computer services, although both policies had the backing of the company's board. At the moment, it seems unlikely that Mr Lewis will voluntarily resign and that he will instead fight to defend his position.</p>

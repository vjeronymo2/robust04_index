			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Reduction in fiscal deficits urged MANY industrial nations should take steps to reduce fiscal deficits to boost the confidence of financial markets and lay foundations for long-term growth, the IMF says. A big factor behind much of the world's economic fragility is the high level of state borrowing, which the report says has sapped the confidence of investors and reduced governments' opportunities to lessen unemployment by cash injections into their economies. Governments should reduce spending or raise taxes to 'achieve a more efficient balance of public and private spending'. The IMF says: 'By improving opportunities for private investment and reducing the cost of capital, fiscal consolidation raises countries' medium-term growth prospects.' The higher deficits have come about partly because of economic slowdown and partly because governments have failed to control rises in state spending unrelated to the economic cycle. In 1993 the structural budget deficits of Germany, France, Canada, the UK and the US are estimated by the IMF to be 2-5 per cent of gross domestic product. Italy's figure is 'considerably higher'. The structural budget deficit is defined as state borrowing excluding borrowing due to higher spending or lower tax revenues linked to economic weakening. In 1989, according to the report, the deficits were generally lower, at 1 to 3 per cent of GDP, in the US, France and Britain and 4 per cent in Canada, while Japan and Germany both had structural surpluses. Britain's structural budget deficit showed a particularly large increase in 1992 and there is likely to be another big rise this year, the report says.</p>

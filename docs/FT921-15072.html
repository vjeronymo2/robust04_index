			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Lithuanians turn attention to economy: Leyla Boulton returns to Vilnius a year after witnessing the clashes at the TV tower ONE YEAR after Soviet troops killed 13 people in a failed crackdown on Lithuania's independence movement, barricades still surround the Baltic republic's parliament. Despite winning independence last September, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the tenacious Lithuanian leader, says the barricades will remain until the last vestige of Soviet power - the army - leaves. But 12 months after unarmed Lithuanians confronted tanks at Vilnius's television tower, much of this nation's dramatic heroism - commemorated in mournful ceremonies in the early hours of this morning - has given way to the painful task of rebuilding a country after half a century of Soviet occupation. 'Everybody is tired and complains about how difficult life is nowadays, but nobody wants to go back to the way things were before,' said Saulius, a surgeon whose burning desire a year ago was for independence. Now his main struggle is coping with the effects of price liberalisation on a monthly salary of Rbs1,500; petrol, for instance, has increased tenfold to Rbs4 a litre, even before Russia begins to charge the Baltics the international market rate for oil. Once accused of devoting too much energy to battling Moscow at the expense of economic concerns, Lithuania has over the past year embarked on a wide-ranging programme of market reforms. But, as one of the newly appointed western ambassadors (who are one of the more tangible signs of Lithuania's independence) pointed out, basic problems remain in implementing changes. Not least of these problems is a lack of qualified staff. Lithuania is already receiving substantial technical assistance - a western-style banking system, for instance, is being built up with advice from Switzerland and the European Community - and there are promises of aid to develop transport and telecommunications infrastructure. Although Lithuania is still nervous about the continued presence of 60,000 troops which it wants out this year - leaving behind weapons to help Lithuania build its own defence force - the republic's main worries are economic. Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, the prime minister, said Russia was supplying only 40 per cent of the oil it promised to sell Lithuania this year. If no deal was reached, Lithuania would switch off electricity supplies to nearby Kaliningrad, the former German enclave which is now part of the Russian Federation. While he was ready for a switch to trade in hard currency at world prices, he said Lithuania was waiting for trade levels with Russia to settle before introducing its own currency, the litas. Meanwhile, Lithuania can only benefit from further delay in putting the litas in circulation. For instance, it needs help accumulating Pounds 110m worth of reserves to back its currency - but significant financial assistance from the west is likely only after July, when the republic expects to join the International Monetary Fund. Despite the uncertainties of living with the rouble, a start has been made on privatising the state-owned economy. Each adult has been given a voucher entitling him or her to Rbs10,000 worth of housing, shares in factories or stakes in small businesses. But Mr Vytenis Aleskaitis, appointed as minister for foreign economic relations to try to attract and help investors, says foreign investment is vital for Lithuania's survival as an independent state. The government hopes foreign investors will take over and re-equip many of the larger enterprises, bringing badly needed managerial and marketing skills to the hard-working and cheap labour force. This is why Mr Aleskaitis is asking parliament to approve a revamped investment law offering a five-year tax holiday for foreign investors who stay that long, and the right to lease land for 99 years or to buy it outright. The government recently produced a list of 114 factories, shops and restaurants which are for sale in hard currency. Nobody has bought anything so far, but the government is pinning its hopes on tourism, textiles, furniture and some high-technology plants inherited from the Soviet defence industry. Mr Aleskaitis also plans a closed tender for 20 companies to bid for a concession to exploit Lithuania's Genciai oilfields. These and other reserves were first exploited during Moscow's energy blockade of the rebel Baltic republic two years ago - but it will be some time before they can reduce Lithuania's dependence on oil imports. Finally, the minister is seeking better access to foreign markets lost after Lithuania was cut off from the world by Stalin. 'It is very easy to lose markets but very difficult to get them back,' he said.</p>

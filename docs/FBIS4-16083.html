			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 12 Apr -- In an interview with an IBERIA  correspondent, Giorgiy Chanturia, chairman of the Georgian  National Democratic Party [NDP], said an analysis of political  life in Georgia shows that the forces ruling Georgia, including  the head of state, have no political will. Eduard Shevardnadze  only acts as a passive observer of events. As a result, the  country's political course keeps changing, swinging from  pro-American to pro-Russian and back, which is ruinous for the  country.    Giorgiy Chanturia said the head of state was committed to a  doomed policy of personnel balancing in the state structures.  The notorious incident involving the chief of the Tbilisi  police directorate, Davit Zeikidze, was a result of that policy.  The two enemies ended up working in the same system -- the  Interior Ministry.    Giorgiy Chanturia described Shevardnadze's policy as a  policy  of the past, saying that Shevardnadze had a choice of either  being with the mafia or not. Since he lacked political will, he  had, in fact, become the mafia's hostage.    On the issue of the opposition, the NDP leader said it had  no  political will either; however, there were definitely some  outstanding figures in it. The West was now relying mostly on  three forces in Georgia -- the NDP, the Republican Party, and  the People's Front, among which, according to Chanturia, the NDP  had the priority.    On the South Ossetian problem, Giorgiy Chanturia said the  issue was a nuisance for the Georgian parliament, whose deputies  were involved primarily in buying property abroad and  accumulating wealth at home. The coolness of their attitude  towards that issue was demonstrated, for example, by their trust  in the quadripartite agreement on the settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The Abkhaz side had cheated Georgia  before and would do so again, concluded G. Chanturia.</p>

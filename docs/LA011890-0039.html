			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: DRIVER IS HUNG UP ON CAR PHONE  </P> <P> Like so many people, Robert Shoun acquired a cellular phone in 1990. This came  as a surprise to his friends because Shoun hates phones and he never answered  his calls in the past. There is no doubt that Bob is enjoying his new toy. I  know this because he called me four times in one day.  </P> <P> "How is everything with you?" he wanted to know.  </P> <P> "That's a stupid question, Bob. Why are you calling?"  </P> <P> "I got this new car phone and and I have to ring somebody."  </P> <P> "You never telephoned when I needed you," I told him. "Now I hear from you all  the time."  </P> <P> Bob sounded defensive. "Can I help it if I prefer to call from my car? I just  don't like doing it from the office."  </P> <P> "If you have to talk to someone, why don't you call your wife?"  </P> <P> "She isn't taking my calls any more. She took her telephone off the hook two  weeks ago."  </P> <P> "Surely you have some business buddies you can get in touch with," I said.  </P> <P> "I do," he answered. "But most of them are putting me on hold. They figure  anyone who calls from a car phone doesn't have much to do. Give me a break --  talk to me for the next three blocks."  </P> <P> "I ran out of things to say after you went through a red light on K Street last  week. Bob, you should have thought of how many people would answer your calls  before you bought the telephone."  </P> <P> "I did, but the ones I counted on let me down. You would think they'd be eager  to converse with someone who was gridlocked in front of the White House."  </P> <P> "They are, but sometimes your phone fades out on them, Bob, and that can be  very annoying."  </P> <P> "Who told you that my phone faded out?" Bob asked.  </P> <P> "Michael Kahme. He said that every time you ring him up, you pass a dead spot  and he can't hear a word you're saying."  </P> <P> "He's just making it up. I am known to everyone because of the clarity of my  calls."  </P> <P> "Bob, I have to go. Joe Califano is calling me from his car and he gets nervous  when I leave him hanging."  </P> <P> "It's OK with me. I'm going to be busy. I have to dial the weather service and  then 911 and after that the 800 number to order cut-rate Pavarotti records."  </P> <P> "You'd be better off forgetting the phone and listening to your radio."  </P> <P> "You don't understand. A cellular phone has to be used. I keep looking at it. I  know that there is someone out there waiting to hear from me. Maybe I'll call  information in San Antonio."  </P> <P> "Do you know anyone in San Antonio?"  </P> <P> "No, but it would be nice to find out how many Shouns live in Texas."  </P> <P> "Tell me, Bob. Have you ever made a call that couldn't wait until you reached  the office?"  </P> <P> "I don't think so, but I've made many to people who were terribly impressed  when they found out that I was calling from my car. Once you have a phone in  your automobile, others respect you for who you really are."  </P> <P> "That's probably true. Can I go now?"  </P> <P> "OK, but you better take my car number if you get the urge to talk to me."  </P> <P> "Why would I want to do that?"  </P> <P> "To thank me for using AT&amp;T."  </P></p>

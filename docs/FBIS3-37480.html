			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kondratyev from the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK allowed the specialists of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect nuclear  facilities. An IAEA spokesman said so on 15 February: This is  good news. The news has been awaited since last March when  Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and refused international inspections on  North Korean nuclear facilities.    I recall that such measures proclaimed by Pyongyang had an  effect of a suddenly exploded bomb. Many capitals, particularly  in Asia-Pacific countries, expressed worry over the measures.  This was because, eventually, nuclear weapons would keep  proliferating in the world.    The DPRK was, and is still suspected to have developed  nuclear bombs. Such suspicion has been strengthened after  Pyongyang took the step. The IAEA applied pressure on North  Korea with a view to resuming nuclear inspection.    A sound way of thinking was superior in Pyongyang. The  inspection will begin after two or three weeks. It is clear that  the decision of the DPRK leadership will exert affirmative  influence on the situation on the Korean peninsula and in its  surrounding areas.    First of all, it will open a road for North-South dialogue.  In addition, the decision will bring about a possibility of  proceeding talks between North Korea and the United States and  between North Korea and Japan for normalization of relations.    Most importantly, people hope that the result of inspection  will remove the suspicion on the intent of the DPRK to develop  its own nuclear weapons.    Washington and Seoul have already expressed their support  for  Pyongyang's agreement on IAEA's nuclear inspection. Pyongyang's  agreement will also arouse a similar reaction from the entire  world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana has  dismissed all striking Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation  staff. Addressing striking workers this afternoon in Mmabatho,  President Mangope informed the staff he had deccided to close  down the corporation. He told the staff he would make  arrangements for the collection of employees' pensions and  salaries.    Meanwhile, the situation in Mmabatho is volatile, following  sporadic incidents of violence at the University of  Bophuthatswana. Students stoned cars, mostly government cars,  and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets.    Earlier the Bophuthatswana government refused a request by  the Independent Electoral Commission to set up voting stations  for South Africans in Bophuthatswana. It has also refused to  allow electioneering in the state and to allow monitoring of the  election process.    The National Party [NP] says that President Mangope has  betrayed most of the values in which he believes. The NP said  the state had become the victim of an increasingly oppressive  system. The party said that Bophuthatswana was a tragic example  of what could happen when leaders made the wrong decisions.</p>

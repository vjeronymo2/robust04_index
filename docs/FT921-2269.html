			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / East German sports hothouse runs out of steam: The former communist state's athletics prowess will soon die along with its sponsors ATHLETES from the former East Germany won nine out of the 10 gold medals for the victorious German team at the Winter Olympics. This lent weight to predictions that united Germany will be a world-beating sports superpower. But trainers and sport club managers in east Germany are pessimistic. 'By 1996 Germany will be lucky to win five gold medals in the winter games,' says Mr Klaus Schonberger, manager of the TSC sport club in east Berlin. He said the foundation of the east German sport system, the selection and training of athletes at an early age, was being rapidly dismantled. Unlike communist East Germany, which used politicised sport to make its mark internationally, the Bonn government did not appear to want to use sport for prestige purposes. 'Democratically elected governments exist for four years and not until the year 2000 (when Berlin is vying to hold the summer Olympic games),' Mr Schonberger said. Several east German trainers have given up on the prospects of competitive sport in Germany and have gone to coach athletes in the US, Britain and Austria. Those who remain are mostly unemployed. The sport training centres which blanketed east Germany were closed down last year when the east German sport federation DTSB was dissolved. Mr Schonberger managed to retain a hard core of trainers for his club by registering them with the Labour Office for a job creation programme. Now they work for other city agencies but still find time to train athletes. Disclosures that east Germany's champion sprinter, Katrin Krabbe, and two of her teammates from the Neubrandenburg sport club falsified their urine samples in a doping inquiry have led to charges that east German sport was riddled with malpractices. Mr Schonberger, a former GDR record-holding hurdler, admitted that trainers worked with researchers in the Institute for Physical Culture and Sport in Leipzig - ironically, taken over by west Germany - to develop techniques using drugs for track and field athletes, swimmers and weightlifters. Mr Manfred Ewald, the supremo of east German sport, was fully aware of this, he said. Drug use, however, was no more prevalent in east Germany than in the west. The essential difference was that while athletes in the west were individually responsible for taking anabolic drugs, eastern athletes had little choice if their trainers told them to do so. The three suspended Neubrandenburg sprinters as well as their club and its sponsor are under a heavy cloud of suspicion. But club athletes and residents of Neubrandenburg demonstratively support the young women. Several of them suggested there was a western 'plot' against east German athletes. While east German athletes quickly adapted to commercialised sport in the west, many of them believe it is short-sighted even from the standpoint of sponsors. Jacqueline Borner, who trains at TSC and won the gold medal at the Winter Olympics in the 1,500 metre speed skating event, complained that sponsors were only interested in promoting top-performing athletes but not in backing promising young talent. Thus a leading German car manufacturer handed out cars 'left and right' to top athletes but did little to support the essential training of juniors. One of the reasons the east German sport machine worked so well is that it provided incentives for athletes. An Olympic gold medal was worth 20,000 Marks, silver 15,000 Marks and bronze 10,000 Marks, although not much could be bought for the money. Much more important was the opportunity to buy a car without waiting ten years or to get a new flat. The opportunity to travel was also an important inducement. The only others allowed to travel to the west were pensioners. Mr Ewald, whose east Berlin flat is filled with souvenirs of his travels as president of the DTSB, proudly recalled that he convinced Mr Erich Honecker, the East German leader, that top athletes, their wives and husbands, trainers and masseurs should be rewarded with cruises to Cuba and the Mediterranean. As the principal architect of the East German sport machine, Mr Ewald, a member of the party's central committee, was convinced it was one of the best investments the leadership made. Although he is relentlessly attacked by the German media over drugs use as well as for allegedly allowing the Stasi security police to harass athletes, he denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ewald insists that ordinary east Germans, who were sport-mad under the communist system, still believed in him although they had lost their faith in socialism.</p>

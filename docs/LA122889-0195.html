			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FILM UPSETS HUDSON'S SECRETARY  </P> <P> The former secretary to the late Rock Hudson said today he is upset over a  movie to air on ABC-TV that he said falsely depicts his role in the life of the  actor who died of AIDS in 1985.  </P> <P> Mark Miller, 63, said he believes that a film titled "Rock Hudson," scheduled  to air Jan. 8 as a "Monday Night At The Movies" feature, knowingly depicts an  inaccurate picture of the former secretary's role in Hudson's life.  </P> <P> "They've established my character as Mr. Big, (which) is not true at all,"  Miller said in an interview from his home in Hawaii. "My life is being made  into a lie."  </P> <P> However, the attorney for Konigsberg/Sanitsky Co., which produced the movie for  ABC, said the script is based on information from this year's court case  involving Hudson's former lover, Marc Christian.  </P> <P> Christian successfully sued the actor's estate, claiming that the fact that  Hudson had AIDS was deliberately kept from him while the two were involved  intimately.  </P> <P> Other parts of the script came from interviews with undisclosed sources,  attorney Susan Schaefer said.  </P></p>

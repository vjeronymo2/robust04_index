			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LUMP OF ICE MAY HAVE CAUSED CRASH OF BRITISH JETLINER  </P> <P> Aircraft specialists searching for the cause of the Boeing 737 crash in central  England say a lump of ice may have smashed the main fan of one of the engines,  the Times of London reported Friday.  </P> <P> The Jan. 8 crash near the village of Kegworth killed 46 people, including a  woman who died of her injuries Thursday.  </P> <P> The paper, however, said detailed analysis of the British Midland Airways  plane's two engines by engineers from the French company SNECMA have not  produced any conclusive cause for the break-up of the plane's left engine.  </P> <P> SNECMA builds the CFM-56 engines with General Electric Co. The engines of the  jet are being examined at the headquarters of SNECMA near Paris.  </P> <P> "Investigators are relying on two theories, that it was damaged after being  struck by a foreign body, possibly ice from the waste pipe of the forward  lavatory, or that the blades suffered metal fatigue," the report said.  </P> <P> "The engineers have found nothing wrong with the jet's right engine and no  evidence to explain why the crew shut it down," it said.  </P> <P> The crew shut down the right engine of the plane while the left engine caught  fire. News reports have said investigators are examining the possibility of  faulty electronics.  </P></p>

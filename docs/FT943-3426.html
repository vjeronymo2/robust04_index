			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Observer: Prickly Apart from being relatively costly exercises, corporate identity overhauls are not for the faint-hearted. There's always that niggling little worry that the new moniker translates into some obscenity in Swahili, for instance. At least Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels, which yesterday unveiled its four star establishments as a separate entity called simply Thistle Hotels, had only a new logo to worry about. But how to differentiate itself from Jardine Matheson, Encyclopaedia Britannica, The Scotsman and countless other outfits that also employ the prickly plant in their livery? A stickler for detail, chief executive Robert Peel spent part of the million odd pounds the affair cost on getting his minions to consult botanical drawings. The red and green design that finally emerged was derived from the Cotton Thistle, proudly pictured in yesterday's bumf (with its Latin name spelt wrongly). Apparently it's a particularly hardy member of the family and grows to a considerable height. It is also better known as the Scotch Thistle. But you can see why London's largest hotel operator chose not to mention that little detail . . .</p>

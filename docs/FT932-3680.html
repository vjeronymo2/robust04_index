			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Overseas earnings WHAT IS the position on overseas earnings when the period overseas does not cover a complete tax year? My son-in-law is taking part in a 12-month job exchange. He left early in January with his family, intending to return late in January 1994. Will his overseas earnings be subject to UK tax? There is some possibility that the other party to the exchange will not complete the 12 months, so that my son-in-law might have to return late in December. What would be the taxation implications? In addition, his house has been let. Does a shorter let than 12 months affect the tax position? If his 'qualifying period' (as defined in Schedule 12 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) does not consist of at least 365 days, his earnings overseas will be fully taxable in the UK. The circumstances in which his earnings may escape the UK tax net are outlined in a free pamphlet, IR58 (Going to work abroad), which is obtainable from most tax offices. The relief is statutory - it is not a concession. If the rent on the family home is paid direct to his bank account, presumably the tenant is deducting 25 per cent income tax from each payment. On the other hand, if the rent is being paid to an agent in the UK, the rent is doubtless being paid in full. If your son-in-law has not seen them yet, you could also ask the tax office for the free pamphlets IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting property), IR123 (Mortgage interest relief: buying your home) and CGT4 (Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses). If it looks as though his overseas earnings may be taxed in the UK as well as in the country in question you could ask for pamphlet IR6 (Double taxation relief). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

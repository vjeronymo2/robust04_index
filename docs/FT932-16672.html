			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Tide running out for royalty in Australia: Kevin Brown in Sydney sees a drift towards republicanism as old ties with Britain fade WELL MAY we say 'God Save the Queen', because nothing will save the governor-general.' So spoke Mr Gough Whitlam, former prime minister, shortly after his Labor government was dismissed by Sir John Kerr, the governor-general, at the height of Australia's worst constitutional crisis in 1975. Mr Whitlam was wrong (he lost the subsequent election in a landslide). But 18 years later, it seems that nothing can now save either the governor-general or his sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, from the rising tide of republicanism. Republicanism was not an issue in last month's federal election, which was narrowly won by Mr Paul Keating's incumbent Labor government after a campaign fought almost entirely on economic issues. But Labor's unexpected victory has unleashed a surge of support for constitutional change in the Liberal party, the larger of the two partners in the opposition coalition. Three state Liberal leaders this week urged the party to consider dropping its traditional support for the monarchy, including Mr John Fahey, premier of New South Wales, the most populous state. Other prominent Liberals remain sceptical. Mr John Hewson, the federal leader, has avoided committing himself, and Mr Jeff Kennett, premier of Victoria, describes republicanism as 'a tenth-order issue'. The party's freedom to change course is also limited by its need to avoid a split with the strongly monarchist National party, the coalition's rural-based junior partner. But the willingness of so many leading Liberals to contemplate constitutional change suggests the party will accept that a gradual transition to a republic is inevitable. Diminishing support for the monarchy reflects Australia's gradual drift away from its traditional links with Britain, the former colonial power, which annexed the continent in 1788. Australia achieved independence in a series of steps between the federation of the continent's six states in 1901 and the abolition by the UK parliament of its residual legislative rights in 1986. The monarchy has remained untouched largely because of the difficulty of amending the 1901 constitution, which says Australia's head of state is the British monarch, represented by a governor-general. Surveys suggest that up to 70 per cent of Australians now think this last link should be broken. But there are a host of problems to be solved before any practical steps can be taken. Most importantly, there is no consensus between republicans on what sort of constitutional framework Australians should be asked to accept. The simplest procedure would be to change the governor-general's title to president, and remove the requirement for the Queen to appoint him. This minimalist approach is favoured by the Australian Republican Movement, led by moderates such as Mr Thomas Keneally, the novelist, and Mr Malcolm Turnbull, a Liberal lawyer and merchant banker. However, the more radical Australian Republican Party says the transition should be used as an opportunity to abolish the states. Mr Ian McPhee, a former federal Liberal minister, has argued a similar case. Other ideas include the entrenchment of a bill of rights, notably lacking from the existing constitution, and indirect elections for the presidency, which would substantially increase the authority of the office. All previous attempts to amend the constitution have been determined by referendums under a provision requiring support from a majority of voters in a majority of states. Only eight of 42 proposals have succeeded, suggesting widespread agreement on a republican amendment would be crucial to success. But even a successful referendum proposition would be open to a High Court challenge by monarchists, who could seek to have it struck down on the grounds that parts of the constitution cannot be amended by this mechanism. This is because the document known as the Australian constitution is technically the ninth section of the 1900 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of UK parliament. Mr Tony Blackshield, professor of law at Macquarie University, says most lawyers think the referendum procedure does apply to the first eight sections. But only the sometimes unpredictable High Court could determine this. The alternative would be to use an obscure provision allowing federal parliament to pass any law that could have been made only by the UK parliament at the time of federation. But this section has never been used because it requires simultaneous consent of all state legislatures - seen by Mr Greg Craven, reader in law at Melbourne University, as a 'virtual impossibility'. A further complication is that it is unclear whether an amendment of the federal constitution would abolish the states' links with the Queen, which derive from colonial constitutions which continued in force after federation. This means a federal republic might have to co-exist with one or more monarchist states. Mr Keating plans to appoint a committee of six eminent persons to consider these issues and prepare the ground for change. Optimistically, perhaps, he has set it a target of 2001, the centenary of federation, to complete the job.</p>

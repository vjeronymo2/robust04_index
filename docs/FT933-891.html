The study adds that 'few employees have a clear idea of how to calculate the true value of a company car in their personal circumstances'. Based on an annual survey of 260 companies operating sizeable car fleets, it concludes that these are two of the main reasons why the number of employees taking up cash offers is low. 1993 Survey of Company Cars and Flexible Benefits Packages, The Wyatt Company (UK), 21 Tothill Street, London SW1H 9LL.

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> DERBIES MAKE CHARITIES THE BIG WINNERS  </P> <P> It was a huge turnout for the Santa Monica Halibut Derby last weekend.  </P> <P> Almost 2,000 anglers participated in the annual two-day charity event with 460  legal halibut weighed in.  </P> <P> Once again this year, Big Berthas (a $25,000 tagged fish) eluded the bait and  jigs. Tim Crissman from Newhall, fishing off Torrance Beach from his boat the  Mad-Gaffer, was grand-prize winner with the 31-pound 2-ounce halibut he caught  Saturday.  </P> <P> Crissman said he knew when he set the hook it had to be a big fish. It started  taking line immediately, and after it came aboard he was sure of first place.  </P> <P> Crissman has a choice of trips to fish in Alaska or Mexico.  </P> <P> Other winners of prizes and cash awards were William Northington of Redondo  Beach, landing his 20-pound 4-ounce halibut at the Pipeline; Robbie Henderson  of Redondo Beach, fishing at the El Segundo Stacks where he used dead anchovies  and decked a 20-pound 3-ounce halibut, and Scott Herman of Torrance, who was  drifting off Torrance Beach when he landed an 18-pound 7-ounce halibut.  </P> <P> The team event winners were Redondo Beach anglers Jerry Foot and William  Northington for catching four fish each.  </P> <P> Anglers turned in 25 fish with research tags attached and will receive $5 from  the Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> A ton of fish were caught in the fourth annual feed for homeless rock cod  derby.  </P> <P> As the First String returned to San Pedro, with 50 anglers who fished San  Nicholas Island, charity organizer Tony Salas said angling success stories were  too numerous to mention.  </P> <P> All were expert rock cod fishermen. Their entire catch will go to feed the  needy.  </P> <P> Bill Benn and John Moore of the Los Angeles Life Food Recovery Program said  this catch should feed 2,300 needy persons.  </P> <P> The jackpot and prize winners included Torrance angler Jack Komda for limiting  out first and second place for Jay Grossflam of Carson. John Glover won a  sheephead jackpot with his 15-pounder.  </P></p>

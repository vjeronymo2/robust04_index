			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Attacks in West Bank trigger army clampdown The Israeli army clamped a curfew on Hebron yesterday after violence between Jewish settlers and the town's 100,000 Palestinians threatened to escalate. Jewish settlers poured into Hebron on Thursday night, smashed windows and burnt a car after an Israeli soldier and a teenage Jewish settler were killed by Arab guerrillas in two incidents in the West Bank. The Israeli army, which forced Palestinians to stay indoors throughout yesterday as they conducted house-to-house searches, vowed to hunt the killers 'to the death'. The renewal of Arab-Israeli violence in Hebron, site of a mosque massacre in February, is a reminder of the fragile nature of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process despite recent progress. The Israeli army blamed the attacks on the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement, which opposes the peace agreement. If true, it marks a new wave of Hamas attacks; offensives were halted to see how the peace process unfolded. Hamas did not make its usual claim of responsibility, but has stated repeatedly in recent leaflets that it is not giving up its armed struggle against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands. In the two attacks a 20-year-old Israeli soldier, missing since Wednesday, was found dead in an abandoned Jerusalem house and a 17-year-old settler was killed when gunmen attacked a car near Kiryat Arba, the militant Jewish settlement outside Hebron. The killings overshadowed a successful summit in Paris between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, who shared a United Nations peace prize. Mr Rabin has recently expressed confidence in the PLO following military reports that Palestinian attacks on Israelis are substantially down since the implementation of self-rule in Gaza-Jericho. The attacks will fuel the campaign of the Israeli right-wing which wants the peace deal terminated and which is determined to resist the extension of PLO control across the West Bank. Israel and the PLO will begin to negotiate this phase of the peace process in Cairo on Monday. Mr Aharon Domb, a spokesman for the settlers, said yesterday: 'While the prime minister is busy receiving a peace prize, Jews are being murdered throughout Israel. The reality is staring him in the face but he refuses to see it.'</p>

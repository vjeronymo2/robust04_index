			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Building society net inflows soar in 'depressed' market BUILDING societies attracted Pounds 258m in a net inflow of funds last month  -just over double the net inflow in September, which itself ended three months of net outflows. But Building Societies Association figures for October underlined the fragility of the housing market as net new commitments fell slightly on the previous month. While some of the rise in funds was caused by savings for Christmas and the end of the holiday period, the association believes it also reflected societies' success in broadening their product range. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, highlighted the success of postal savings accounts, for which slightly higher interest rates than those on offer in branches are available. With mortgage demand low, one main concern is to maintain the existing pool of savings in the face of fierce competition from banks and other forms of savings such as unit trusts. But Mr Coles warned that the continuing subdued level of new commitments implied that net lending for the year would be below 1992 levels. Net new commitments came to Pounds 2.5bn last month compared with Pounds 2.6bn in September. 'The housing market is still very depressed,' he said. He added that transactions would be higher than in 1992 only because of the government's package of measures for housing associations at the start of the year, and urged the government to use the Budget 'to reaffirm its commitment to home ownership in order to strengthen the recovery'. There was also modest cause for encouragement among societies at the fall in repayments of principal as borrowers remortgage. Other recent figures suggest that building societies have been losing out to banks when people remortgage, as borrowers have taken advantage of banks' fixed-rate mortgages. October's figure for repayments was Pounds 1.8bn, slightly down on September's Pounds 1.9bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Swedish Air Environmental Villain </F> in Russia"]    [Text] Oslo -- Sweden causes more pollution in Russia than  vice versa.    This is the surprising result arrived at by Norwegian  meteorologists when they tried to measure air pollution which is  spread across borders.    Russia receives three times as much sulfur dioxide and  nitric  oxide from Western Europe than it exports to the West.    In June the states of Europe will sign a protocol on sulfur  emissions in Oslo. In the context of this meeting the  Meteorological Institute has compiled figures for cross-border  emissions which contradict the picture of Russia as the big  environmental threat.    It is true that the country's industry is highly polluting,  but because the wind mainly blows from the southwest to the  northeast most of Russia's dirt lands in Russia.    If we look at the balance between Sweden and Russia 6,200  tonnes of sulfur and 16,400 tonnes of nitric oxide are  transported from Sweden to Russia, while Russian pollution in  Sweden amounts to 5,600 tonnes of sulfur and 1,300 tonnes of  nitric oxide.    Sweden, Norway, and Finland are countries which because of  their location receive relatively large quantities of pollutants  from Russia.    If we look at the EU [European Union] countries they spew  forth 118,000 tonnes of sulfur which land in Russia, while we  receive only 600 tonnes of sulfur.    "The chaos in Russia means that the inhabitants there have  lost their balance. As a result they are an easy target for a  Western description of the environmental problems which is not  particularly balanced. We should not paralyze Russia by simply  concentrating on their environmental emissions," said Rune  Castberg, a researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute who has  specialized in Russia.    He predicts that Russia will become much more aggressive on  environmental issues too and will demand that the countries of  Western Europe clean up their own backyards before criticizing  Russia.    The sulfur protocol which environment ministers from 28  countries are to sign in Oslo on 13 June contains several new  principles.    These include the notions that natural vulnerability must be  taken as the foundation when it comes to regulating emissions  and that countries must work together to a much greater extent  to achieve the best results.    "The protocol makes it possible for a country like Norway,  which to a large extent has only automobiles and ships as  sources of nitric oxide emissions, to invest in purification  plants on the Kola Peninsula instead.    "As a result an overall reduction in emissions can be  achieved that is greater than would have been the case if  similar amounts of money had been invested in a pool of  environmentally sound automobiles which would after all only be  replaced in time," Thorstein Dreyer, information chief at the  Norwegian Environment Ministry, said.</p>

The cause of  the blast was unknown. The explosions at the Hercules Powder Inc. plant knocked  down trees, tore off doors and damaged many homes and about 80% of the  businesses in this township, about 40 miles west of New York City, officials  said. Three of about 40 buildings at the complex were destroyed and several  were damaged, a company manager said. Twelve people were treated and released  at a local hospital. Three were admitted with injuries ranging from back pains  to a concussion. All werein stable condition, supervisor Barbara Treverrow  said.  </P> <P> Best said the material that exploded Saturday was a smokeless propellant used  in shotgun shells.  </P> <P> He said that to limit damage, the plant is divided into compartments that each  contain no more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder. The gunpowder plant is located  in a somewhat isolated ara near several small towns.  </P></p>

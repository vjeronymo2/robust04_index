			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> FRENCH GAME PLAN TO GET FARMERS BOGGLES THE MIND  </P> <P> On the surface, the question of whether regulators in California and eight  other states should let something called Faraxa Corp. take over Farmers Group's  insurance operations is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Just the  application that Faraxa submitted to the Illinois Insurance Department to take  over Farmers' subsidiary there weighs 15 pounds, according to my bathroom  scale. The arguments in California's hearings between Faraxa and Farmers  lawyers are so nit-picky that they sound like doctrinal disputes between  members of a religious cult.  </P> <P> Why should you care about any of this? Because there is actually something  interesting going on here. It may even be important.  </P> <P> The fate of Faraxa's bid for Farmers will probably determine whether Sir James  Goldsmith, the Anglo-French takeover artist, ever gets to make his $21-billion  hostile bid for BAT Industries, Britain's biggest conglomerate. That would be  the world's second-largest takeover, after RJR Nabisco.  </P> <P> BAT, which bought Farmers last year, is trying desperately to keep Goldsmith at  bay, not least because his plans call for selling most of the company and  firing most of its managers.  </P> <P> If Farmers manages to foil Faraxa, Goldsmith's raid on BAT is probably  finished. If Faraxa wins, the fun begins.  </P> <P> Faraxa, the would-be buyer of Farmers, is one of about 6 zillion subsidiaries  of Axa-Midi Assurances, a French insurance company that also has industrial and  real estate holdings. Axa-Midi has made a deal to buy Farmers from Goldsmith if  Goldsmith takes over BAT.  </P> <P> What Axa-Midi is trying to pull off is breathtaking. The company wants to use  $4.5 billion, all of it borrowed money, to buy Farmers. In one stroke,  Axa-Midi, which doubled its size in 1988 when Axa took over Midi, would  redouble in size and transform itself from a European company to a worldwide  giant.  </P> <P> "I can no longer just be a poor little Froggie with my beret on my head,"  Claude Bebear (pronounced BAY-BAY-r), Axa-Midi's chairman, says with a Gallic  shrug. Given that Europe is turning into a single market, "if we remain only a  small French insurance company, we will have to fight to survive," he says.  </P> <P> The $4.5 billion for Farmers, plus another $1 billion that Axa-Midi plans to  use to buy into Hoylake Investments, the company that Goldsmith is using to  raid BAT, is a good part of the cash portion of Goldsmith's proposed offer.  Goldsmith can't make the offer, under British rules, until and unless Axa-Midi  gets regulators' permission to take over Farmers.  </P> <P> If Axa-Midi were an American company, its request to buy Farmers would be  laughed out of the place. Why? Because its corporate structure is  incomprehensible to mortal man. And because you can't get away with borrowing  100% of the purchase price for a takeover in these post-junk, post-Drexel  Burnham Lambert days, when debt is declasse.  </P> <P> Bebear's plan, which sounds almost reasonable when he explains it, goes like  this:  </P> <P> The $1 billion to buy into Hoylake comes from cash on hand, or relatively minor  borrowings by various Axa-Midi companies. To raise the $4.5 billion to buy  Farmers, Axa-Midi will borrow $2.25 billion from banks and the other $2.25  billion from Goldsmith by giving him promissory notes rather than cash.  (Goldsmith will turn the notes into cash to help pay for his BAT offer by  selling the notes or borrowing against them.)  </P> <P> Axa-Midi will repay the bank loans, plus interest, with dividends from Farmers.  It will repay the $2.25 billion of notes to Goldsmith, which have relatively  short maturities, from profits, from selling shares in group companies to  investors or by disposing of non-insurance assets, such as an African beer  company that it just unloaded for several hundred million dollars, or by  selling some of its enormously valuable landholdings in Paris.  </P> <P> "We can easily raise this money," Bebear says. "The $2.25 billion of notes  isn't really debt. It's deferred equity."  </P> <P> "He can call it deferred equity or whatever he wants, but it's still short-term  debt," says Charles Schultz, Farmers' senior vice president for finance.  Schultz, who has been sparring with Bebear for months, seems to have come to  like the man. "With his charm and our facts, it would be a slam-dunk," Schultz  says.  </P> <P> Does Bebear's plan make sense? Can he really raise the money he says he can?  Can Farmers pay Axa-Midi enough dividends to repay the bank debt without  putting its policyholders at risk?  </P> <P> Beats me. It's hard enough to analyze a U.S. insurance company because  insurance is complicated to begin with and firms keep entirely different sets  of books for stockholders and for insurance regulators. A French insurance  company, especially this one, is a mind-blower.  </P> <P> Axa-Midi has so many twists and turns that its structure looks like someone's  small intestine, not a corporation.  </P> <P> I'll spare you most of the details. All you have to know is that the company  ultimately is based on three large mutual insurance companies, which are owned  by their policyholders. Piled atop them is a group of controlled, partly owned  subsidiaries that own pieces of each other. The piece de resistance is  Compagnie du Midi, acquired in 1988 when its managers ran to Bebear asking for  protection against a raid by an Italian company, Generali-Assicurazioni  Generali. Axa now controls Midi by owning 60% of an Axa-Generali holding  company that owns a majority of Midi's stock.  </P> <P> See? Isn't that clear? And that's the simple version.  </P> <P> The point of all this is to introduce Axa-Midi and Claude Bebear, who are  clearly going to be heard from again. And to give you an idea of how the world  has changed to the point where European companies we never heard of can make  10-digit takeover bids for American firms. It's a sobering thought.  </P></p>

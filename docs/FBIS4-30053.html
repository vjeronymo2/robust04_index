			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, June 22 (YONHAP) -- About 1,000 students of  the Namchongnyon organization violently demonstrated Wednesday  afternoon here in Kwangju demanding the stoppage of what they  called "Namchongnyon suppression" and the release of arrested  students.    The demonstration lasted about one and half an hours  beginning around 5 P.M. along a street near the east ward office  near Sosok-dong.    When riot police fired tear gas canisters, the students  mostly of Chonnam and Chosun Universities countered it with rock  hurling, paralyzing traffics.    At an earlier rally held at the Chosun University campus,  the  students also demanded the safe return home of those Kwangju  students stranded in Seoul and asked for the disclosure of the  truth of the June 18 violent clash at Hong-ik University in  Seoul.    Meanwhile, at the reports of the renewed issuance of search  and seizure warrants against the two Kwangju campuses, students  erected barricades at their school gates to keep police from  entering.    So far 110 Namchongnyon students were arrested for their  part  in unlawfully stopping a passenger train and in the violent  clash of June 18 in which more than one hundred policemen and  students were injured.    Student arrests are likely to swell as the police,  determined  to ferret out all those who actively took part in the violence,  have launched an extensive manhunt.    Students claim that both the train stoppage and Hong-ik  University clash were the results of "traps" laid by the police.</p>

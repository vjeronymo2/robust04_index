			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNTING BANS  </P> <P> The article "Drawing a Bead on Hunting" (Part I, Aug. 28) would lead readers to  believe that the current effort to save the mountain lion is an anti-hunting  campaign. Such is not the case. The California Wildlife Initiative, if passed  by the voters in 1990, will not stop all hunting and is not intended to do so.  </P> <P> The number of mountain lions left in California is unknown. No scientific study  has been made to determine the number of these creatures left in our state.  Until such a study is made it would seem prudent to stop the hunting of  mountain lions.  </P> <P> Even so, the initiative has provisions for the taking of lions which endanger  people or kill rancher's livestock.  </P> <P> DAVID ADAMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

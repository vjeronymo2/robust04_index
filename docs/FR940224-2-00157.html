			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA will consider funding the following project costs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. NOTE: U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities overseas, the Standard Government Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Interpreters: For the U.S. program interpreters are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division. Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Consultants: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Room rental: Generally should not exceed $250 per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Materials Development: Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants. USIA reserves the rights to these materials for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. One working meal per project: Per capita cost may not exceed $5&hyph;8 per lunch and $14&hyph;20 per dinner, excluding room rental. The number of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two to one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Return travel allowance: $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note: All delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA/sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the Application Package. Confirmation letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Application Package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area offices and the budget and contract offices. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting officer. The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and development costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant; should circumstances prevent award of a grant, all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense. USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

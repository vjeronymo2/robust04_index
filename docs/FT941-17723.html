			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Major defends tax increases Mr John Major said yesterday that the government had to raise taxes and cut spending to ensure that the economic recovery would last. In his new year message, the prime minister predicted that unemployment would continue to fall as the recovery gathered speed. But he said he had to raise taxes because his overriding objective was 'sound finances', otherwise the recovery would be built on sand. 'The Conservative party remains the party of the lowest possible tax and the only party whose instinct is to cut tax and leave money with individuals and families and not take it for the state,' he said. 'We raise taxes only when we have to. They (opposition parties) raise taxes whenever they want to.' Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the prime minister's message deserved action under the Trades Descriptions Act: 'The party which has given us the biggest ever tax increases claims to be the party of low taxation.' Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said people would face higher taxes and higher bills in 1994. 'A typical family will have to pay Pounds 10 a week more in tax by the end of the year when all the new taxes come into effect,' he said. 'This extra burden of tax will rise to Pounds 16 a week more in April 1995.' In his new year message, Mr Smith warned that as many as 95 per cent of households would be worse off next year because of higher taxes. But Mr Major said it was time for the country to be more confident and said pessimists should be put 'in their box'. He went on to stress that the joint declaration on Ulster that he signed with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, made clear that the majority in Northern Ireland would decide whether they wanted to remain within the UK. 'The choice is for them alone,' he said. 'But one thing is certain: so long as they want to be part of the union, they have a rock solid constitutional guarantee that they can do so.' However, he sent a message to the men of violence: 'If you lay down your arms - and prove you mean it - then the way will begin to open for Sinn Fein (the political wing of the IRA) to come to the negotiating table. 'We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus is on Sinn Fein to pick it up. There is no excuse and no justification for them not to choose the path to democracy.' Mr Major concluded by underlining the importance he attaches to the European elections in June. 'The European Parliament matters to the future of Europe,' he said. 'So the elections matter to us. That is why we must fight them to win'. Companies should 'make exporting a way of life' in 1994, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said in a new year message to members. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said in his new year message that prospects for the coming 12 months were more hopeful than at the end of 1992.</p>

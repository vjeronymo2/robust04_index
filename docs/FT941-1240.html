			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (4): Just let the dears get on with it - John Dunn describes tools which are so reliable that they can be left unattended to cut metal all night if necessary, thereby doubling or tripling their productivity / Machine tools TAKE one fresh egg. Clamp gently in chuck. Insert 2mm diameter drill in spindle. Switch on machine and drill hole in egg. Wipe up egg yoke. Now tap end of drill lightly with hammer to blunt it. Repeat the drilling operation. Result? The machine tries to drill a hole but detects the extra force on the spindle caused by the blunt drill and stops before it smashes the egg. Drilling holes in eggs is not, on the face of it, the most profitable way to use an expensive computer controlled CNC machining centre. But cutting-tool maker Sandvik Coromant likes to use the occasional egg to demonstrate how modern machine tool technology can dramatically increase the payback from metal cutting operations for British industry. A machine sensitive enough to stop a blunt drill from breaking an egg can safely be left to cut metal unattended, all through the night if necessary, thus doubling or trebling its productivity. Mike Swaffield, general manager of Sandvik's automation division, says a typical CNC machine tool is only cutting metal for 30 per cent of the time. The rest it spends standing idle, waiting for materials, cutting tools, jigs and fixtures, for a broken tool to be replaced, or to be programmed for the next job. 'Our business is to unlock that 70 per cent of unused machining time,' he says. Sandvik Automation, formed last May, is breathing new life into an old machine tool technology - direct numerical control or DNC. This creates a factory floor network by linking each machine tool by wire or cable to a terminal in the design office. Programs can then be downloaded electronically to each machine, and data on a machine's performance fed back up the wires to a central monitoring point. But, says Swaffield, once that network is in place, then 'squirting part programs into machine tools' is just a tiny fraction of what can be done to improve machine tool useability. In the hands of Sandvik, the network becomes a conduit for 'paperless manufacturing' in which a range of software and hardware connects machine tools, inspection machines, tool room, design office, planning office and stores in a two-way flow of data. The aim, says Swaffield, is to ensure that the right tools and materials are always at the right machine at the right time to do the right job and to keep it cutting metal. With the basic CoroNet network installed, CoroPlan - 'containing everything Sandvik knows about cutting metal' - will plan the best way to do a new job and list what tools are needed and their settings. It will calculate to a fraction of a second how long the job will take. CoroTAS then takes over to look after all the tooling, ensuring that the tool room is told what tools to get ready for each job. It monitors tool inventory and tracks tools around the factory. Savings in tool stocks alone can pay for CoroTAS in a few months, says Swaffield. IntelliTool will keep an eye on tool wear, automatically stopping a machine and alerting the toolroom when a tool blunts or breaks. And the system will, of course, send out part programs and collect data on machine utilisation. When boiler maker Babcock Energy of Renfrew spent Pounds 100 000 on a CoroNet DNC system to link up 16 machine tools, it paid for the system in just eight months from the savings it made by getting programs to its machines electronically rather than by paper tape. 'We only sell systems on the basis that we will save the customer money,' says Swaffield. If only life were that simple for the machine tool makers. The demand for higher speeds, shorter cycle times, increased accuracy and reliability at stable, if not lower, prices have brought remarkable changes to machine tools. 'Today, we are selling machines that size for size are 15 per cent cheaper in real terms than the machines we sold in the mid '80s - and they are faster and more accurate,' says Mike Ryan, sales director of machining centre maker Cincinnati Milacron. At Cincinnati's Birmingham plant, the use of simultaneous engineering has led to the redesign and relaunch of its complete model range in just four years. Spindle speeds have leapt from 4,000rpm to 10,000rpm, doubling metal removal rates. Tool movements between cutting operations are three times faster, slashing 'chip-to-chip' time from 15-20 seconds to 5-8 seconds. 'A job can now be done in a fraction of the time it took 10 years ago,' says Ryan, adding that speed is all important in reducing a machine's hourly costs and shortening its payback. The quality of machine tools is now taken for granted, says Ryan. Thanks to lessons learned from the Japanese, reliability is no longer an issue. 'We have designed out the need for maintenance by doing away with mechanical assemblies such as clutches and gear boxes and reducing the number of parts by over 40 per cent. Our machines now only need an hour's maintenance a week.' Les Pratt, general manager of Yamazaki Machines in Worcester, says the machine tool industry today is giving its customers far more value for their money. 'They're buying a machine that in real terms is cheaper than 10 years ago. It will run longer with less supervision. 'It's faster and more accurate. But the problem remains that UK manufacturing industry is driven by the need for much shorter paybacks than its competitors. Payback is out of step with the operating life of a machine tool. As a result, industry is suffering from not replacing its ageing machine tool stock.' Next month Europe's largest lathe maker, the 600 Group, will unveil a new CNC lathe, the Colchester Tornado. It will cost Pounds 35,000, almost Pounds 15,000 less than the old Colchester 350 launched a few years ago with a similar specification. It is the outcome of extensive market research which showed that the drive by lathe manufacturers for more and more added value was pricing machines out of the range of small jobbing shops. Colchester decided to design the Tornado down to a price - an hourly rate - that small firms could afford. 'We're not introducing a cheap machine. It will cope with 95 per cent of the requirements of small engineering firms,' says managing director Colin Gaskell. 'We've taken out the features that don't add to productivity. The average job shop doesn't want a third axis or live tooling.' What they want, says the company, is low cost of ownership and until now none of the lathe makers has been addressing the small engineering firm sector. As a consequence, Colchester believes the Tornado will boost its low 6 per cent UK market share to 25-30 per cent within 12 months.</p>

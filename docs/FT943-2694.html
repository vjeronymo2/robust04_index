			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: An ill wind . . . It might have been a bad day for their company's shares, but directors at DRS Data Research Services spotted a golden opportunity when prices in the scanning equipment producer plunged by 58 per cent. On Tuesday, the shares fell 56p to 40p after the Milton Keynes-based company warned that uncertainty in education, its biggest market, had led to lower than expected sales. But after coming to market at 110p in a placing in May, the company's shares represented good value to at least two DRS directors. The following day, Stuart Henderson bought 50,000 at 40p, a holding of 0.14 per cent, through Jasmine Trustees, a trust of which he is the sole beneficiary. Amanda Croker, the wife of director Patrick Croker, acquired 46,000 at 43p to increase her holding to 51,400. By coincidence, the same day saw managing director Malcolm Brighton make a gift of 353,751 shares to the Milton Keynes Community Trust, which offers grants to local charities. He added that he would soon be buying more shares at what he called the 'silly low prices' to add to his 38 per cent holding of 13.5m. DRS supplies scanners to capture hand-written data, such as ticks on multiple choice forms, for processing by computers. Turnover for the 28 weeks to July 15 fell from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 5.76m as sales to schools, which account for 70 per cent of turnover, dropped by 14 per cent.</p>

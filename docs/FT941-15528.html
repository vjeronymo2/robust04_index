			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The regulation insurance needs (2) Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging', while accepting that my argument for a statutory regulator has merit, concludes that we should ignore it and carry on in the present direction regardless. This cannot be right. There is no difference between us over the requirement for effective regulation or over the necessity for public confidence in the eventual structure. But those objectives are unlikely to be attained unless we institute the best form of regulation we can devise. This is not 'foot-dragging' as you suggest but a genuine effort to do what is in the best interests of consumers. When a structure is finalised, Standard Life will work within that structure to make the best of what we are given. In the meantime, I shall continue to argue for getting it right rather than for just going with the tide. J Stretton, deputy managing director, Standard Life Assurance Company, 3 George Street, Edinburgh EH2 2XZ</p>

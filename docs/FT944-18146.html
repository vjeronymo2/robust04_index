			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Car part suppliers warned on Japan Britain's motor component makers were warned yesterday that their Japanese rivals were improving quality and productivity at more than twice the average rate in the UK. They were told at a seminar backed by the Department of Trade and Industry that most British suppliers would never catch up with the Japanese unless they made 'fundamental changes' to their practices. The companies have been taking part in a DTI 'learning from Japan' initiative. Teams of executives have been in Japan studying the work practices of the Japanese. As part of the initiative the performances of the Japanese and British components sectors are being evaluated by Andersen Consulting. Ms Betty Thayer, the Andersen Consulting partner most closely involved with the initiative, told suppliers: 'On average, world-class Japanese suppliers are improving their performance by more than 50 per cent a year compared to less than 25 per cent on average (for the UK industry).' The aim of the two-year initiative, started earlier this year and backed by Rover Group and Inchcape, is to upgrade nearly 10,000 smaller British components makers. They form one of the biggest elements in the economy, with turnover estimated at Pounds 15bn a year, nearly 150,000 employees and exports of Pounds 3bn.</p>

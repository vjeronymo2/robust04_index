			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVID GOLDFARB; RESISTED KGB ON FRAMING JOURNALIST  </P> <P> Soviet "refusenik" David Goldfarb, who successfully resisted KGB pressure to  frame a U.S. journalist as a spy but then was allowed to emigrate to the United  States in 1986, died Saturday of heart failure at age 71, his son said Monday.  </P> <P> Goldfarb died of heart failure at Georgetown University Medical Center in  Washington but had lived in New York City.  </P> <P> Frail and in ill health before he was allowed to leave the Soviet Union after  the intervention of American industrialist Armand Hammer, Goldfarb was a  biologist who had tried to emigrate to Israel in 1984. That was after he  exposed what he said was an attempt by the secret police to help them frame  American journalist Nicholas Daniloff.  </P> <P> Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., has often acted as an  intermediary in U.S.-Soviet affairs.  </P> <P> Goldfarb was a pioneer in molecular genetics who said he had been told by the  KGB that he and his family could fly to Israel if he agreed to hand Daniloff  incriminating documents. After he refused, his visa was revoked and he was  accused of seeking to smuggle national security material out of the country.  That accusation was later dropped but Goldfarb still was denied permission to  leave.  </P> <P> Daniloff, a U.S. News &amp; World Report correspondent, confirmed that scenario  after Goldfarb was safely on U.S. soil and praised the white-haired geneticist,  who suffered from diabetes and heart problems and had had his left leg removed,  as "one of the most admirable men I have ever known."  </P> <P> Most recently Goldfarb had been a visiting scholar at the National Institutes  of Health in Bethesda, Md.  </P></p>

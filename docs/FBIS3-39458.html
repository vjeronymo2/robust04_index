			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Erfurt (DPA) -- With a real economic growth of 11.6  percent in 1993, Thuringia was right at the head of the new  laender. The GDP's development was "quite remarkable" compared  with the average of the new laender, which was 6.3 percent, and  confirms the economic course that is being followed, Economic  State Secretary Friedrich Stamm said in Erfurt on Thursday [17  February]. According to first estimates by the Economic Overall  Calculation for the Laender Working Group, Saxony came in second  in 1993 with a real growth of 6.6 percent.    East Berlin experienced a growth of 1.8 percent compared  with  the previous year, Brandenburg 5.2 percent, Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania 5.9 percent, and Saxony-Anhalt 5.6 percent. In 1993,  however, Thuringia was clearly below the average regarding the  per capita GDP in the new laender, which, according to Stamm,  was 13,500 marks. Thuringia reached only 12,500 marks. Stamm  justified this primarily with the large number of approximately  70,000 commuters, whose performance is not included in the  calculations.</p>

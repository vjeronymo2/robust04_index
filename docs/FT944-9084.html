			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US pressure on trade deals in Asia pays off Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, yesterday witnessed the signing of Dollars 40bn-worth of contracts and memoranda of understanding between Indonesian and US companies in Jakarta. The deals, which came a day after the signing of free trade plans at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, reflect the more aggressive stance by the US government to helping US companies secure contracts overseas. 'In contrast to previous administrations, we have unashamedly been active in helping our businesses win contracts abroad,' said US President Bill Clinton in Jakarta. Many of the contracts have been in the pipeline for some time. Over the past few days the US has signed contracts and memoranda worth more than Dollars 400m in the Philippines and clinched deals worth more than Dollars 250m in Malaysia. Topping the list of deals in Jakarta was an undertaking between Esso Exploration and Production Natuna and Indonesia's state-owned oil company, Pertamina, to sign a basic agreement to develop the Dollars 35bn Natuna sea gas project. The US Eximbank Bank supported two of the Indonesian deals; a credit agreement with the ministry of finance to back a Dollars 65m AT&amp;T contract with PT Telkom and a memorandum of understanding with the forestry ministry to support Motorola's Dollars 104m forest radio communications system project. Britain's Philip's Systems made an initial bid for the latter project and completed the preliminary stages in implementing forest radio communication systems in Indonesia. However, it lost out to Motorola in the later stages. The Eximbank agreements are part of new US 'Tied-Aid' credit offers. The policy 'is designed to counter foreign tied-aid offers and level the financial playing field for US exporters,' the bank said. Tied aid is government to government concessional financing which is linked to the purchase of donor country exports. Other memoranda included a Dollars 2.6bn project for the supply of power equipment and services by Mission Energy and General Electric to Indonesia's first large-scale independent private power project, Paiton. Heard Energy Corporation headed a consortium of bidders which signed a memorandum of understanding for a Dollars 200m power project with Indonesia's directorate of electricity and energy development and PT Panha Serodia Pradhana. The companies are expected to build, own and operate a 200MW coal-fired power plant to supply Indonesia's state owned electricity company, PLN.</p>

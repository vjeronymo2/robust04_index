			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONORARIUMS PAY WAXMAN $60,300;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: MOST OF THE LAWMAKER'S FEES CAME FROM HEALTH INDUSTRY GROUPS. OTHER  OFFICIALS' FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS ARE ALSO MADE PUBLIC.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who chairs a House subcommittee on health  and the environment, received $60,300 in honorariums from special interest  groups in 1989, most of it from health industry associations, according to  financial disclosure information made public Tuesday.  </P> <P> Waxman, long a House leader in honorarium receipts, pocketed $26,808 of his  honorariums in accordance with House rules, which allow members to keep up to  $26,850 each. Waxman gave $31,296 of his honorariums to charity and used $2,196  to cover unreinbursed expenses incurred while earning the appearance fees.  </P> <P> Beginning in January, 1991, members of the House will be prohibited from  accepting honorariums from special interest groups.  </P> <P> Waxman's largest honorariums were $5,000 each from the American Health Care  Assn., Merck Pharmaceutical Co., the National Council on Prescription Drugs,  the Trial Lawyers Assn. and the American Veterinary Medical Assn. He also got  $4,000 from the Illinois Hospital Assn.  </P> <P> Under House rules, a member cannot pocket an appearance fee in excess of  $2,000. As a result, Waxman's gifts to charity came largely from the excess  money he received from these and a few other groups. He also was reimbursed for  travel in connection with many speaking engagements, but did not disclose the  amounts or where the speeches were made.  </P> <P> Waxman's was one of many annual financial disclosure reports made public  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who is under investigation by the Senate Ethics  Committee, reported that he stopped accepting speech honorariums in 1989 and no  longer takes trips at the expense of voter registration groups.  </P> <P> A millionaire, Cranston was criticized last year for his many all-expenses-paid  trips in 1988 on behalf of voter registration groups for which he was raising  money. His success in persuading Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the failed  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, to give $850,000 to these groups is one subject of  the ethics inquiry.  </P> <P> In 1989, however, Cranston took only two trips for which he received  reimbursement from outside groups. Both trips -- to Jamaica and Yugoslavia --  were paid for by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan group that runs programs  for top public officials.  </P> <P> Cranston decided to stop accepting honorariums from special interests early  last year when the Senate, responding to widespread criticism, was debating  whether to prohibit members from receiving fees for speaking and other  activities. Although honorariums will be banned in the House next year, it will  continue to be legal for senators to pocket up to $35,800 of such fees.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), another Senate millionaire, received  $27,000 in honorariums last year, $2,000 of which he donated to charity. He and  his wife also took four trips paid for by others: to Palm Springs at the  expense of the American Leadership Conference; to a tennis tournament in  Scottsdale, Ariz., paid for by the Hospice of the Valley; to Los Angeles, paid  for by the firm of Overton, Moore &amp; Associates, and to Brooklyn, paid for  by Bais Yaakov.  </P> <P> President Bush's report, also made public Tuesday, provided little new  information because he already had released his 1989 income tax return.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the report shed some light on the kinds of gifts that a President  of the United States receives: 51 neckties, 36 T-shirts, half a dozen sets of  fishing gear, an $800 cup and saucer from Nelson Rockefeller's widow, statues  of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from Disney Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer Michael D. Eisner, a football helmet, 14 pairs of cowboy boots, a  gingerbread house for his dog and 79 baseball caps. Those are among the gifts  that Bush kept.  </P> <P> Uncounted on Bush's financial disclosure form are dozens of gifts from foreign  leaders that Bush turned over to the government under rules that limit the  sorts of gifts he can accept. One of the few gifts from a foreign leader that  Bush kept is $125 worth of Christmas ornaments and children's books from Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa.  </P> <P> Among other financial disclosure reports made available Tuesday:  </P> <P>  -- Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) received $22,700 in honorariums and  took trips at the expense of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, the National  Cable Television Assn., the Committee for Immigration Justice, the Washington  Institute for Near East Policy, the Japan Society and the Religious Action  Center of Reform Judaism. He traveled to Tokyo at the expense of the Japan  Society.  </P> <P>  -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), a member of the Agriculture Committee,  received $28,150 in honorariums -- $10,000 of it from the Ceres Foundation of  Deerfield, Ill. He gave $8,000 of it to charity because of the $2,000 limit on  members of Congress.  </P></p>

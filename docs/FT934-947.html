			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Management: Programmed for success - So you're thinking of taking part in a business broadcast? Simon Ellis offers some guidance When sizing up a possible appearance on a business programme there are four important things you need to know: What is the audience? How big a ration of airtime are you likely to get? How much of your time is going to be taken up by filming/recording? And to what extent are the journalists/producers known for putting their slant on the programme, giving interviewees a rough ride, and heavy editing? Broadly there are two types of factual programme. First there are the daily news-driven variety which set out to report what is happening, offer succinct analysis and look forward to what may be about to happen. Second, there are weekly current affairs, documentary and investigative programmes which often set out either to prove a thesis, make a point or nail a villain. The first may seem more enticing, but just because a programme appears hard-hitting it does not mean you should avoid it. Also, satellite channels should not be overlooked. They have lots of airtime needing to be filled cheaply and are keen to get established in the potentially lucrative business market. Producers therefore need to persuade well-known business figures to be interviewed reasonably often - . they cannot afford to upset interviewees by roughing them up. Their lean resources mean they have to move quickly - inconveniencing you less - and they lack time to attempt any severe editing. The following, read in conjunction with the table, is a personal rating of the best-known business broadcast slots. MONEY PROGRAMME (BBC2). Its line will generally have been decided before filming and, if necessary, will have been approved higher up the BBC's editorial chain. It is essential to be clear about exactly what story they are telling before deciding whether to take part. Also, be clear about your role in the plot: are you Expert? Pundit/Critic? Victim/Loser? Target/Baddie/Aggressor? Running a stopwatch over two recent programmes showed that 14 of the 25 interviews lasted 30 seconds or less. In contrast, the reporter was speaking for roughly 60-70 per cent of the report. Bear in mind that the Money Programme, like other BBC current affairs programmes, may consume much time in fixing locations and interviews. On the plus side, it has the biggest UK audience for a business programme (1.3m viewers). It is also the most upmarket of all BBC Television News and Current Affairs programmes, beating Newsnight and Panorama with an audience which is 26 per cent AB. INVESTIGATIVE PROG-RAMMES, such as Watchdog and Checkpoint, are often fairly entertainment driven. They need a strong storyline and preferably a clear baddie to keep ratings and budget high. The higher the entertainment factor and the stronger the goodies and baddies element, the more careful you must be. There is a built-in tendency to see things from the standpoint of the consumer underdog rather than the corporate fat cat. BUSINESS BREAKFAST (BBC1). Criticised for too many features, not enough City news and too small an audience (average 300,000 at any moment), the show is nevertheless beamed to Europe and Asia on World Service Television's growing business output. Interviews are sometimes repackaged for later WSTV business bulletins if relevant to overseas viewers. You can expect a much better airtime ration than on the Money Programme. The most benign slot is the chatty review of the business pages which normally includes two appearances of up to three minutes each. Other items are of similar length. Interviewing style is a mixture of chatty and formal, and all straight down the line. FINANCIAL WORLD TONIGHT (BBC Radio 4). The late transmission time limits the audience (250,000), while the length (14 minutes) limits the number of reports. But the programme does offer the most comprehensive roundup of the day's UK business news on British airwaves. It is a news-driven programme which does not impose its own slant on events. Many reports use just a couple of clips. Straight interviews last 2-3 minutes. IN BUSINESS (BBC Radio 4). This programme has found that there is a craving for coverage of management issues, trends and fads. It steers clear of the City and economics and concentrates on the nuts and bolts of being in business. The programme is good at listening to interviewees and gives them time to develop their point. It gets a very good response from its audience (500,000 on Wednesday and Sunday combined) - with up to 1,500 letters and 300-400 requests for tapes and transcripts each time. MONEY BOX (BBC Radio 4). This long running personal finance programme - audience 750,000 - has a clearly established remit to provide independent advice about savings, investment, tax and benefits. It approaches from the consumer's point of view so expect tough but fair questioning if your charges or products are under fire from customers. Most straight interviews last two to three minutes. WORLD BUSINESS REPORT (BBC World Service Radio). The audience is motley but massive (120m). Popular in those parts of the developing world where domestic broadcasting is state-controlled or newspapers are slow to arrive. This is a fast-moving 24-hour operation pumping out three ten-minute programmes of business and market news plus shorter bulletins in the main World Service News Programmes. The World Service is justifiably renowned for impartiality and accuracy. THE NAMES AND THEIR COMPANIES (LBC). Chairmen or chief executives (no junior ranks) can expect an unrivalled opportunity to talk at length (15-18 minutes) about their company in relaxed fashion, but to a relatively small audience (30,000-35,000). SKY NEWS. Most of its business slots last between three and six minutes. Interviewees' clips generally last 15-20 seconds, although economists and analysts can expect up to 2 1/2 minutes to foreshadow the day. Most interviews are on location. WORLD BUSINESS REPORT. (BBC World Service TV). A 26-minute flagship programme, claiming the most comprehensive global audience, including President Yeltsin's economic adviser. Produced by the team which puts out BBC Business Breakfast, the approach is similar although the perspective is more international. EUROPEAN BUSINESS TODAY, FT REPORTS, WEST OF MOSCOW (all FTTV). All three are unashamedly international with a European flavour. They are interested only in big multinationals, especially the leading European players. There is less original shooting and heavier reliance on relatively long interviews. WORLD BUSINESS TODAY (CNN International). Two pacey half-hour roundups of the financial market from a US perspective. Claims one in three European business executives watch at least once a week.

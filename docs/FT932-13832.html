			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Downturn hits Japanese retailers' profits THREE leading Japanese retailers yesterday underlined the depth of the depression in Japan's consumer markets by reporting large falls in profits. Takashimaya, a leading department store group which this week opened a prestige store in New York, reported a 63 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to February 28. Significantly, Takashimaya blamed the fall on growing competition between retailers, which is cutting into profit margins, as well as the slump in consumer confidence, sluggish growth in incomes, and doubts over the employment outlook. Takashimaya's sales fell by 6.5 per cent to Y784.96bn (Dollars 6.885bn), operating profits plunged 58.8 per cent to Y7.28bn, and pre-tax profits slid 63 per cent to Y4.93bn. All but one of Takashimaya's stores reported sales declines, with the main outlet in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, recording a 9.5 per cent fall. In spite of the sluggish outlook for consumer spending, Takashimaya expects a modest increase in capital spending, to Y27bn. It plans to open stores in Singapore and Taiwan this year. The company's expansion programme has left it carrying a heavy depreciation charge. Sanwa Bank, the group's main bank, has moved Mr Kazui Nishina, its vice-president, to become Takashimaya's vice-president, signalling an intensification of its involvement in efforts to restructure Takashimaya. Sogo, another Japanese department store operator which has expanded rapidly since the late 1980s, reported a 47.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y3.82bn for the year to the end of February. Sogo's sales fell by 9.8 per cent to Y280.04bn, mainly due to a 13.4 per cent fall in sales of luxury goods such as jewellery and paintings. Daiei, the supermarket operator reported a 12.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to Y24bn, in the year to February 28, on sales 0.5 per cent lower at Y2,015.23bn. The decline at Daei, although lower than the falls at the department stores, reflects the spread of the consumer slowdown to basic goods. Clothing and foodstuffs make up more than 50 per cent of Daei's sales.</p>

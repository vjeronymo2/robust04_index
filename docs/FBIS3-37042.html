			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has  spoken in favor of fewer deputy premiers. Addressing  coal-mining managers and trade union officials in Moscow on  Friday, he said, "There have been fewer deputy premiers. I  think that there could be still fewer of them." Chernomyrdin  explained that, "there are now four deputy premiers, but their  number will be reduced even more."    IF Note: After the Cabinet reshuffle, the deputy prime  ministers in place are: Oleg Soskovets -- first deputy prime  minister, and Yuriy Yarov, Aleksander Zaveryukha, and Anatoliy  Chubays -- deputy prime ministers.    Chernomyrdin called for enhancing the role of ministries,  federal departments, and large industrial companies.    "If we make the government free of the duties that are alien  to it and transfer them to ministries, major companies and  regions, questions will be solved in a more prompt fashion,"  Chernomyrdin remarked. In his words, the time when only Moscow  decided whether to build an enterprise or close one has gone and  will never return.    He recalled that as the USSR Gas Minister he cut the number  of his deputies from 11 to 2 with no adverse effect on the  industry.</p>

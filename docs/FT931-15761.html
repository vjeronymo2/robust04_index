			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: FNFC to make Pounds 50m cash call this week - Troubled group will move to repair balance sheet TROUBLED First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, is expected to ask its shareholders for up to Pounds 50m in its first rights offering since 1986. Along with its annual results on Friday, FNFC is expected to announce that it will seek up to Pounds 50m through the sale of convertible preference shares in order to repair its balance sheet. In the six months to last April, the group had total charges for bad debts of Pounds 64.5m, and incurred a net loss for the period of Pounds 23m. It also took an exceptional charge of Pounds 17m related to the sale of undeveloped property sites. The group, whose short term borrowings rose significantly in 1991, also faces the repayment of some Pounds 250m in bank loans this spring. However, the loss for the second half is expected to shrink significantly to under Pounds 10m. Profitability has been aided by the sharp drop in base rates in recent months and the fact that its loan agreements do not require it to pass on all of those savings to customers. Also, it has pared roughly Pounds 400m from the group balance sheet through securitisation and sale of loans. In October, FNFC raised Pounds 190m when it became the first issuer to sell securities backed by secondary mortgage loans. Its loan book at the end of December was Pounds 900m, down from Pounds 1.3bn the year before. The company has said that most of its troubled loans stemmed from aggressive business it took on in the late 1980's which has been largely repaid or written off. About half of all new business is in the form of home improvement loans and about a third are secondary mortgages. The company's share price has risen steadily, rising from a 1992 low of 13p to 60p on Friday.</p>

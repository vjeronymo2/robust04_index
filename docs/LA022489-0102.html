			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL GETS OK TO SUE 2 RIVALS ON RACKETEERING CLAIM  </P> <P> Continental Airlines Inc. said Thursday that a Los Angeles federal court has  agreed to let it proceed to trial with a $1-billion racketeering claim against  American and United airlines involving their computer reservation systems.  </P> <P> Continental said U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie denied motions from the  other two airlines to dismiss the charges. Continental has complained under the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) that American and  United have committed mail and wire fraud in the operation of their ticket  reservation systems. American operates the Sabre reservation system; United  operates the Apollo system.  </P> <P> American said Continental's contention that it has engaged in racketeering "is  a moral outrage." United representatives could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Continental said the focus of its suit is the "manipulation by American and  United of information on their Sabre and Apollo computer reservations systems,"  which are used in more than 70% of ticket sales by travel agents. Claims in the  Continental suit include charges that the reservation system screens display  the operators' flights first and suppress the fares and schedules of  competitors.  </P> <P> A Continental spokesman in Houston said that even though the federal court  ruling was made on Feb. 17, it did not get the court transcript until Thursday.  </P></p>

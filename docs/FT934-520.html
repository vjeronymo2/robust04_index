			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / The essential connection: Mobile phones are still costly, but many now consider them a necessity O reason not the need] Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous King Lear, going mad, realised that 'need' is relative. But for those beyond the stage of worrying about food and heat this Christmas, the mobile phone is fast becoming a basic necessity on a par with the freezer and the microwave. With Cellnet, the UK's second-largest mobile phone operator, connecting almost as many new customers to its network this month as in the whole of 1992, mobile phone sales are increasing exponentially. By new year, the UK's three operators will have a total of nearly 2m subscribers. Already the mobile phone is more than a yuppie toy or business accessory. West Yorkshire Police has lent 75 mobile phones to victims of domestic violence for use in emergencies; for safety reasons Southwark council in London equips most of its social workers with mobiles; health authorities now give them to midwives to speed communication, and have a pool for other nurses. 'The phones have made a tremendous difference,' said Chief Superintendent Gary Haigh of West Yorkshire Police. 'The women at risk don't feel as isolated. They can call us by pressing three digits and we know exactly who they are even if they can't speak.' A survey by Ms Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex University, shows that the image of mobile phone users as swanky businessmen no longer tells the whole story*. Growth areas include vulnerable groups and blue-collar workers who deal directly with customers. Since the launch of the mobile phone in the mid-1980s, self-employed mobile workers have been prime customers. Next year's north London Yellow Pages directory of business telephone numbers gives mobile numbers for 30 plumbers, for example - up from 16 this year. 'It's business,' said a self-employed taxi driver in central London. 'You don't have a mobile, and you lose jobs to others.' Now, according to Ms Wood, large companies are also equipping their mobile staff - such as gas fitters or railway officials - with handsets. 'The stereotype is being turned upside down. And though the number of 'non-professional' users is still small, the fact that mobile phones are being seen in the hands of ordinary people is vital to creating a mass market.' But however ordinary they become, mobile phone sales will still depend on price. At the moment, the cost is prohibitive for most people. Mercury One-2-One, the new cellular network covering the London region, has done more than any other operator to popularise the mobile phone, with free local calls in the evening for non-business subscribers. But to get free calls requires a handset costing at least Pounds 350, a Pounds 23.50 connection fee, and a Pounds 14.70 monthly subscription - a total of Pounds 550 in the first year before a single call has been made. Nevertheless, among the more affluent, attitudes are clearly shifting away from the idea that a mobile phone is a luxury. The Carphone Warehouse on London's Marylebone Road has been packed this week with the well heeled, claiming they had to have a mobile phone to do their job or move about safely. 'For me it's pretty well essential,' said Mr Nick Saunders, a business consultant from north London who commutes to Surrey. 'I'm buying one for myself and one for my partner for Christmas: with the crime rate going up, I don't like her doing long journeys in the car alone.' Most of the others in the shop were men, on high salaries, buying mobiles for Santa to pass on - 'though Christmas is just the excuse for spending the money now', said an oil broker. One female investment banker was splashing out on the most expensive phone in the shop (Pounds 400) for her husband's stocking. 'But I figure I'll get to use it more than him, so it's a bit self-interested.' Mr Charles Dunstone, Carphone Warehouse's 28-year-old managing director, started the business four years ago with Pounds 6,000 and a tiny office. Now he has 115 employees, owns a mail order business and 17 shops - mostly opened this year - and is one of Capital Radio's biggest advertisers. 'The yuppie stigma is fading fast,' said Mr Dunstone. 'Since Mercury One-2-One got going with the free calls, our inquiry lines have been jammed  -and many of those who think they can't afford one now will be in when the next round of price cuts takes place.' The location of Mr Dunstone's other stores in London sums up the state of the mobile phone market: Harrods, Moorgate, Fleet Street, King's Road, Watford, Croydon, Staples Corner and Thurrock - the first four in upper-crust or City locations, the latter four in middle-brow commuting towns. Across the country, the picture is similar. In an effort to broaden the market network operators are competing to offer attractive tariffs for infrequent users. There is room for growth: the 2m mobile phones in use compares with more than 20m BT lines. Handset prices are also falling fast: one dealer in Surrey - Sell Phones Direct - is selling them for 99p, if the customer pays the subscription charges. With a fourth national network, Microtel, to be launched next year, the price war will only hot up. Meanwhile, for those who need the latest and most expensive, a digital network has been launched by Vodafone, the largest UK operator, which allows users to make mobile phone calls across Europe. The cost in the first year of buying and running the phone, before making calls, is about Pounds 850. One of Mr Dunstone's first customers for the new network was industrialist Lord Hanson. No doubt he finds it essential. * Available from SPRU Publications, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RF, Pounds 50</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Selling the recession NOT BEFORE time, the British government has realised that if its economic strategy is to succeed it must deploy the most important weapon in its political armoury: persuasion. There are many Conservatives who are unconvinced that the gain, which lies in the future, is worth the present pain. Some, notably on the back-benches, openly question whether there will be a recovery unless there is a complete change of direction - a withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, say, or a temporary flotation of sterling. Yes, inflation is down, it is conceded, but where is the growth? They - and the country - need reassurance that there is something of value to be had for what has been called a price worth paying: that low inflation alone is not the whole prize. Mr Norman Lamont started the process of persuasion in a frank speech on Friday night. The chancellor's determination to stick to the government's hawkish anti-inflationary stance could not have been more clearly stated. It was supported by the prime minister in an interview published yesterday. Given where the economy now stands, it is argued, there is no alternative but to stick with a hairshirt strategy whose nature should have been clear when Mr John Major, himself then chancellor, took Britain into the ERM nearly two years ago. Unfortunately, the case for a long hard slog was blurred by 17 months of electioneering, during which it was intimated by both Mr Major and Mr Lamont - not to mention the Treasury's economic forecasts - that recovery was just around the corner. Now that the election is out of the way the original argument must be rehearsed all over again. If the prime minister was hesitant about selling his strategy after April 10, it may be because he genuinely believed that consumer confidence would return once the threat of a Labour government had been removed. Mr Lamont, who has shown greater courage and persistence under pressure than most of his postwar predecessors, has until now been slow to perceive that you cannot hope to lead the British public on a long march towards permanent near-zero inflation unless you explain the benefits of such an endeavour. The need for political salesmanship will increase if there is no sign of an upturn after the summer holidays. By that time, backbench doubts about the management of the economy will be bound up with doubts about the wisdom of ratifying the treaty on European union agreed at Maastricht. Mr Major has been robust in his responses to the Eurosceptics behind and above him, but the Tories remain divided. Yet, as with the ERM, there is no alternative for the government to the policy of keeping Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. This means ratifying Maastricht, unless the French veto it. The government is engaged in a doubly heroic endeavour. If it fails, so too do the prime minister and the chancellor. No wonder they have come out fighting.</p>

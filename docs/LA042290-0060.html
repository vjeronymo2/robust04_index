			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOULDER SEAT BELTS  </P> <P> Thank you for your newspaper's excellent article about our settlement with Ford  Motor Co. for failure to provide rear-seat shoulder harnesses in our Escort  ("Ford Settles for $6 Million in Suit," April 4).  </P> <P> We feel it is very important that your readers know that, while rear-seat lap  belts may prevent a person from being ejected, they can also cause death or  paralysis in head-on collisions.  </P> <P> We learned of this safety hazard the hard way when we were in a serious  accident and lap belts broke the spines of our 11-year-old sons, killing one  and leaving the other a paraplegic.  </P> <P> Federal law requires that all 1990 cars be equipped with rear-seat shoulder  harnesses. However, there are still millions of cars on the road which should  be retrofitted with them. Unfortunately, many dealers are refusing to install  the harnesses because they don't want to assume liability.  </P> <P> We're urging consumers to demand that their dealers install the rear-seat  shoulder harnesses. If your dealer refuses, write to your congressional  representative. Don't take "no" for an answer. The life of your loved ones may  depend on it.  </P> <P> JAMES MILLER  </P> <P> PATRICIA MILLER  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

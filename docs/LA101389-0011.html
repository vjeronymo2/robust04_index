			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN ROBBERY SPREE SLAYING  </P> <P> A suspect in a 40-minute robbery spree that left one victim dead was arrested  Thursday morning after he was sighted leaving a Sun Valley bar, Los Angeles  police reported.  </P> <P> Russell Graham, 34, a transient, was arrested at 12:30 a.m. after police pulled  over a pickup truck he drove away from a bar at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and  Sheldon Street, Detective Al Ferrand said. Graham was being held without bail  on suspicion of murder at the Foothill Division jail in Pacoima.  </P> <P> Ferrand said that on Wednesday Graham fatally shot a 22-year-old man near a  phone booth outside a 7-Eleven store at Woodman Avenue and Osborne Street in  Panorama City. The victim, whose name was not released, apparently was shot  during a robbery attempt, Ferrand said.  </P> <P> Shortly after the noon shooting, the same suspect -- in another attempted  robbery -- fired shots at two men standing in the yard of a house in the 12200  block of Truesdale Street, police said. The shots missed, and the gunman fled.  </P> <P> Then, at 12:40 p.m., the gunman robbed a market in the 10100 block of  Stonehurst Avenue, police said.  </P> <P> Police were able to identify Graham from descriptions of the gunman and his  truck provided by witnesses, Ferrand said. Investigators watched a Sun Valley  bar he was known to frequent, and his pickup truck was sighted there early  Thursday.  </P></p>

It was  attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi; Dr. 'Atif 'Ubayd,  minister of the Public Business Sector and minister of state for  administrative development and environment affairs; Mahmud  Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and foreign trade; and  Engineer Muhammad Khulayf, chairman of the Egyptian Sugar  Company.    The prime minister said afterward that the two basic issues  discussed at the meeting were Egypt's economic ties with world  and regional countries and the Sugar Company's projects,  especially since the company has foreign investment ventures.  He said that the company head explained these projects.    The prime minister said these projects include setting up a  number of sugar factories in African and Middle Eastern  countries.    He praised the sugar company, which he said enjoys a very  strong position and has industrial equipment and a design center  that can fulfill Egypt's needs.    He said sugar prices currently rise and fall according to  the  production costs and that there are no problems on this matter.    He noted that an integrated study on customs is currently  being compiled and that it will be discussed next week with  sugar exporters, importers, and producers to determine whether  sugar will be subject to customs fees.    The prime minister said a similar meeting will be held next  week to discuss customs fees on fertilizers between officials  from the Ministry of Industry and Economy, national fertilizers  companies, and customs experts.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Yugoslav mandate renewed THE Security Council yesterday extended by six months the mandate of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia and tenuously linked the lifting of sanctions against Belgrade to enactment of a peace plan in Croatia, Reuter reports from New York. The resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote, including Russia which had previously objected to the measures. The Council warned nations of 'serious consequences' if they interfered in Croatia, a reference to any military supplies Belgrade might deliver to fellow Serbs. Meanwhile, fresh clashes erupted in north-west Bosnia yesterday after forces loyal to local Moslem leader Fikret Abdic tried to wrest control of Bosnian army positions in the isolated Bihac region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Situation in Ukraine. </F> Leonid Kravchuk: The Last Dash -- to the East"]    [Text] The closer we get to the finishing line of the  election race in Ukraine, the clearer it becomes that the only  hot favorites are Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, who enjoy  the affection of the Republic's west and east. It is not  impossible that the "in-between" position of Crimea may prove  decisive in this politico-geographical polarization of opinions.  As for Yuriy Meshkov, he has again demonstrated his skill at  vanishing from his native climes at the right time, once again  provoking Kravchuk into sharp actions in Crimea. The  expectations of the Simferopol president may, however, not be  vindicated: It is mainly the Kiev president who has until  recently been scoring points out of confrontation.    Much as KOMMERSANT-DAILY supposed on 21 June, Kravchuk could  not resist the temptation to capitalize on the absence of  Meshkov, who left for Geneva at a crucial moment with no special  objective. Yesterday Kiev already announced the annulment (by  Kravchuk's edict) of Meshkov's edicts of 4 May "On Items in  Republic of Crimea Ownership" and "On the Privatization of  State-Owned Enterprises of the Republic of Crimea" as "not being  in line with Ukraine's legislation." This is just one of the  signs of the Ukraine president's sudden attention to economic  questions. This same election race should perhaps be seen as  the reason for Kravchuk's turn toward the economy: His rival,  Kuchma, has a special liking for the economy, on which he builds  his campaign.    Kravchuk's economic breakthrough has touched on rather  delicate matters. Having shown an inclination to break down  customs barriers with the European Community (as part of the  partnership agreement he signed the other day), the president  nevertheless decided to beef up the customs service with respect  to Russia. Kravchuk's reasons (he shared them with the workers  of the "Azovmash" joint-stock company in Mariupol) boil down to  the phrase: "It pains me when the country is being hurt." The  president remarked: "It is inadmissible that the already none  too rich Ukraine's market should be laid waste. If the border  were now opened, a considerable proportion of consumer goods and  agricultural produce would be carted away to Russia." And this  is true: You need only look at the rugged rows of Ukrainian  shuttle traders outside the Kievskiy rail terminal in Moscow who  exchange fatback at almost dumping prices for the Russian ruble,  which is a picture of health (compared to the Ukrainian  karbovanets). By his other edict the president demanded that  Ukrainian producers declare, within 10 days flat, their hard  currency in a bid to stem its outflow from the Republic. That  is to say, he has thrown down the gauntlet to Kuchma. Now  Kravchuk, known in the western regions as a "guarantor of the  independence of a united and indivisible Ukraine," has a chance  to melt the hearts of the promarketeers even in the eastern  lands, which are Kuchma's turf. In fact, "eastern" coal miners  and steelworkers were rewarded the other day with edicts solving  their financial problems.</p>

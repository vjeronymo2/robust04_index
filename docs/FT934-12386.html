			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Thames signs Pounds 90m deal with ITV THAMES TELEVISION, the independent television production company that lost its ITV franchise, announced yesterday that it had signed a deal to make programmes worth more than Pounds 90m for the ITV Network Centre, the ITV programme commissioning organisation. The deal, which is spread over the next three years, is for The Bill, Des O'Connor Tonight, Wish You Were Here and a range of other documentary, light entertainment, comedy and children's programmes. Thames said the agreement was the largest ever made in the UK with an independent producer and confirmed the company's position as the leading independent studio. Thames, which in April was bought by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, signed a deal in the summer with the BBC worth more than Pounds 20m over three years. At the centre of that deal was This Is Your Life - originally a BBC programme that later moved to ITV and will move back to the BBC next autumn. Under the deal with the ITV Network Centre, Thames will continue to produce three weekly episodes of The Bill until the end of 1996. It has also been asked to produce two more series of Des O'Connor Tonight for transmission in 1994 and 1995. The holiday programme Wish You Were Here is also being prepared for transmission later this year, and will also be renewed for 1994 and 1995. Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV Network director, said Thames' top programmes were big audience winners. 'I'm delighted they are now guaranteed to remain on ITV,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC/DANCE  </P> <P> Cambodian Dancer Will Stay: The star performer in the Cambodian dance troupe  that danced last month at the Los Angeles Festival has joined four fellow  dancers in remaining in the United States rather than returning with her  company, which left New York for Cambodia on Wednesday, the dancer's attorney  confirmed Thursday. But dancer Yim Devi has not yet decided whether she will  defect and request political asylum like the other dancers or whether she will  merely stay as a visitor until her visa runs out Dec. 14.

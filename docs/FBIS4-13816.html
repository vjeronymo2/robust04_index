			<p>BFN     [Text] Sharp reactions to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's  remarks concerning his willingness to remove Golan settlements  for the sake of peace have been voiced in the Golan settlements  and the political establishment. The Golan Heights Settlements  Committee says the remarks undermine the existence of all the  settlements in the north and raise a question about the  country's future.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says Rabin's remarks  attest  to the total political collapse of a weak prime minister. Rabin  disavows his commitment to the settlements' continued existence  and the control of the Golan in the peace era as well, Knesset  Member [MK] Netanyahu says.    The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister  announce immediate elections in order to allow the people to  decide whether Golan settlements should be removed. MK Refa'el  Eytan says that Rabin has apparently been lying to the nation  for a long time.    The National Religious Party says the prime minister is  forfeiting the Jewish people's assets like a political greenhorn.</p>

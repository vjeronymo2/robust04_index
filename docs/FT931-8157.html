			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: City group urges delay in USM closure A CITY lobby group is to urge the London Stock Exchange to delay closure of the Unlisted Securities Market, pending preparation of proposals for an alternative market with separate governance. The City Group for Smaller Companies, representing 72 organisations, has drawn up its response to proposals for closing the USM and establishing a smaller companies sector on the Official List. The deadline for such recommendations is March 5. In its document, Cisco agrees that the differences between the USM and the main market 'hardly justify the continued operation of the two primary market regimes'. However, the group argues that there is a strong case for a junior market with 'markedly different listing arrangements'. To date, argues Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, the Stock Exchange has failed to address specifically the needs of smaller companies. 'The Stock Exchange should be forced to recognise that it is operating two markets, or someone else should be allowed to operate a national market,' he said. 'There is a lot of support for the idea, but it would need a significant change in attitudes from both the Stock Exchange and the government,' he added. Mr Balarkas and Mr Andrew Beeson, Cisco's chairman, cite the example of Nasdaq, which is operated by a self-regulatory body in the US. Established in 1971, Nasdaq was particularly successful in its early days in providing a forum for smaller companies. Today, however, the bulk of trading is concentrated in its biggest companies. Nevertheless, Mr Beeson said: 'The Nasdaq market is independently operated and governed and totally dedicated to the needs of smaller companies.' He stressed that the preferable option in the UK would be to set up a junior market within an existing framework. However, the market would require dedicated management. Cisco argues that the creation of a viable junior market would in the long run be good business for the Stock Exchange, which currently derives some 90 per cent of share turnover from the biggest companies. Other issues being investigated by Cisco include the definition of inside information as included in the draft criminal justice bill. Working parties have been set up to prepare submissions to the Treasury. Cisco will be meeting the Treasury next week to discuss its proposals. The group is also holding a series of discussions with the Bank of England.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TVA received a substantial number of comments that supported the more aggressive timber harvesting activities allowed under Alternatives A and B. TVA agrees that Alternative A has been a successful management strategy in the past at LBL, particularly in the area of enhancing wildlife habitat. As a result, even-aged forest management, a critical component of Alternative A, has been included in Alternative E although at reduced levels. Even-aged forest management will help to meet the long-term needs of early successional wildlife species by increasing the amount of young plant growth. Even-aged management is more effective in maintaining the oak-hickory forest of the area. However, the public's perception of even-aged management is generally negative and there is less acceptance of this than in the past, particularly on public lands. The reduced use of even-aged management under Alternative E attempts to strike a balance between the ecological benefits of even-aged management and the public's perceptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA also agrees with commenters that Alternative B would represent sound resource management from a biological standpoint. However, increasing the level of even-aged timber management would have negative visual impacts and is not desirable for that reason. In addition, as pointed out by a number of commenters, LBL offers the opportunity to maintain a large block of mature forest in a region where most private forests are fragmented and other tracts of public land are small in size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments were received that supported an end to commercial forest management activities (the harvesting of commercially-usable timber) on all of LBL. This would occur under Alternatives C and D. As stated in TVA's EIS, Alternative C or D would be consistent with and help advance LBL's broad goals. However, over the long term, these alternatives are expected to change 40 to 50 percent of the stands in LBL's forests from oak-hickory to beech-maple. Oak-hickory species are better mast producers and many wildlife species rely on mast for food. In addition, wildlife species which depend on early-successional vegetative habitats would be adversely impacted by the change to mature, old-growth forest. There is also likely to be a decline in overall visitation under Alternatives C and D because of adverse effects on hunting. Under Alternative C, hunting would be eliminated. Under Alternative D, the habitats preferred by certain game species would be reduced and hunting opportunities would be adversely affected. The diversity of habitats and associated recreational opportunities offered by Alternative E better support LBL's recreational and education goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmentally Preferable Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of LBL's goals of recreation and environmental education, none of the alternatives would be environmentally destructive and none of the alternatives would likely result in significant environmental impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are environmental differences among alternatives. Depending on the alternative, there could be greater or lesser impacts on certain resources and certain species. For example, Alternative C would eliminate future commercial timber harvesting and likely eventually result in an old growth forest. This would benefit species which prefer such habitat such as some neotropical birds. However, those neotropical birds which favor early successional vegetation would be adversely impacted. In contrast, Alternative B, which would allow the most timber harvesting, would result in more early successional habitat and benefit game species, such as deer, that prefer such habitats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, depending on the habitat or species one wants to enhance or foster, any one of the alternatives evaluated in TVA's EIS could be characterized as environmentally preferable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Consequences and Commitments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In choosing Alternative E, all practical means to avoid or minimize environmental harm have been adopted. Site-specific environmental reviews will be conducted prior to implementation of natural resource management actions that could potentially impact the environment. Typically, mitigation will be accomplished by avoiding sensitive areas, changes in intensity or method of management, or providing off-setting resource enhancement or replacement at other localities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Common mitigation measures include silvicultural and agricultural BMPs to ensure that minimal amounts of soil and nutrients enter any water course. Other mitigation measures include archaeological and historic surveys, use of integrated pest management techniques, and implementation of visual quality zones. Wildlife management mitigation includes bat management zones and eagle nest management zones. To address the issues of fragmentation and biological diversity, large blocks of biosphere reserve core acreage are an integral part of Alternative E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of implementing Alternative E will be continuously monitored to determine if management objectives are being achieved. The results of forest and open land management activities will be monitored through the use of forest inventories, logging inspections, annual mast surveys, and use of gypsy moth traps among other activities. Management impacts on wildlife are monitored through periodic surveys of bats, breeding and wintering birds, eagles, grouse, turkeys, and deer, as well as through hunter harvest data and wildlife disease surveillance activities. Water and soil will also be monitored through testing and survey activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Innovative natural resource management is crucial to the fulfillment of LBL's mission and to TVA's role in environmental leadership. TVA believes this plan will further the recreation and environmental education mission of LBL. At the same time, this plan will maintain and enhance a nationally significant tract of public land in western Kentucky and Tennessee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Kathryn J.

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: TSB closes 11 branches of Hill Samuel The TSB Group's attempt to re-focus its Hill Samuel merchant banking arm continued yesterday. It plans to close 11 Hill Samuel branches and transfer most of their business into its retail banking network. TSB is forming a commercial banking service, run from its 40 existing banking centres. Relationships with small businesses at Hill Samuel branches involving lending of less than Pounds 5m would be transferred to these centres. The bank has indicated that it would be willing to sell Hill Samuel if it received the right offer. In the mean time it is attempting to refocus it on merchant banking, and target companies with a net worth of Pounds 50m to Pounds 500m. TSB said that about 1,000 staff work in the Hill Samuel branches and the retail bank's commercial banking centres. It is not yet sure whether redundancies would result from the moves. The closures will leave Hill Samuel with offices in London, Glasgow and Birmingham.</p>

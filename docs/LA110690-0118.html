William Seidman said in a Los Angeles speech that stock investors  have overreacted to concern that banks could develop problems similar to those  plaguing the savings and loan industry. Noting that major banks are still  making money, he said he believed that the FDIC can meet its insurance  obligations, provided the nation does not slip into deep recession.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Hard line urged on directors' liability for accounts COMPANIES' ACCOUNTS should contain a statement of directors' responsibilities which should be be approved by their auditors, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said yesterday. It should state explicitly the legal responsibilities of directors in preparing the accounts, which includes the requirement that the figures give a 'true and fair view'. They should also give details of the maintenance and effectiveness of internal financial controls. The recommendations are based on a study conducted by a working party established by the institute in April last year to examine issues of corporate governance. It calls for the widespread adoption of audit committees by companies and the strengthening of internal financial controls. Auditors are already legally obliged to highlight any directors' statements they disagree with in the annual report. The recommendation for a more detailed directors' report - which should not be a pro forma statement - would strengthen auditors' powers to comment on a company's internal controls. Mr Ian Tegner, institute president, said that an audited directors' statement would represent a move towards a more detailed, 'qualitative' form of financial reporting, in that auditors would verify the content of the statement as well as the figures in the company's accounts. He added that a significant aim was to confront boards of directors with their responsibilities and get them to take them seriously. The institute argues that any additional costs incurred by auditors scrutinising the directors' statements should be balanced by efficiency gains resulting from improved internal controls. The report has been submitted to the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, which is expected to report in the next few months. The report also echoes proposals now before the Auditing Practices Board, which sets standards, for an expanded audit statement which would list the responsibilities of directors.

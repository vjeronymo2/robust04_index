			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Effort to push ahead with WTO The 125 participants in the Uruguay Round of trade talks yesterday reaffirmed their intention to establish the World Trade Organisation on January 1 next year by setting a December date for the formal implementation conference that must give the go-ahead. The decision, by the WTO preparatory committee in Geneva, rests on the assumption that the leading traders - the US, the European Union and Japan - will ratify by the time of the implementation conference on December 8. Only 30 nations have ratified so far but 50 more are pledged to do so by the end of the year. Ratification has been held up partly because many countries are waiting for the US, EU and Japan to do so. In the US, the lame-duck Congress will return for a special session to vote on the Uruguay Round implementing legislation after the November 8 mid-term elections. In the EU, ratification has been delayed by a dispute over the powers of the European Commission to speak for member states on all WTO matters. The European Court of Justice is due to pronounce on the issue on November 15. Stephanie Flanders adds: The world's main trading nations should rise above politics in picking a leader for the World Trade Organisation, Professor Jagdish Bhagwati of New York's Columbia University said in London last night at a memorial lecture for Harold Wincott, a former Financial Times journalist. Prof Bhagwati, a trade economist and former economic policy adviser to Gatt, said the WTO would require 'intellectual leadership, not the skills of political fixmanship.' Instead, 'we observe the main trading nations battle to put their man in Geneva. It seems their chief desire is to pursue their narrow political advantage and advance their preferred economic agenda.'</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Hungary warns of double-dip recession Hungary's new Socialist government looks set to follow other east European countries in which former communists have returned to power, as it abandons populist rhetoric and prepares austerity measures more severe than its nationalist predecessors could stomach. Only a fortnight after entering office, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, Hungary's new Socialist finance minister, yesterday warned of swingeing budget cuts and a relapse into recession next year. The finance ministry expects GDP growth of 1 per cent to 2 per cent this year after a four-year depression in which Hungary's economy contracted by more than 20 per cent. But the famously gloomy Mr Bekesi used his first major policy statement as finance minister to warn of another dip in economic activity, with output sinking back by 1 per cent in 1995. Just last month the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies forecast that Hungary - once the communist bloc's economic pioneer - would share in the recovery spreading from Poland to the other fast reformers of eastern Europe. Hungary's economic rebound has been hobbled, however, by a balance of payments crisis. Hungary has the highest debt service per capita in the region and the current account deficit hit Dollars 3.46bn (Pounds 2.23bn), 10 per cent of GDP, last year. An International Monetary Fund delegation met the new Hungarian government last week to warn that the imbalance was unsustainable. The National Bank of Hungary took independent action by raising its key repo interest rates by a total of four points in June and July. But that has taken real borrowing rates towards 20 per cent and the central bank said monetary policy alone cannot stabilise the economy. The government last week cancelled the 1996 Budapest Expo to save money and Mr Bekesi said yesterday he planned an emergency fiscal package in September to reduce this year's budget deficit by Ft60bn (Pounds 383m), or 1.5 per cent of GDP. The government is also embarking on negotiations with trade unions and employers on a wide-ranging programme to claw back a recent surge in real wages. These measures and further cuts in the 1995 budget will take Hungary part of the way towards the IMF target of halving the current account deficit to Dollars 1.5bn in 1995. The Socialists' austerity programme sits uneasily, however, with voters' expectations in the May elections that the former communists would ease economic hardship. It remains to be seen whether the realists, as Mr Bekesi describes himself, have the political strength to overcome the trade union wing of the party. Commercial banks have built up large foreign exchange positions in the expectation that the government will take the easier option of a devaluation of up to 10 per cent. Mr Bekesi refused yesterday to comment on the increasingly feverish speculation against the forint. But he left the option of devaluation open by talking of a 'balanced exchange rate policy' to 'anticipate rather than follow changes in competitiveness'.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Manufacturers in all regions report growth Manufacturers in all regions are enjoying growth, according to figures released yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry and the consultancy Business Strategies. For the first time since the survey began in July 1988 all 11 regions reported increases in business optimism, orders and output. The report is compiled from the CBI's national quarterly industrial trends survey, released last month. East Anglia appears to be growing the most rapidly, although Business Strategies warned that it was a small region where survey results could be volatile. Orders and output growth have grown faster in East Anglia than elsewhere. Expectations for new orders and increased output over the next four months are highest in Wales while the greatest level of business optimism is in Northern Ireland. Business Strategies said it was significant that manufacturing appeared to be healthy in the two important regions of the east and west Midlands. The east Midlands has seen the strongest growth in total orders of any region, apart from East Anglia, while the west Midlands is second to East Anglia in the league table of regions enjoying output growth. The regions which showed the smallest improvements, according to the report, were the north-west, the north, Scotland and the south-west. Although some commentators fear the strength of the economy will lead to inflationary pressures, the report says: 'There is no evidence of rising unit costs at the national level and only limited evidence that the regions experiencing the strongest growth are also the first to experience accelerations in costs.' The survey found that in the past four months, seven of the 11 regions had seen falls in domestic prices, with only Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside seeing significant increases. The fastest growth in unit costs occurred in the south-west and the east Midlands. East Anglia is the area which most expects prices to rise over the next four months. The improvement in business prospects has done little to brighten the employment outlook. Only three regions are expecting to see an increase in manufacturing employment in the next four months - Scotland, East Anglia and the west Midlands. However, Business Strategies pointed out that manufacturing employment was declining in the long term and only tended to pick up at the height of a boom. CBI/BSL Regional Trends survey.

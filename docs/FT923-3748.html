			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Favourable weather lifts Grolsch 20% to Fl 15m GROLSCH, the Dutch beer producer, lifted net profit by slightly more than 20 per cent to Fl 14.9m (Dollars 9.3m) during the first half-year, aided by favourable weather conditions in its home market. Sales showed a 15.9 per cent increase to Fl 423.9m, with about half of the rise attributable to the acquisition of Ruddles, the British brewer, in early 1992. Operating profit rose by 27 per cent to Fl 22.4m. The premium beer markets in the UK and Germany, where Grolsch made its first acquisition in 1991 by buying Wickuler, a regional brewer in the Ruhr area, were affected by difficult economic conditions in both countries. Dutch sales were 'excellent,' thanks to good weather in the spring. Exports to other markets were satisfactory on balance, although they varied considerably from country to country, the company said. Commenting on the first-half figures, Grolsch said that the same period of 1991 had been weak because of the Gulf war and poor weather conditions in May and June. By contrast, results in the 1991 second half were strong, and Grolsch believes it will be able to match this performance in the second half of this year. Overall, full-year profit is expected to show a rise.</p>

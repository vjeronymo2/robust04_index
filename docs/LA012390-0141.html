			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY TAKES ON GANGS IN AD CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> MEDIA: FRANKEL &amp; ANDERSON IS USING RADIO AND TV IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS  URBAN PROBLEMS. IT IS THE AGENCY WHERE KAREN TOSHIMA, WHO WAS KILLED BY A GANG  MEMBER IN WESTWOOD, WORKED.  </P> <P> It is a chilling anniversary. Two years ago this month, Karen Toshima, a  27-year-old advertising agency art director, was shot in the head and killed in  random gang violence in Westwood.  </P> <P> Since that time, gang violence has only grown worse. And so has the sense of  helplessness of many Los Angeles area residents. But the Van Nuys ad agency  where Toshima worked has decided to take action -- not just for her, but for  all victims of gang violence.  </P> <P> "The role of advertising is to motivate people," said Rob Frankel, president of  Frankel &amp; Anderson. "If we can sell soap flakes, I'm convinced we can also  sell social good."  </P> <P> With that in mind, Frankel &amp; Anderson has created a series of print ads  that urges Southern Californians to make a stand against gangs and graffiti.  And it has enlisted two of the city's media powers -- KABC-Talkradio and  KABC-TV -- to help create and air public service announcements that address  urban problems.  </P> <P> The ad campaign has been named "Turn the Tide."  </P> <P> Beginning this month, print and broadcast advertisements will try to persuade  Los Angeles residents to dial a 900 telephone number -- 1-900-USA-TURN -- to  help stop gang violence. When people dial that number, they will automatically  be donating $2 to one of several local, anti-gang educational groups. Those who  call will also be given further information on how they can help fight gangs.  </P> <P> The four-person ad shop isn't trying to tackle the gang problem alone. Nearly a  year ago, it enlisted the help of KABC Talkradio, which is spearheading the  effort. In fact, the station will air on Thursday a special four-hour show on  gangs featuring radio talk show host Michael Jackson.  </P> <P> "This is something we probably should have done years ago," said Nelkane  Benton, director of community relations at the station. "We look at this as  just a beginning, not an end." Other corporate sponsors of the campaign are the  Vons grocery chain, which will promote the campaign in its stores and in  advertisements, and Main Street Dairies, which will run "Turn the Tide" ads on  its milk cartons.  </P> <P> The agency's first print ad -- which appears in today's Times -- is an entire  page filled with what looks like spray-painted graffiti. The headline to that  ad says, "The next thing they spray is bullets."  </P> <P> One print ad the agency created -- but eventually decided to drop -- may be the  most provocative of all. The ad features a large swastika above the headline,  "It started out as gang graffiti too."  </P> <P> "Needless to say, the ad would have caused a sensation," said Frankel. "The  feeling was that the ad brought up too many racist images."  </P> <P> The money raised from the ad campaign will mostly go to six local grass-roots  organizations dedicated to reducing gang violence. Among the largest of those  groups is Community Youth Gang Services. That nonprofit group is seeking nearly  $1 million to fund its program of sending specialists to inner-city schools to  talk about gangs with children ages 10 to 12.  </P> <P> "The object is to cut off membership at the grass-roots level," said Schuyler  Sprowles, public affairs consultant with the group. "It's no panacea. But it's  better than anything else that's available."  </P></p>

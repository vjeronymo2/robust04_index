			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Lionhope Pounds 500m development to be scaled down BACKERS of a controversial Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential developments in one of the south-east's unemployment blackspots are proposing a scaled-down version to address environmental objections. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and Citibank, the US bank, are discussing with the government, local authorities and environmental groups a new version of the Lionhope plan on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east Kent. The 'son of Lionhope' proposal is the latest twist in a saga that began with the administrative receivership in 1989 of the developer Lionhope (Kent), which devised the original project. The plans were rejected in July by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, after a 13-week public inquiry in 1990 during which environmentalists condemned the effect on local wildlife. In September, Touche Ross - Lionhope's receiver - said it would challenge the decision in the High Court. The projects' promoters have been discussing revised proposals with Kent County Council, Swale Borough Council and the main objectors, English Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Mr Tony Houghton, joint administrative receiver, said yesterday he was 'quite confident that we have put forward a proposal that fully meets objections raised at the public inquiry.' The revised plan, based on four sites, still hopes to create 9,000 jobs, and one of its key elements, a big expansion of Sheerness Dock, remains unchanged. A proposed privately funded tunnel under the Swale, linking Sheppey to the mainland, will be replaced with a bridge, to be funded mainly by the government.</p>

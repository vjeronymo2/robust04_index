			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa prices in retreat - Market Report Disappointed liquidation hit COCOA futures prices at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday after early buying failed to achieve the breach of resistance around Pounds 900 a tonne for May delivery. By the close the price had surrendered all but Pounds 5 of Friday's Pounds 23 rise to close at Pounds 872 a tonne. But COFFEE prices maintained their rally with a Dollars 13 rise to Dollars 1,212 a tonne. As speculative interest slackened base metals prices generally succumbed to profit-taking at the London Metal Exchange. Compiled from Reuter</p>

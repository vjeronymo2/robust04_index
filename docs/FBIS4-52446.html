			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A human evolution history  research team of Kim Il-song University recently unearthed in  and around Pyongyang 42 pieces of 20 fossil men, 298 pieces of  stone implements, 109 pieces of bone implements, two bone  sculptures and 34,702 pieces of fossil animals belonging to the  Paleolithic age and 15 pieces of six fossil men, 23 pieces of  stone implements, six pieces of bone implements, 43 pieces of  earthenware, one piece of ornament and 1,047 pieces of fossil  animals belonging to the Neolithic age and 12 pieces of five  fossil men, one piece of earthenware and two pieces of stone  implements belonging to the Bronze age.    In this connection, a symposium for reading papers on the  scientific research into fossil men and relics recently  unearthed in and around Pyongyang took place at Kim Il-song  University Thursday.    Published at the symposium were data about a profound  scientific and theoretical analysis of the archaeological  significance of the fossil men and relics discovered in Chungri  cave, Yonggok cave No. 1 and Taehung caves Nos. 1 and 3 and the  features of the bones of ancient Koreans and the results of the  research into the systematic evolution of Koreans in Pyongyang.    According to them, scores of pieces of relics unearthed from  the first and second cultural layers of the Paleolithic age in  Chungri cave show that the cultural traditions of primitive men  who left the Komunmoru relics were carried forward by their  descendants in Pyongyang.    The geologic time of Yonggok cave No. 1 where ten fossil men  were unearthed on the second, third and fourth cultural layers  of the Paleolithic age ranges from the beginning of the  Pleistocene epoch to the Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period  and that of Taehung cave No. 1 where three fossil men were  unearthed on the cultural layer of the Paleolithic age ranges  from the end of the Pleistocene epoch to the beginning of the  Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period.    In Taehung cave No. 3 fossil men, 43 pieces of earthenware  and 65 fossil bones of animals were discovered. The earthenware  used by ancient Koreans in Pyongyang represents their wisdom and  creative talent and noble esthetics. It is patent proof that  the common features of the culture of the homogeneous Korean  nation were carried forward in the Neolithic age, too.    The fossil human bones and relics which have been unearthed  and studied prove that the evolution of Koreans took place in  Pyongyang in regular order.    This is because the features of Koreans were formed in due  sequence with Pyongyang as the centre, the culture of ancient  Koreans was developed systematically with Pyongyang as the  centre and Pyongyang was the best place for the life of mankind.    The participants in the symposium said the symposium proved  that the evolution of Koreans took place in this land, notably  in Pyongyang in regular order and that Pyongyang had sufficient  natural conditions and paleontological conditions for the origin  and development of ancient Koreans.</p>

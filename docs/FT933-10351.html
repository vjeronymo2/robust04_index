			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Bonds: IADB in Dollars 500m offer after tough mandate bidding THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 500m offering of 10-year bonds after a round of competitive bidding for the mandate which some dealers felt had led to the issue being priced rather aggressively. The 10-year bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury yield, but by the end of trading the bonds were bid at 23 basis points over the curve. However, dealers said a substantial portion of the issue had been sold at a spread of 20 basis points. Three other underwriters had also submitted bids to the IADB at a spread of 20 basis points, and a fourth had bid even more aggressively at 19 basis points. Lead-manager Merrill Lynch said the issue had prompted some switching out of outstanding issues by Sweden and LKB Baden-Wurttemburg. Also in the dollar market, Ford Motor Credit launched a Dollars 300m issue of floating rate notes due 1998, which dealers said was too tightly priced. The notes pay interest at 30 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which represents an all-in cost to the borrower of about 35 basis points over Libor. Lead-manager Morgan Stanley said there was strong demand for floating-rate dollar debt as some investors want to be protected against potential rises in interest rates. It added that Ford was a much improved credit. However, while other dealers agreed there was considerable interest in floating-rate notes, the pricing of 30 basis points over Libor was 5 to 10 basis points too aggressive, according to some dealers. They pointed out that if Ford were to borrow in the fixed rate market and swap the proceeds into floating-rate funding, the company would not be able to achieve a similar cost of funds. However, Morgan Stanley reported strong demand from European money market funds. Banks, which are traditional buyers of floating-rate notes, do not tend to buy corporate paper because under Basle capital rules corporate debt carries a 100 per cent risk weighting. In the Japanese equity-linked sector, Trans Cosmos launched a small Dollars 100 four-year issue of bonds with warrants, which surprised the market with the strength of its performance. By the end of the day, the bonds with warrants were bid at 105, a five-point premium to their par issue price. Lead-manager Nikko Europe said there had been particularly strong demand because the company had not previously issued equity warrants. Further, Trans Cosmos, a computer software company, is only listed on the second section of the Japanese stock market, which is notoriously illiquid. Consequently, some investors interested in the stock may have avoided buying it in the cash market, but jumped at the chance to buy the warrants. Nikko reported some demand from US offshore fund managers.</p>

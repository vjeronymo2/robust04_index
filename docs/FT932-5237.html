			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Power Corporation lets its money do the talking - Recent deals give few clues to the group's long-term strategy POWER Corporation of Canada's annual meeting last month demonstrated once again why the Montreal-based financial services and media group has gained a reputation for speaking softly but wielding a big stick. Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman and controlling shareholder, gave no hint of Power's business plans, beyond reaffirming the 'steady, patient and prudent approach that we always seek to follow'. But he spoke freely about Power's financial muscle, confirming it had access to as much as CDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.9bn) in cash, and proudly noting the 'very strong balance sheets and credit ratings' of its affiliates. Power has no long-term debt, and earned CDollars 152m in 1992 on consolidated revenues of CDollars 6.1bn. Observers are left to guess what long-term strategy, if any, lies behind three recent deals which have cemented Power's foothold in international communications: Power has invested Dollars 99m in a 1 per cent stake in Time Warner, the US media and entertainment group. The holding was revealed last week by Seagram, the drinks company which has bought a 5.7 per cent interest in Time Warner. Seagram and Power have several directors in common, but have insisted their purchases took place independently. Two months earlier, Power spent CDollars 180m on a 19 per cent interest in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper publisher. It has joint control with Hollinger, the holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the UK Telegraph group. Power Broadcasting, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has formed a partnership with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to provide two channels to DirecTV, the planned US direct-broadcast satellite service nicknamed 'Death Star'. All three transactions bear the stamp of Mr Desmarais' son Andre, who is in charge of Power's communications business. He is widely recognised as the more forceful of the two Desmarais sons who help run Power. Andre is said to have favoured buying a much bigger stake in Time Warner last year, but to have been restrained by his father. Beyond his involvement, the common thread between the three deals is not yet clear. Power, which already owns La Presse, Canada's second-biggest French-language daily, has long viewed loss-making Southam as one of North America's worst-managed newspaper publishers. 'I think they'll start by collaborating closely with Hollinger and the Southam board to turn Southam around,' says Mr Stephen Jarislowsky, a Southam director who is also president of Jarislowsky Fraser, Canada's biggest pension fund portfolio manager. In the longer run, analysts are speculating that Power, Southam and Hollinger may pool their North American media interests. The new investments have given Power a more even balance between its stakes in communications and financial services, and between its European and North American interests. The Desmarais' attention over the past decade has been focused on Pargesa, the Geneva-based investment holding company, which Power controls jointly with Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian financier. Pargesa is emerging from an unsettled period, during which it has shed a stake in Henry Ansbacher, the London merchant bank; has been assured of control of Petrofina, the Belgian energy group; and (most recently) has acquired a minority stake in CarnaudMetalbox, Europe's biggest metal packaging company. Pargesa has also given Power a window on the European communications business through ownership of Radio-Television Luxembourg. RTL owns 10 radio stations and six TV channels, beaming into France, Germany and the Benelux countries. Mr Paul Desmarais, 66, began his business career by reviving small-town bus operators in Ontario and Quebec. He bought control of Power Corporation in 1968. He has built a reputation as a canny investor, usually buying and selling at the right time. Mr Desmarais has disposed of every one of the shipping, forestry and financial-service companies which Power controlled when he took over 25 years ago. Stakes in Consolidated-Bathurst (now Stone-Consolidated), the Quebec-based forestry group, and in Montreal Trust, a mid-sized financial-services company, were unloaded just before the onset of the last recession. Mr Desmarais has impeccable business and political connections in and outside Canada. Former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau and the present incumbent, Mr Brian Mulroney, have several times used the helicopter pad at the Desmarais summer home at La Malbaie, Quebec. Nonetheless, Mr Desmarais' advances have been rebuffed on several occasions. During the 1970s, he failed to transform a 10 per cent stake in Argus Corp, one of English Canada's most blue-blooded companies, into anything more significant. Political pressure forced him to back away in the early 1980s from an attempt to gain control of Canadian Pacific, another pillar of the business establishment. Mr Andre Desmarais told the annual meeting that Power is restricting its investments to friendly, high-quality targets 'where we can participate as shareholders, and where we can work in a constructive way with management'. If it remains true to those criteria, Power must at least be considering a bigger stake in Time Warner than that which it now holds.</p>

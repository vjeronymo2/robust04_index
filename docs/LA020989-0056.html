			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "The Last Emperor," which swept last year's Academy Awards, and "A Fish Called  Wanda," a possible candidate in this year's Oscars derby, top the nominations  for the 1988 film awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.  The two movies will compete for best picture with Frenchman Louis Malle's  semi-autobiographical "Au Revoir Les Enfants" and last year's Oscar-winning  Danish movie "Babette's Feast," by Gabriel Axel. The awards honor films from  around the world released in Britain during 1988. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

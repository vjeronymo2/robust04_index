			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / TUC claims success in GCHQ dispute A BREAKTHROUGH in the eight-year dispute between the government and trade unions over union membership restrictions at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), was claimed yesterday by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC said the government had responded to pressure from the International Labour Organisation and was reopening talks with Civil Service unions. The ILO has been critical of the government's ban on membership of national trade unions at GCHQ. The government has argued since 1984 that membership of a national trade union is incompatible with security - GCHQ staff are permitted to belong only to a staff association. The Department of Employment denied yesterday that there had been any change in the government's stance.</p>

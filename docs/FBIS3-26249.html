			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": "Central Leaders Lead a Delegation to </F> Xiamen to Discuss Haicang's Development"]    [Text] Xiamen, 2 Feb (TA KUNG PAO) -- It has been reported  that some 40 ministerial level officials, including officials  responsible for making central policy decisions, will fly to  Xiamen tomorrow evening to inspect the 20 square km of land  originally reserved for Taiwan businessman Wang Yongqing, and  how to develop the piece of land after it has been taken over.    An official of the Xiamen Haicang Management Committee  disclosed that the visit by senior level officials from Beijing  is the largest and highest level of its kind to Xiamen. On the  second day after their arrival in Xiamen (4 February), they will  conduct on-the-spot inspection for a day and then discuss what  should be done on the 20 square km of land.    Reportedly, one of the topics to be discussed is what kind  of  industry will be developed in Haichang, whether it will continue  to be petrochemical industry or other industries such as  automobiles, electronics, or machine-building.    As for investors, it does not constitute a problem. A number  tycoons of Chinese origin in Southeast Asia have expressed on  numerous occasions their interest in investing in Haicang. When  an official announcement is made by China on Wang Yongqing's  withdrawal from the zone, they are willing to invest in Haicang  and develop whatever industries China propose. They may even  fly to Beijing or Xiamen on the second day to hold talks on  investment.    The move of senior Beijing officials is apparently unusual.  It indicates that Haicang is a development zone of Xiamen and  also a state-level development zone directly under control of  the central authorities. The move also declares an end to "Wang  Yongqing's investment in Haicang," which had created a furor,  and a new period for Haicang's development.    Su Zengtian, deputy secretary of Xiamen CPC Committee and  executive deputy director of the Haicang Management Committee,  said today: It is estimated that the decision of the central  government on the 20 square km of land will be made public  sometime in March or April. Whatever the result, it will  definitely be a big project, which will bring along other  trades. By then, Haicang will become a very popular place  attracting investment from all sides.</p>

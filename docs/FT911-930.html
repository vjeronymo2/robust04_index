			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Rates stay soft THREE-MONTH sterling interbank, the most important guide to base interest rate levels on the London money market, straddled the 11 1/2 per cent level yesterday. This points to a cut of  1/2 point in bank base rates, with the market regarding Friday May 17 as a possible date, after publication of the April UK retail price index. The Bank of England has discouraged such speculation however. It kept the short end of the market tight yesterday by not supplying enough help to take out the full underlying shortage. The central bank has also lent funds at 12 per cent on the last four Fridays. Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 7/16 per cent compared with 11 9/16 -11 1/2 on Tuesday, while 12-month money fell to 11 3/16 -11 1/16 from 11 1/4 -11 1/8 per cent. Short sterling prices maintained a firm tone on Liffe. June delivery opened at 88.87 and held in a narrow range before finishing at 88.88, against 88.85 previously. Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,150m, but revised this to Pounds 1,250m at noon and to Pounds 1,300m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,018m was provided. In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 255m bank bills outright in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 421m bills were purchased, by way of Pounds 138m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 64m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 219m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 222m bank bills were bought in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 120m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,064m, with bank balances below target absorbing Pounds 325m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 225m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 15m. In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent despite a net drain of DM1.6bn from the banking system at this week's securities repurchase agreement tender. The Bundesbank allocated DM22.1bn for 35 days at a fixed 8.60 per cent, to replace an expiring facility of DM23.7bn. Trading conditions were comfortable however, with banks reserve holdings averaging a high DM77.2bn for the first six days of the month.</p>

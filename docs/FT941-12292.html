			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Panel demands retractions from Granada The Takeover Panel forced Granada Group to publish late on Friday certain retractions to statements in its latest missive in the war of words between itself and LWT (Holdings), for which it has made a hostile bid of about Pounds 725m. In 1993, LWT generated cash before investments and dividends of Pounds 23.8m, rather than Pounds 22.9m as Granada said. So the conversion of profit before interest and tax into cash before investments and dividends was 51, not 49, per cent. Similarly LWT's net cash inflow before investments and dividends was down 23.9, not 26.8, per cent on 1992.</p>

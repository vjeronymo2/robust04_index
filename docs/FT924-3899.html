			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile prepares copper for the melting pot - Tentative steps on the road to a controversial partial privatisation THE CHILEAN government is understood to be considering the division of Codelco, the state copper company, into four independent units as a first step towards the partial privatisation of the world's biggest copper producer. Opening Codelco to private investors is seen as the best long-term solution to a number of problems afflicting the company. The government is trapped in a double-bind: the income it gets from Codelco is falling and at the same time it has been unable to allocate sufficient investment funds to reverse the trend of rising production costs and dwindling reserves at Codelco's existing mines. In 1989, Codelco's net earnings mustered almost Dollars 2bn, or 6.5 per cent of GDP, for the treasury. This year the figure is expected to drop to below Dollars 900m. According to TASC, a group of economic consultants to the Chilean parliament, lower copper prices forecast for next year will further reduce Codelco's contribution to about Dollars 400m or 1 per cent of GDP. Codelco, which owns a third of all registered mining property in Chile, has a list of projects it wants to develop, alone or with partners in the private sector, and has asked the finance ministry for a Dollars 600m investment budget next year. The company's executives think, however, that they will be lucky to get Dollars 450m. 'As a state company, we compete with health, housing and education for the government's limited resources,' says Mr Ignacio Guerrero, Codelco's financial director. Codelco's executives have won the backing of the finance ministry for divesting non-core businesses to raise extra investment funds. Top of their list is Tocopilla, the 530 Mw power plant in the Atacama desert that feeds electricity to Chuquicamata and La Escondida, the world's two biggest copper mines. Executives say selling Tocopilla could finance the Dollars 450m development of Radomiro Tomic, an ore body near Chuquicamata, which could be producing 150,000 tonnes of copper a year from 1995, if the project goes ahead as planned. Codelco has also discovered another important copper deposit near Chuquicamata, named MM, which has reserves of between 650m and 900m tonnes. The privatisation of Tocopilla is being resisted by the Mining Minister, Mr Alejandro Hales, and the Copper Workers' Union (CTC), neither of which wants to see Codelco dismembered. Union sentiment is running so high that even the relatively innocuous move to split off Codelco's maintenance works from the Teniente division sparked protests and go-slows this month. The Mining Ministry has invited Codelco's management and the union later this month to discuss the company's modernisation. Given the almost sacrosanct nature of Codelco's public ownership, enshrined in the Chilean constitution, modernisation has become a code-word in Chile for ideas such as divestiture and privatisation that cannot be named openly. Mr Ivan Valenzuela, the deputy mining minister, says the main topics under discussion will be how to generate more resources for the development of Codelco's mineral deposits. 'We are trying to prepare the ground so that there is the least possible political resistance to the government's plans,' he says. As a first step, says the deputy minister, the government would like to decentralise management to give Codelco's four divisions - Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Salvador and Andina - more autonomy in the running of their own affairs. Many inefficiencies, he says, are now masked by cross-subsidies. There will also be an attempt to persuade the 19,000-strong CTC that divesting from Tocopilla, where only 500 jobs are at stake, will allow the creation of more mining jobs in Codelco's new projects. The company's management wants to discuss other ways of raising investment finance. One proposal gaining support is to tap the Dollars 15bn of savings managed by Chile's private pension funds and insurance companies. Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance minister, is preparing new legislation to widen the investment options open to private pension funds. Although the details have yet to be made public, the new law might allow pension funds to take part in project finance, including the new mines Codelco wants to develop. The idea is likely to please nationalists of both right and left, as the pension funds would be channelling domestic savings into the development of the state copper industry. The pension funds are eagerly awaiting the new investment regulations. But they say they will measure Codelco's projects against the same criteria that they use to analyse other investment options. 'We will look at the risk and the return. Nobody can force pension funds to invest in Codelco,' says Mr Augusto Iglesias, a pension fund consultant. From there, Codelco's executives argue, it is a short step to opening up the company to new shareholders. However, the mining ministry insists that the ownership of Codelco is not under discussion. 'This is not the right political moment for a blitzkrieg,' Mr Valenzuela says. With general elections in Chile only one year away, however, Mr Valenzuela concedes that the nature of Codelco's ownership will be a political issue on the platform of every party. Mr Ricardo Lagos, the Socialist presidential candidate, says there should be no 'sacred cows' as far as Codelco's future is concerned. 'The main problem of privatising Codelco,' he says, 'is having one partner, the armed forces, which take 10 per cent of Codelco's gross sales'. This amounted to Dollars 277m last year. Mr Lagos believes the military rights over Codelco's earnings will have to be scrapped for privatisation to become a realistic proposition. But this in turn would require a revision of military income and expenditure - a subject which remains strictly out of bounds for civilians despite the formal end of military rule in 1990. Codelco's El Teniente division has negotiated collective wage agreements with two unions representing 1,600 workers, a quarter of the total workforce. Although the present two-year contracts do not expire until July 1993, Codelco offered to bring forward wage negotiations to avoid a repetition of the damaging wage strikes that hit El Teniente and Chuquicamata in 1991. The new two-year contracts for the unions that agreed to advance wage negotiations come into effect immediately. They include a no-strike bonus of 310,000 pesos (Dollars 830), higher productivity incentives and a profit-sharing scheme for Codelco's employees. Codelco executives have hailed the agreement as a new departure in labour relations. Mr Pedro Courard, El Teniente's general manager, said the absence of labour strife and lower absenteeism in 1992 had allowed the mine to step up output this year to 300,000 tonnes of refined copper, from 276,000 tonnes in 1991. He said El Teniente planned to invest Dollars 712m between 1993-2000 to bring new areas into production. Although the mine still has huge reserves, most of these are located in brittle primary rock which are costly and difficult to exploit.</p>

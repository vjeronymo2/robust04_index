			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Dragon with an eye on its futures: As China opens up to the world, Shanghai's financial markets are developing fast - perhaps too fast Shanghai, in the spring of its economic transformation, appears to be confounding even the most determined optimists. Few predicted it would move quite so fast in re-establishing itself as a financial centre and magnet for foreign investment. After an uncertain start in the 1980s Shanghai's almost passionate embrace of the marketplace is palpable. The opening on Monday of an interbank currency market is yet one more indication of the rapid steps being taken towards restoring the city's former financial status. Indications that the Shanghai Securities Exchange will soon allow foreign brokers unrestricted membership, thus freeing them from the obligation of trading through local counterparts, is another sign of progress towards realisation of the city's dream of becoming first a national and then an international financial trading post. All the more remarkable, perhaps, is the speed of the city's recovery after years of relative decline. This slide in its fortunes owed much to Beijing's decision to keep Shanghai, with its history of destructive radicalism during Mao's Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, on a tight leash, while allowing free rein to the southern regions adjacent to Hong Kong. As a consequence, Shanghai's once virtually unchallenged status as China's industrial and exporting powerhouse was gradually eroded. Between 1978, the year China tentatively opened its doors to the outside world, and 1992-93, its contribution to national exports declined from 30 per cent to 7 per cent. In 1985 it surrendered to neighbouring Jiangsu province its coveted status as the regional centre with the greatest absolute value of industrial output Like an oriental Gulliver, Shanghai was being strangled. But Shanghai's fortunes changed in 1992 when ailing senior leader Deng Xiaoping, anxious to ensure his economic reforms were consolidated before he died, ordered that the shackles be removed. The enterprising Shanghainese needed little encouragement to do what comes naturally to them - making money. Although substantial obstacles remain - such as a crumbling infrastructure after decades of neglect, and an archaic banking system unable to meet the demands of a modern economy - municipal officials make liberal use of superlatives to describe their ambition to transform Shanghai into the 'dragon head' of China's economic revolution. Shanghai's vice-mayor Xu Kuangdi likens the future roles of Shanghai and Hong Kong to those of complementary players in a 'Beijing Opera'. Hong Kong will continue to be a conduit between China and the countries of South East Asia, while Shanghai will form a 'golden highway' between 'China and the rest of the world'. Mr Xu would seem to have a point about Shanghai's role when it comes to markets - whether equities, bonds, commodities' futures or currencies. In scarcely more than a year Shanghai's markets have undergone extraordinarily rapid development. The city is home to the country's three dominant commodities' futures markets - petroleum, cereals and metals. The last of these is now the world's third largest metals exchange and is beginning to influence trading in London and Chicago. Trading volume on the Shanghai metals exchange soared to Yuan388.9bn (Dollars 44.7bn) in 1993 from Yuan48.8bn after opening for business in May 1992. Shanghai's fledgling interbank market will form the nucleus of a national currency trading system. All important regional exchanges will eventually be linked electronically with Shanghai, and it is hoped this will facilitate steps towards making the Chinese yuan a fully convertible international currency. But progress is likely to be slow since a national electronic dealing system is far from being in place. The city will also soon be home to an experimental gold exchange to be organised by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, which holds the monopoly over gold trading. Initially, the gold market will be restricted to enterprises directly involved in the Chinese gold industry, but gradually it will be allowed to evolve into a gold exchange open to the public. Chinese consumers last year purchased 223 tonnes of gold jewellery, according to the World Gold Council, making China the fourth biggest market for gold behind the US, India and Saudi Arabia. It is a measure of Shanghai's growing strength as a financial centre that attempts by provincial governments, such as Jiangsu, to establish their own futures markets are tending to wither on the vine. Indeed, the central authorities have called a halt for the moment to the proliferation of futures exchanges following the near collapse of some and pending the drafting of new trading regulations. Shanghai officials are using the city's revival to spur the growth of what they refers to as its tertiary sector, which includes both financial services and high-technology industries. At the same time the city is shrinking the low-technology state-run sector dominated by textiles. By the year 2000 tertiary industries will account for 45 per cent of the city's economy, against 37.8 per cent at the end of 1993, according to the municipal plan. In this, the municipality is being assisted by a surge in investment, much of its destined for projects in the city's new Pudong Development Zone, on the east bank of the Huangpu River. In the first two months of 1994, foreign investors pledged Dollars 1.1bn of new investment. By October, according to the American Consulate, 86 'Fortune 500' companies had invested in Shanghai, including McDonell Douglas, Du Pont, Xerox and Coca Cola. In spite of Shanghai's growing self-confidence, however, there are considerable obstacles to the city's almost boundless ambition. These include a huge knowledge gap in a population starved for years of contact with the outside world. Teething problems abound, such as relatively frequent computer glitches in the Securities Exchange's supposedly state-of-the-art trading system. Trading surges tend to bring the system down. The markets, including securities and commodities' futures, are also labouring under a lack of national regulations. Insider trading is a persistent problem, especially in the commodities' exchanges, where some of the bigger players are also China's monopolistic state trading corporations. This poses a threat to individual and smaller institutional investors who are in danger of being squeezed. The drafting of a new securities law and commodities trading regulations is progressing slowly, to the chagrin of local securities traders. Market managers recognise the need for a confidence boost to lift the equities markets, which have been depressed since last year and show little sign of recovering. This has tested the nerves of local investors who have been deserting stocks in droves for currencies and futures. The Shanghai A-share market, restricted to Chinese investors in local currency, fell by about 50 per cent last year from a high in mid-February 1993. The B-share market, denominated in US dollars for foreign investors, has also experienced a bumpy ride and is well off its highs of last year. In spite of its bearish mood, the equities market is still developing fast. Trading volume increased fivefold in 1993. At the end of last year some 133 A and B share companies had been listed, up from 38 a year earlier. Numbers of listed companies grew further to 177 by the end of March. Western securities analysts in Shanghai believe the gloom in the stock market is temporary and is, in any case, attributable to a difficult learning process among investors unschooled in the vicissitudes of the marketplace. Mr John Crossman, chief representative in Shanghai of the Jardine Fleming securities house, says it is understandable that China's emerging markets should be volatile, and he expects this pattern to continue for the next five to 10 years: 'There's tremendous risk in this market, but there are also prospects for enormous gain. It's going to be wild.' The disappointing performance of Shanghai securities markets and reservations about China's regulatory abilities have not deterred foreign banks and securities houses from moving to the city. At last count, there were 26 foreign brokerages in Shanghai dealing in B-shares - including Barings, Jardine Fleming, Credit Lyonnais and Standard Chartered. Hard-pressed officials at the stock exchange joke that it seems now to have become the city's principal tourist attraction. Among a steady stream of high-level visitors in the past weeks have been Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, Mr Joseph Hardiman, president of the US NASDAQ exchange and Mr Peter Baring, chairman of Barings. Not least among the attractions for them is the prospect of Chinese pension funds which, swollen with contributions, would seek help in investing vast amounts of money internationally. With China undergoing such a rapid transformation to a market economy, and with a process of corporatisation of previously state-controlled industries well under way, it is only a matter of time before Chinese superannuation funds develop a big appetite for investment opportunities abroad. The development of Chinese mutual funds and unit trusts is also in the wind. Visits to Shanghai by representatives of the international financial community show that, after years of isolation, China, and Shanghai in particular, is being drawn inexorably into the world trading and financial system. But representatives of foreign securities houses also caution that Shanghai has a long way to go towards realising its ambition to rival New York, London or Tokyo. Apart from an archaic banking system (banking reform lags far behind other sectors) and lack of full currency convertibility, Shanghai also labours under the burden of a primitive legal framework and an absence of transparency in financial rules and regulations. But foreign bankers and securities traders believe that these impediments may not be a bad thing for the time being. 'They shouldn't go forward too quickly,' says Mr Crossman of Jardine Fleming. 'If they move too fast they run the risk of not having the regulations in place to assert control. Their banking system could not cope, for example, with vast sums of money flowing in and out.' Shanghai may have to learn to be more patient if it is to consolidate its gains - but patience does not appear to be a conspicuous virtue these days in a city striving to regain its former glory.</p>

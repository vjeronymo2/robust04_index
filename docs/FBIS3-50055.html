			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Aspects of Human Rights; M.A. Martinez </F> Received by Leading Representatives of the Slovak Republic"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava -- [passage omitted] Slovak  Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic received Miguel Angel  Martinez, president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council  of Europe, in the early evening yesterday. Their talks  concerned primarily aspects of human and civic rights of  individuals and national communities, the ratification of the  Slovak Republic's agreement on association with the European  Union [EU] by the parliaments of EU member states, and the  Partnership for Peace project. [passage omitted]    At a briefing held after the meeting, Miguel Angel Martinez  reiterated his conviction that Slovakia is a country respecting  the freedom of citizens and their right of assembly. The  Komarno rally [of representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8  January 1994] is a proof of this. Ivan Gasparovic stressed the  fact that M.A. Martinez had declared his visit as a working trip  to one of the member countries of the Council of Europe and not  as an inspection.    The highest representative of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic briefed his guest about the territorial and  administrative division of Slovakia currently under preparation  and about Slovakia's rejection of the [Hungarian minority  representatives'] project of the country's division on the basis  of the ethnic principle. He also spoke with him about planned  legislation addressing the issue of designating the names of  communities in the language of ethnic minorities and the writing  of their names and surnames. The president of the Parliamentary  Assembly of the Council of Europe showed understanding for this  approach. [passage omitted]    Later in the evening, at the end of the first day of the  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly delegation's stay in  Slovakia, Miguel Angel Martinez was received by Slovak Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar.</p>

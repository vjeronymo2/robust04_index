			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: Thinker on the trigger 'Workers of the world unite' has given way to putting thinkers of the world on screen for 1960s student revolutionary Tariq Ali. His latest project is a series of films about philosophers. The first, on Wittgenstein, is for release this week. A second in the can is on Spinoza. Another, on Locke, is scheduled for filming this autumn. 'I'm hoping Jonathan Miller will play him,' says Ali, adding that while presenting his subjects' ideas, he isn't doing it classroom-style. 'The idea is to explain their philosophies through the way they lived their lives.' Hence, a good candidate for a fourth film would surely be Oxford's F H Bradley who died in 1924. True, in Britain he was rarely seen outside Merton College where he lived as a bachelor, but he often took health-restoring trips abroad where he had some intriguing adventures. One was to link up with a red-headed writer called Elinor Glyn who scandalised Edwardian society with her novel Three Weeks about a steamy affair in exotic settings. The result was a popular jingle: Would you like to sin with Elinor Glyn on a tiger skin? Or would you prefer to err with her on some other fur? Whether she did any sinning with Bradley is uncertain. While the fact that he was 65 when they met makes it less likely, his writings show he doubted that he could have a Platonic relationship with a woman. What he certainly had, however, was a fierce hatred of cats which, when feasible, he shot at with a revolver. Nor evidently did he see them as his only potential enemies, because he never went abroad without carrying one of the three pistols that were found in his college room on his death, none of them registered with the police. All of which sheds odd light on Bradley's brand of philosophy. He was an idealist.</p>

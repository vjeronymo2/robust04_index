			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The Long View: A swing to the dollar FIRST, SOME anniversaries. It is 500 years since Christopher Columbus discovered America by mistake, and 200 years since the US dollar was created. It is 60 years since the last elected Republican party US president was rejected for his second term - Herbert Hoover in 1932, a victim, like George Bush, of the nation's perception of his failure to tackle economic difficulties. Now Bill Clinton inherits the legacies and responsibilities; only history will tell if he is another Franklin D. Roosevelt. Clinton's victory was almost a foregone conclusion and so the financial markets have reacted calmly. In fact, the dollar appears to have bottomed out some weeks ago, when it briefly dipped to DM1.40 for the second time early in October. From there, it has bounced more than 10 per cent. As for poor old sterling, the brief glory of the two-dollar pound late in August has been extinguished by the cold reality of a current rate little above Dollars 1.50, representing a 30 per cent leap for the dollar and one that will gratify the devotees of the purchasing power parity theory of exchange rates. This turnround by the dollar against the European currencies partly reflects the feeling that the peak of D-Mark interest rates has certainly passed, but equally the growing opinion that the trough for dollar rates is being formed, too. At present, the money market rate on dollars is just over 3 per cent, on D-Marks, around 9 per cent. It would not be surprising to see those rates converge quite close together over the next 12 months. Published figures show moderately strong economic growth in the US, with a provisional GDP growth figure of 2.7 per cent annualised for the third quarter - albeit a pre-polling day statistic received with some disbelief by the markets. Now Bill Clinton is heading for power armed with spending plans which are rather more credible than his compensating cost-cutting programmes. He inherits, incidentally, a Federal budget deficit of Dollars 300bn-plus, or 6 per cent of GNP. The deficit remains a formidable obstacle and one which, on the disaster scenarios, could conceivably start expanding out of control as the debt burden compounds: Dollars 300bn here and Dollars 400bn there, and pretty soon you have the darndest credit rating problem. Long-term interest rates have therefore been moving rather differently from those at the short end. The long bond yield hit 8 per cent in May and slid to 7.2 per cent at the beginning of September but has subsequently risen to 7.7 per cent as the Clinton bandwagon has rolled confidently towards the White House. Meanwhile, the US stock market has continued to move resolutely sideways. The pattern has varied somewhat across different sectors of the market, so that the 30 blue chips in the Dow Jones Average tended to perform better in the early part of the year, while the broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 hit a high in September (almost coinciding with that of the long bond) and has stayed very close to it. However, the remarkable feature of Wall Street in 1992 has been its steadiness; the gap between the high and low on the S&amp;P's 500 is a mere 8 per cent (against 22 per cent in the case of our own All-Share Index, for example). American stocks have, of course, been suffering from valuation problems. The backward-looking price-earnings ratio on the S&amp;P's is still a formidable 27, and although that continues to be artificially inflated by last year's wave of restructuring provisions, the prospective 1992 p/e is a still offputting 19 or so. Steady earnings growth of, say, 15 per cent in 1993 could bring that down to 16 or so, but the problem all this year has been the sheer difficulty of presenting this projected earnings pattern as a justification for a surge in prices. Certainly, international fund managers have concluded that Wall Street is overpriced. 'Where is the foreign investor?' complained the Securities Industry Association last week, releasing figures that showed foreigners sold Dollars 1bn net of US equities in the second quarter (though they were substantial buyers of US Treasury bonds). British pension funds, for instance, hold only 21 per cent of their overseas equity portfolios in US stocks. A neutral weighting, in terms of market capitalisation, would be more than twice as large. The difference may not be so much between US and foreign opinion as between amateur and professional investors. The record demand for US mutual funds has provided the key feature of 1992, with equity funds notching up amazing net sales of Dollars 50.9bn during the first eight months (although on average investors have lost money on equity funds so far this year). Bond funds have pulled in an even more formidable Dollars 81.9bn. But because the basis of this demand for mutual funds appears be a flight from low-yielding savings deposits, as the US banking system shrivels before our very eyes, there are obvious fears about the consequences should short-term interest rates rebound. On this reasoning, Wall Street may have nowhere to go but down. If the economy recovers and earnings are strong, interest rates will go up and the flow into mutual funds will be reversed. Alternatively, if interest rates stay low, it will be because the economy fails to revive and the earnings recovery which the market is discounting will fail to happen. One final anniversary. It is 21 years since the Bretton Woods agreement broke up and the dollar left its peg of Dollars 35 to the ounce. Since then, it has lost two-thirds of its domestic purchasing power and more than half its value against the D-Mark and the yen. But the US is big enough for the Americans to regard dollar weakness as a problem for foreigners, not themselves. It will not be a problem for the immediate future, though, as the markets nervously adjust to the Clinton presidency.</p>

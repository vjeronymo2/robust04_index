			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Vickers doubles its loss to Pounds 25.9m VICKERS, the UK engineering group, fell to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 25.9m last year, double the loss of the previous year, under the impact of a further steep fall in sales of its Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury cars. The company is launching a one for four share issue to raise Pounds 60.5m to bolster its balance sheet, which has been weakened by exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 65.8m in the last two years. The dividend for the year has been cut to 1.5p, from 6p in 1991 and 9.9p in 1990. The share price rallied yesterday to close up 6p at 124p. The new shares will be priced at 95p per share, and the issue will be underwritten by Lazard Brothers. Vickers' pre-tax loss of Pounds 25.9m had risen from a deficit of Pounds 12.4m a year earlier under the impact of exceptional charges of Pounds 31.4m, including restructuring costs of Pounds 30.1m. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the group's loss-making luxury car subsidiary, accounted for re-structuring costs of Pounds 18.2m following exceptional charges of Pounds 31.4m in 1991. Vickers also suffered restructuring costs of Pounds 4.6m at Cantieri Riva, its Italian luxury powerboat business. Group turnover rose to Pounds 718.5m from Pounds 652.2m in 1991, while trading profits fell to Pounds 12.6m from Pounds 20.9m. The automotive engineering operations, which include Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Cosworth engines and Riva, incurred trading losses of Pounds 15.8m compared with Pounds 17.3m in 1991, while trading profits at the defence and aerospace components division fell 13.9 per cent to Pounds 13.6m. Under the impact of the group's rising debts, net interest costs rose to Pounds 7.1m compared with net interest income of Pounds 1.1m in 1991. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said the group had suffered 'exceptionally severe trading conditions in its major markets over the last two years'. Vickers had net debts of Pounds 100.1m at the end of 1992 compared with cash, net of borrowings, of Pounds 11.5m at the end of 1990, while shareholders' funds had contracted from Pounds 271.5m to Pounds 206.4m over the same period. Vickers' gearing had risen to nearly 50 per cent by the end of 1992, but Sir Colin said the rights issue would reduce the gearing to about 15 per cent. Lex, Page 24; Rolls-Royce, Page 26</p>

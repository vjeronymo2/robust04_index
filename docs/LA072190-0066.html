			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 COSMONAUTS MUST WALK IN SPACE AGAIN TO REPAIR A STICKING HATCH  </P> <P> Two cosmonauts who nearly ran out of oxygen when they were locked out of their  space station by a sticky hatch must take another space walk next week to  repair the door, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Friday.  </P> <P> The cosmonauts, who encountered the trouble when they were outside their space  station making repairs on Tuesday, will venture out again to fix the hatch, the  paper said.  </P> <P> A ground controller at the Soviet Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad said  cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin will make the new space walk  Thursday.  </P> <P> Solovyev and Balandin went outside the Mir space station to fix thermal  insulation that was damaged during the launch of the Soyuz TM-9 capsule they  must use to return to Earth.  </P> <P> At the end of the strenuous space walk, which took two hours longer than  planned, the cosmonauts were prevented from re-entering the spacecraft because  they could not completely close the hatch they were using to re-enter.  </P> <P> With their oxygen running dangerously low, they were forced to use an emergency  porthole on another part of the space station complex to get back inside, seven  hours after their exit.  </P> <P> Once inside, they apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end of the  air-lock compartment that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. Isaulov told  Pravda that the outside hatch is "slightly ajar," leaving the air-lock  compartment unsealed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: SURVIVOR OF TITAN FOOTBALL GETS SECOND CHANCE AT PURDUE  </P> <P> A decade removed from his last head coaching job, Jim Colletto kicks back in  his new office at Purdue University, reveling in the difference between then  and now.  </P> <P> "Right now," Colletto says, speaking by phone, "I'm looking out the window of  my beautiful office at a stadium that seats 70,000. I can see an indoor  practice facility that's as good as any in the country. I'm coaching at a  school that plays in a great football conference."  </P> <P> Colletto laughs.  </P> <P> "My office in Fullerton, I had to put the plywood on the wall myself. My office  also shared a wall with the girls' gymnasium and the hot steam from the showers  made the plywood buckle."  </P> <P> The wall makes an apt metaphor for Colletto's five-year tenure at Cal State  Fullerton (1975-79). It, too, buckled -- bowing under the strain of having  pushed the Division I issue before Fullerton was even close to ready.  </P> <P> In 1975, Colletto was the youngest Division I head coach in the country and  Fullerton was the youngest Division I football team in the country. Colletto  was 30 at the time, a winner during his playing days at UCLA, where he  captained the 1966 Rose Bowl champions. Fullerton football was six, having  completed a successful run at the Division II level under Dick Coury and Pete  Yoder.  </P> <P> It was going to be a case of youth serving youth. The idea was for Colletto and  the Titans to grow together, to learn together, to struggle and develop and  mature together.  </P> <P> Nice idea.  </P> <P> Five years later, Colletto was the oldest 35-year-old football coach alive,  beaten down by a 17-38-1 record, exhausted from running the same obstacle  course Gene Murphy runs today. After a 3-8 season in 1979, Colletto resigned,  unsure if his head coaching career hadn't lost its grip on the very first rung.  </P> <P> "Neale Stoner (then Fullerton athletic director) told me my best chance to get  back was to go somewhere and be a coordinator," Colletto said. "Neale said,  'That'll give you the opportunity to outlive this problem.'  </P> <P> "It worked."  </P> <P> Colletto returned to UCLA, where his old teammate, Terry Donahue, was head  coach. "Terry was kind enough to hire me as an assistant and let me regroup for  a couple years," Colletto said. From there, it was on to stints as offensive  coordinator at Purdue, Arizona State and Ohio State before, 11 days ago, Purdue  named Colletto as its new head coach.  </P> <P> Yes, good things can happen to old Titans who wait.  </P> <P> Colletto lost many things at Fullerton -- games, naivete, hair, a smoothly  functioning digestive tract -- but a sense of humor wasn't among them. Ask him  about those bygone years and Colletto will crack, "I've tried to forget them  all."  </P> <P> He hasn't, though. For a long time those years seemed to be the albatross  around the neck of his resume, but time -- along with a lucrative five-year  contract at Purdue -- has shed a kinder light on the dark ages of Jim Colletto.  </P> <P> "That whole situation, as difficult as it was, was a very valuable experience,"  Colletto said. "It was like a laboratory experiment, and I don't mean that  facetiously. You're thrown into an environment where you're going to make  mistakes. You learn pretty fast that there's a lot more to it than Xs and O's  and that you're not going to be the next Knute Rockne.  </P> <P> "But every problem I experienced there has been magnified at every school I've  been at since. It's given me a little better perspective."  </P> <P> A checklist of those problems, circa 1979, sounds painfully familiar. Has  Colletto been sitting in on any of Murphy's media luncheons lately?  </P> <P> "We played all over the place. We played every stadium dedication and  homecoming across the country. . . .  </P> <P> "I had great support from the athletic administration -- Neale Stoner,  (president) Donald Shields -- but we didn't have many resources. There was no  on-campus housing. There were very few funds for recruiting and there was zilch  for game films. I had to use my own camera, my own Super-8 and my own film. I  raked the practice field to have it soft enough for practice.  </P> <P> "There was a whole litany of things. It was all the result of trying to move up  to Division I when the school wasn't ready."  </P> <P> Is it yet? Fullerton has just now broken ground on the on-campus football  stadium that, Colletto says, "was first proposed when I was there." And this  season, the Titans broke new ground of a different sort -- finishing 1-11, the  worst single-season record in the school's history.  </P> <P> "I keep up with what's going on there," Colletto said. "I think Gene Murphy has  done a great job. He had a rough year this year. but I don't know how they can  expect to have winning records there, year-in and year-out.  </P> <P> "The money problems are inherent. They'll always be there. And from a fairness  standpoint, they're physically incapable of playing those big schools, where  you get the big scores. Gene's done about as good a job as you can do there."  </P> <P> Today, different problems confront Colletto. He has inherited from Fred Akers a  Purdue program that was crippled by one quarterback transfer -- Jeff George, to  Illinois -- and now has to ward off a second, now that run-and-shoot incumbent  Eric Hunter no longer has Akers' run-and-shoot to run.  </P> <P> "I had a meeting with Eric," Colletto said, "and told him that in nine years as  an offensive coordinator, I worked with Scott Campbell, who's now  quarterbacking the Atlanta Falcons; Jim Everett, who you know about; Jeff Van  Raaphorst, who was a Rose Bowl MVP, and Greg Frey, who set records at Ohio  State.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Eric, if you want to play somewhere else, fine,' but I think he's  going to stay."  </P> <P> Colletto has a reputation for fine craftsmanship when it comes to grooming  young quarterbacks. That's an improvement. At Fullerton, Colletto had a  reputation for fine craftsmanship when it came to putting up office walls.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Partnership </F> for a United Democratic Europe"]    [Text] There is no shortage of -- on the surface --  effective "unidirectional" solutions to the problems of Europe's  security. Two myths, which their supporters consider to be  axioms of current European policy, lie at the heart of these  recommendations. First, there is the theory that there is a  "security vacuum" or "gray zone" in Central Europe, which will  almost inevitably become the sphere of Russian expansion.  Second, there is the theory that refers to "Russia's return to  a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent  parliamentary elections.    Combining the two hypotheses leads to this conclusion: NATO  must protect the countries of Central Europe from the inexorable  pressure from the East.    Accepting the theory of a "security vacuum" means rejecting  the very essence of the pan-European process expressed in the  Paris Charter and the unity of the democratic nations of Europe.  This would be the most major crack in the supporting pillars of  European policy, which, despite apparently insurmountable  difficulties, has brought about the reunification of Germany and  led to the collapse of the 20th century's totalitarian monsters.    If I were to make a prediction about the worst case scenario  -- the restoration of Russian imperialism -- it would not come  from the invasion of the West by "Russian tanks," but from a  repetition of the Yugoslav drama in the former USSR. The  repercussions of this would be tens of millions of refugees and  upheaval in the large industrial complexes, and the threat of  tactical nuclear weapons deployment. What could NATO do in this  situation to protect its eastern members? Several Chernobyls  would be enough to finish off the whole of Europe -- with  interest. The "guard on the Bug" would be incapable of  protecting anyone.    However, this worst case scenario could be provoked by the  hasty expansion of NATO. This presents the extremists in Russia  with a most convincing argument in favor of restoring the  Russian empire, because "it is necessary to defend ourselves"  against "pressure from the West." The strategy of the "worst  case scenario" is dangerous, therefore, because it contains the  detonator of a prophecy that may then fulfill itself.  <H5>  The Russian Factor in European Security </H5>   Anxiety about a new "threat from the East" can be dispelled  -- first and foremost -- by a partnership strategy with  democratic Russia, which has embarked upon the policy of  establishing a law- governed state and a market economy.    Russia's presidential foreign policy has already made  evident  its orientation toward implementing the country's nation-state  interests by means of partnership and not by confrontation with  the surrounding world. This orientation is enshrined in the  democratic constitution. Russia does not have territorial  claims against any state, including the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe. Russia's new military doctrine orients its armed  forces exclusively toward defending the country and its allies  and toward peacekeeping operations in harmony with Russia's  international commitments.    As far as the results of the parliamentary elections are  concerned, I am convinced that there is no fertile ground for  pro- fascist tendencies in Russia, because Russia placed more  sacrifices than any other country on the altar of victory over  fascism. The voters cast their ballots not in favor of a "march  toward the West," but in favor of a "leap into warmer waters,"  that is, not for the violent restoration of the Soviet Union and  the socialist camp. They voted against the ambitions and  arrogance of some reformers, against their inability to explain  the aims of reform to the people in simple, ordinary language,  and against the shortcomings in social security for the  population and in the struggle with crime. Russian democrats  have already begun to draw unavoidable conclusions from the  sobering lesson of the parliamentary elections. However, this  will definitely not take the form of toying with right-wing  extremism. We condemn any overt or covert form of extremism,  aggressive nationalism, and fascism.    The West should now draw some conclusions from this and  modify the tone and accent of its dialogue with Russia. The  pedantic language in it is inappropriate. It is hard to  associate partnership with the submission of proposals that we  have to either adopt in full or reject completely, without the  right to amend them to suit our interests.    Right now Russia needs to feel greater support from outside  for the reform line. A precise and detailed strategy for  cooperation between Russia and its democratic allies in the West  has to be drawn up. We need new strategic concepts and the  mechanisms to implement them, mechanisms that would emphatically  express the current level of progress in our relations. And  most important of all -- it is essential to move forward on the  promises Russia received in Tokyo at the meeting with the  leading representatives of the seven most industrially advanced  nations (G-7) toward multilateral cooperation, that is, to the  fulfillment of these promises.  <H5>  Partnership on Behalf of a United Europe </H5>   In designing the new European architecture, it is important  to take into consideration the following criteria:    A balanced step-by-step approach toward transforming  Europe's  security. It is essential to eliminate "shock diplomacy"  methods and the policy of faits accomplis. The Russian side  favors broad consultations with all the countries involved.    The openness of regional organizations and institutions as a  guarantee for their successful adaptation to the current  European situation. Russia has no right to dictate who can and  cannot join NATO. We have the right, however, to assume that  the North Atlantic Alliance will take into consideration the  specific features of the inevitable long-term transition period  and -- since we are talking about the longer-term perspective --  that it will confirm the position contained in its documents  declaring NATO to be an organization open to the entry of all  democratic states in the Euro- Atlantic region. It is  impossible to discount the possibility a priori that Russia will  also apply for entry into NATO in the future. The primary task  is to guarantee an effective and equal partnership during the  period of mutual transformation and adaptation.    Providing guarantees for an equal standard of security for  each European state. The creation of "first and second class  security," "gray zones," "special spheres of influence,"  "isolated regions," and "cordons sanitaire" in Europe is  unacceptable.    The preservation of the current principles for European  security, which are based on treaties.    The removal of territorial claims within the framework of  interstate relations in Europe.    The main aims of the strategy that we propose, for  partnership in the political sphere in the area of security, are  as follows:    First: Forging North Atlantic cooperation. Transforming the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) into a  general regional political organization and the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council (NACC) into an independent organization for  military-political cooperation, but closely associated with the  CSCE. It is necessary to orient them toward coordinating the  efforts of NATO, the Western European Union, and the  Commonwealth of Independent States in the spheres of improving  international security and the peace-forming and sincere  protection of ethnic rights and of linguistic and other  minorities in Europe. I consider the acceptance of the  declaration on resistance to aggressive nationalism during the  CSCE conference in Rome to be a major step in this direction.    It is essential to understand NACC not an "anteroom" to NATO  in accordance with the formula "NATO plus," but -- as was  intended at the time of its establishment -- as an independent  instrument for equal partnership among former adversaries in the  interest of building a new Europe. The proposals to expand the  NACC by including the European neutral states and to create a  compact NACC secretariat are arousing great interest. It is  necessary to orient the Council toward developing cooperation in  the spheres of security, military planning, conversion, and  peace missions.    Second: Creating a system of mutually interlinked security  guarantees for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The  more these states are interlinked, the stronger their relations  will be. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to consider -- for  example -- creating a kind of "safety net" on the basis of  mutually supplementary agreements on security between Germany  and Poland and Poland and Russia. Analogous agreements could  also be proposed to the other states in the region.    Three: I welcome the proposals put forward by my German  colleague, K. Kinkel, concerning the signing of an agreement on  cooperation and consultations between NATO on the one hand and  the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine  on the other hand. The establishment of a communications  channel between NATO and the CIS would also be a positive  element.    Four: An improvement in the ability of the European states  to actively participate in the peace process. At the moment, to  be frank, the East and West have not found a solid response to  the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the former USSR. These  problems are turning into major problems within the framework of  European security. Our partners should give genuine support to  the efforts of Russia, which is bearing the main burden of the  peace process in the former USSR. The time has come to create a  voluntary support fund for the peace process in the CIS. NACC  could offer practical assistance (whether by providing finance  or preparing staff).    Fifth: The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe.  It is wrong to regard the Russian-Ukrainian dispute over  strategic missiles as a matter or element of Soviet heritage.  It involves preserving the regime of nuclear non-proliferation.  The strategy for European partnership must contain strong  incentives for adhering to the current nuclear non-proliferation  treaty.    The economic aspect of partnership forms a special chapter.  The gist of it is: During the transition from individual,  chronically overdue programs to help incorporate Russia into the  international division of labor on an equal and  non-discriminatory basis, it is necessary to guarantee Russia  access to European markets.    The dialogue on the strategy for partnership in Europe is  progressing actively. I believe that the NATO summit, by means  of its well considered and far-reaching decisions, will make a  positive contribution to its development. Russia remains for  the members of the North Atlantic Alliance a responsible partner  interested in drawing up such a strategy.</p>

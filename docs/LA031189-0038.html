			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARNATION TO ALTER LABEL ON BABY FORMULA  </P> <P> Carnation Co., under fire for using an infant formula label that has been  called misleading, on Friday said it will remove the term "hypo-allergenic"  from its Good Start H.A. product.  </P> <P> Carnation said the label change, which will be effective in April, is being  made to eliminate potential consumer confusion about the word  "hypo-allergenic," which means reduced potential for allergic reaction.  </P> <P> "Carnation Good Start H.A. is hypo-allergenic but not non-allergenic," said  Carnation President Timm Crull. "The distinction is significant to a very  small, but potentially vulnerable, group of infants who are severely allergic  and who should change formulas only under the direct supervision of a  physician."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adverse Reactions Reported  </P> <P> The term hypo-allergenic, used on a number of product labels, has become the  subject of controversy. The Food and Drug Administration has asked companies --  Carnation, among them -- to prove that their products are more easily tolerated  by some allergic consumers. The FDA also has asked industry to help develop an  easily understood definition for "hypo-allergenic."  </P> <P> The FDA is also investigating six reported incidents of adverse reactions to  Good Start. Carnation, a subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle SA, introduced Good  Start last November.  </P> <P> The move did not satisfy critics -- among them, Action for Corporate  Accountability, a Minneapolis-based consumer group. Carnation should also  remove the initials "H.A." from the product, according to Janice Mantell,  executive director of the organization.  </P> <P> "More than this cosmetic change is necessary," she said. "Nestle's determined  effort to enter the lucrative infant formula market through its acquisition of  Carnation must not be made at the expense of the health of U.S. infants."  </P></p>

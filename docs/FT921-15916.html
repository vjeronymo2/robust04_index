			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls against D-Mark THE DOLLAR fell back substantially on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, as dealers focused on the weakness of the US economy ahead of important economic statistics due for release later this week. The US currency opened in Tokyo at DM1.5315, already down from Friday's close in New York of DM1.5425. However, the main weakness came during European trading with switching out of the dollar into European currencies, primarily the D-Mark. The dollar hit a low of DM1.5180 during the afternoon in London before finding support to end at DM1.5190 (the close in London on Friday was DM1.5465). It finished lower in New York at DM1.5160. Dealers said sentiment surrounding the US currency was negative ahead of non-farm payroll data for December due to be released on Friday. In the recent past, poor employment statistics have been the spur to monetary easing by the US authorities. Data for November showed a 217,000 fall in employment; market forecasts centre on a smaller decline of between 50,000 and 100,000 this time. However, the dollar was little changed against the yen, underlining that the flow of money out of the dollar was primarily in favour of European currencies. The dollar closed in London at Y124.05 (against Y124.85 on Friday). It slipped in New York to Y123.35. US President George Bush is due to visit Japan this week for talks which will include the trading relationship between the two countries. The visit has fuelled speculation that the US authorities are content to see a further depreciation of the dollar against the yen as a means of capping the US trade deficit with Japan. The weakness of the dollar posed problems for sterling yesterday within the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound lost  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.85. Dealers commented that there was no sign of intervention by central banks yesterday to support the UK currency. However, if the dollar comes under further pressure against the D-Mark this week, the Bank of England may be forced to support sterling. While most currency markets were open for business yesterday for the first time since Christmas, analysts noted that trading volumes were still low. The real position of the dollar against the D-Mark, and therefore the position of sterling within the ERM, may not be clear until the end of this week. Currency economists at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are forecasting a sterling rate of DM2.8450 by the end of the week. Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar strengthened following the launch of CDollars 850m bonds in the international bond market. The Canadian currency rose from CDollars 1.1470 to CDollars 1.1425 against the US dollar during the day, prompting intervention from the Bank of Canada to stem the rise. The Canadian authorities sold Canadian dollars at around the CDollars 1.1430 level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz </F> 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and  assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress, in  Paris, by unidentified correspondent in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the  Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of  the General People's Congress, has cast doubt on the truth of  the voice recording of the telephone conversation which Aden  intercepted and attributed to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  which included orders to continue the fighting despite the  cease-fire announcement. He said that "modern recorders can  forge anyone's voice. And the phrases I read in AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT contain terms the president does not usually use.  Anyone's voice can be imitated."    He was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from  his residence in Paris. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Ghani said: "We want a dialogue with the brothers in  the Socialist Party, except those against whom a decision was  issued by the prosecutor general. We do not believe that the  Socialist Party is working against unity. It is the elements  which exploded the situation militarily and squandered the Yemen  Arab Republic's capabilities." [passage omitted]    He pointed out that the "secessionists exploited the  cease-fire announced on the eve of 'Id al-Adha to safeguard the  people's lives and capabilities. So they continued their  rebellion and announced the secession. Then the Security  Council adopted a resolution, which we accepted for the sake of  public welfare and to prevent matters from escalating and  worsening, even though we opposed it on the grounds that the  crisis is an internal affair. But they still announced the  formation of a government."    He stressed that Sanaa's acceptance of the Security Council  "proceeds from its emphasis on unity and the sovereignty of the  Republic of Yemen over all its territory." Then he said: "We  had wanted from the outset to implement the Security Council  resolution, but the others' arbitrariness prevented us. And  when we set a date for the cease-fire, they sent their aircraft  and naval units to shell the targets of legitimacy, as attested  by reporters who were present in the sites."    He criticized the statement issued in Abha [Saudi Arabia] by  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] ministerial council. He  said, "I do not believe that the position taken by the GCC after  we did our utmost to improve relations with them is in the  interests of any state, Is the aim is to settle scores, it is  erroneous."</p>

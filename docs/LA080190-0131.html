			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS COUNCIL MEETING OPEN TO THE PUBLIC  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Arts said Tuesday that a series of meetings  Friday through Sunday of its 24-member advisory board would be open to the  public as a result of a court suit filed by four news organizations.  </P> <P> The announcement that the meeting of the National Council on the Arts would be  open for the first time in its 25-year history was made by NEA Chairman John E.  Frohnmayer.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer said that the decision was made after a suit was filed Monday  morning in U.S. District Court here by the Los Angeles Times, the Washington  Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the New York Times seeking access to the  meeting at which controversial grant applications are expected to be discussed.  </P> <P> "It is highly unusual for any agency of the federal government to conduct  application review in the glare of public scrutiny," Frohnmayer said. "But I am  convinced that there are significant advantages to having our citizens aware of  how this small amount of their money is invested in cultural activities all  Americans enjoy."

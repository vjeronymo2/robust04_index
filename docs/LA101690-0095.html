			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> A LITTLE TRAVELING MUSIC, PLEASE, FOR THIS MAESTRO  </P> <P> Thanks to conductor David Amos, some of San Diego's most notable music-making  this month will take place in London. Working with three local musical  colleagues -- violist Karen Elaine, baritone Sheldon Merel and San Diego State  University resident composer David Ward-Steinman -- the globe-trotting Amos  will make three recordings of American music with three London orchestras.  </P> <P> Known locally as the music director of the Jewish Community Center Orchestra,  Amos began recording in Israel several years ago. When he completes the London  project, Amos will have made seven recordings this year, a respectable tally  for a conductor not connected with a major orchestra.  </P> <P> By offering record companies musical programs off the beaten track -- Amos does  not see his own complete Beethoven symphony series in the offing -- the San  Diego conductor has found his niche. Labor costs in England, Israel and Poland,  where Amos made two recordings in June, are significantly lower than comparable  costs in the United States, so recording companies can afford to speculate on  this type of music.  </P> <P> Amos has specialized in music written by composers he knows and with whom he  has worked.  </P> <P> "If you are looking for music to record, the best method is to ask a composer  which of his compositions he thinks has been undeservedly neglected," Amos  said. Ward-Steinman, for example, was eager to have his Chamber Concerto No. 2  preserved on disc. Amos and the City Sinfonia of London are recording it this  afternoon for Harmonia Mundi records, with the composer on hand to offer his  interpretive counsel.  </P> <P> Another composition on the Ward-Steinman disc will be Norman Dello Joio's  "Lyric Fantasies," with Elaine performing the viola solo. Dello Joio, a  Pulitzer prize-winner and one of the elder statesmen of U.S. composers, wrote  "Lyric Fantasies," which is really a viola concerto, in 1973. Amos spoke with  the retired composer while he was preparing his conductor's score for the  upcoming recording session.  </P> <P> Merel, longtime cantor at San Diego's Congregation Beth Israel, will perform  the vocal solos in Alan Hovhaness' "Shepherd of Israel," to be recorded with  London's Philharmonia Orchestra. Amos has recorded several of the  Armenian-American composer's works recently, including a critically  well-received account of Hovhaness' "And God Created Great Whales."  </P> <P> A busy recording schedule is the bread and butter of the various London  orchestras, but according to Amos, the British musicians keep a good sense of  humor about the nonstop projects. But they are sufficiently jaded to size up a  guest conductor very quickly.  </P> <P> "I once asked a London concertmaster (the British call them 'leaders') how long  it typically took the musicians to evaluate a conductor once he started a  rehearsal. 'We know if he'll be any good before he steps on the podium,' was  the unhesitating reply."  </P> <P> Vocal relief. While most U.S. opera houses are well into their fall  productions, local opera buffs must mark time until San Diego Opera's season  opens in January. Temporary relief is in sight, however, with a pair of vocal  recitals sponsored by the local company at La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium.  Sunday at 7 p.m., German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz will make his American  recital debut, and the following Sunday, Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky  will sing his only West Coast recital this fall.  </P> <P> Blochwitz, who made his stage debut in 1984 as Lensky in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene  Onegin," made his Metropolitan Opera debut last month in Mozart's "Don  Giovanni." As Don Ottavio, a role he will sing for San Diego Opera in 1993, New  York Times music critic Donal Henahan praised Blochwitz for "his silvery tone  and a pliantly phrased 'Dalla sua pace' ." For the San Francisco Opera,  Blochwitz sang Idamante in Mozart's "Idomeneo."  </P> <P> Sunday's program will be devoted to two complete song cycles, Schubert's "Die  schone Mullerin" and Robert Schumann's "Dichterliebe." Blochwitz will be  accompanied by Australian pianist Peter Grunberg. Although the Hvorostovsky  recital is sold out, some tickets are available from the opera office for  Blochwitz.  </P> <P> Requiem for Rozsnyai. The San Diego Symphony's Oct. 19 performance of Gabriel  Faure's Requiem will be dedicated to Zoltan Rozsnyai, who died last month. The  symphony's music director from 1976-71, Rozsnyai conducted the orchestra's  first commercial recording. Current music director Yoav Talmi will conduct this  performance of the Requiem, assisted by the La Jolla Civic-University Chorus,  soprano Sivan Rotem and baritone Hector Vasquez.  </P> <P> Another new music director. Kerry Duse will fill the post left vacant by the  recent death of Zoltan Rozsnyai. Duse has been rehearsing the International  Orchestra at United States International University for the last few weeks and  will make his debut in his new role with the ensemble Dec. 14, 8 p.m., in La  Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium.  </P> <P> At USIU, Duse has directed more than 30 musical-theater productions and has  also conducted ballet and pops concerts with the International Orchestra.  Before his association with USIU, the California native spent five years as  music director of Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet. He had a similar post with  the Banff Festival Ballet and was principal pianist with Switzerland's Geneva  Opera.  </P></p>

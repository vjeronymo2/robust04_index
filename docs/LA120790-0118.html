			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN GETS 20 YEARS FOR CAPITOL BOMBING  </P> <P> Leftist radical Laura Whitehorn received a 20-year sentence Thursday for her  role in bombing the U.S. Capitol and conspiring to set off seven other  explosions that a prosecutor called acts of terrorism.  </P> <P> Whitehorn was sentenced along with co-defendant Linda Sue Evans, who was  ordered to serve five years for her part in the bombing conspiracy after  completing a 35-year term she is already serving for illegally buying firearms.  </P> <P> The two women, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain Sept. 7, were sentenced by  U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene at a proceeding punctuated by cheers and  applause from supporters.  </P> <P> The Nov. 7, 1983, bomb blast that blew a hole in the wall outside the Senate  chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in Washington and New York  City "were not symbolic gestures; they were distinct acts of terrorism,"  Assistant U.S. Atty. Margaret Ellen said. "Only chance prevented serious harm"  to people, she added.  </P></p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1's drama series The Lifeboat has been attracting remarkably few viewers. While Morecambe And Wise repeats from 25 years ago have been pulling in 10m and more, this series dreamed up by Lynda la Plante has been failing even to make it into BBC1's weekly Top 30, which means it is getting fewer than 5.8m viewers. Could it be that people are finally tiring of drama run off the production line like lumps of pre-moulded plastic? In today's episode Keith Barron plays a rich man who needs rescuing when his yacht runs aground (8.00). In Frontline journalist Simon Winchester who has lived in Hong Kong for seven years argues that the British government has mishandled its negotiations over the future of the crown colony because of its failure to understand the Chinese (9.00 C4). This week's 'Screen Two' drama, Criminal, tells the story of Simon Willerton, a teenager who hanged himself in prison in 1990 (9.00 BBC2). The Late Show is devoted to Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch born architect, trained at the Architectural Association in London, who is more famous for his theoretical writing than for any buildings (11.15 BBC2).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The priority as written supports research on issues related to ``outcome assessment and/or outcomes-based accountability for students with disabilities'' that ``include, but are not limited to'' the issues listed in the priority. The list is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, and to include a range of assessment and accountability issues without being excessively complex and prescriptive. Applicants may certainly address important research issues which are not included on this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Priority_Studying Models That Bridge the Gap Between Research and Practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that applicants should not be limited to the specific models mentioned in the background section and should be allowed to add or create models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that applicants should be allowed to add or create models. The models mentioned in the background section were meant only to serve as examples of the range of models. Applicants may study other existing models, such as teacher networking models, or use models they have created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has clarified the priority by revising the first two paragraphs under the ``Priority'' section so as to give applicants the option of creating models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter cited the priority as extremely important in making the final step between research findings and practice if research is to have meaning for students and teachers. The commenter suggested that the model testing involve a teacher training component in how to interpret and translate research findings into practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that the priority as written provides the potential to bridge the gap between research and practice and at the same time allows applicants the flexibility to select or create a model with such a training component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the Department require applicants to develop approaches that use a broad body of content/strategies that inform both special and regular education. The commenter also suggested that the applicant be required to present the research supporting the effectiveness of the content to be implemented and the rationale for site selection. It was further suggested that the term ``model'' was not appropriate because it suggested something standardized rather than an approach that could be ``*&blank;*&blank;* adapted and implemented to fit particular situations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that the approaches should be broad enough that they have potential implications for both special and general education. In fact, some of the models used as examples in the priority as written are based in regular education. The Secretary agrees that applicants should present the research literature supporting the effectiveness of the chosen approach and justify study sites, and notes that the selection criteria included in the application package address these issues. Further, judging the effectiveness of the implemented model is already a requirement of the priority. The Secretary believes that any further requirements would make the priority unnecessarily prescriptive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the commenters concern on the use of the term ``model'', for the purpose of this priority, the term ``model'' is meant in its more generic sense of a design or approach, thus allowing the applicant flexibility in selecting and implementing a knowledge utilization model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Priority_Student-Initiated Research Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that those working in classrooms are asking questions of immediate importance and suggested that this priority be modified to ``Teacher-Initiated Research Projects''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that teachers are deserving of support, but notes that they are eligible to apply through their local educational agencies for awards under the Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program. The Secretary believes that the priority as written is an important vehicle for attracting, promoting, and supporting potential new researchers on disability issues and is consistent with the student-initiated priority in the regulations at 34 CFR 324.10(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

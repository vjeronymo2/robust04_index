			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Taylor reforms Barclays Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, yesterday stamped his presence on the UK's largest bank by breaking up its divisional structure and replacing it with a set of management groups reporting directly to him. His reforms, including the creation of a group offering services to large companies, reduce the influence of Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the former banking division, who was a leading internal contender to be chief executive. The role of Mr Robinson was 'being nibbled away in the sense that the job he is doing ceases to exist', but his skills would be used in other ways, said Mr Taylor, who arrived from Courtaulds Textiles in January. He said Mr Robinson was 'a very valuable colleague' but pointed out that he would retire in three years' time. Mr Robinson's remit will include private banking and retail banking in Africa and the Caribbean. The reforms, which Mr Taylor described as a first step, created groups covering big companies and European retail banking. The new group for UK retail banking will report to Mr Taylor for the first time. Mr Graham Pimlott, chief executive of merchant banking at the BZW investment banking arm, is to head the group serving large companies. The bank's former service businesses division - one of three with banking and BZW - will be divided. Mr Joseph De Feo, its chief executive, will retain charge of technology while custody switches to Mr Pimlott's control. Mr Taylor said that he hoped to spend more time observing operating businesses, and less on tasks such as supervising 'a zillion central departments' and chairing executive committee meetings at Barclays' head office in the City. Mr Robinson, a vice-chairman of Barclays, will also deputise for Mr Taylor in his absence. 'I want Alastair (Robinson) to help me by taking on a lot of the central load here.' He said further reforms were likely to separate the bank's group functions from its operating arms. Barclays had been divided too heavily into different divisions and legal entities. 'This place is statutory entity-mad. I wish I could find the person who does it and stop him,' said Mr Taylor. Lex, Page 30</p>

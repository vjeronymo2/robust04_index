Such trust agreement may include a confidentiality agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission or court approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph III. B. 3. to accomplish the divestitures, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.

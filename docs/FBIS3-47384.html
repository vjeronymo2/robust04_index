Speaking to newsmen in Denpasar, the regional commander  clarified that de Mello will be free to talk to anyone or visit  any place he wishes in East Timor. Therefore, no restrictions  will be placed against Galvao de Mello compared to (Manuel  Tillman), a Macau (?programmer) who was originally from East  Timor and has been visiting Dili for the past week.    The regional commander hopes Galvao de Mello, who has been  given the freedom to visit East Timor, will personally observe  the existing situation there. He also hopes de Mello will then  clarify to the Portuguese community what he observed without  distorting any facts.    Meanwhile, after a meeting with the regional commander, de  Mello said his current visit to East Timor has no specific  bearing and that it was only aimed at further fostering ties  between Indonesia and Portugal.</p>

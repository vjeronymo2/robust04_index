			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major mounts attack on SNP A FIERCE attack on the Scottish National party marked the start of Mr John Major's day of campaigning in Scotland. The prime minister angrily denied that he was acting on the basis of party interest in the debate about Scotland's future. At a press conference in Edinburgh he rejected the suggestion that the Tories had been talking up support for the nationalists to split the anti-Tory vote. The SNP, he said, 'adheres to the sort of socialism that the whole of eastern Europe has thrown out'. He added: 'They are an immense danger to the potential future well-being of people who live in Scotland.' He used the fact that the Conservatives are weak in Scotland - the party holds just nine of the country's 72 seats - to reinforce his claims that the government's opposition to devolution or separation was based on the future prosperity of every region of Britain. 'If I was concerned solely about party self-advantage, I would say 'Go and have separation, have separation, come out of the Westminster parliament' and the effect of that would be that the Conservative party would be undefeatable in the rest of the United Kingdom.' He underlined his call for a full constitutional debate on Scotland, saying that the prize, but not the price, of devolution had been set out. The Tories' tactics have been to polarise the debate by discussing devolution purely in terms of its leading inevitably to separation. The prime minister accused Labour of risking long-term damage to the UK for short-term advantage. 'They portray as a panacea what is in reality a Pandora's box,' he said. 'Open that box - and the demon of separation would be let loose. We should not see it caged again so easily.' Mr Major acknowledged that some Scots felt a sense of grievance, but said the consequences of separation included not just the direct impact on Scotland's economy, but its position in the European Community. An independent Scotland would not have the same influence as the UK in EC negotiations and would not be able to deliver as good a deal. 'If after all the arguments have been carefully weighed, the people of Scotland want to break that bonds that bind us, then it can be done. No nation can be held within a union against its will,' Mr Major said. 'But it would be an unimaginable disaster were we to do so. Whether we intend to or not, if we take the wrong decision, we will break up the United Kingdom.'</p>

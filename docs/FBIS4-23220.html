			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Need for Taxes -- An editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 1 June on page 22 begins by noting that President  Mandela has "stirred a hornet's nest" by speaking of the need to  raise taxes. The proposal to apply the top tax rate of 43  percent to income above 80,000 rand is especially controversial  because it would affect so many people. While supporting the  "upliftment of South Africa's poor" and the aims of the  Reconstruction and Development Program, the editorial expresses  reservations about the tax proposals: "What the Government needs  to achieve is a measure of income redistribution without  demotivating or -- worse -- driving out the nation's relatively  small pool of highly skilled professional and business people.  The conundrum of how to find more money might possibly be  solved via the indirect (rather than direct) tax route. The  Government should consider this as an option."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   KwaZulu State of Emergency -- "The state of emergency in  KwaZulu/Natal is clearly an impotent measure and should be  lifted immediately." So argues an editorial in the Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on page 8 on 1 June. It notes that "hundreds  of people" have died there since the state of emergency was  declared and goes on to assert: "While rivalry between IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC supporters is a contributing  factor,...the primary causes of bloodshed can be traced to  poverty, landlessness and the absence of basic amenities. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme of the Government is  aimed at addressing some of these problems and there seems  little need for an ineffective state of emergency which is  simply going to hinder the real work required in KwaZulu/Natal."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   New Police Plan Welcomed -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans  on 30 May in a page-8 editorial says that the new police plan is  welcome. "Doing away with military culture and tokens of rank  will go a long way in creating an image of a more friendly  police force. Such a change of image, and especially from the  negative perceptions that exist in many parts of the South  African community, is necessary to ensure that the police force  plays its rightful role in the new South Africa." The rift  between the police and the community which it serves has thus  far disadvantaged the effectiveness of the force. "As a matter  of urgency, politicians will have to educate communities to  accept the new police force as their own and show appreciation  for the work they do under difficult circumstances."    Education Problem -- the second editorial in the 30 May  BEELD  notes that: "That South Africa is saddled with an enormous  education problem in the black community is old news. This  burning problem has been the center of discussion for over a  decade. Apparently the will to tackle it effectively thus far  has been lacking." As there has been no joint effort from the  government, the parent community, teacher and youth  organizations, discipline has deteriorated so much that in many  parts of the country a constructive learning athmosphere no  longer exists. Recently children of a certain school held  teachers hostage in their classrooms, allegedly after racist  remarks had been made by a white teacher. "If this is true,  departmental action should be taken against her," "but such  undisciplined action by school children should not be condoned.  It is about time that authorities took a firm stand."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Salman Mahmood] </F>   [Text] Narowal -- PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz]  chief Nawaz Sharif Saturday called upon the United States to  mind its own nuclear programme before asking Pakistan to allow  an inspection of its facilities.    Addressing the District Bar here, Nawaz suspected the claims  of US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott that his visit  to Pakistan was a complete success. "If they want to peep in  our nuclear programme, they should first mind their own nuclear  programme," he said.    He said US officials had also met him "but I told them that  we want friendly relations only and would not beg for aid".    Pointing out that India was far ahead of Pakistan in the  production of conventional weapons, he said the country's  nuclear programme was the only deterrence to India.    Rejecting the capping of the country's nuclear programme in  exchange of F-16 aircraft, he feared that the F-16s would be of  little use once the nuclear programme was capped.    He also warned that the inspection of the nuclear facilities  was tantamount to accepting restrictions at every stage of  development of the programme.    Condemning the rollback of the Motorway project, he asked  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto not to cancel the programme only  because it was started during his government. He said  [Uzbekistan] President Islam Karimov had also expressed his  concern over the cancellation of the project and said he would  not be keen to expand ties if Benazir was not interested in  boosting mutual relations.</p>

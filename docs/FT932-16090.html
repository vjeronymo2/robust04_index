			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: EBS earnings rise to FFr1.28bn ERIDANIA Beghin-Say, the Paris-based sugar, agro-industrial and branded foods company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi-Montedison group, raised net profits by 70 per cent to FFr1.28bn (Dollars 232m) last year from FFr754m in 1991. The improvement stems from recent acquisitions and more favourable markets, notably on the oil seeds side. Group sales rose by 22 per cent to FFr49.7bn, while net operating profits were up 35 per cent to FFr3.62bn. The dividend remains unchanged at FFr30 for each share or investment certificate. EBS warned that the 1992 figures were not directly comparable with those for 1991 owing to the effect of the merger with Eridania, Ferruzzi-Montedison's Italian sugar operation, acquisitions and changes in accounting practices. The 1992 figures represent the first results produced after Ferruzzi's complex restructuring of its French and Italian sugar and foods interests last year. As a result, Eridania, which held 60 per cent of Beghin-Say's capital, conferred its Italian sugar business and a 30 per cent stake in a starch group co-owned with the French company to Beghin-Say, creating the bigger EBS. In spite of last year's rise, Beghin-Say's profits have only recovered to the levels of 1990, when net earnings amounted to FFr1.08bn. The subsequent fall stemmed from lower exceptional items and rising debts from acquisitions, including Lesieur and Ducros.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Land Securities' shares fall 2% Shares in Land Securities fell 2 per cent yesterday to 606p as the UK's largest property company said that it was increasing development activity and warned of lower profits as a result. The company plans to spend up to Pounds 350m over the next two to three years, the first boost to its development programme since the late 1980s. Land Securities does not capitalise interest on developments, so profits will be reduced by higher interest charges until the new buildings are occupied. In the six months to September 30, Land Securities made an unchanged pre-tax profit of Pounds 118.9m. After stripping out property trading profits, the figure increased by Pounds 2.9m. Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, said that interest charges arising on development would make it difficult to match this result in the second half. He added that demand for business space was still patchy with no general increase in rental levels, although modern office buildings in good central London locations were already achieving higher rents, as were prime retail buildings. The interim dividend is increased by 3.8 per cent to 6.85p. Analysts said this was disappointing, set against growth prospects available elsewhere in the sector, even allowing that Land Securities did not cut its dividend during the downturn. Acquisitions in the period amounted to Pounds 75m, mainly in the retail and industrial sectors. Mr Hunt said that scope for further acquisitions was now limited. Land Securities' development programme includes the construction or refurbishment of 600,000 sq ft of offices in central London, of which 45 per cent has been pre-let to tenants. The company is also proceeding with the 600,000 sq ft White Rose Shopping Centre outside Leeds, which is being jointly developed with Evans of Leeds and Yorkshire Water. The project will cost about Pounds 100m and three quarters of the rental income from the finished scheme will accrue to the company. Net rental income for the half-year increased from Pounds 192m to Pounds 198.5m. Adjusted earnings per share advanced from 16.64p to 16.81p.</p>

Yesterday, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN-3-80], headed by Jose  Angel Talavera better known as El Chacal, decided to stop  surrendering its weapons. El Chacal's decision was his response  to the government minister's announcement that the government  has limitations to granting the economic benefits the rebel  leader is demanding. El Chacal is asking for 3 manzanas of land  for each man who surrenders his weapons. The government,  however, is offering a small piece of land where a house can be  built. At present, El Chacal's forces consist of 250 men who  have weapons ranging from AK rifles to surface-to-air missiles.  Following the announcement on the suspension of the disbandment  of El Chacal's forces, the government began a series of actions  to maintain talks with the FN-3-80.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as dollar holds, bonds improve Wall Street US stocks posted solid gains yesterday as stability returned to the currency markets and a firmer trend took hold in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.21 ahead at 3,928.27, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.29 better at 472.52. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped 0.07 to 474.84, but the Nasdaq composite climbed 4.67 to 790.12. Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 306m shares changing hands. Advancing issues led declines, 1,194 to 862. Stocks advanced steadily from the opening bell, after the market shook off a scare the previous afternoon when the dollar fell sharply against the yen. With the US currency recovering somewhat in the foreign exchange markets, equity investors were able to put aside the disconcerting trade friction between the US and Japan and concentrate on some strong, though unsurprising, data on the economy. The Federal Reserve said that January industrial production had risen 0.5 per cent, against a revised 0.9 per cent gain in December. The reading, which was favourable in spite of weather-related setbacks, suggested that the economy would grow at a better-than-expected 3 to 4 per cent rate in the first quarter, according to James Capel Economics. The US Treasury market, meanwhile, held steady as traders awaited further developments on relations between Washington and Tokyo, and the release of housing and consumer price data later in the week. Afternoon remarks by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, suggested no change in the US position on access to Japanese markets. With calmness prevailing, many blue-chip stocks showed moderate gains, and a few of them spurted ahead. Caterpillar was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 107 3/8 , 3M added Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 108 3/8 , Goodyear put on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 1/2 and McDonald's Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/4 . The long-running Paramount takeover saga appeared to have reached its conclusion, with the company announcing that more than 50.1 per cent of its shares had been tendered to Viacom. The company's victory brought a further Dollars 1 7/8 decline in the value of its B stock, which was trading at Dollars 28. QVC's share price climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 . Paramount was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 76 1/8 . Blockbuster, which has agreed to merge with Viacom as part of the latter's Paramount strategy, was unchanged at Dollars 24 7/8 , while BellSouth, an ally of QVC, gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 . In the forest products sector, Boise Cascade jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 27 1/8 after announcing plans to reorganise its Canadian operations. Rockefeller Center Properties appeared on the most active list for the second day running. The stock shed a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 5 7/8 , after a Dollars 1 3/8 plunge the previous session, on reports that the owner of the Manhattan landmark was having difficulty making interest payments. Canada Stock prices closed broadly mixed in moderate trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index rose 19.24 points, or 0.44 per cent, to close at 4,414.44. Volume was 76.139m shares, up from 64.847m shares on Monday, and trading value rose to CDollars 933.8m from CDollars 930.3m.</p>

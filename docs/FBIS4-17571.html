			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Lekant report in the "Counterattack" column: "Petr </F> Filippov Is Awaiting Resignation"]    [Text] Petr Filippov, former chairman of the Supreme  Soviet's Privatization Subcommittee, is to face an official  investigation initiated by presidential administration chief  Sergey Filatov. Administration officials reported that Mr.  Filippov is likely soon to resign from the post of chief of the  presidential administration's Information Support Directorate.    As SEGODNYA has learned, the reason for the inquiry was the  analytical materials worked out under Filippov's supervision,  containing recommendations for reorganizing large agricultural  enterprises and supporting collective peasant farms. The  authors of the memorandum propose the voluntary breakup into  smaller units and sale of the land and property of corporatized  kolkhozes at internal auctions, and using them to create small  -- approximately 30 people -- peasant farms.    The preparation of corresponding normative documents took  two  and a half months and was of a planned character. The authors  thought that if a decision about a presidential edict or  government decree was adopted on this subject, they could be  released this fall. As is apparent from the content of these  documents, they are of a purely recommendatory character and  could be addressed only to two persons: presidential  administration chief Sergey Filatov and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. The latter, however, deemed it necessary to  transfer them to Agriculture Minister Khlystun, who in his turn  forwarded them to Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Duma's agrarian  faction. From that point on the documents finally lost their  confidential character, were duplicated and circulated to "all  rural councils."    The agriculture generals assessed the recommendatory service  memoranda as guidance for action. According to some Directorate  officers, they demanded explanations from the president and the  prime minister, and from Sergey Filatov, an official  investigation and punishment of the guilty.    The outcome of the battle between the agrarian lobby and  Petr  Filippov arouses practically no doubt in Staraya Ploshchad.</p>

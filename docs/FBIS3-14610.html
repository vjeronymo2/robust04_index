He said one proposal being considered is a plan to  inspect ships once they have docked at al-'Aqabah, instead of  the current procedure of stopping and searching them before they  reach the Port of al-'Aqabah.    The U.S. State Department's Michael McCurry said the United  States is examining proposals that are supposed to respond to  the Jordanian Government's concerns.</p>

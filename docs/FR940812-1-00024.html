			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in this proceeding, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 59 FR 37566 (July 22, 1994) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''), the Commission determined that, to expedite the provision of broadband PCS in rural areas, which have historically suffered from delayed introduction of new services and fewer choices in service providers, rural telephone companies should be permitted to obtain PCS licenses by partitioning certain geographic areas from the licensed PCS service area (MTA or BTA). These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in either of two ways: (1) they may form bidding consortia to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among themselves, or (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation. We required that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and that each area include that portion of the rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS license area. In addition, where a rural telephone company acquires a partitioned license from another PCS licensee, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to rural telephone company's wireline service area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para;148&hyph;153. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Our rationale in allowing partitioning for rural telephone companies is that these companies are uniquely positioned to use their existing infrastructure to provide broadband PCS in rural areas. Many rural telephone companies argued that if they were required to bid on entire Basic Trading Area or Major Trading Area licenses to obtain licenses covering their wireline service areas, they would be effectively barred from entering the broadband PCS industry. They contend that under a partitioning plan, they would be able to serve areas in which they already provide service, while the remainder of the PCS service area could be served by other more efficient providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. We wish to consider whether a similar post-auction broadband PCS partitioning plan should be adopted for the benefit of businesses owned by minorities and/or women. We note that some parties commenting on petitions for reconsideration that we received in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 supported various forms of geographic partitioning. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Others, however, were opposed to partitioning. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The record has not been sufficiently developed on the issue of whether the public interest would be served by permitting businesses owned by minorities and/or women to hold partitioned licenses to enable the Commission to make a determination on this issue. We therefore seek further comment from interested parties. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Commenters should address the following issues: (1) whether allowing businesses owned by minorities and/or women to hold partitioned PCS licenses would serve the public interest; (2) if so, what parameters the Commission should provide for these entities to obtain partitioned licenses ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , through what mechanisms should partitioned licenses be granted and what, if any, limitations should apply); and (3) whether any such partitioning should be prohibited for a period of time after initial PCS licensing, and if so, for what period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of GTE Service Corp., Association of Independent Designated Entities, McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc. on Petitions for Reconsideration in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of MCI Telecommunications Corporation and comments of Nextel Communications, Inc. in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments submitted on this issue in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 will also be considered in this proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters should focus on the public interest impact that allowing such partitioning would likely have. We are particularly interested in hearing from interested parties whether such partitioning could be expected to give rise to benefits corresponding to those we expect to derive from rural telephone company partitioning. We also seek comment on whether the potential benefits that may be derived by partitioning in this context outweigh any practical or administrative difficulties that might arise, and whether more rapid and better service will be provided to any areas as a result of the partitioning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. We also wish to explore whether the Commission should restrict the transfer or assignment of partitioned licenses (held by rural telephone companies or by businesses owned by minorities and/or women) for some period of time. We therefore seek comment on this issue, and ask commenters to address how long any such transfer restriction period should last. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IFRA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals contained in this Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM). We request written public comment on the IRFA, which follows. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of Proposed Rule Making <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. &sect;601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1981). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Reason for Action: This FNPRM is issued to obtain comment regarding the certain aspects of the implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

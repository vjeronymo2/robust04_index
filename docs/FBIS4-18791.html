			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Preparing for a week of intense diplomatic  activity, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias yesterday  reiterated the government's defiant disregard for Wednesday's [6  April] "sad" decision by the European Commission to take Greece  to the European Court of Justice unless its sanctions on Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are lifted  within a week.    Mr. Papoulias spoke to reporters after briefing President  Konstandinos Karamanlis on the latest developments over the  Skopje issue, the likelihood of having to withstand the  threatened EU [European Union] legal action, and Monday's  planned talks of UN mediator Cyrus Vance in separate sessions  with Greek and Skopje officials.    "The government has no reason to worry about the  Commission's  flawed decision," Mr. Papoulias said, relegating the EU  ultimatum against Greece as "no different from other  unpraiseworthy initiatives like those which enhanced the  dissolution of Yugoslavia."    But he commended last week's shuttle diplomacy between  Athens  and Skopje by U.S. special envoy Matthew Nimetz, which the Greek  foreign minister described as "very useful." He did not rule  out Mr. Nimetz's resumption of his efforts next week, in  conjunction with a possible progress in Mr. Vance's mediation  talks in New York. [passage omitted]    Regarding the legal action against Greece by the EU,  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters: "The  procedure which the Commission seems to have chosen, is one  which has never been used before within the Community. The aim  of such proceedings would be to establish whether a member-state  is abusing its right to impose sanctions on a third country, for  reasons of national security, public safety or international  tension that endangers peace."    Mr. Venizelos stressed that, if the Commission finally  initiates these proceedings, it would take no less than a whole  year to reach a court ruling. Further, the spokesman emphasised  that such legal action would not be in the form of criminal  proceedings. "The EU Court only offers an opinion on a possible  violation of EU law, without further legal consequences. There  is no penalty, and, certainly, the levying of fines is no easy  matter either," Mr. Venizelos said.</p>

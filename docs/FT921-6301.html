			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Better nuclear safeguards THE MEASURES taken by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this week to strengthen safeguards against nuclear proliferation are only a modest step forward. The UN's nuclear watchdog needs far stronger powers if its inspectors are to stand a real chance of detecting a clandestine weapons programme like that of Iraq. The IAEA board of governors agreed that inspectors could make 'special inspections' of undeclared sites in countries that have comprehensive safeguards agreements with the agency. That is real progress. But countries with limited agreements to inspect specific reactors, such as Algeria, would not have to open other sites for inspection. A second measure will require countries to submit preliminary information about new nuclear facilities and modifications to existing plants, before construction starts. But again this will apply only to full IAEA members. A more ambitious proposal - to set up a central registry of production, exports and imports of nuclear materials and sensitive equipment - foundered on the objections of several industrialised countries. They argued that a reporting system sensitive enough to pick up suspicious shipments would impose an unacceptably heavy administrative burden on suppliers. Database proposal IAEA staff will refine the database proposal in the hope that the board will accept it at the next board meeting in June. The inspectors believe, rightly, that a comprehensive system for tracking nuclear materials and equipment would make it far easier to detect a country trying to conceal a weapons programme by buying similar materials in relatively small quantities from several suppliers in different countries, as Iraq did. In the long run, effective global safeguards can work only if countries still outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty, such as Israel, India and Pakistan, sign up. But it will take strong and sustained diplomatic pressure, particularly from the US, to make them see that the loss of sovereignty entailed in IAEA membership is a price worth paying to prevent nuclear proliferation among their actual or potential enemies. Meanwhile, the existing membership must accept an inspection system powerful enough to detect clandestine weapons development. Challenge inspections The 'special inspections' now proposed by the agency could develop into a system of 'challenge inspections' similar to those permitted under the US-Soviet arms control treaties. The IAEA must have the right to order inspections of suspect sites at short notice; and if there is any obstruction, this will have to be backed up by the UN Security Council through sanctions or, in the very last resort, military action. There could perhaps be a dual system under which a special inspection would be carried out either at the discretion of the agency or on the request of a given number of member states. But there is no point in mapping out substantial new powers for the IAEA unless it is given the resources to match. This year, the agency is having to cut back all its existing activities by 13 per cent, mainly because the loss of the Soviet Union's annual contribution of Dollars 20m has triggered a financial crisis. This is hitting not only the inspection programme but also the IAEA's work on nuclear safety, which is particularly important given the number of unsafe Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in eastern Europe. Industrialised countries will have to increase their IAEA contributions to help the agency out of its immediate crisis and then enable it to take on new responsibilities. But at the same time, developing countries must accept a change in the geographical balance of IAEA inspection work. Today, 60 per cent of the inspection programme is devoted to western Europe, Canada and Japan. In future, it should concentrate more on regions such as the Asia and the Middle East where the risk of proliferation is greater.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIALIZED SERIES TO BE ADDED TO SUMMERPOPS  </P> <P> What SummerPops audiences want, SummerPops audiences get.  </P> <P> In an attempt to target the particular musical tastes of its pops patrons, the  San Diego Symphony announced Monday that the 1990 SummerPops will be divided  into five series. Besides the main series of six weeks of standard pops  offerings, this summer's 12-week season (June 20 through Sept. 10) will have  four specialized series: great classical composers, Russian Romantics,  selections from Broadway musicals and a Big Band series.  </P> <P> According to executive director Wesley  </P> <P> Brustad -- who planned SummerPops '90, to be held at Hospitality Point on  Mission Bay -- the significant revisions were made in response to the varied  programming interests of last year's pops patrons, who answered an extensive  end-of-the-season questionnaire.  </P> <P> The 1990 season-opening concert, an all-Ravel program, will feature Canadian  conductor Boris Brott, who has led the local symphony in two guest stints over  the past year. Brott's program, June 20-23, will be the first week of generic  pops offerings, a series that will continue every other week through Sept. 2.  </P> <P> The other four series will share a split-week schedule in the intervening  weeks. Subscriptions will be offered in both six- and three-week packages.  Symphony officials noted that in recent years, shorter series have become  easier to market.  </P> <P> Though single-ticket prices were not announced, the range of subscription  prices starts at $20 for three Wednesday night gallery seats to $725 for six  weekend nights at a Champagne cabaret table. The subscription prices for Friday  and Saturday night pops series are slightly higher in every seating category  than those for Wednesday and Thursday nights.  </P> <P> Another innovation includes dancing, and a dance floor will be set up for  patrons at the Sunday evening Big Band performances.  </P> <P> Among the guest conductors this summer are Lalo Schifrin, popular composer and  music director of the Glendale Symphony; Norman Leyden, music director of the  Seattle Symphony Pops, and Kate Tamarkin, newly appointed associate conductor  of the Dallas Symphony. Harmonica virtuoso Larry Adler will be the featured  soloist July 18-21, although the season promises fewer guest soloists than  last.  </P> <P> If the symphony has its way, this will be its final year at the Mission Bay  outdoor site, which is plagued by airplane noise. Construction of a new outdoor  pops venue on San Diego Bay next to Seaport Village, called Embarcadero Marina  Park South, is still being negotiated with the San Diego Unified Port District.  Last week, the symphony received approval to proceed with actual plans for the  site, although the environmental impact report has yet to be made and filed.  </P> <P> The advantages of the San Diego Bay site include a minimum seating of 4,000,  contrasted with 3,200 at Hospitality Point (home to SummerPops since 1983), and  its proximity to the San Diego Convention Center and major downtown tourist  hotels.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 8 KYODO -- Japan told the United  States on Wednesday [8 Jun] it has decided to shelve plans to  authorize "reverse engineering" of computer software, a move  that effectively removed a thorny trade issue between the two  countries, Japanese officials said.    "We consider the matter as more or less settled," a Japanese  official said after a team of Japanese officials outlined  Japan's decision during two days of trade talks in Washington.    The talks, which focused on intellectual property rights  issues, were part of the so-called "framework" trade  negotiations the two countries reopened last week after a  three-month deadlock.    The U.S. lodged a formal complaint to Tokyo last year after  the Japanese Government launched a study on whether Japanese  software engineers should be allowed to tinker with rival  computer software technologies in the process of developing  their own. The Japanese Government effectively shelved the  "reverse engineering" initiative on May 30 when an advisory  panel to the Cultural Affairs Agency concluded that it is  premature for Japan to act without international consensus. U.S.  officials "raised no objections" when the Japanese team outlined  Tokyo's position on the reverse engineering issue, a Japanese  official said.    "Reverse engineering" has emerged a highly contentious trade  issue over patents and copyrights as computer software firms try  to ensure compatibility of their own products by "decompiling"  and looking into the language of commands written into a  software product. Japanese officials contend that the issue of  "reverse engineering" in computer software remains unresolved  even in the U.S. as lower courts have made conflicting rulings  on what is permissible under U.S. copyright law.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Paklin report specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: </F> "Bypassing Rivals. Indo-Russian Contracts To Total $100  Million"]    [Text] Delhi -- The shortfall in deliveries of spares from  Russia for weapons which India bought from the former Soviet  Union has become the talk of the country. This issue has been  raised literally at every level up to and including the  Russo-Indian summit. Our former government found itself  strangely unable to resolve an issue that was not so difficult.  But things have now gotten moving -- a package of long-awaited  contracts on shipments of spares has been signed in Delhi. It  is mainly a question of meeting the needs of the Indian Air  Force, not least its naval aviation.    "Yet another package of similar contracts will soon be  signed," Stanislav Filin, deputy general director of the  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, who headed the Russian  delegation at the first round of the Delhi talks, said. "These  will stipulate shipments of spares for the ground forces. The  total value of the contracts will be approximately $100 million.  The spares issue will thereby mainly be removed from the  agenda...."    But the main result of the Delhi talks, in S. Filin's  opinion, is that Russia and India have agreed on a program for  further cooperation in the military sphere that takes account of  the sides' long-term interests. There has been a great deal of  speculation in India about the modernization of our MiG-21  fighters. There are several hundred of these aircraft in  service with the Indian Air Force. Indian pilots rate their  performance highly. But over the past few years the MiG-21 has  become obsolete. Russia has stopped producing them. Hence the  problem with spares shipments. India came up with the idea of  not writing off these aircraft but modernizing them. A few  years ago the Indians appealed to us to draw up a modernization  program. The Mikoyan design bureau carried out the order.  Corresponding proposals were put to India. But Delhi's reply  was delayed. Exploiting this uncertainty, some former Warsaw  Pact states put their own proposals to India for the  modernization of the Russian fighters. Recently Israel has been  particularly importunate in offering its services. Israeli  delegations have descended on Delhi one after another. Their  arguments have boiled down to saying that many former Soviet  aircraft engineers have now emigrated to Israel to work, and  they will have no difficulty in modernizing the MiG-21.    But ultimately India preferred its traditional partner --  Russia. Any other decision would have looked strange: It was  Russia that gave birth to the large MiG family, and even the  collapse of the Soviet Union has not adversely affected their  production -- after all, the leading enterprises producing the  MiG's and components for them are located within the Russian  Federation.    The modernization of the MiG-21 will be substantially  advantageous for India -- its combat might will be increased at  least 2.5 times for a relatively small outlay. Winning this  major order will also be a "shot in the arm" for our aircraft  plants, which are going through hard times.    Accord was also reached at the Delhi talks on the  acquisition  by India of a new batch of modern MiG-29's. A figure of 30  aircraft is being mentioned. Justifying their purchase, the  Indian side is drawing attention to the increased combat might  of the Pakistani Air Force. India is particularly concerned  about the possibility of several dozen U.S. F-16 aircraft being  supplied to Pakistan, with which it has a strained relationship.    But not all of the package of proposals which the Russian  delegation brought to the Indian capital was agreed. India's  acquisition of certain types of Russian military hardware was  postponed. These include the unique "Tunguska" air defense  system. On the other hand, another avenue in Russo-Indian  cooperation is opening up -- the leasing of our weapons systems  to the Indian Army. We agreed that the Indian side could try  our weapons in its country before making its final choice.  Admittedly, India will have to pay for the pleasure of seeing  our latest weapons in action. Military specialists are  particularly interested in large-caliber Russian guns. The  Indian Army would like to take a three- to five-year lease on  some 152-mm self-propelled howitzers. They plan to use them as  the basis for manufacturing their own 155-mm artillery pieces  under Russian license in line with the standard used in the  Indian Army. The gun could be given a "self-propelled" capacity  by a mount developed on the basis of the T-72 M1 tank.    Our new helicopters will substantially strengthen India's  defense potential. They are designed for antitank warfare. We  will also be supplying air-defense systems to the Indian Navy.    It seems as though the hiatus in Russo-Indian military  cooperation has been overcome. But it should be remembered that  a fierce competitive battle is under way for the large Indian  arms market -- the Indian Army is the fourth largest in the  world. Britain is persistently offering India its military  helicopters. The British premier is acting as "fixer." France,  which has already supplied Mirages, is after more aircraft  orders. Italy and the United States have not lost hope of  selling their military aircraft equipment to India. Western  arms suppliers are offering the Indian Army tanks, artillery  systems, and other weapons, while offering the Navy their old  ships as well as new vessels. A winding-down of Russian  military shipments to India -- something which had begun to  occur -- would merely have played into our competitors' hands.  Issues like this are not resolved unilaterally. Russia cannot  afford to suffer economic, moral, and political damage for the  sake of abstract principles.</p>

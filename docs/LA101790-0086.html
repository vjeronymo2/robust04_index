			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKER MANAGEMENT, COACHES TRY TO PATCH THEIR DIFFERENCES  </P> <P> The Sockers' owner and president got together with the team's coaching staff  for three hours Tuesday evening and tried to mend a rift that developed over  how three remaining roster spots would be filled.  </P> <P> Apparently solved was a difference of opinion between Coach Ron Newman and  President Ron Cady over whether to sign free-agent midfielder Paul Dougherty.  </P> <P> Cady said decisions were made during the meeting as to whom will be offered  contracts for the final spots, but would not say whether Dougherty was among  them. He said details would be announced at a press conference today at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Cady and and owner Ron Fowler also took exception to a story that appeared in  Tuesday's San Diego Edition of The Times that quoted two team sources who  contended there has been a split between management and Newman for a couple  years. The sources also said that disagreements between Cady and Newman have  been so strong that Cady would like to get rid of Newman but can't because the  team keeps winning championships.  </P> <P> "Most of the stuff was as fallacious as I've ever seen," Fowler said. "I think  it's a case in which people who don't know everything that is going on put two  and two together and come up with seven. It's complete bull----. When other  people speculate on matters they know nothing of they come across as complete  Bozos and I think that's what happened."  </P> <P> Added Cady, "Why would we want to get rid of someone who has won eight  championships?"  </P> <P> Fowler said disagreements have cropped up between Cady and Newman, but that he  has never seen "a situation where two professionals don't at some point  differ."  </P> <P> Cady waffled as to whether he has had disagreements with Newman. At one point  Cady said he has had "normal" differences with Newman.  </P> <P> "I call them normal differences in managing a professional team," he said. "I  call them normal differences in running a business."  </P> <P> Those differences apparently reached a boil earlier this week and a meeting was  held Monday night to discus the matter.  </P> <P> "We had a meeting just to air some differences that we've been having over some  time here," Cady said. "It was just a little hiccup in Newman and my  relationship and I think we got it all aired out."  </P> <P> Later Cady said he has never disagreed on a personnel matter with Newman in the  three years he has been club president.  </P> <P> "For the three years we (Fowler and Cady) have been running the club," Cady  said, "Coach Newman and I have always agreed on every single roster member."  </P> <P> The Dougherty situation appears to be another personnel matter wherein Cady and  Newman have disagreed. On Monday Newman made it clear he wanted Dougherty for  the team but that the decision was not his.  </P> <P> When Fowler was asked about the Dougherty situation on Tuesday, the owner did  not deny that a rift existed between Newman and Cady, but said he casts the  deciding vote when such a difference occurs.  </P> <P> "The guy who writes the check gets to make the final decision," he said.  </P> <P> Cady also took exception to what he saw as an underlying tone of the quotes in  Tuesday's story which suggested that the Sockers have won three championships  under the Cady-Fowler regime in spite of the two.  </P> <P> "We have been involved with and have run the club the same way for three  years," Cady said. "And my relationship with Newman has been the same for three  years. If they're saying that the team has won in spite of the way we have  managed the club, I would have to disagree."  </P></p>

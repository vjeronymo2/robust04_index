			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues When Keller Group mentions grouting, it has nothing to do with bathroom tiles. The company is in the specialised business of ground engineering  - preparing sites for construction. Its kind of grouting involves solidifying soil by injecting cement or chemicals, using drills and high-pressure liquid jets, and projects outside the UK account for more than 80 per cent of sales. This high-technology group is being floated with a market valuation of Pounds 72.8m. A placing and intermediaries offer will raise Pounds 15.3m, to repay borrowings and fund further overseas expansion. Keller will become one of the first companies to use the foreign income dividend scheme, introduced to help companies with a structural surplus advance corporation tax problem. Under the scheme, companies can opt to pay a dividend out of foreign income which they must remit to the UK, so in effect avoiding paying advance corporation tax on the dividend. A former offshoot of GKN, Keller was bought by its management for Pounds 26m three years ago. Despite recession, Keller has increased operating profits steadily to Pounds 6.3m on sales of Pounds 148m. It has benefited from the German building boom, which accounted for 43 per cent of last year's sales. The issue has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities, sponsors and brokers to the issue. Applications for the intermediaries offer close on Wednesday, and dealings are expected to start on May 5. Given the group's large overseas exposure, Kleinwort could not price Keller's shares in line with the UK construction sector, where ratings assume a great deal of recovery. Instead, they are being offered on a prospective multiple of 13 times earnings, a discount to the market. The issue should attract solid support.</p>

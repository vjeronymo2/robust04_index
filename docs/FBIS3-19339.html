			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- Minimum prices for imports  of seven species of fish are to be extended by two months, the  French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries said Wednesday [16  March], one day after the European Union ruled out such a move.    In a statement, the ministry said the decision had been  taken  overnight after strong lobbying by France.    "The (EU) Commission in Brussels will this morning ratify  the  political accord reached overnight which will extend for two  months the arrangements put in place at France's request."    "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that  the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of  minimum import prices," the statement said, quoting Agriculture  and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech.    On Tuesday in Brussels, a spokesman for the European  Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the system would not be  extended as there were no data showing that the market is  destabilized at present by cheap fish imports.    The spokesman added however that if such data were  forthcoming, the commission "is prepared to re-establish the  minimum prices."    The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire  March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against  excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set  for fish last year as well, from February to December.    France asked the commission to extend the minimum prices  last  week. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes  violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU  countries that drive down prices of French fish.    The ministry added in its statement Wednesday that: "Our  firmness has paid off. The European Union now has two months to  take a serious look at the difficulties in the fishing sector."</p>

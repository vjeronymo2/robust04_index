			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (7): Asian neighbours display interest - The pace of trade and investment is increasing Even during the darkest days of the general slowdown in the Philippine economy in the mid-1980s, visitors to the country could not help noticing the brisk business at restaurants and shopping centres. Consumer spending had remained buoyant, although the official gross national product was contracting. Economists attribute this to the extensive 'underground economy' that had supported millions of Filipinos during times of adversity, and to the ever-rising remittances from overseas workers who had sought jobs in North America, the Middle East and other Asian countries for lack of opportunities at home. It has been these remittances that have consistently made up for the slow domestic economy over the past few years. In 1993, for instance, while GDP increased by only 1.7 per cent, a 27.5 per cent rise in the income from abroad pushed up the overall GNP expansion to 2.3 per cent. This was still evident from the economy's first-quarter record. While GDP rose by 3.8 per cent, income from abroad expanded by 44.7 per cent, which boosted the period's overall GNP growth to 4.8 per cent from the year before. The point of all this is that the Philippine economy can rely on an underlying strength that could see it through difficult times. The improving macroeconomic fundamentals, as such, can only mean that investors may expect big gains as the economic growth gathers momentum. With the 2.3 per cent GNP growth in 1993 came a 9.2 per cent increase in revenues and 22 per cent leap in profits of the country's 5,000 largest corporations. The declining trend in the overall cost of doing business (slower inflation, lower interest rates and stable exchange rate), therefore, should make the Philippines an attractive area for investment. In the first half of 1994, the number of business plans registered for incentives with the Board of Investments (BOI) reached 327 - an increase of 32 per cent over last year. These projects were estimated to require total costs of 239.5bn pesos (Dollars 9bn), higher by 449 per cent than last year, of which over 80.3bn pesos will be in the form of direct equity from the investors. In terms of actual foreign investments brought into the country, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central monetary authority, registered a total of Dollars 556mm in the first three months of 1994 - a giant leap over the Dollars 188m in the same period last year, mainly due to a Dollars 502m remittance made by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co for its newly acquired 40 per cent holdings in Petron, the country's leading oil company. This, along with the steady stream of foreign investment missions visiting the country, has led Mr Rizalino Navarro, the trade and industry secretary, to believe that the Philippines has now been 'promoted to the short-list of attractive investment sites' in Asia. More significant, according to Mr Herman Montenegro, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has been the big increase in the amounts reinvested by foreign companies already operating in the country. Behind this trend are government efforts towards the liberalisation and globalisation of the economy, he said. Implementation of the Foreign Investments Act (FIA) of 1991 allowed up to 100 per cent foreign ownership in any export enterprise and in a range of activities for the domestic market. A provision in the FIA, which limits foreign ownership in certain industries, is due to expire in October, which will further open up the economy to foreign capital. Among these areas are: life and non-life insurance, travel agencies, tourist lodging houses, and convention and conference organising. The only areas that will remain closed are those listed in the constitution and in specific laws. They include the media, services involving licensed professionals, small-scale mining, marine-resources utilisation (except in deep-sea fishing), retail trade, rice and corn production and trade, co-operatives, and private security agencies. While the increase in the amounts coming from Asian countries has set the pace for overall growth in foreign investments in recent years, the US and Japan remain the largest foreign investor groups in the Philippines. Investments from Japan are expected to grow significantly, given that it remains the Philippines' largest source of official development assistance. For this year, for instance, of the Dollars 2.8bn pledged by the country's traditional aid donors, Japan accounted for Dollars 1.5bn. The department of trade and industry has noted the change in Japanese investors' perceptions of the Philippine investment climate. During the Japanese investment flows into Asia in the 1980s, the Philippines was at the bottom of the list, owing to political uncertainties in the country at the time. In recent months, big Japanese groups have signified their intention to move into the Philippines. Among the companies that have proposed major investments are Hitachi, which is planning to put up a Dollars 300m disk-drive plant, and Matsushita, which is putting in an additional 550m pesos into its appliance manufacturing operation in the Philippines. Investors from the US have also started to change their view of the Philippines since the cooling of relations following the 1992 departure of American military forces. In the first six months of this year, US investments registered with the BOI amounted to 2.77bn pesos, the second-largest after 7.58bn pesos by Hong Kong investors, and a sharp increase from 463m pesos in the same period last year. Mr John Negroponte, US ambassador to Manila, has noted that US companies have been staying away from the Philippines owing to 'outdated perceptions' about the political and economic climate in the country. 'There have been a lot of opportunities developed (in the Philippines) for American businesses in recent years,' Mr Negroponte said. Foremost among these opportunities, he added, were in infrastructure, including energy, telecommunications, roads, ports and airports. One US company that had recently chosen the Philippines as the site for new investment is Quaker Oats, with a 150m pesos manufacturing project. The decision to locate in the Philippines was reached after a survey of available facilities and incentives in the region. Mr Phil Marineau, Quaker Oats president, said during a visit in July that the Philippines had been considered as 'one of (the company's) lead investment areas in Asia' and that 'further investments in the Philippines can be expected in the near future.' If the country continues to gain the confidence of investors in this manner, it may catch up with the rapid-growth economies of Asia sooner than expected.</p>

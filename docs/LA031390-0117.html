			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOWERS, HAIL AND SNOW FALL ON COUNTY  </P> <P> Scattered rain, hail and snow peppered a wide area of the Southland on Monday  afternoon as a slow-moving storm system moved through the region.  </P> <P> The showers were steady and relatively light in Orange County, although several  Irvine residents reported that hail pelted the city for about 30 minutes at  about 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Malinee Churanakoses, 16, said she was hit by hail as she left a friend's house  on Lindstrom Street. "It was thundering down rocks," said Churanakoses, who  moved to Irvine with her parents four years ago. "It was very surprising. I  thought I was back in Seattle."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the county, snow dusted the Santiago and Modjeska peaks in the  Santa Ana Mountains. And a water spout -- which occurs when a tornado-like  column of air passes over water -- was reported near Dana Point just before  5:30 p.m. and dissipated about 10 minutes later, the National Weather Service  said.  </P> <P> Parts of the San Bernardino Mountains recorded up to 10 inches of snow in a  matter of hours, authorities said.  </P> <P> Light snow also fell in the Grapevine area on Interstate 5 and on California 14  in the Antelope Valley and a dusting could be seen on the San Gabriel Mountains  from the Civic Center.  </P> <P> In addition to snow, the system dumped short-lived rain and hail showers over  the Southern California foothills and valleys. Rain also was reported in  downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Ana.  </P> <P> While the length and severity of the rainfall varied, forecasters predicted as  much as half an inch of rain in the heavier showers, along with the possibility  of hail and gusty winds to 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The weather created serious traffic problems in some areas. The Simi Valley  Freeway was closed for more than three hours after a tractor trailer carrying  tile overturned on wet pavement about 2:45 p.m. One person was injured.  </P> <P> "Traffic is just screwed up all over on every one of our freeways," said  California Highway Patrol spokesman Jim Wills. "The accident rate is higher  than normal."  </P> <P> Agriculture officials canceled Monday night's malathion spraying over 47 square  miles of the San Fernando Valley because of the rain.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials in Orange County expressed delight about the rainfall.  Orange County Agriculture Commissioner James D. Harnett welcomed the showers,  saying that the county's farmers "need every drop of rain they can get."  </P> <P> "The rain may make it a nuisance for people who are harvesting their crops now  but by and large the benefits of rain overshadow the negative points," Harnett  said. "There is no substitute for good rain. It does things that imported water  cannot do."  </P> <P> Meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., however, said the showers  would not significantly affect the prolonged drought being experienced in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Staff writer Davan Maharaj contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Observer: Seal of approval Michael Green's arrival on the Reuters' board is an important step in the City's rehabilitation of a whiz-kid who had been almost written off two years ago. Unlike some of the shooting stars of the bull market in the late 1980s the 44-year-old chairman of Carlton Communications has shown real staying power. Two years ago Carlton's shares collapsed after the market latched on to a cautious trading statement, but Green, an old friend of Gerald Ratner and Charles Saatchi, persevered and won the London weekday ITV franchise from Thames. His standing in the City should rise further now that Reuters' chairman Sir Christopher Hogg has given his stamp of approval.</p>

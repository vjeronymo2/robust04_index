Also present were members  of the Syrian delegation and top officials of the German  Economics Ministry, as well as the Syrian and German ambassadors  in Bonn and Damascus.    They looked into ways to deepen and expand cooperation and  friendship between Syria and Germany in various fields in the  best interests of the two countries. The German minister called  relations between Syria and Germany old and historic. Al-shar's  visit to Germany, he added, should help strengthen these ties.  He emphasized that Syria plays a significant role in the Middle  East. The German minister said his country was willing to help  Syria's economic development by upgrading bilateral cooperation.    For his part, al-Shar' reviewed Middle East political  developments. He pointed to the role Syria is playing under  President al-Asad in efforts to promote a just and comprehensive  peace predicated on UN resolutions and international legitimacy  so as to bring about security and stability -- the basic  requirements for economic and social development in Syria and  the region.    This morning, al-Shar' received Mr. (Hans Sherkin), head of  the foreign relations commitee at the German parliament.  Al-Shar's delegation was also present as were the Syrian and  German ambassadors in Bonn and Damascus. They reviewed Middle  East developments and bilateral ties.    Also this morning, al-Shar' held a news conference to mark  his official visit to Germany at which he took questions from  foreign, German, and Arab correspondents about his talks in  Germany.    Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel last night hosted a  dinner for al-Shar' and his delegation, also attended by German  officials and top bureaucrats of the German Foreign Ministry, as  well as the Syrian and German abmassadors in Bonn and Damascus.    Kinkel welcomed al-Shar' and told him he appreciated his  taking up the invitation to visit Bonn during these critical  circumstances in the Middle East. His speech noted the notable  developments in relations between Syria and Germany. Kinkel  stressed the need to hold further consultations and meetings to  compare notes on issues of shared interest. He reitrated  Syria's primary role in the region. The German minister called  for the peace process to be restarted, given the difficult  circmstances and impediments it is facing. The interests of  Syria and Germany, he said, stand to gain from a successful  peace process, since Middle Eastern and European peace,  security, and stability are interdependent. Kinkel stressed  that Germany and the European Union are determined to contribute  to the establishment of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace  in the Middle East. He concluded his speech by saying that  Syria is an important player in the Middle East. We want to be  a dependable partner for Syria in Europe and the world, he added.    For his part, al-Shar' thanked Minister Kinkel for the  hospitality and the opportunity he has been given to see German  officials. Syria, al-Shar' added, is keen to deepen friendship  and cooperatioan with Germany in all areas. He emphasized that  his talks in Germany were good, constructive, and frank, and  showed the two countries have deep-rooted ties of friendship and  cooperation. Al-Shar' said Syria appreciated Germany's keenness  to bring peace to the Middle East. He emphasized that a united  Germany is bound to make an effective contribution to a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Al-Shar' said Syria is  serious and sincere in pursuing the peace process in line with  UN resolutions, the Madrid formula, and the land-for-peace  principle. He stressed that an Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories is a must for the achievement of peace.</p>

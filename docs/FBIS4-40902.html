			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA/ITAR-TASS column: "Altay </F> Introduces Own Privatization"]    [Text] The kray legislative assembly session yesterday  adopted the "Law on the Privatization of State Enterprises in  Altay Kray."    It envisages the sale of privatized property solely for  money, since vouchers are now past their validity date.  Privatization methods have been widened to include methods not  contained in the corresponding Russian law. They are contracts,  transfer of packages of enterprise shares to private control,  step-by-step privatization of loss-making and low-profit  enterprises, and privatization involving the process of dividing  up debts and property. The adoption of this kind of law at  regional level is unprecedented in Russia.</p>

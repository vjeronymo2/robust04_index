			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  war-thirsty elements on June 9 staged a massive combined  air-ground-sea war exercise against the North in the southern  area of East Coast by mobilizing destroyers, Naval planes and  Airforce planes of the puppet Army, according to a radio report  from Seoul.    The drill for "increasing the capacity of combined  operations" shows that the puppets are running [words  indistinct] the train of war against the North, taking issue  with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North.</p>

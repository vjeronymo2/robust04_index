			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TWO WOMEN SENTENCED FOR TRYING TO HIRE HIT MAN  </P> <P> The mother and aunt of two suspects in a drug case have been sentenced to 37  months in federal prison for trying to hire a hit man to kill two witnesses in  the case.  </P> <P> Martha Walters, 42, and her sister, Carmen Elenes-Fonseca, 41, of San Diego  pleaded guilty to using interstate telephone lines in a plot to kill two  prosecution witnesses.  </P> <P> Walters, whose sons -- fugitive Vincent Walters, 23, and Martin Walters, 22 --  are suspects in the drug case, was also fined $8,000 by U.S. District Judge  Earl B. Gilliam.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Ferraro said Tuesday that the women paid $5,000 to a  man who was actually a police informant to kill two witnesses in the case.  </P> <P> No murder attempt was made, as authorities had secretly videotaped the  transaction. The sisters were arrested Dec. 26.  </P> <P> Vincent Walters' whereabouts remain unknown. He and his brother have been  charged, along with 90 other people, with drug offenses stemming from a sting  conducted in 1988 and 1989 by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in  which drug dealers were videotaped buying equipment at a DEA-operated store.  </P> <P> Martin Walters also faces sentencing Nov. 15 for first-degree murder in the  September, 1988, death of Kristine Reyes, 21.  </P></p>

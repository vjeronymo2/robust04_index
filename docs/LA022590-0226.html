			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL-SCREEN CINEMA  </P> <P> "The Fourth Protocol" (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m. and again on Saturday at 8 p.m.)  is a misfired 1987 spy thriller, laying waste to Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan,  Joanna Cassidy and others.  </P> <P> "The Last Dragon" (KTLA, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a ludicrous but entertaining  1985 martial arts movie starring Taimak as a black Bruce Lee.  </P> <P> "Hot Dog: The Movie" (KTLA, Thursday a 8 p.m.) offers a great young cast and  dazzling Squaw Valley locales, but the 1984 film about a world skiing  competition is spoiled by calculated raunchy sex scenes and a noticeable racist  tone.

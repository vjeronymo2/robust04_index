			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Plant of the week Elaeagnus Gilt Edge This fine variety of Elaeagnus ebbingii makes a large evergreen bush with glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green, broadly edged with yellow. They have small, silvery, fragrant flowers in autumn, but it is as a hardy ornamental shrub that it is chiefly valued. It is easy to grow in all fertile soils and is stocked by most garden centres in containers so that it can be planted at any time of the year. It will thrive in sun or light shade, but the best leaf colour is produced when the light is good. If it grows too large, stems can be shortened or removed, preferably in May but certainly by August. It can also be used as a hedge or screen, clipped during the same period. AH</p>

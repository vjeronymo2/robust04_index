			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEW HEAD OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES HIRED IN SUPERVISORS' SPLIT VOTE  </P> <P> By a split 3-2 vote in closed session, Los Angeles County supervisors decided  Tuesday to hire the No. 2 man at Florida's statewide health services agency to  take over the troubled Department of Children's Services.  </P> <P> The vote to hire Gerald Peter Digre as the department's director followed a  public hearing that included dramatic, surprise testimony from the grandmother  of a 2-year-old boy whose death generated widespread criticism of Florida's  Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.  </P> <P> After the testimony, Supervisor Ed Edelman -- who has been extremely vocal in  his opposition to Digre -- told his colleagues he had learned new information  about Digre that he wanted to share during a closed session. The vote followed.  </P> <P> Edelman dissented, as did Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who said he was persuaded by  Edelman that Digre's demanding management style would not work well in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> After the vote, Edelman called a news conference to express "strong  displeasure" -- not only at the appointment of Digre, but also at the way he  was hired. The supervisor complained that the executive search firm that  selected Digre as a finalist failed to disclose any negative information about  him. Edelman also voiced displeasure that his colleagues did not make an effort  to find a candidate on whom they could all agree.  </P> <P> "My concerns were sort of brushed aside," Edelman said.  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana said Digre was "the best candidate we interviewed."  Supervisor Mike Antonovich praised his "excellent credentials."  </P> <P> Digre, 46, is currently the No. 2 man at the Florida Department of Health and  Rehabilitative Services, a sprawling state agency that is responsible for a  variety of health services, including those to abused and neglected children.  The agency has been harshly criticized in recent years, and Edelman cited this  criticism -- as well as complaints from those who worked for Digre -- in  opposing the nomination.  </P> <P> Since its director resigned in July, the Department of Children's Services has  been undergoing a massive state-ordered reorganization. Investigators found,  among other problems, that social workers routinely failed to visit the  children they supervise and that county officials permitted children to remain  in foster homes where they had been abused. The department serves 55,000 abused  and neglected children.  </P> <P> Digre, who said he will assume the $115,000-a-year post Jan. 2, was expected to  be confirmed publicly at Tuesday's board meeting. The vote was delayed after  the testimony of Mary Rae Coe, a Long Beach woman who is the grandmother of  Bradley McGee, perhaps Florida's most well-known victim of child abuse.  </P> <P> Coe held back tears as she told the board of how she called a Florida child  abuse hot line five times to report that Bradley was being abused by his  parents.  </P> <P> "Nothing was done," she said bitterly. "Now he's dead."  </P> <P> The child was sent back from a foster home to his mother and stepfather, who  killed the boy in July, 1989, by repeatedly dunking his head in a toilet and  beating him with a wet pillow. The case led to the conviction of a social  worker on charges of neglect and caused changes in Florida law, adding $13  million annually in child welfare funds.  </P> <P> Coe contacted Edelman after reading newspaper stories about Digre's possible  selection for the county job. The supervisor asked her to attend Tuesday's  meeting.  </P> <P> Her voice quavering, Coe complained to the supervisors that Digre had stated  publicly that her grandson's death was "a question of probability" and that an  agency as large as his would inevitably make "errors of judgment."  </P></p>

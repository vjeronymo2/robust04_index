			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Nostalgia for communist comfort: Passionate divisions behind Sunday's Hungarian election For the outside world, it is clear enough what Hungary's election is about. It will either reverse or, more probably, confirm the pattern of former communists returning to power through the ballot-box, which now affects almost all of central and eastern Europe. The reason for this swing of the pendulum is no secret. While the scope of reforms varies, the collapse of the communist system has brought social and economic dislocation, unemployment, widening income differentials and, at least initially, steeply falling output. Even in a country like Poland, where gross domestic product began to grow again last year, unemployment continued to rise. Everywhere (except Russia) the former communists have changed their name. All claim to be converted to the virtues of the free market, with a large private sector, as well as multi-party democracy. But everywhere they have benefited from public disillusionment with the first fruits of capitalism, and have encouraged people to think that, with them in charge, the transition can be managed more gently, with better protection for those who stand to lose. Yet when it comes to specific policies, their room for manoeuvre is small. In Poland the ex-communists, now in government, find themselves struggling to hold down wages and contain public expenditure, against the populist demands of the Solidarity trade union. And in Hungary, while their attacks on the conservative government's economic record and their claims that the country is on the verge of economic disintegration have contributed to their commanding lead in opinion polls, the Socialists (formerly communists) do not offer any sharp change of policy. In fact, economic policy as such has been almost absent from the Hungarian election campaign. Every party agrees that income tax rates need to be brought down, but none has staked out a position as the party of tax cuts. All the main parties proclaim their belief in privatisation, and in economic integration with western Europe. Even where there are differences, they tend to be within political blocs rather than between them. The fiercest criticisms of the government's privatisation policy have come from the right wing of the ruling party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), and from its Christian Democrat coalition partners. And the government presents its economic achievements, such as more than Dollars 7bn in foreign investment, as fruits of gradualism rather than 'shock therapy'. The opposition Free Democrats - generally seen as to the left of the MDF, and now as potential coalition partners of the Socialists - are, in fact, to the right on economic policy issues: 'revolutionaries posing as yuppies', in the bon mot of one of their founders, they favour more economic freedom, less state control or intervention. Their fellow-liberals in the Federation of Young Democrats ('Fidesz') are regarded as further to the right - 'yuppies posing as revolutionaries'  - because they are more firmly hostile to the Socialists. Yet one of the Fidesz leaders, Jozsef Szajer, told the FT recently that 'free market rhetoric wouldn't work in Hungary: no one here believes in a simple, idealistic structure of any kind'. He went on to argue for a consensual economic policy based on agreement between government, unions and employers. The Socialist party itself has the high priest of fiscal restraint in the shape of Laszlo Bekesi, a former and perhaps future finance minister, alongside a trade union wing that promises higher social spending and government action to save troubled industries. (The party leader, Gyula Horn, has good reformist credentials as the foreign minister who tore down the barbed wire between Hungary and Austria in 1989, but also a more dubious past as a militiaman in the grim period after the 1956 revolution.) In short, economic policy is not what divides the parties. Voters' feelings about the economy may be the decisive factor in the election, but the political class reserves its passion for 'the national question'. This is, in essence, a question about what makes a Hungarian: ethnicity or citizenship? The late Jozsef Antall, founder of the MDF and prime minister until his death last December, once said he considered himself the prime minister in spirit of 15m Hungarians. Hungary has only 10m inhabitants, but Antall's concept of the nation included Hungarian-speakers in neighbouring countries. Left-wingers, both liberal and socialist, regard such talk as dangerous, potentially even for the Hungarian minorities themselves, since it tends to increase suspicion of them among their fellow-citizens. Intellectuals maintain that there is a deep and unbridgeable divide in Hungarian society between liberals and conservatives. Socialists, even after half a century of communist rule, are regarded as a sub-category within the liberal camp. Perhaps it is not surprising that this should be the view of a rightwing intellectual like Istvan Csurka, the nationalist playwright who split from the MDF two years ago to form his own splinter group, the Hungarian Truth and Life Party. What is surprising is that many liberals see politics in rather similar terms. This is particularly true of the Free Democrats, despite their origins in the anti-communist opposition of the 1980s. Many of their original leaders were the offspring of committed communists, and many had begun their careers as Marxist dissidents before graduating to liberalism. Many, including perhaps half the top leadership of the party, are also Jewish. The readiness of right-wing nationalist leaders like Csurka to resort to anti-semitism is thus not entirely surprising; and the Free Democrats made a sort of concession to it when they picked Gabor Kuncze, a previously little known provincial politician, as their candidate for prime minister. Election posters featuring their previous leader, Ivan Peto, who comes from a Jewish and communist family, are frequently spray-painted with the star of David. Kuncze is a Christian, whose mustachioed features give him an 'authentic Hungarian' look (to borrow Csurka's terminology). Csurka has happily been marginalised. But many liberals argue that the mainstream MDF retains the instincts of a Catholic, authoritarian, nationalist party. Even Gaspar Miklos Tamas, a Free Democrat MP who once described himself as a 'central European Tory', now grudgingly admits that he would regard a Socialist victory as a lesser evil than a continuation of the present government. 'One may have doubts about the genuineness of the Socialists' conversion to democracy,' he says, 'but these people (the MDF) positively hate it.' As proof of this somewhat extreme proposition he cites the sacking or forced retirement of 129 journalists from the state-owned radio last February, which prompted large demonstrations both for and against. Feelings run equally high on the other side. An adviser to the present prime minister, Peter Boross, accuses the Free Democrats of advising western countries to withhold credits from the present government, and makes a seemingly far-fetched link between such 'unpatriotic' behaviour and the shortlived bolshevik dictatorship of Bela Kun, which followed Hungary's defeat in the first world war. Only the Young Democrats have tried to rise above this apparently anachronistic kulturkampf, but it is far from clear they have succeeded. A year ago they were riding high in opinion polls and tipped by some as leaders of the next government. But their efforts to reassure provincial conservative voters by calling themselves 'national liberals' - stressing their concern for Hungarian minorities abroad, repudiating any anti-clerical tendencies and hinting that they would prefer a coalition with the MDF to one with the Socialists - provoked a split in the party and hostile press comment. Today, Fidesz leaders claim their first preference would still be a liberal government, formed by themselves and the Free Democrats. But no one seriously expects an election result that would make this possible. Hungarians are being asked to choose between left and right, not in the sense of socialism versus capitalism, but in the much older sense of 'cosmopolitan' free-thinkers versus Christian nationalists. In 1990 an anti-communist backlash brought victory to the right. This time, nostalgia for the relative comfort of 'goulash communism' seems likely to favour the left.</p>

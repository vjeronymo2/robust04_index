			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Non-life side gives boost to Hibernian Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance group, saw pre-tax profits leap 89 per cent over the 12 months to December 31. Directors attributed the rise - from IPounds 8.25 to IPounds 15.6m (Pounds 16.1m) - to improved non-life underwriting results both in Ireland and the UK and 'exceptionally higher' investment income in Ireland. The life side showed new annual premiums ahead 47 per cent to IPounds 7.3m, but single premium sales dipped 28 per cent, to IPounds 15.6m. Shareholders' funds at the year-end were marginally up at IPounds 72.4m (IPounds 72.2m). The proposed final dividend is 4.1p, bringing the total for the year to 6.2p (5.7p), covered 3.2 times by earnings of 19.9p (10.2p) per share.</p>

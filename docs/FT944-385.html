			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mexico - 1994 is not 1982 For experienced observers of Mexico, the story looks depressingly familiar. Just as they did 12 years earlier, Mexican officials last week stood before angry lenders at a meeting at the New York Federal Reserve to explain a financial crisis. This week, like their predecessors in 1982, officials are locked in long negotiating sessions in Washington in a bid to put together an emergency financing package. Every day seems to bring new horrors to the jittery financial markets: a sinking peso, big losses in the stock market, worries about the health of the banking system and questions about the ability of the government and private sector to service their dollar-denominated debts. Resolving these problems will be painful. Some companies and banks may even fail. Nevertheless, this is not a repetition of 1982. The financial markets' understandable concern must not be permitted to overshadow the manifest and manifold improvements in the economy since then. Mexico's non-oil exports were rising even before the devaluation, a sign that the economy is increasingly competitive. The burden the state imposed on private enterprise has been much reduced. The government's debt burden, albeit troubling in the short term, is much less than 12 years ago. A significant devaluation, coming on top of these many changes for the better, provides an opportunity to achieve the rapid growth that has been so elusive. It was, it should be recalled, precisely such a move to a flexible, more competitive exchange rate, after the financial crisis of the early 1980s, which gave Chile its last necessary push towards international competitiveness. Although the new administration of President Ernesto Zedillo has suffered a defeat, it has also been granted an opportunity. It has shown itself less than deft in handling the immediate crisis. But what matters now is the future. Its first priority is to bolster financial market confidence. No resolution will be forthcoming so long as capital continues to flee the country. This will require unity within the administration. Given the low level of Mexican reserves, it will also require the help of international agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund. The US can play an invaluable role in bolstering confidence. As it made clear on Tuesday, a collapsing peso is no more in Washington's interests than Mexico City's. Next, the package of measures that the government is set to announce by next Monday at the latest must be comprehensive and clear. The aim must be to demonstrate a continued commitment to reform, combined with willingness to take the tough measures needed to exploit the devaluation. One element must be an explanation of how the government proposes to keep its budget balanced, given the extra costs caused by devaluation. Another must be a commitment to policies aimed at halting an inflationary spiral. Yet another must be a firm timetable for extensive privatisation, along with proposals for faster deregulation and reform of the social security system. Finally, it must indicate how it plans to stabilise the financial system. A financial crisis is the last thing Mr Zedillo wanted, or needed, as he tries to grapple with Mexico's many political and social problems. But properly handled, this devaluation could mark the beginning of Mexico's export-led growth miracle. Mr Zedillo has the time - six full years. He also has the chance. The success or failure of Mexico's struggle for modernisation hangs on his making the right decisions over the next few weeks.</p>

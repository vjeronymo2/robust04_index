			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing optimistic over new talks on rejoining Gatt - Guy de Jonquieres and Tony Walker on doubts whether China can be re-admitted in time to help found the WTO Negotiators from China and members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meet in Geneva today for what promises to mark the start of a critical stage in the seven-year-old talks on Beijing's application to rejoin the organisation. The four-day meeting is the first since US President Bill Clinton ended uncertainty about China's position in the world trade system this month by renewing Most Favoured Nation treatment of its exports to the US and 'de-linking' trade and human rights. Mr Clinton's decision has lifted a cloud over the Geneva talks. Mr Long Yongtu, China's Gatt negotiator, who has visited Washington and Brussels in advance of this week's meeting, said he was satisfied with his meetings in both places. He said contacts with US negotiators were 'the most positive and fruitful' for two years - an assessment shared by US officials. They applauded China for its recent commitment to preparing itself for membership of Gatt, from which it withdrew in 1950. The hope now is that the way has been cleared for faster progress in resolving outstanding issues. 'There is movement and a will on all sides to press ahead with serious work,' said one official in Geneva. But though all the main Gatt countries say they want to admit China, some question whether it will be possible this year, in time to meet Beijing's goal of becoming a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed Gatt. That would require broad agreement by late autumn on formal accession terms. However, officials closely involved in the talks stress that formidable obstacles have still to be overcome. 'I think it is going to be very difficult for the Chinese to make it in time,' said a European official. There are also differences between Washington and Brussels over how far Gatt should go to accommodate China's difficulties in meeting its rules immediately. The US wants Beijing to accept all Gatt obligations on entry, and to eliminate in particular about 400 specified non-tariff barriers. The European Union is taking a more flexible line, though it has reserved the right to impose selective safeguards on certain imports until China is fully integrated into the Gatt system. Mr Long said his government was seeking a 'package deal' in the negotiations and indicated it would press for transitional arrangements which would allow it to conform with Gatt rules over time. He acknowledged that a gap remained on the transition issue. 'This is something we have to work on,' he said. 'Without agreement on transitional arrangements China may not get into Gatt for 5-10 years, and we assume this is not the wish of the US. 'The bulk of American and European demands are in line with China's economic reforms. There is no basic disagreement on China becoming a full-fledged market economy. The question is how quickly China should do it. 'China's economic reforms were a gradual process, and we can't for the sake of getting into Gatt disrupt that gradual process. I don't think this would be in the interests of western countries,' he said. Mr Long called 'ridiculous' US arguments that if China were granted a transition period, it would have no incentive to assume its obligations after it entered Gatt. 'China is not adopting its reforms simply for the sake of joining Gatt,' he said. In an effort to clarify the outstanding issues, Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss economy minister who is chairing the Geneva meeting, has circulated a 'non-paper' which aims to bring together the views of all the main participants, including the US, the EU and Japan. In a covering letter, Mr Girard says the document - which is not intended as a draft protocol for China's eventual accession - is not prescriptive, but should be regarded as the basis for discussion. However, some officials close to the talks described Mr Girard's approach as 'maximalist' and said it appeared to set tougher conditions for China's accession than some Gatt members considered appropriate. As well as the removal of non-tariff barriers, negotiators in Geneva say the most obstinate questions still to be resolved are: Lack of transparency in China's trade regulations and 'hidden' quotas on various categories of imports. Dismantling of China's tariffs, for which a timetable must be negotiated and set out alongside the planned accession protocol. The uniform application of Gatt obligations, in a country where regulations and the speed of liberalisation vary widely between regions. Extension of national treatment to foreign companies and, in particular, access to China's market for foreign providers of services such as banking and insurance. Intellectual property rights, an issue on which China has been criticised because of widespread piracy of western entertainment software. A safeguards clause against sudden surges of Chinese exports, especially textiles. Negotiators in Geneva were cautious yesterday about the prospects for breakthroughs on these issues this week, while Chinese officials have acknowledged that there will have to be tough bargaining against a tight timetable. Beijing is preparing for another session in late July and will send a large team back to Geneva to negotiate through September, if necessary. 'As long as the participants have the political will, we can finish the negotiations in time,' said Mr Long.</p>

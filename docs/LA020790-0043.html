			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH, STORM-DRIVEN WAVES MAY BATTER THE SHORELINE  </P> <P> High waves propelled by a storm in the Gulf of Alaska and high tides are  expected to pound San Diego beaches today and Thursday, and may cause flooding  in low-lying areas.  </P> <P> Light rains are also expected today but will dissipate by Thursday morning,  leaving San Diegans with a nice, dry weekend, said Wilbur Shigehara, a  forecaster for the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> Waves rising as high as 10 feet today and Thursday will make swimming and  surfing dangerous, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "Only the foolhardy would want to attempt" going into the water, he said.  People fishing or watching waves from buildings near the ocean should be alert  for unusually large waves which can suddenly sweep across dry areas, Shigehara  said.  </P> <P> The combination of high waves driven by the storm and tides increasing through  Saturday could also cause flooding in low lying coastal areas such as the  boardwalk in Mission Beach, he said.  </P> <P> High tide is at 7:19 a.m. today and 8:01 a.m. Thursday.  </P></p>

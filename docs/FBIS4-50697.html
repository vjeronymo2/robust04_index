			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antoine So] </F>   [Text] China's foreign investment development is seeing a  new trend, with inner regions reporting a higher rate of  increase in new foreign investment than the coastal areas, a  visiting Chinese official says.    Speaking at a press conference yesterday for the coming  four-day Hong Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference to  be held in the territory next week, Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) deputy director-general Ma  Xiuhong said the administration had seen rapid growth in foreign  investments in inner regions since late 1992.    "As China's open door policy continues and foreign  investments increase to a certain level along the coastal areas,  inner regions have become the targets recently for most foreign  investment," Ms Ma said. In addition, they (the inner regions)  are also improving their own investment environment, which also  contributes to the rapid growth," she said.    Ms Ma said the amount of foreign funds flowing into the  inner  regions last year exceeded that of the coastal areas by 5 to 10  percent.    Earlier this year, China vowed to continue its foreign  investment policy and extended it to the inner regions. "In  fact, the trend had already begun in late 1992. But it was more  obvious last year."    She said that in its bid to re-enter the General Agreement  on  Tariffs and Trade, China was "actively" refining its trade laws  to conform to international standards. "We are determined to  tailor a more secure and better protected environment for  foreign investments in terms of adjusting our laws."    The country had stepped up work on trade regulations this  year. "In the process of reform, the refinement of legislation  is necessary and will be to the interest of foreign investments."    Moftec, under the Foreign Investment Administration, is to  jointly host the Hong Kong' 94 China Trade and Investment  Conference with the territory's Trade Development Council at the  Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The conference  begins on Monday and will continue until 26 May. Seminars on  China's latest foreign investment policies will be held during  the conference, to brief interested investors.    Meanwhile, China's April industrial production figures  showed  a year-on-year increase of 17.9 per cent, according to the State  Statistics Bureau.</p>

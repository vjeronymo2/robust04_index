In his words, the Defense Ministry refers to the fact that  civil departments abroad have never supervised such kind of  military activity. Shapovalenko pointed out that the Defense  Minister should issue a decree to bring into force a provision  on the State committee on atomic supervision in the ministry's  structure because "it is difficult to establish a single state  system of supervision over radioactive security on Russia's  territory without this."    Shapovalenko declared that last December a working group of  the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry prepared a report  for the government to solve the problem with liquid radioactive  wastes. In particular, it proposes to forward membrane devices  to re-process nuclear wastes, which have been designed by the  association Radon, to the Pacific Fleet for test exploitation.    In addition, he said, "we have accepted Japan's proposal  which will hand over a dual-bottom tanker to Russia to store  10,000 tons of liquid radioactive wastes. However, the  government must consider the issue on the construction of  facilities to re-process liquid radioactive wastes on the  Northern and Pacific Fleets and several regional burial places  in order to entirely resolve this problem."    A feasibility study for a burial place on the territory of  the former nuclear test range on Novaya Zemlya has been already  prepared and subjected to state ecological expertise. "The same  burial place should be created in the Far East, but if we start  construction this year it will be concluded not earlier than  1997," said Shapovalenko.    He reported that a facility capable of re-processing 8,000  cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes annually will be  assembled on the Kola peninsula on the basis of the water  purification station of the Murmansk sea steamship line.  Shapovalenko said that the Murmansk steamship line is ready to  accept wastes from military crafts assigned to the Northern  Fleet on a commercial basis.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Body Shop Body Shop seems to find selling soap a lot easier than selling shares. Yesterday's interim results showed turnover continuing to grow, but the long-term fall in return on capital is worrying. The City is uncertain about the full extent of the company's problems, but the difficulties of a go-go retailer overreaching itself are all too familiar. Saturation has been reached in the UK earlier than expected and Body Shop faces copy-cat competition from Boots and others, putting its premium pricing under threat. True, there were some special factors behind the 42 per cent fall in UK profits, but confusion about the company's response to the decline is unsettling. As with many companies which have grown rapidly, issues such as working capital and stock control have had low priority. While profits are growing exponentially, that may be excused; once growth slows firm financial controls become central to success. Were Body Shop to acquire a strong finance director, many fears might be allayed. That said, the company has a brand name with genuine international appeal and a proven ability to make money overseas. Its franchising system also avoids many of the pitfalls which have befallen other retailers abroad. In a sector struggling to make progress the potential for international growth is seductive. After recent falls the shares now stand at a mere 10 per cent rating premium to the sector. The brave may see a buying opportunity; the wary may recall Next and Ratners.</p>

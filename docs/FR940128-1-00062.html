			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If decomposition is found in less than 2.5 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lot, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute to,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the formation of histamine in the fish, Appendix B, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.a.2.iii. provides that the decomposed fish should be removed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the procedure outlined in Appendix B, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.a.2.i., but that it is not necessary to subject the lot to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine examination. The agency has tentatively concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition below 2.5 percent is not significant in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the acceptability of the entire lot. Under the best conditions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is possible that some fish in a large lot will experience some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal decomposition. Under these circumstances, so long as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish with decomposition are culled from the lot, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason to suspect that the lot has been subject to unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that could cause histamine or scombrotoxin to form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is aware that the canned tuna industry uses the 2.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent value to determine whether special handling of a lot is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted (Ref. 119). The canned tuna industry has concluded,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just as FDA tentatively concludes, that levels above 2.5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent likely exposure of the fish in a lot to conditions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are out of the ordinary and potentially dangerous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, if the processor finds decomposition in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, those fish must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the lot, and a histamine examination needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed on a representative sample of the remaining fish in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that lot (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.iv.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to recognize that where the time/temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records are inadequate for all the fish on a vessel, or show poor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for all the fish from a vessel, histamine analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be performed on representative samples from each lot on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vessel. Although an appropriate number of fish for sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could possibly be provided from a single lot, the results would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be representative of the vessel as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B, section 3.a.3. describes how fish should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed of depending on the results of a histamine examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with current policy, the agency expects that any fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is found to have histamine above a defect action level or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other regulatory level or limit for histamine established by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be used for food. Moreover, the agency expects, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in Appendix B, section 3.a.3.i., that a finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine over such level or limit in any fish in a lot from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel will result in the destruction of that entire lot,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the percentage of decomposition that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptically detected or the conditions on the vessel as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated by the time/temperature records. Such a histamine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding strongly indicates that neither the records from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel nor the decomposition test (if the results were below 2.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent) are reliable. Histamine may be present in the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of organoleptically detectable decomposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the agency expects, as reflected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B, section 3.a.3.ii., that a finding of histamine below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the action level, but higher than is normally found in fresh fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Refs. 120 and 121), in any fish in a lot will result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate cooking of all the fish in the lot to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin will not form over the shelf life of the fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooking stops the histamine forming process once it has started.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without this cooking, any elevated temperatures later in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution system or in the home can result in a rapid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elevation of histamine levels to hazardous levels (Ref. 117, p.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 341).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B, section 3.b. addresses raw materials controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can be exercised by subsequent processors, i.e., those other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the first processor to take possession of scombroid toxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forming fish and fish products from a harvester. Assuming that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first processor has met its responsibilities with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw materials as explained above, and has not caused a problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through improper handling during processing, subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors should determine whether decomposition occurred during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer from the previous processor. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guideline provides, at Appendix B, section 3.b.1., that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent processors that do processing other than simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storing, should subject a representative sample of fish or fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products from each lot to an organoleptic examination. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding of decomposition in that sample should lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptic examination of the entire lot. If decomposition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in more than 2.5 percent of the fish in the lot, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor should perform a histamine examination on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative sample of fish from the lot. These gradations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the expectations reflected in the guidelines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has tentatively concluded these measures need not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken by those who only store fish and fishery products. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature abuse can occur during storage, and thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombroid toxin forming species must be &blank;held &blank;at &blank;appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;temperatures (40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below), the hazard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin in the finished product can be controlled by those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who own the product or manipulate it during processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> EQUIPMENT FAILURE CAUSES POWER OUTAGE  </P> <P> An underground equipment failure Friday at La Habra Fashion Square caused 1,200  customers -- including a local hospital -- to lose electrical power for almost  two hours, police said.  </P> <P> The blackout at 9:15 a.m. created headaches for residents, banks, stores and  restaurants in the half-square-mile area bounded by Beach Boulevard on the  west, Lambert Road on the north, Idaho Street on the east and Imperial Highway  on the south, according to La Habra police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp.  </P> <P> At the Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center on Lambert Road, emergency  generators were automatically activated when the hospital lost power. No  patients were in danger, and no patient transfers to other hospitals were  contemplated, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> "We had no problems," said Sandy Alderman, assistant director of nursing at  Friendly Hills Medical Center. "We were able to handle everything."  </P> <P> Some hospital employees, however, reported myriad minor inconveniences brought  on by the outage. For instance, an automatic glass door to the hospital lobby  was stuck halfway-closed, making it difficult for people to enter until  employees cranked the door open.  </P> <P> And hospital administrators posted warnings for people not to use the  elevators, which were running on emergency power. Electricity was restored to  the hospital at 9:50 a.m., Alderman said.  </P></p>

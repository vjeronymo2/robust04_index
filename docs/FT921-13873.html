			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Books: Identity crises of two Resistance lovers - Anthony Curtis on the life and literature of Elsa and Aragon THE LIVES OF ELSA TRIOLET by Lachlan Mackinnon Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 216 page IN THE middle of the Second World War there appeared in Occupied France a slim volume, Le Creve Coeur, containing a collection of poems by Louis Aragon, a one-time surrealist who had joined the French Communist Party. The poems had been written on active service, and several reflected the mood of the phoney war in France. A companion volume was called Les Yeux d'Elsa; in his dedication the poet greeted the Elsa of the title as 'chaque battement de mon coeur'. Aragon fought in the first war as well as the second, in which he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his command of a medical unit in 1940. The two books were published over here in 1944 under an imprint called La France Libre. In an England starved of contemporary French writing, they enjoyed rapid currency and for the remainder of the war Aragon became a cult-figure among the literati. Aragon was also a prolific novelist, author of a fiction-cycle Le Monde reel. As a prominent member of the PCF he had visited Russia before the war, and edited the party's evening newspaper Ce Soir. After the Fall of France Aragon became active in the Resistance under a number of code-names, working especially on the literary front, while continuing to write and publish. Aragon's part in the bloody purges of those who had collaborated with the Nazis, which occurred immediately after the Liberation, remains a matter of controversy. Jean Cocteau said he owed his life to Aragon and Eluard during that horrendous time. In spite of the passion inspired by his love for Elsa, expressed in limpid lyric poetry that reads well even today, Aragon had a 'homoerotic' side to him that has emerged in recent studies. He seems in his surrealist days to have loved Andre Breton and later Drieu La Rochelle, the collaborator and writer-editor who committed suicide after the war. Despite a rather messy private life, Aragon always remained devoted to Elsa, whom he married in 1939 after her divorce from her first husband. Aragon continued to write poetry celebrating her long after the war was over, even after her death in 1970. Le Fou d'Elsa appeared in 1963 and Il ne m'est Paris que d'Elsa in 1975. But who was Elsa? And who for that matter was Louis Aragon? These questions are fascinating but, as Lachlan Mackinnon's The Lives of Elsa Triolet interestingly demonstrates, they are not at all easy to answer. It is not merely that Elsa and Aragon assumed false names and identities for the purpose of wartime undercover activity. It is much deeper than that. The process of self-realisation in the 1920s and 1930s was one of deepening political engagement as the betrayal of appeasement became plain to them. Writing articles and fiction was combined with frequent sexual adventures on both sides. They made some violent shifts of gear and fundamental refashionings of their personalities. Mackinnon tracks these two ferocious leopards to their lairs and from time to time catches them changing their spots. Both suffered identity crises in their youth. As a child Aragon had been brought up by three older so-called sisters. He was told one day that the oldest was in fact his unmarried mother and that his godfather and tutor was his father. Elsa was born Ella Alexandrovitch Kagan in 1896 in Moscow, the younger of two daughters of a Lithuanian-born Jewish lawyer and his musical wife. The story of this assimilated progressive Russian Jewish family's life up to the First World War, with its two beautiful nubile daughters attracting the attentions of a group of futurist artists and poets, including Mayakovsky, is a crowded and happy one. After their father's death the Kagan clan scattered. Ella's first marriage to Triolet, a well-to-do French dandy and Lothario, took her briefly to Tahiti to live. It was after she returned from there that Gorky, who had read some letters she had written about the island, told her she should become a writer. At that moment Ella Kagan disappears and Elsa Triolet was born, living among Dadaists and Surrealists in a Left Bank hotel in Paris. In her subsequent relations with Aragon, already established in literature, her literary ambitions were at first entirely subordinate to his. She made jewellery to earn some money and wrote a novel Colliers which was only published after her death. Like Beckett she decided to write from now on in French and produced a self-revelatory novel Fraises-des-Bois (Wild Strawberry was her nickname as a girl). In 1930 she accompanied Aragon to the Writers' Congress in Kharkov. He was welcomed in the Soviet Union as a celebrity and signed a document repudiating Surrealism and his former colleagues - this was his most shameful moment - while Elsa became thereafter a fellow traveller in more senses than one. Then her transformation began - first as a wartime icon in his verse, a metaphor of separation; then as a novelist herself who in 1945 was awarded the Prix Goncourt for Le Cheval Blanc. Little of her work has appeared in English. Mackinnon finds it, at its autobiographical best, most deserving of our attention. He compares the wartime and post-war fortunes of Elsa and Aragon with those of Sartre and De Beauvoir. Why did the younger couple achieve such wide international fame while Aragon and Elsa dwindled outside France into obscurity? He has no simple answer but points out that the more famous pair of writers remained in Paris during the Occupation and to an extent difficult now to determine played along with the regime. Aragon and Elsa were living mainly in the south in Nice and Lyon, doing dangerous work, and they had no ready-made Existentialism to market after the war. They were also, it must be said, less gifted. This provocative comparison is one of many such to emerge from a stimulating, sparely written biography of a woman whose extraordinary life may be seen to summarise much contemporary history.</p>

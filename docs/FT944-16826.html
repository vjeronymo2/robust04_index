			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Russians bemused by 'Black Tuesday': Either by accident or design, the government appears to have lost control of the rouble Russia is not the first country to experience the humiliating effects of a currency market in full flight - although few devaluations can compare with the rouble's fall, in speed and scale. Like many before them, Russian ministers and central bankers yesterday were like puppets tossed around by the savage forces of a panicking market. The Russian media were quick to pronounce 'Black Tuesday' following the 'catastrophic fall' in the rouble. The reaction of ordinary Russians was one of stunned incomprehension. No one in the streets knew what it would mean for the everyday economy. 'Collapse? Hyper-inflation? We simply do not know,' said one confused Russian. Currency exchanges shut their doors for 'technical reasons' as anxious crowds milled around outside. Mr Yuri Zarubin, who works at a computer company which sells software priced off the dollar was fearful of the effects, thinking his company's sales would be badly hit. His wife, Olga, said: 'All the prices will go up again and I do not know how we will buy the most basic things.' What cannot be measured is the psychological damage the rouble's fall will inflict. The value of the currency has great symbolic significance in Russia. A television advertisement for one Russian finance company envisages the day in 1999 when the dollar will have collapsed to a few kopeks against the mighty resurgent rouble. Such advertisements tap into a deep vein of Russian pride. Throughout the summer the central bank appeared to have done a good job in husbanding the rouble. Indeed, in real terms it had appreciated against the dollar, encouraging people to hold roubles to the benefit of the Russian government bond market. Russia's reformist ministers spoke with pride about how they were winning the confidence of the people. Their economic stabilisation policies were having a visible effect. Russia was beginning to become a 'normal' country once again. How severely the government's economic programme will be jeopardised by the rouble's fall is - as yet - impossible to tell. The devaluation will undoubtedly bring relief to some parts of the economy - at least temporarily. The energy sector, in particular, which sells oil and gas abroad for hard currency, will make useful currency gains although they will also have to pay more for imported equipment. The devaluation may also help domestic manufacturers compete more effectively against imports. The Russian government has been seeking to protect domestic industry by raising import duties. The rouble's fall will have a similar effect. The relative price of imported goods will shoot up making life difficult for the western consumer goods manufacturers active in the Russian market. In comparison with most countries, however, imports still represent a relatively small proportion of all traded goods - especially outside the big cities. Some economists argue that it is far from certain that the rush into the dollar will fuel inflation. The critical test will be the effect the devaluation will have on the prices of domestic goods. Some devaluations have proved beneficial in retrospect and there is a certainly a benign interpretation that can be placed on the rouble's fall. One western economist in Moscow says: 'There are two ways of viewing it. The negative one is simply that the government has lost the trust of the people. The other is that the government is letting the rouble slide to help exchange rate stabilisation in 1995. On this view, the rouble's fall is a policy pursued by the government not imposed by the market.' At the government's budget meeting held at Sochi at the weekend, it is believed ministers discussed an extremely tight budget for 1995 with the aim of reducing the monthly inflation rate to 1 per cent. Credit emissions would be strictly controlled and a real attempt would be made to produce a stabilisation package for 1995. But some ministers argued that trying to stabilise with the rouble at too high a level would inflict further unacceptable pain on Russian industry. 'At this new rate all opposition within the government to trying to fix an exchange rate next year has been eliminated. Previously there was a view that the stabilisation policy was too tough for Russian industry,' says one source familiar with the discussions. The government believes that perhaps as much as Dollars 10bn of western money would be needed to stabilise the exchange rate, but it fears that the IMF will not move quickly enough to support a new level. The IMF will face an agonising decision about the extent of its support following the rouble's latest collapse. The danger for the government is that its plans, if such they are, might yet be defeated by the manner of their implementation. The problem perhaps is not so much the level at which the rouble now trades but the speed with which it has fallen. There is not much the central bank can do to stabilise the situation if the rouble continues to run out of control. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the bank, promised to raise interest rates today to help defend the currency, but that will further damage Russian industry. 'The trouble is the government's credibility has been obliterated. It will now be that much harder to try to stabilise the currency next time round,' one western banker said.</p>

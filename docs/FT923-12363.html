			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: IBM shares slide in heavy trading SHARES in International Business Machines fell by 5.2 per cent yesterday and helped drag down the broader US stock market as the world's largest computer manufacturer reported unexciting second-quarter results and gave a downbeat view of second-half trading prospects. IBM, which is in the throes of a shake-up designed to make the company more entrepreneurial and less bureaucratic, reported net earnings of Dollars 714m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, against earnings of Dollars 126m, or 22 cents a share, in the same period of last year, when the US was deep in recession. Its revenues rose almost 10 per cent, from Dollars 14.8bn to Dollars 16.2bn. The results were towards the low end of analysts' expectations, which ranged from Dollars 1.20 a share to Dollars 1.40 and the shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at Dollars 95, down Dollars 5 1/4 after heavy trading of 5.3m shares. The company told an analysts' meeting it continued to expect year-on-year revenue growth in 1992 in the 'mid-single digit range.' However,it added that second quarter revenues in the US rose 9.4 per cent from a year ago and 'the tone of business in the US is continuing to improve.' The company's strongest revenue grown was in two areas it is anxious to expand - software, which was up 12.3 per cent to Dollars 2.68bn, and services, which rose 45 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn - but its key computer hardware sales rose by just 4.6 per cent to Dollars 8.64bn. The company said mainframe computers and other top of the range systems had been strong, but that was offset by weakness in the personal computer market. The PC field has seen severe price cutting by IBM's competitors and IBM hinted yesterday it would be taking more aggressive action in the third quarter. The company's gross profit was Dollars 7.9bn, against Dollars 7.6bn a year earlier, while the company's selling, general and business expenses dropped 11 per cent. However, excluding some one-time items in 1991, expenses dropped by around 5 per cent. Mr Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'operating expense reductions were very impressive, but they have intense gross margin pressure.' He estimated the margin on hardware at only 46.9 per cent. An IBM spokesman said the group expected to exceed the upper end of its plan to cut the workforce by 15,000 to 20,000 in 1992, although a suggestion that it could reach 40,000 to 60,000 was ' off-base.' For the six months, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.31bn, or Dollars 2.29 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.58bn, or Dollars 2.77 a share, in 1991 when it took a Dollars 3.96 a share one-time charge for an accounting change.</p>

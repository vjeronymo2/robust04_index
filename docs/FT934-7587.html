			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Mines sell-off bill may come within weeks - British Coal THE GOVERNMENT is expected to publish a bill to privatise British Coal within weeks as ministers press ahead with controversial plans to sell off the industry by early 1995. The legislation to enact what Lord Parkinson, former energy secretary, described as the ultimate privatisation, comes as British Coal presses ahead with a programme of closures expected to shut more than half of its remaining 30 pits. The legislation, which could come as early as next week, will attempt to resolve the contentious issues of pensions and concessionary coal for employees. The Labour party and pit unions are likely to concentrate on both subjects in their campaign to keep British Coal in the public sector. Potential buyers will have to wait some months, possibly until the middle of next year, before the government decides which pits are for sale and at what price. Ministers have already announced that British Coal is to be split into five parts for privatisation. The composition of the areas, to be grouped around Scotland, north-east England, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Wales has yet to be determined. There is uncertainty about which pits will be closed before privatisation. British Coal has indicated to unions a cut in the number of deep-mine pits to 23, but a further reduction to at most 15 is likely before privatisation. The long-term market is unlikely to sustain more than 12 deep mines. Last year British Coal sold 65m tonnes of coal to the England and Wales generators, but by the late 1990s the total annual market for power station coal is likely to fall to about 30m tonnes. The privatisation should also pave the way for privatisation of British Coal subsidiaries including Coal Products, which sells smokeless fuels, British Fuels, the retail distribution arm, Compower, the computer services company, and the Coal Research Establishment. Unions are opposed in principle to privatisation, but the Union of Democratic Mineworkers is part of a consortium which is considering bids and British Association of Colliery Management is looking at the possibility of management buy-outs. The government is offering financial help for employee teams interested in buying pits. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'History will charge this government with the murder of the British coal mining industry. Now, in the ultimate insult, they are seeking to sell off the dismembered body.'</p>

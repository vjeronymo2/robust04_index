			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sabena joins with Delta to market route DELTA Air Lines, said yesterday it had signed a code-sharing agreement with Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, to market jointly a daily round-trip flight between Atlanta and Brussels. Delta, based in Atlanta, became a leading transatlantic operator when it acquired former Pan Am route authorities. The new flight will begin operating on June 1, using Delta Boeing 767 aircraft. There will be a combined Delta and Sabena flight crew, and Sabena will reserve a block of seats, using its own flight designation, in the three service classes. The airlines will also share terminal facilities in Atlanta and Brussels. United Airlines - which, like Delta, is one of the 'big three' US carriers - said yesterday that it was considering cutting or rescheduling deliveries of Airbus A-320 jets. The company's president, Mr Jack Pope, told Dow Jones that there had been no talks with Airbus to date, but that reductions in Airbus deliveries might have to be considered because of the weak domestic market. United has 50 A-320s on firm order and a further 50 on option. On Wednesday, United revealed that its negotiations over reduced deliveries of Boeing aircraft had been completed, but declined to reveal the revised agreement until discussions with engine manufacturers had also ended.</p>

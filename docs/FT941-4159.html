			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Shut up' is not acceptable from a guardian of free speech Sir, With reference to your editorial 'Euro-babble' (March 3), I am disappointed that a newspaper of your standing should stoop to telling the European Union's culture and information commissioner to 'shut up'. Should a guardian of free speech tell anyone to shut up, much less Mr Pinheiro whose views - while different from your leader writer's - are respectable? It is ironic that the same leader accuses Mr Pinheiro of 'an objectionable attempt at censorship'. On encouraging European audiovisual 'entertainment', you criticise Mr Pinheiro's flawed proposals without suggesting alternatives. While free-trade principles are important, films are not merely entertainment, but also culture - and culture's value cannot be measured in purely economic terms. If you insist on viewing it as a commodity like toothpaste, what price do you assign to Shakespeare, national identity or freedom of expression? Philippe Legrain, 88 Lansdowne Road, London W11 2LS</p>

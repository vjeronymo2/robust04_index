			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HANOI, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The trial of former  Vietmamese energy minister Vu Ngoc Hai, implicated in one of the  biggest corruption scandals of recent years, has become  abnormally drawn out because of persistent arguments between  lawyers. Journalists report that the public hearing, now in its  fifth day, has significantly overrun the 72 hours originally  alotted for it because of lengthy debates between the  prosecution and Hai's lawyers. According to judicial sources, a  verdict is now not expected before Wednesday afternoon.  Observers claim such delays are rare in the Vietnamese legal  process.    The circumstances leading up to charges being brought  against  Hai after two years of investigation are particularly  complicated and politically sensitive. Prime minister Vo Van  Kiet even declared the affair a matter of priority. The trial,  which calls a former government official into question for the  first time since 1975, is considered a test of the goverment's  will to stamp out corruption which has worsened since Vietnam  moved to a market economy. The former energy minister is  accused of "abuse of power" in the delivery of 4,000 tonnes of  steel intended for the construction of the first 500 kilovolt  electric powerline from the north to the south of Vietnam.    He allegedly ordered the steel from a small intermediary  company run by one of his relatives instead of going through  Vinametal, the main state firm responsible for metal trading.  The prosecution alleged that by-passing the state company cost  Vinametal 3.1 billion dongs (about 300,000 US dollars).    Hai is appearing in court together with his former deputy  minister Le Liem and seven other co-accused who are directors of  other companies implicated in the scandal. The prosecution has  asked for a fixed three-year jail sentence for the former  minister and a two-year suspended sentence for his deputy. It  requested three to seven-year sentences for their associates.  The defence lawyers have called for outright acquittals for the  two main defendants because of the "complexity" of the case and  the "lack of precision" of the charges.    The case is highly sensitive since the prime minister, who  has vowed to make the fight against corruption one of the  priorities of his government in 1994, personally committed  himself to the construction of the 500 kilovolt powerline, which  should alleviate the energy shortage in the country's southern  provinces. The development project, which is one of the most  important in Vietnam, has been plagued by bribery and by theft  of materials since it began in 1992. It has been delayed and  its cost, originally estimated at 300 million US dollars by the  authorities, has almost doubled.    Three days before the start of the trial Kiet fired Hai from  his job as "prime minister's special supervisor for the 500  kilovolt powerline". He was sacked from the government last  year and was last month expelled from the Central Committee of  the Communist Party. However neither he nor his deputy has been  arrested.    Foreign journalists have been present at the trial and the  proceedings have been relayed to several dozen onlookers through  loudspeakers in the courtyard of the central law courts.</p>

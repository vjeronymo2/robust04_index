			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA CENTER FINE-TUNING BALANCED BUDGET, SEASON  </P> <P> Los Angeles Music Center Opera is projecting for 1989-90 its first balanced  budget, following three years of accumulating deficits. Company officials  announced details of the new season, featuring three new productions, at a  press conference Thursday, stressing solidarity behind current management and  the conviction that its years of deficits are over.  </P> <P> The major changes in the season are the elimination of "Orlando Furioso" (a new  production from San Francisco Opera) and the replacement of a new "Idomeneo" by  a borrowed "Le Nozze di Figaro." Additions are a double bill of the Oliver  Knussen/Maurice Sendak works, "Where the Wild Things Are" and "Higglety,  Pigglety, Pop!," and "Oklahoma!," ending the season in June.  </P> <P> Although expenses are slightly more and earned income less than predicted for  the current season, the deficit for this year will be substantially less,  thanks to an increase of $1.5 million in contributed income. The season deficit  is now listed at $807,959, creating a cumulative total of $3.1 million.  </P> <P> Addressing the deficit problem, board chairman Roy Ash insisted that these  first three seasons of productions should be considered start-up years, and  that the company now considers its initial investment to be complete. The next  step, he said, "starts by operating on balanced budgets from here on out."  </P> <P> Ash also said that the board has obtained commitments for individual gifts  totaling more than $6 million, earmarked for a much-deferred and still not  clearly formulated capital fund. The company projects applying $1.2 million  from this fund toward deficit reduction for 1989-90, bringing the accumulated  deficit under $2 million by June, 1990.  </P> <P> Publicity about the MCO deficits and widely bruited rumors about possible new  executive leadership when general director Peter Hemmings' contract expires  seemed to be behind the unusual presence all chief company officers. Ash and  board president Bernard Greenberg both stressed their support for Hemmings'  work, and Greenberg announced that they are discussing a new contract with  Hemmings. "We want to be able to assure ourselves that he will be here for the  next five years," Greenberg said.  </P> <P> Hemmings said that the company has no plans to appoint a music director, though  he also is projecting an increased season and presence for the company when the  completion of Disney Hall opens dates in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Changes  to the Pavilion and its operation that the company is considering or proposing  include the addition of standing room at the back of the orchestra seating  section.  </P> <P> Artistic personnel for the new season remains largely as previously announced.  The new "Tosca," which opens the season Sept. 6, will be staged by Elijah  Moshinsky, however, rather than Peter Hall. Hemmings described the production  as a vehicle for Maria Ewing, singing her first Tosca.  </P> <P> The newly unveiled portion of the season continues what Hemmings considers a  company tradition of ending with an operetta or musical, a spot occupied in  prior years by "Porgy and Bess," "The Mikado" and "Orpheus in the Underworld."  The Kussen/Sendak works also figure in the company's outreach plans.  </P> <P> A production of "Le Nozze di Figaro" from Chicago replaces "Idomeneo" as a  fiscal concession to deficit reduction. Hemmings pointed out that a borrowed  "Figaro" would be cheaper and expected to sell more tickets than the  home-produced, less popular "Idomeneo."  </P> <P> "Idomeneo," however, has only been deferred until the following year. Other  highlights of the 1990-91 season are new productions of "Fidelio," directed by  Gotz Friedrich; "Elektra," directed by Hall, and "Hansel and Gretel," designed  and staged by Sendak and Frank Corsaro.  </P> <P> Other works for 1990-91 are "Aida," with Leona Mitchell and Placido Domingo in  the production that opened the new opera house in Houston this season, and  "Nixon in China," getting its much anticipated West Coast premiere in  association with the 1990 Los Angeles Festival.  </P> <P> The MCO schedule:  </P> <P> "Tosca" by Giacomo Puccini.

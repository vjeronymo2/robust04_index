			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Two-part interview with RSS Head Rajendra Singh by Gopal </F> Sharma in Keshav Kunj on 19 Mar]    [22 Mar p 1]    [Text] Appointed recently the chief (sarsanghchalak)  of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Rajendra Singh spoke  to THE STATESMAN's Gopal Sharma at Keshav Kunj, the  RSS headquarters in New Delhi, on Saturday. Excerpts:    THE STATESMAN: Were you expecting to be nominated as  sarsanghchalak?    Rajendra Singh: The process of choosing a  successor to Balasaheb Deoras had started three years ago  because of his deterioriating health. There were six top-ranking  RSS leaders who were being considered as probable successors to  him. They included Abhaji Thatte, Sudershanji, H.V. Seshadri,  Suresh Rao and Moroplant Pingle besides myself.    Three months ago, Deorasji had come to Delhi and indicated  that he wanted to relinquish office. I had pleaded with him to  nominate a younger person so that he could have a long tenure in  office. But he was determined to choose his successor.    The normal procedure of selection is that the reigning  sarsanghchalak must consult the 20-member working  committee and also ascertain the views of 120 special invitees  to the committee. He had done it and made up his mind. My name  as his successor was announced by him at the Akhil Bharatiya  Pratinidhi Sabha of the RSS held at Nagpur on March 11.    What is it that Balasaheb Deoras is suffering from  which compelled him to choose his successor during his  lifetime--contrary to the established practice of leaving the  name of the successor in a sealed envelope that must be opened  after the sarsanghchalak's death?    Deorasji has been suffering from blood pressure and diabetes  for the past 30 to 35 years. Besides, he underwent a prostate  operation and had a mild paralytic attack. All these ailments  made it extremely difficult for him to discharge his duties.    What are your views on choosing your successor?    I will keep on working so long as I find myself physically  fit. As far as choosing a successor is concerned, this will be  finalized during my lifetime. And that is going to be the new  succession policy in the RSS. Life being what it is, anything  can happen to anyone anytime.    It is alleged that Balasaheb Deoras was a weak-hearted  leader who wrote eulogistic letters to Indira Gandhi during the  Emergency to secure his own release from detention.    Nothing of that kind happened. Our adversaries had been  threatening us that they would expose the RSS.    All that Deorasji had said in his letter to Indira Gandhi  was  that since the Government had made all kinds of investigations  and could not prove that the RSS was out to overthrow her  Government, it was time they held talks about nation-building.    Many people, particularly the minorities, feel that the  RSS is a fascist organization that is working to create a "Hindu  Rashtra" behind the facade of a cultural organization.    Those who accuse us of being a fascist organization  obviously  know nothing about the origin and growth of fascism in Europe.  There the ideology of socialism was used to capture political  power by a political outfit.    We are not aspiring to capture political power, to impose  any  kind of ideology on the nation. All that we want is that  national politics should have a pronounced pro-Hindu tilt. We  are totally against the creation of a theocratic State. India  has never been a theocratic state and should never be.    [23 Mar p 1]    [Text] THE STATESMAN: The Sangh Parivar has been  accused of waging a veritable war on the Muslims. What it has  done at Ayodhya is now having its reverberations in distant  Pondicherry and Hubli in Karnataka.    Rajendra Singh: Reclamation of the three Hindu  shrines at Ayodhya, Mathura and Varanasi is the programme of the  VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad (vernacular)] which we support.  Perhaps they are right in claiming only three Hindu temples in  lieu of demolition of 3,000 or more of their temples. It would  have made a qualitative difference in Hindu-Muslim relations had  the VHP been permitted to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya.    I have no comments on developments in Pondicherry and Hubli.    What would be your priorities as RSS chief?    I would endeavour to strengthen Hindutva and accelerate the  tempo of constructive work like slum improvement. During the  centenary celebrations of K.B. Hedgewar in 1989, the RSS had  collected about Rs 10 crores from the public. Much of this money  was channelled into slum-improvement schemes.    In Delhi we have been active in this field since 1978:  currently, nearly 700 slum-improvement programmes are under way  in the capital. Besides teaching the slum dwellers skills like  sewing, we try to bring people belonging to scheduled castes and  tribes into the Hindu mainstream. And our success rate has been  quite impressive.    What is the relationship between the RSS and the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party]? Is the BJP your political wing?    No. The BJP is an independent organization--they take their  own decisions. It is true that it is a like-minded party; their  leaders meet us off and on and we discuss many things. But they  don't take any dictation from us. Nor do we impose anything on  them.    And what is the relationship between the VHP and the  RSS? Is the VHP a religious wing of the RSS?    Again no. The VHP is also an independent organization that  takes its own independent decisions. Suffice it to say that our  front organization, including the BJP and VHP, work for a  "common cause."    Has the reported political understanding between the  BJP and the Shiv Sena your blessings then?    Their political understanding has nothing to do with us.  They  are free to strengthen it or terminate it.    Does the RSS believe in socialism?    If socialism means State control, then our answer is that we  are against it in all walks of life. We want minimum State  control in the lives of the people.    Since the founding of the RSS in 1925 till you took  over, all its sarsanghchallaks had been Brahmins. Did  this happen by coincidence or by design?    It was a coincidence. Till 1937 the work of the RSS was  confined mainly to Nagpur. It was in 1937 that Dr Hedgewar sent  swayamsevaks to Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Calcutta.    In 1940 he died and Guru Golwalker--a Brahmin--took over. In  1973 Guru Golwalker died and Balasaheb Deoras took over. He too  was a Brahmin.    But let me remind you that between 1925 and 1940, a majority  of leaders in the Congress, Communist Party, Hindu Mahasabha and  RSS were Brahmins--Tilak, Pandit Nehru, S.A. Dange, V.D.  Savarkar and Dr Hedgewar. The exceptions were Mahatma Gandhi and  Sardar Patel.    So it was natural that the leadership went into the hands of  Brahmins. Today we have a wide variety of leaders belonging to  various castes.</p>

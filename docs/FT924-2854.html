			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Royal Trustco senior debt rating cut by Moody's MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, has reduced its rating on Royal Trustco senior debt from triple-B (medium) to double-B (high), pointing to problem loans in the UK and North America. Royal Trustco is the holding company for Canada's second-biggest trust company and is part of the Bronfman-controlled Edper group. Ratings were also reduced for the subordinated debt of Royal Trustco as well as on debt issued by the subsidiary operating trust business in all parts of Canada except Quebec. Moody's said it was worried that Royal Trustco's capital 'could be reduced further by the need for additional write-downs against UK and US assets'. It added the domestic operation had been affected by non-performing loans and tight profit margins. Royal Trustco replied it had CDollars 1bn (USDollars 783m) in liquid assets while the domestic trust company had CDollars 2.2bn, well above regulatory requirements.</p>

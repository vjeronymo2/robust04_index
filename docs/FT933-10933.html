			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Motoring: Vauxhall Astra 2.0i convertible WHEN I HAD an Audi 80 cabriolet on test in June, the weather was so awful that the hood never got opened, writes Stuart Marshall. Early July was better, though, and the power-operated top of the Vauxhall Astra 2.0i convertible (above) was open more often than shut. This lively car rode well, shook only slightly when a wheel hit a pothole and remained perfectly habitable, hood up, at a business driver's motorway cruising speeds. Closed, it drove as quietly as a saloon and stayed dry even during a near-tropical thunderstorm. It is a proper four-seater, although the hood mechanism takes up so much boot space that four people could, at best, take a weekend bag apiece. Since an open car creates much more aerodynamic drag than a saloon, I thought 27 miles per gallon pretty good because most of my driving was either at speed on the motorway or in stop-start town traffic. The price is Pounds 15,800, which includes a power-operated top, windows and outside mirrors.</p>

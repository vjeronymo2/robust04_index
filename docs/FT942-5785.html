			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (9): Spring is in the air - The economic auguries are promising The Belgian economy is showing signs of a springtime recovery after last year's wintry mixture of recession, currency crisis and political uncertainty. After a 1.4 per cent contraction of national output in 1993, this year's budget assumes a modest 1.1 per cent recovery in gross domestic product. However, officials are privately looking at a possible 1.9 per cent GDP growth, pulled along by brighter prospects in Germany and France. Such bald figures, however, tell little of the horror of last year or of the formidable challenges which still lie ahead. For Belgium, 1993 was traumatic. The recession and unemployment bit hard, and the franc suffered its worst battering since 1982 from speculators, when in August the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) imploded and all currencies within the grid were set free to float within wide bands. The Centre-Left coalition led by Christian Democrat Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene frequently seemed on the brink of collapse, bruised by scandals affecting its Socialist partners, challenged from within and from the unions over austerity measures, and in the final difficult throes of turning Belgium into a federal state to enable French-speaking Wallonia, Dutch-speaking Flanders and polyglot Brussels to cohabit. To cap it all, King Baudouin, the embodiment of Belgium's fragile unity, died suddenly in August. Yet the glue holding Belgium together, and the vitality of its economy, were stronger than most people had guessed. If there was a single turning point, it was probably the government's mid-November adoption of the Global Plan, a package to rein in budget and social security deficits, boost industrial competitiveness, and freeze wages in real terms until the end of 1996. These measures were designed to release the strength of a high-productivity, export-oriented economy, weighed down by huge public deficits and a growing wage gap with Belgium's main trading partners. Pushed through stubbornly by Mr Dehaene against trade union strikes and protests, they appear so far to be working. It is still hard to pin down the precise reasons for the better than expected growth in output. On the heels of a surprisingly severe wage freeze - the government quietly subtracted fuel and tobacco from the retail price index to which Belgian wages are linked - recovery is being driven by exports rather than domestic consumption. The authorities predict a handsome current account surplus for the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union this year of BFr400bn, or 5 per cent of GDP. This is double the average surpluses of the second half of the 1980s, but, most importantly, the mix has changed. About half of the surplus is on the trade account, and three fifths of it is Belgian, whereas the banking centre of Luxembourg traditionally accounted for around three quarters. The government is closely studying why Belgium's exports and market share should be rising. Belgium exports around two thirds of its output, and two thirds of that goes to Germany, France and the Netherlands, its neighbours and peers in the 'hard-core' group of ERM currencies. But wages had risen more slowly in those depressed markets, and Belgium was and is paying a competitive price for its franc fort policy of shadowing the D-Mark. 'We are trying to figure out the paradox,' smiles Mr Phillipe Maystadt, the finance minister. He and his officials suggest the margin between wages in Belgium and in its competitors was relatively small in the light of the persistent trend towards higher Belgian productivity gains. 'I'm afraid the adjustment is being made not through the current account but the rise in unemployment,' Mr Maystadt says, forecasting a jobless rise to 10.1 per cent by year-end before things improve. But the improvement could then be quite rapid. Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque, points out that inventories have been cut drastically, leading to one of the lowest ever levels of stocks. Export-led growth now should therefore feed into a revival of investment, then of domestic demand, and then of jobs. Unlike the recessions in 1975 and 1980-82, most of Belgium's generally low debt and cash-rich companies remain respectably profitable. The overburdened social security system has taken a good deal of the shock of lay-offs and early retirements, while the BFr30bn take from new energy taxes is being recycled into the tradeable goods sector to reduce employers' payroll costs. Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the governor of the central bank, reckons these transfers alone should create 50,000 new jobs over the next four years. 'For a politician four years is an eternity but not for Dehaene,' he remarks. Sticking with the Global Plan of which this is part is vital. Mr Dehaene is now in the running to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, but his tough managerial reputation is more likely to be needed to ensure the success of the Plan - and to take the further, sensitive measures needed to deal with Belgium's debt. The Plan and spending cuts made last year look as though they will quickly bring the social security deficit into rough balance, and cut the budget deficit from 7.2 per cent in 1993 to 5.7 per cent - under the likely EU average - this year. Still to be attacked is the debt stock, equivalent to 130 per cent of GDP, which towers over the economy and the franc even though Belgium's huge stock of household savings, equivalent to 175 per cent of GDP, far outweighs it. The debt is over twice the 60 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio set down in the Maastricht treaty as the marker for economic and monetary union (Emu) by 1997 or 1999 - to which Belgium is firmly committed. The debt stock is a useful alibi for pushing through structural reform of public finances and attacking the budget deficit. Lower interest rates plus the repricing of virtually all Belgium's more expensive debt has, moreover, brought significant savings on an interest bill which had grown to 11 per cent of GDP. As Mr Verplaetse points out, 'once nominal growth exceeds the deficit, we're in a virtuous circle,' helping bring down the debt/GDP ratio, probably from 1995. Growing privatisation receipts could also be used to retire debt. But a new assault on public finances will almost certainly be needed before 1996, when the Maastricht review of early candidates for Emu will take place. For instance, the Brussels region is in trouble because of its shrinking tax base, while the education system on both sides of the language divide (but especially in Wallonia) is heading for insolvency. This would need a very tight budget for 1996. But that is virtually impossible unless federal elections are brought forward from their November 1995 deadline. Even then, going further than the government has already done will be socially and politically risky. In Mr Praet's view of the medium-term, 'you need somebody like Dehaene to take these sorts of decisions.'</p>

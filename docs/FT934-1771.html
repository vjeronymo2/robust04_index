			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Court refuses insurance plea Decisions by the insurance ombudsman cannot be judicially reviewed in the courts, the High Court in London ruled yesterday. Lord Justice Rose and Mr Justice McKinnon dismissed a challenge by Aegon Life Assurance to a series of ombudsman decisions which will cost the company an estimated Pounds 2m in payments to investors. Aegon had sought to overturn 23 of 49 decisions by Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, in March. These held the company responsible for alleged guarantees of income made on broker bonds sold by South West Investment Management of Truro in 1985 and 1987, before the Financial Services Act came into operation. South West had sold bonds for Trans Life, later renamed Regency Life and bought by Aegon in 1991. Aegon argued that any promises by South West as an agent were made without authority. The court refused leave to appeal. Aegon has 28 days to apply direct to the Court of Appeal. Mr Peter Baines, Aegon chief executive, said any further legal action would not affect payments to investors, which would be made immediately.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME acts to end zinc market squeeze THE LONDON Metal Exchange acted yesterday to end the squeeze in the zinc market, which has taken the premium for cash metal over three-month metal to nearly Dollars 200 a tonne in spite of record stock levels. After an emergency board meeting, the exchange announced that its was limiting the premium payable on spot metal to Dollars 15 a tonne per day until June 26, then to Dollars 10 until July 8, and finally to Dollars 5 until July 15. Any market user short of zinc and unable either to deliver on the above dates or to borrow metal (buy cash and sell forward) for the day at or below those premiums will pay an equivalent penalty. Users with long positions will be similarly compensated. Mr David King, chief executive of the LME, said the board would be 'meeting again during the course of this period to review the situation'. The technical shortage that has forced spot prices up is thought to be related to increasingly sophisticated use of the options markets. In the physical market LME warehouse stocks of zinc now stand at a record 277,300 tonnes, compared with 152,000 tonnes at the beginning of the year. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group yesterday put producer stocks at 344,000 tonnes at the end of April. This situation angers consumers, who are encouraged by the LME to us the market to smooth out peaks and troughs in prices. Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, said that the large premium for cash metal - which was not reflecting the fundamental market position - meant that day-to-day users of the market were unable to hedge properly. Yesterday cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,423.50 a tonne, down Dollars 24 on the day. The cash premium over three-month metal narrowed to Dollars 166 a tonne from Dollars 189. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said that the LME had been stuck between a rock and a hard place, and had come up with a sensible solution which would lead to an orderly market. 'If you need to borrow for a day and there is a party on the other side, then he might as well lend the metal at Dollars 15 because he is not going to get any more,' he said. He pointed out that the zinc market was in oversupply last year, and supply would probably outweigh demand again this year. The LME action follows two warnings to the market earlier in the year, the last time at the beginning of April. Mr Martin Abbott, marketing director of the exchange, said at the time that the LME had fired 'a warning shot across the bows of anyone who might be thinking of playing any games in the zinc market'.</p>

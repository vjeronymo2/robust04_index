			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The Justness of Our </F> Party's Revolutionary Economic Strategy"]    [Text] In his New Year's address the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song presented a militant task to thoroughly implement  our party's revolutionary economic strategy and highly display  the superiority of socialism of our own style.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: By  thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategy  during the adjustment period for socialist economic  construction, we must consolidate the self-reliant economic  foundation of the country rock-firm, more smoothly ensure the  people's lives in keeping with the socialist demand, and secure  a new position of attack to conquer higher peaks of socialism.    In his New Year's address the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song presented strategic tasks to implement the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and foreign trade-first  policy, give top priority to the coal industry, the power  industry, and railway transportation, the leading sectors of the  people's economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical  industry during the three year adjustment period.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the most just  policy on economic construction that was presented based on its  scientific insights into the current state of the development of  our country's people's economy, lawful requirements of socialist  economic construction, and the changing situation at home and  abroad.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just because  it will significantly increase the people's standard of living  in the next few years and more highly display the superiority  and vitality of socialism of our own style.    Material lives are an important part of social lives and one  of the important features that show the superiority of the  socialist system. How one improves the people's material lives  is closely related to agriculture, the light industry, and  foreign trade.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is to further  consolidate the strong basis of the heavy industry, rapidly  develop the light industry and agriculture and develop foreign  trade, and, thus, significantly improve the people's lives.  Toward that end, we must exert great efforts to develop  agriculture. Then, we can satisfactorily solve the problem of  food, the most important thing in the people's lives, and  rapidly develop the overall people's economy.    Only when we give priority to the light industry and rapidly  develop on a high level, can we smoothly distribute goods,  ensure expanded reproduction at a high speed, and, thus,  decisively increase the production of people's consumer goods.  Only when we extensively develop foreign trade, can we  satisfactorily solve problems in further strengthening the basis  of the self-reliant economy and improving the people's lives.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just also  because it enables us to further consolidate the self-reliant  basis of our economy to ensure that we can live on our own  strength in the changed new environment.    For us to defend the honor and dignity of socialism and live  on our own strength in any environment is our party's  unchanging, firm principle. An important thing in living on our  own strength is to more reasonably restructure the country's  economic structure to comply with the changed environment and  actual demands.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy calls not only  for giving top priority to production of agriculture, the light  industry, and export goods, but also for continuously developing  the coal and power industries and the metallurgical industry,  more satisfactorily solving the railway transportation problem,  and strengthening the independence and self-reliance of our  economy, thus providing a firm guarantee for our people to live  on their own strength in any condition.    When our people eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes,  and live in tile-roofed house by thoroughly implementing our  party's revolutionary economic strategy, the enemies' plot to  isolate, blockade, and suffocate [chilsik] our country cannot  succeed no matter how hard it may strengthen. Even bourgeois  ideology and literature cannot infiltrate into our country.  Also, the justness of our party's revolutionary economic  strategy enables us to firmly build a new launching base to  occupy the higher socialist hill.    In general, a strategy presents a guideline for the prospect  of development in the near future, as well as the development of  the next stage. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is  a practical and prospective blueprint to open a bright prospect  for the future development of our economy, which has been  greatly advanced during the Third Seven-Year Plan.    Our party has set three years as a period for an adjustment.  This is very appropriate and correct. During this period, our  people are urged to concentrate their efforts on agriculture,  light industry, and external trade. This becomes the wisest  policy to prepare for a new attack [saeroun konggyok chunbirul  kachugiwihan].    When we vigorously struggle to consummate the task of rural  theses, effect an upturn in the people's consumer goods  production, correct the structure and method of the external  trade, and largely expand and develop it during the period for  an adjustment, our people's economy will be more vigorously  strengthened and developed. By so doing, we can firmly build the  new launching base and boldly embark upon the road of the grand  march to occupy the higher hill in the socialist construction.    Truly, the presentation of the revolutionary economic  strategy is a clear demonstration of the wisdom of the  leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who have always an extraordinary  wisdom and far-sighted scientific insight and who are  victoriously leading the economic construction battle.    All party members and working people must uphold and  thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic  strategy. As a result, they must glorify socialism of our own  style more highly.</p>

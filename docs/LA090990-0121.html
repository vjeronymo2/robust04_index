			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: A HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO JOINING SHIP'S CREW  </P> <P> The concept of free cruising throughout the world's waters as a member of a  crew conjures up one of the ultimate romantic images for budget travelers. But  just how realistic is this dream?  </P> <P> "You'll discover that enjoying this type of adventure is based more on  personality rather than gender, age or occupation," writes Alison Muir Bennett  and Clare Davis in their recent book, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Oceans:  Crewing Around the World."  </P> <P> The British authors combined knowledge gained from their crewing experiences  for a book designed to help others determine if the concept was something they  would like, and, if so, how to go about doing it.  </P> <P> Topics include recognizing the skills that make you valuable to a skipper, how  to acquire more skills, how to contact skippers who need crews, presenting  yourself, what you should consider before signing on, the life style on board,  and financial arrangements.  </P> <P> For example, the authors write that just because you may not have had any  "hands-on" experience crewing, don't think it means that you wouldn't be  valuable. You may have other skills that would make you a desirable crew member  -- skills such as cooking, teaching and navigation, plus knowledge of  mechanics, languages and/or medicine.  </P> <P> Even being able to play a musical instrument could help sway some skippers in  your favor.  </P> <P> You also get tips on the ways that "yachties" network, so you can plug into the  system and make it known that you would like to sign on. For example, in some  harbors, all the boats tune in to a daily radio session and exchange  information, an ideal medium for a crew to make it known they are looking for  someone.  </P> <P> To use this method you have to go where the boats are docked. Each year the  cruising boats migrate following patterns dictated by trade winds, hurricane  seasons and other world weather conditions. The book includes a map and chart  that indicates the bottleneck areas where skippers are most likely to be  recruiting crews while waiting out the weather.  </P> <P> One of the more valuable points offered is that you can't just expect to fly  into any area with a minimum amount of funds, find a berth and be on your way.  </P> <P> Without the proper documentation and references from a waiting skipper, you may  have problems entering the country unless you can prove that you have the funds  or a ticket that would take you home.  </P> <P> You'll also learn that some island nations require each member of the crew, and  the skipper, to post a bond equal to the amount of their air fare home, which  is held until their day of departure.  </P> <P> The authors encourage readers to consider some of the drawbacks to crewing,  such as: adjusting to the time patterns required for a crew to man a boat 24  hours a day, dealing with seasickness, living in cramped quarters, the  complications of communicating with friends and family by phone or mail,  washing in saltwater and learning to live in a less-than-democratic environment  (the skipper's word is final).  </P> <P> The book also points out the ways you can judge which skippers would be best  suitable to sail with. You'll learn that it's important to pay attention to  their reasons for making the journey.  </P> <P> Are they escaping, relaxing or trying to achieve something? This can make a big  difference in the type of atmosphere you can expect on board.  </P> <P> You should also take into consideration that some vessels could be involved in  illegal activities. The book suggests some ways for checking out your skipper,  an important concern considering that even recreational drugs can lead to the  confiscation of a boat and the arrest and sentencing of the crew.  </P> <P> In some areas of the world, the sentencing of foreigners for drug offenses has  even included the death penalty.  </P> <P>  "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Oceans: Crewing Around the World" is distributed  by Tab Books, 13311 Monterey Ave., Blueridge Summit, Pa. 17214, (717) 794-2191.  It can be purchased through retail bookstores or ordered directly for $13.60,  including postage and tax.  </P></p>

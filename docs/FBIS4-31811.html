			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Uros Komlenovic: "Brother Drives Down the </F> Corridor"]    [Text] Every bus trip down the corridor through Bosanska  Posavina [Sava Valley in Bosnia] usually begins with a quarrel.  For example, the conductor may be mortally insulted if an  unfortunate traveler deferentially seeks a bit of rope or wire  to somehow tie up the completely collapsed back of his seat:    "Rope! Where would I get rope? If I had rope, I would hang  myself at once! The seat is broken, and I cannot do anything  about it, so don't make trouble, do you hear!"    That is how it was last fall, but this spring the quarrel  begins on the platform of the Belgrade bus terminal. The  participants are the bus driver ("boss," "brother," "bro") and a  woman who is trying to send a package to Bosanska (now Kozarska)  Dubica by him:    "Listen, madam, I cannot take the package, they will give me  a hard time at the border."    The fear is certainly justified--by contrast with the  Serbian  police, who work quickly and routinely, the MUP [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] of the Srpska republic take their job much  more seriously. At the border checkpoint in Bosanska (now  Srpska) Raca, young men in new uniforms (blue camouflage  garrison caps with a brim like that of General Zivojin Misic)  study personal identity cards carefully, and the customs  officials poke around in the baggage compartment: "Whose bag is  this with the flowers? Please come out." In the end, it turned  out that the flowers were artificial and harmless.    The bus passes quickly through Bijeljina without problems  unless it is market day, when trucks, cars, and wagons  completely block the narrow street that borders the market.  There are no visible traces of war until Brcko, which is riddled  and destroyed and where soldiers fill the bus. These are mainly  people from Bosanska Krajina who are going on leave. Good humor  is at an enviable level, so no one objects if the barrel of some  kalashnikov pushes against his side. A trip is unthinkable  without the inevitable tipsy fellow in good humor who prattles  on for hours about the aunt of his comrade-in-arms, that is,  about her impressive bust. The music from the radio is stylish  and ethnically pure--they only tune in to "patriotic folk  music." For instance, aside from the increasingly popular  refrain "Long live orthodox concord, us and 300 million  Russians," they also sing "The small and the tall have risen up,  we are creating you, Srpska republic," but the most fascinating  is a poetical dialogue with a former friend of a different  religion:    "What kind of Bosnia do you want, friend, One in which the  Serbs would do your bidding? How do you feel now, my former  friend, Now that the tanks are rumbling?"  <H5>  The Moral </H5>   The music is interrupted by the voice of the woman  announcer,  who reports that "Muslim units this morning opened infantry and  mortar fire on positions of the Army of the Srpska republic near  Brcko, but the Serbs did not return it." A soldier who obviously  had not learned all he should in moral-political training  cheerily commented: "Come on, why is she lying, damn her eyes,  my battery alone fired 15 shells this morning, ha, ha." The  militance is nevertheless frightening, and the news that the  U.S. Senate voted to remove the embargo from imports of arms  intended for the Muslims is met almost with approval: "Well,  thank you, now they can't forbid us from settling accounts once  and for all."    The worst part of the trip through the corridor is the  macadam road around Derventa. This road was cut immediately  after the corridor was cleared, before it was widened, but even  now it is sometimes used. This section is some 20 km long, the  houses along it have been completely destroyed, and it takes at  least about an hour to travel it. The sun is frying, and every  car that passes in the opposite direction raises a cloud of dust  that covers the bus, and so we seek salvation by closing the  windows. Only then do you realize the real meaning of the term  "gas chamber." The windows, however, remain closed even when we  finally leave the macadam and head for Prnjavor and Banja Luka  on the decent asphalt road. Every attempt to let a bit of air  into the overheated tin can meets with looks full of primitive  fear and an imploring: "Don't, it is blowing on my head." The  tense and sweaty faces of the passengers speak clearly of the  attempt to settle the issue of who is to blame for this kind of  heat: the Muslims, the Croats, the leaders of the opposition in  Belgrade, or perhaps the bus drivers. The closed windows have  nothing to do with that, and it is well-known that a breeze  causes instant death, if not something worse.  <H5>  Advantages </H5>   Nor did the trip from Pakrac to Belgrade begin without a  quarrel. To be sure, the drivers are more liberal and take  packages for Belgrade, but on the other hand they do not  recognize travel passes: "You have gone to Belgrade 10 times and  you always have some pass from the Red Cross, the opstina, a  firm, God, and the devil. You have to buy a ticket."    The ticket from Pakrac to Belgrade, incidentally, costs 25  dinars, but from Belgrade to Gradiska (a trip 40 km shorter) 27  dinars. A ticket bought from Pakrac Tours is perhaps cheaper  because there is no music in the bus, but that fact might easily  be taken as an advantage. On this trip, they do not take the  macadam, but the asphalt, through the center of devastated  Derventa, but on the other hand they cannot avoid the checkpoint  where a zealous policeman spends an entire hour checking papers  and the content of the package referred to, which is marked  "Fragile." The content of the suspicious package: Slavonian ham,  eggs, and walnuts. Aside from the regular one-hour rest stop at  the Atina Restaurant between Brcko and Bijeljina (prices similar  to those in Belgrade, a toilet that takes your breath away),  another stop had to be made to take on at least half of the  passengers from a broken-down bus traveling the route between  Okucani and Belgrade. It goes without saying that elderly ladies  with immense bags effectively push their way into the bus, by  contrast with a young woman and a child, who correctly judged  that uncertainty on the highway is a lesser evil than the  possibility of her child being smothered in an overcrowded bus.  At the border, it turned out that the Srpska republic is  incomparably more difficult to leave than to enter. In this  direction, the baggage is not checked, but on the other hand  every male of "military age" who has an identity card from the  Srpska republic must show a certificate that his military  obligation has been met, and the police of the Srpska republic  are particularly interested in those whose names might indicate  a non-Serb origin. Only a personal identity card from Belgrade  rescues these people. Finally, when a Serbian policeman enters  the bus at Sremska Raca, ordinary mortals can hardly resist the  impulse to hug him and kiss him, and the casual examination of  papers, the incidental (unfulfilled) threat "Come on, people, if  you have a weapon, turn it in yourselves, so I don't have to  look for it," and the already forgotten "Good-bye and good trip"  prove that it does not take much for a man who has a hard time  to immerse himself in the deceptive dream of freedom and  democracy.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DON'T PLAY ON THE TRACKS  </P> <P> In response to Julie Fine of Reseda's letter about the injuries and deaths that  have occurred since the July start-up of the Blue Line light-rail system, I am  appalled to learn that anyone as fuzzy-brained as she could have been on a  panel for transportation solutions.  </P> <P> She mentioned a Canadian rail consultant's projection that during the first  year of operation, a light-rail line would experience no deaths, just injuries,  and tries to take the consultant to task for what has happened along the  BlueLine tracks.  </P> <P> What she, and the consultant, fail to take into consideration is that in  Southern California there have been bred persons so brainless they don't  realize that a moving train can hurt you.  </P> <P> Don't parents teach their children anymore that there is a reason not to play  on the train tracks? Or that there is a purpose for fencingoff tracks and  having signals and crossing arms?  </P> <P> I object to the latest effort to throw money at a problem by allotting $5.1  million to educate and over-protect an idiot element of the population.  </P> <P> Let them get the message on their own that when one of the crossings is  indicating an imminent dangerous situation they are to obey, and that a moving  train is not to be fooled with.  </P> <P> WILLIAM POWELL, Toluca Lake  </P></p>

Recently, more lethal  equipment arrived at the Luanda airport at night coming from  Brazil, the DPRK, Russia, Israel, and Argentina. Such an  attitude is dangerous to the current atmosphere of expectation  in Angola, since the negotiators in Lusaka are about to reach an  agreement. The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] alerts the international community, particularly  the United States to persuade the Futungo regime to abdicate its  warmongering thoughts. UNITA also says that the Luanda regime  has on various occasions tried to hinder the success of the  Lusaka talks. The Luanda regime will be responsible for a  possible failure in the process. UNITA believes that there is  no possibility of establishing peace through a military solution  in Angola, as stated recently by UNITA President Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi in an interview with AFP journalists.</p>

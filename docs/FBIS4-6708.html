			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's battered  economy is showing signs of revival this year, and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wednesday [20 April] gave the  credit to an ambitious stimulus package the Japanese Government  introduced in February. There would be "essentially no growth  in the absence of the package," the IMF said in a study on the  macroeconomic effects of the 15.3 trillion yen economic program.    The package, which consists of a mix of government spending  plus a one-time tax reduction, "will raise the level of output  by about three-fourths of 1 percent in both 1994 and 1995," the  IMF said in its semiannual review of the world economy.    The IMF study also said the stimulative effect of the  economic package is expected to cut Japan's current-account  surplus by 1.5 percent this year and by a lesser margin in 1995.    Without the package, the IMF projects the surplus in Japan's  current account, which provides the broadest measure of foreign  trade, will rise from 131.4 billion dollars last year to 135.5  billion dollars this year. With the package in place, this  year's surplus is expected to shrink by 2.1 billion dollars to  133.4 billion dollars.    For 1995, the package is expected to produce a 1.5 billion  dollar difference in Japan's projected current-account surplus,  from 127.2 billion dollars to 125.7 billion dollars.</p>

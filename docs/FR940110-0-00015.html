This rule is effective during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year and establishes minimum grade and size requirements for such olives in the order's rules and regulations. This final rule also adopts, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule that authorizes the importation of certain bulk olives into the United States to be used in the production of limited use styles of olives such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments. This action is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels and is consistent with current market requirements. This action also updates the Federal-State inspection office address list contained in the import regulation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  February 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Caroline C.

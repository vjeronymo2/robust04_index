			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ENTRY  </P> <P> Re: "Merit Only" College Entry Proposal (Dec. 9):  </P> <P> Notwithstanding the charts, tables, reports, studies and other hype presented  in defense, the disproportionate number of outstanding Asian-Americans who have  been turned away from certain California public universities and professional  schools reinforces my belief that de facto discrimination in admissions  practices is indeed going on in these institutions.  </P> <P> The purpose of affirmative action is to help those minority students not  proportionately represented on the campuses better their academic performance  so they can gain admission to our institutions of higher learning. The intent  is not to permit quotas to override other criteria. Asian-Americans value  learning and are willing to work hard. America has much to gain if their  pursuit of excellence is rewarded. The Bakke ruling reaffirmed merit as a  determining criterion in judging admissibility to a UC medical school. The  Olympic gold is awarded only for excellence. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is to be  complimented for his wisdom in sponsoring a congressional resolution which  speaks to this inequity. The purpose of our institutions of higher learning is  to pursue the truth. And excellence.  </P> <P> U KYAW WIN  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

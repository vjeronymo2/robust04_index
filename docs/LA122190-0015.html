			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A DO-OR-DIE WEEKEND FOR STORES HOPING TO LIFT SALES  </P> <P> After nearly a month of disheartening holiday sales, Southland merchants are  bracing for what they hope will be a three-day sales blitz, the retail  equivalent of hanging shiny new ornaments on an otherwise sagging Christmas  tree.  </P> <P> Hit hard by the economic slowdown, department store executives and small  shopkeepers alike say they hope that the malls will bustle and cash registers  will ring starting Saturday and running through Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> Consumers who have postponed making gift-buying decisions will finally be  forced to act -- or wait until next year. Merchants, forced to keep sweetening  the pot with sales and discounts, will have one final chance to move  merchandise off the shelves before having to slash prices for after-Christmas  sales.  </P> <P> "I don't think (merchants) have faced a time in recent memory where three days  have been more important to them. This can be the difference between an OK  Christmas and a very disappointing year," said Richard Giss, partner-in-charge  of the Retailing Services Group for the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As if to foretell the comeback, the blast of cold arctic air this week was  being welcomed by store owners as a way to put people into the Christmas  spirit, into malls and into expensive jackets and ski gear.  </P> <P> The calendar is also giving retailers reason to keep fingers tightly crossed.  The season has been a little longer, with five weekends since Thanksgiving Day  instead of four. And more important, since Christmas Day falls on Tuesday,  shoppers are likely to take Monday off or work only a partial day. As a result,  merchants believe that Christmas Eve may be one of the busiest shopping days  this year.  </P> <P> A three-day shopping period before a holiday typically adds 6% to 8% to sales  revenue for the month, said Rita Mincavage, manager of merchandise publicity  for J. C. Penney's Southern California stores. "You can say that about any  holiday, but what's really nice is this holiday is Christmas," she added.  </P> <P> Although the busy Christmas Eve shopping day could add a lift to sales,  retailing executives say they would rather have seen the buying season pick up  speed earlier.  </P> <P> "It's certainly a big plus as far as shopping goes, but it's a mixed blessing  because it makes it more likely people will put off their shopping and  retailers would like to see them get in there early," said E. Harlin Smith, a  spokesman for Carter Hawley Hale Stores, owner of the Broadway Southern  California, Weinstock's, Emporium and Broadway Southwest chains.  </P> <P> Late or not, every sale will be appreciated as merchants reel from the weak  economy and heavy debt from the takeover wars.  </P> <P> Department stores and others have responded by increasingly upping the ante to  try to lure shoppers. Price reductions ranging 20% to 50% have been common  during the season.  </P> <P> In an effort to boost sales of big-ticket items, Sears, Roebuck and Co. offered  0% financing starting Thursday on appliances, furniture, home electronics and  carpeting costing more than $200. J. C. Penney is starting its traditional  "after-Christmas sale" on Saturday, three days before the holiday.  </P> <P> Problem is, sales eat into profits. A price-cutting binge may offset the surge  in volume derived from a last-minute shopping stampede.  </P> <P> "Even if they can bring customers in the door, the fact is that discounting  hurts earnings," said Sandra Shaber, an economist and management consultant for  The Futures Group in Washington.  </P> <P> Sarah Stack, an analyst for the stock brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  in Los Angeles, adds that no matter how busy the three days turn out to be, it  will be hard to recoup from five flat weeks.  </P> <P> Many retailers agree. Said one San Diego sporting goods store manager: "I don't  think this weekend will save the season; I'm just hoping to break even."  </P> <P> Department store executives say they have seen a trend for years toward  shopping later in the season, particularly as consumers become more bargain  hungry and have less time to shop.  </P> <P> But one thing that retailers could never plan on was the onslaught of cold,  wintry weather that has gripped the Southland the past few days. Finally, it's  beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  </P> <P> Jim Chick, president of the Covina-based Chick's Sporting Good chain of six  stores, said the weather should help heat up icy sales of winter and ski gear.  </P> <P> Shoppers who wait too long, however, may pay an unexpected price for their  procrastination. Some key items may be sold out by Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> Although overall retailing has been off, there have been some regional bright  spots.  </P> <P> Some San Diego retailers, for instance, are hoping that the return of the  aircraft carrier Independence from duty off the Persian Gulf will flood the  city with free-spending sailors.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Chris Kraul and Tom Furlong contributed to this article.  </P></p>

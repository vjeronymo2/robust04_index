			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the municipal securities market came under increased scrutiny because of concerns that municipal securities dealers were influencing municipal securities issuers to hire such dealers for municipal securities business through the payment of political contributions and other monies to persons with influence over the dealer selection process. While the Board addressed the issue of political contributions through rule G&hyph;37, the Board was concerned that other activities, such as excessive gifts, also might be viewed as influencing the dealer selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change requires dealers to keep and retain specific records of all gifts and gratuities subject to paragraph (a) of the rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule change also requires dealers to keep and retain records of all contracts of employment or agreements for compensation for services and all compensation paid as a result of those agreements. These amendments are consistent with the rules of other self-regulatory organizations. The Board believes that the amendments to the recordkeeping and record retention requirements related to gifts and gratuities will facilitate dealer compliance with rule G&hyph;20, and assist enforcement agencies in monitoring for compliance with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change also clarifies that dealers complying with Rule 17a&hyph;3 of the Act are required to maintain this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report in the "Restoration" column: </F> "Mordovia's Supreme Soviet Has Restored District and City  Soviets. The Government Is Against but It Is Ignored"]    [Text] Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, periodically stirring the  public with loud scandals -- now setting up the republic's  Constitutional Court to help remove the president from his post,  now abolishing it quickly ostensibly as "useless" -- has decided  again to make itself known. Relying on the Russian Federation  State Duma's and president's permission, a Supreme Soviet  session moved elections to the Legislative Assembly from 5 June  to 27 November although the election campaign has been in full  swing, with more than 350 candidates nominated to 75 seats. The  Supreme Soviet motivated its decision by suggesting that  simultaneous elections to the Legislative Assembly and local  power bodies will be less expensive for the taxpayers.  Generally, the wish to save public funds is quite laudable  except that no one has consulted the people about the fourth  shift in the election date.    On 11 April Mordovia's Supreme Soviet Presidium met to  discuss its further actions. Quite naturally the subject of  discussion was that the executive branch in general and  administration chiefs in particular have gotten completely out  of hand, and after the "illegal dissolution of the soviets"  there is no one to oversee them. The Supreme Soviet Presidium  then found an easy and foolproof method to control  administration heads. It was decided to elect district and city  presidiums from among former deputies of district and cities  soviets, up to 25 people, vesting them with oversight functions.  Under the interim regulations On Chairmen and Presidiums of  District and City Deputies Assemblies, they are to approve the  local budget and report on its execution; impose local taxes and  charges; approve programs for the development of corresponding  territories; amend the local self-government charter; oversee  the activity of the administration head; sanction the  appointment of administration head and other officials, and so  forth.    Republic Prosecutor Pavel Senkin, who was present at the  Supreme Soviet Presidium session, warned the house against  voting to restore soviet power because this contradicts the  Russian Federation Constitution and Boris Yeltsin's edict on  reforming the soviets. Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Biryukov,  however, feeling his colleagues' support, stated that "no matter  whether our decision is legal or not, as we shall vote, so it  will be." The "yes" vote was practically unanimous.    The scandal in Mordovia is growing and has already reached  Moscow. The republic's prosecutor, upholding legality, has  appealed against the Presidium's actions to the Russian General  Prosecutor's Office. Valentin Konakov, the president's  representative in Mordovia, in a telephone conversation with  SEGODNYA's correspondent, assessed the decision by the Supreme  Soviet Presidium as "restoration of soviet power in full volume  on a communist basis," stemming from the "desire to preserve  their powers to the utmost," moreover, by "exceeding these  powers." According to him, the decision is "an unconstitutional  act and it does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's edict on local  self-government," a fact he noted in his memorandum yesterday to  the presidential administration.    A similar reaction to the emerging setup has come from  administration chiefs who refuse to take their orders from the  soviets. The republican government appraised the Supreme Soviet  Presidium's decision as interference in its affairs. Yesterday  in Saransk a joint session of the government and administration  chiefs was held, ruling, in view of the fact that there is no  constitutional court in the republic, to request the Russian  Federation president to look into the "legality and  constitutionality" of the Mordovia Supreme Soviet Presidium's  resolution. Mordovia's government decided "not to implement the  Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution pending the president's  decision." The administration heads were told to be guided in  their activity by the latest resolution of the Council of  Ministers, not the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In addition, an  enlarged session of administration chiefs and the government  decided to ask Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, the Russian Federation  president, and the Russian Federal Assembly to move elections to  the republican Legislative Assembly back to 5 June.</p>

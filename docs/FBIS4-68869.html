			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [SNARK report: "Measures Made Stricter"] </F>   [Text] Measures against individuals evading the draft into  active military service are becoming stricter in Armenia.  According to a government decree signed a couple of days ago,  from now on citizens of draft age will be allowed to leave the  republic only with the appropriate note on their military  identification card.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to  submit  proposals concerning the procedure for returning draft dodgers  from other states.    At the same time certain economic sanctions and restrictions  on draft dodgers and their families are being considered.    Additionally, the state minister for questions of defense,  Vazgen Sarkisyan, speaking at a government conference,  categorically denied the assertion that draftees would be sent  immediately to the front lines, calling such rumors "absurd."</p>

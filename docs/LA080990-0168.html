			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews by Max jacobson.  Prices are based on average cost for a party of two without wine.  </P> <P> $--less than $15  </P> <P> $$--$15 to $39  </P> <P> $$$--$40 to $75  </P> <P> $$$$--More than $75  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN  </P> <P> * Cafe Zinc, 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-6302. Open Mondays from 7  a.m. to 11 a.m.; Tuesdays through Sundays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. $$  </P> <P> A Berkeley-style cafe in Laguna, Cafe Zinc has remarkable, densely foamed  cappuccino; fresh, imaginative muffins like millet or cranberry; and an outdoor  patio.  </P> <P> * Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714)  240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight; Fridays  and Saturdays to 2 a.m. $  </P> <P> This brewpub is a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young,  party-crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all, one could even call the  place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and  Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the  best of which is "beef on wick," wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The  burgers aren't bad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAJUN  </P> <P> * Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5  to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is Orange County's only bona fide Cajun  restaurant. The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. Indulge  yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden flavors;  oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and spicy  tomato; and stuffed trout, pan-fried in pure butter. Blackened items are a  must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHINESE  </P> <P> * China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton.  (714) 526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays  to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra-modern  dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is nothing  tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the most  accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and first-rate  soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged steaming into an  ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies you can have in  between are too numerous to mention.  </P> <P> * Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., No. 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 9 a.m. $$  </P> <P> A vast Hong Kong-style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is  beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the  capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both  food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black-pepper beef brisket from the  Page 1 specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first-rate kung pao  dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy-sauce squab. On a menu with 150  entrees, there is much to choose from.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONTINENTAL  </P> <P> * The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point.  (714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$$  </P> <P> A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience,  but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amid the beautiful  surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice Canelle  has introduced a creative, eccentric and imperfect cuisine, a blend of French,  Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes have a  tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and outstanding  desserts are the hallmarks.  </P> <P> * The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open  Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through  Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies  rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer  pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is  like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of  avocado immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled  marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on  the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines  and bistro-like desserts. The ambiance is relaxed and casual.  </P> <P> * Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim.  (714) 750-4321. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays  through Saturdays from 6 to 10:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant, but other aspects of dining  there can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room  is predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu  features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad and  some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the mouth  and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is extensive and  intelligent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CUBAN  </P> <P> * Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open seven  days a week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. $$  </P> <P> You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban-style  cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa rellena  (a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs) is the best appetizer.  Roast chicken Cubano (a crispy half-chicken with bitter orange peel added for  extra dimension) is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert -- it is  the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery  suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker  blush.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENGLISH  </P> <P> * The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or  (714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;  Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Tuesdays through Fridays to 10 p.m.; Saturdays to  10:30 p.m.; and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. $$  </P> <P> The Cat and Custard Cup is a lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy  Continental menu and dark, medieval trappings. It is charming, cheerful and  worth a wide detour.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FRENCH  </P> <P> * The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755.  Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through  Thursdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> * La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through  Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m.  $$$  </P> <P> Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants  advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge  more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and  salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything  without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more  accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade  chicken-liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too.  </P> <P> * La Vie en Rose, 240 S. State College Blvd., Brea. (714) 529-8333. Open  Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6 to 10 p.m.  $$$  </P> <P> La Vie en Rose is supposed to be fashioned after a Normandy farmhouse, but the  building is a masterpiece in kitsch; it looks like a swap-meet replica of the  Mont-St-Michel abbey. Luckily, the food is good. Spinach salad sizzles with  natural flavor. Salad perigourdine (a simple dish of mixed greens with slices  of preserved duck and a heady garlic dressing) makes a terrific lunch. Fish is  prepared with delicacy. The veal chop is wonderful. Service is flawless and  attentive. The only major drawback is the noise level, which befits, well, a  swap meet. Moderately expensive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GREEK  </P> <P> * Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; daily from 5 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> * Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 964-0016. Open  Tuesdays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 11  p.m. $20  </P> <P> Ethnic eateries in mini-malls: Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo,  creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek  specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco  norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a  cheese-sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses).  Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDIAN  </P> <P> * The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Open Tuesdays  through Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The Clay Oven is an Indian restaurant inauspiciously located in a country  shopping mall and specializing in dishes from the tandoor, the authentic oven  advertised by the restaurant's name. Fish tikka, here made with chunks of  broiled swordfish, is downright heavenly, and tandoori chicken, rubbed red with  a spice mixture and broiled until sizzling, is another winner. There is an  interesting selection of vegetable dishes as well. Wash everything down with  giant bottles of imported Indian beer and lament the fact that most of the  really exotic specialties you see displayed on the menu won't be available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDONESIAN  </P> <P> * Dewi, 1762 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (714) 637-1101. Open Tuesdays through  Saturdays from 11 a.m to 8 p.m. $  </P> <P> Hurry over -- while there is still time -- to Dewi, a small Indonesian  restaurant/grocery store hidden among commercial properties along a busy avenue  in Orange. Nasi rames is a mixed rice plate with a whole cookbook full of  Indonesian goodies, and the restaurant has fabulous barbecued chicken and hot  stewed-beef dishes. Owner Edith Vredevoogd is constantly preparing little  snacks such as lemper (a sticky rice roll filled with minced chicken) or cendol  (mysterious green bits taken with crushed ice, syrup and jackfruit). Don't  despair if you miss the restaurant, though. There is a second Dewi run by Mrs.  V's brother in Huntington Beach. Exotica at its best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ITALIAN  </P> <P> * Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open  Tuesdays through Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> This Chicago-style Italian restaurant is famous for its homemade sausage and  romantic beach view. Much of the menu, including the rich, creamy pastas, is  the same as it was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino has added  many seafood dishes, including mussels, fresh salmon and calamari. The bar is  as good a hangout as you'll find in Capo Beach.  </P> <P> * Capriccio Italiano Ristorante, Village Mall, 25380 Marguerite Parkway,  Mission Viejo. (714) 855-6866. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to  2:30 p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 4 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Capriccio may mean "whim" in Italian, but there is nothing whimsical about the  food in this restaurant; it is polished and sophisticated. For my money, it is  a real find. The kitchen is run by two brothers from Palermo, Sal and Franco  Maniaci, but there is barely a trace of Sicilian influence in the dishes they  serve. Appetizers like vitello tonnato and lumache del bosco are marvelous, and  pastas are fresh and homemade. Many main dishes have French overtones, like a  stylish lamb rack with truffles and foie gras, or a civet of hare called lepre  salmi. Cappriccio's location is modest, and so are prices, but its class is  obvious.  </P> <P> * Prego, 18420 Von Karman Ave., Irvine. (714) 553-1333. Open Mondays from 11:30  a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays to 11 p.m.; Fridays to midnight;  Saturdays from 5 p.m. to midnight; Sundays from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Prego, 4 years old, remains one of the area's most impressive Italian  restaurants. The exterior is that of a Tuscan villa; inside, it's elegant and  neoclassical. The kitchen serves mostly northern Italian fare that is all the  rage now: homemade pastas, rotisserie meats, sumptuous desserts. It's best to  stick to basics here -- wood-fired pizzas, terrific roast duck and lamb.  Service ranges from gracious to arrogant, but there are plenty of excellent  Italian wines to toss around.  </P> <P> * Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open  Mondays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays  from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. $$$  </P> <P> Service is fluid and solicitous at this smart, stunning restaurant, located in  the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is having  its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin olive  oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables and  bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello (veal chop with  fontina and prosciutto) is one reason to go back for a second look.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JAPANESE  </P> <P> * The Food Court at Yaohan Market, 665 Paularino Ave., Costa Mesa. (714)  557-6699. Most concessions open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. $$  </P> <P> If you are looking for a crash course in contempo Japanese, look no further  than Yaohan Market in Costa Mesa and its colorful Food Court. Several  concessions are in full swing here, serving a variety of Japanese lunch and  snack foods, including bento (Japanese lunch box), ramen and curry rice;  there's even a bona fide sushi bar. You also will find a bakery that serves  Japanese versions of such Western dishes as clam chowder and spaghetti -- and  many curious, puzzled customers. Good, cheap fun.  </P> <P> * Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 to 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays from  5 to 11 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an  exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into  a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of  Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful  $14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per  person, is unforgettable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEXICAN  </P> <P> * Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days a week, 11  a.m. to midnight. $$  </P> <P> Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new  restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest  adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red '80s-chic motif  complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen and a comal (a high-tech  version of a stone tortilla cooker). The restaurant smokes its own meats, and  you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila.  Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful.  </P></p>

He demanded that Iraq accede to a long-term  monitoring and inspection program before the sanctions are  lifted. Taking into account the fact the 30-state aggression on  Iraq had set out to achieve the objective of keeping Iraq from  developing an arms industry so that the Zionists maintain their  edge, we are bound to conclude that the attacks on Iraq were  stage managed in order to attack Iraq's force and prevent it  from posing any threat to Zionism.    That was the true motive behind the aggression on Iraq.  However, the war the United States launched on Iraq and the  subsequent sanctions and inspection have failed to advance the  goal Washington had in mind. The waffler Clinton's statements  may then be explained as follows:    No nation on earth will voluntarily surrender its power and  weapons that it is supposed to use as a deterrent against its  enemies. There is only one way whereby a given nation will be  forced into capitulation and disarmament, and that is total war  and occupation -- elements that were lacking in the aggression  on Iraq, because the war was technologically-based and involved  no confrontation.    Throughout history whenever Iraq came under siege, blockades  have been shown to be less than foolproof. It has also been  shown that a siege of a country that has borders with six  countries cannot possibly be one hundred percent effective.    What the present crisis boils down to is that the United  States wants Iraq to make concessions that it could not force on  it through war. The war, whose real "hero" the war criminal  George Bush fell from power, had more in common with fantasy  than reality.    In their attitude toward Iraq, the United States and the  West  find themselves in a unique, unfamiliar situation. For them,  war means their adversary's outright capitulation. Consider  Germany and Japan, among others. For the first time ever, the  West has faced a unique and special situation of its kind -- one  in which the adversary has not been browbeaten into submission.  This is despite the fact that that the adversary's forces were  forced into a withdrawal, and, by Western standards, were at a  qualitative disadvantage.    The West miscalculated. The victory claimed by the criminal  Bush merely drove Iraqi forces from the governorate of Kuwait.  However, that victory has failed to destroy the adversary's  force or subjugate it. It is an established fact that it was  the United States that brought the hostilities to a halt. It  shied away from sending its combat troops deep inside Iraq, a  substantial part of whose armed forces remained intact.    The result waffler Clinton would have liked the 1991 war to  produce was a far cry from how it actually turned out. In the  conventional terms of war and defeat, that war failed to turn  out to the waffler Clinton's satisfaction. In conventional  terms, the West is incapable of engaging in close combat,  occupying enemy territory, or scouring every inch of territory  for weapons to destroy them. The waffler Clinton and the West  are betting on the sanctions to realize their ambitions in Iraq.  We doubt that the sanctions will deliver the goods.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Dealing with a matter of trust: Norma Cohen meets the man with the task of reforming pension law PROFESSOR Roy Goode, chairman of the government's independent Pension Law Review Committee, makes little secret of the fact that he has chosen the most contentious issue in the industry - and most commercially sensitive - as his committee's central theme. 'There are rights of scheme members and there are expectations which are not necessarily rights,' he said. 'Some of those expectations are reasonable and some are not. The question is how far pension expectations need to be taken into account by trustees.' The conflict arises, he says, when employers make entitlement to benefits vague to avoid locking themselves into commitments they may not be able to afford, while employees make contributions in the belief that specific benefits will be forthcoming in all circumstances. 'We are asking whether there are some scheme rules which are capable of being exercised so unfairly that they should only be exercised with a court's permission. And are there some which should be banned altogether?' Within that framework lie matters of great commercial consequence, both for scheme members who receive benefits and for corporate sponsors who, more or less, underwrite them. 'You have to decide who owns the scheme before you can decide on whose behalf you are protecting it,' he said. Professor Goode will only smile when the commercial consequences of his report are mentioned and says he has come to the matter with no particular point of view. 'I have an open mind - but not a vacant one,' he said. However, he acknowledges that he is likely to come under considerable pressure from plan sponsors and their advisers to write a report with their commercial interests in mind. Already, the lobbying appears to have begun. Yesterday the pension fund trade association, the National Association of Pension Funds, formally offered its members expertise to help the committee, while actuarial consultants R. Watsons said it would be encouraging its clients to respond as well. The committee has its roots in the unprecedented theft of more than Pounds 400m from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. But its remit has been drawn to encompass what has emerged as the central issue in the industry - ownership. Revelations of mismanagement or misuse of surpluses have outraged pension scheme members, sometimes with reason, sometimes not. But, in all, it has created political pressure for pension fund reform as never before.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (16): Trying to connect you - when we have more lines / A look at telecommunications THE visiting executives of AT&amp;T quickly realised the task ahead of their company as they tried to telephone Warsaw from the plant the US telephone and telecommunications group recently acquired only 280 kms north east of the capital. First they had a problem getting a line to the local operator. Then there was a long delay while the call was transferred to Warsaw. Mr Jerzy Bak, the president of AT&amp;T Telfa in which AT&amp;T has acquired a 94 per cent state, relates the incident while reflecting on the improvements that have taken place in his country's antiquated telecommunications system. But while it is now possible to make such connections with much greater ease, enormous efforts are still required to drag the system up to European standards of efficiency and service. Successive post-communist governments have given improvement of the telecommunications system a high priority. A well functioning telecom system is seen as a vital building block in the establishment of a free market economy - and indispensable for the encouragement of foreign investment. Politically. improved telecommunications also represent a symbol of higher living standards for millions of Poles. Starved of foreign exchange and by-passed by the rapid changes which took place in western telecommunications during the past two decades, Poland has one of the lowest levels of telephone line ownerships in Europe, east and west. Figures supplied to the Ministry of Telecommunications by Bain and Co, the management consultants advising the government on restructuring the industry, show that at the end of 1991 there were only 7.8 lines per 100 inhabitants. The closest comparison in western Europe is Portugal, with 20 lines per 100 inhabitants. Even to achieve Portugal's level by the end of the decade Poland needs to install nearly a million lines a year. The government has concluded that the cost will be in the region of Dollars 1bn a year. At the beginning of this decade there was no digital computer technology and Poles relied on equipment which was often 30 years old. Equipment which came from the west during the past two decades was invariably outmoded. To tackle this backlog the government launched a wholesale restructuring programme for the industry which relies heavily on foreign capital and expertise. The international and inter-city telephone network will remain in the hands of the state monopoly, TPSA, and 20 local operators. But the government is in the final stage of selling off formerly state owned manufacturers of switching and transmission gear. At the time the decision was made to transform the industry, five of the 40 state-owned electronics companies dominated this area of the market. The financial position of all these groups was dire. Like much of Polish industry, domestic bank debt weighed them down and made them technically insolvent. In line with the government's sectoral approach to industrial restructuring the government decided to 'bundle' these five main producers and their associated operations into three companies and dispose of them to western groups, creating an oligopoly of foreign owned-switch and transmission makers. But the government has given no assurance on market shares, which will have to be fought for. In each case two foreign companies were encouraged to bid for the enterprises on offer. The winner was decided primarily on the full bid price and the size and type of investment, job security and other commitments offered. Mr Bak of AT and T concedes that in Telfa's case it had no financial and industrial future without an injection of foreign capital. 'We were at least 15 years behind the west and had no chance of catching up, so we didn't look for half-way measures,' he says. Bidding against Ericsson of Sweden, AT&amp;T won the right to an 80 per cent stake in Telfa for Dollars 35m. This holding was increased to 94 per cent following the sale of employees' shares to the company. The US group commited itself to invest a total of Dollars 86m on modernising the product line. An important part of AT&amp;T's product innovation will be the introduction of its standard 5ESS switching system. Another two producers, PZT and Teletra, were merged for the purpose of sale, and disposed to Alcatel of France after a competition in which Siemens and Northern Telecom took part. The two groups, with a combined workforce of 1,700, were sold for Dollars 46m with undertakings to lift the investment substantially. The third piece should fall into place next September when the outcome of the competing bids by Siemens and Northern Telecom for the combined ZWUT and Elwro enterprises is expected. The upcoming decision is creating intense speculation in industry circles. The stakes are especially high in this sell-off, because the loser will be effectively excluded from the Polish market for the foreseeable future. The merged ZWUT and Elwro will be the biggest group in terms of employees, with 4,000 on the payroll, although this staffing figure may be revised after the deal goes through. The investment commitment required will also be the largest, reflecting the importance of ZWUT. Each of the three companies which will control the industry must achieve 50 per cent local content levels, a measure insisted on by the government to ensure development of ancilliary suppliers. But the potential rewards for the foreign companies serving a domestic market of 40m people, starting from such low standards of service and equipment, are substantial. For this reason the process of transformation will be watched closely, especially by those on the political sidelines who question the wisdom of transfering such a strategically important industry to full foreign control.</p>

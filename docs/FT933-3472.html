			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Tories deny banking favours ROYAL BANK of Scotland yesterday leapt to the defence of the Conservative party after Labour sought an assurance that the bank was not giving the organisation preferential treatment over its overdraft, Alison Smith writes. Both the bank and Conservative Central Office said that the Tory party was being charged a commercial rate. The financial report in the Conservative party conference agenda, which was published yesterday, said that the revenue deficit was Pounds 18.6m, but that a small surplus was hoped for this year. There was a fall, however, in the payments that constituencies were supposed to make, and these quota payments totalled only Pounds 1.23m compared with Pounds 1.44m the previous year. Earlier yesterday Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said that substantial progress had been made in putting the party's finances on a sounder footing. Royal Bank's statement came after Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded that the bank justify or change its treatment of the Tories. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: At sea in a leaky punt Tuesday's UK rate cut has dealt an unkind blow to Ireland. With sterling weak as a result, the Irish authorities are struggling to keep the punt within the ERM. Even short term rates of 100 per cent, subsidies to exporters and an illiquid money market cannot keep speculators at bay. The punt fell through its floor against the Belgian Franc and the Dutch guilder yesterday. Assuming the prospect of further rate cuts keeps sterling weak, Ireland may soon have no option but to desert the ERM, but that need not mean a crisis which would also engulf the the French franc. The unfortunate aspect of the punt's weakness is that it coincides with a market perception that the Bundesbank is again suffering doubts over the wisdom of lower rates. Neither Germany's budget nor inflation nor wages are sufficiently under control to warrant any substantial monetary easing. A discount rate cut seems unlikely before late February or early March. So the D-Mark is strong, and the Irish problem can be seen as a trigger for strains which were already waiting to re-emerge in the ERM. The pressure could spread to Denmark whose unemployment rate has reached nearly 12 per cent. But it is difficult to over-estimate French determination to stay the course, notwithstanding the approaching election. The Bundesbank recognises as much. It has already trimmed its money market repurchase rate to take pressure off the franc and would surely be prepared to do so again. There will not, however, be much of a system left if other currencies keep dropping out. If the Bundesbank is too niggardly, Europe may enter an era not of monetary union, but of competitive devaluation and deepening economic gloom.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] As soon as the first and most important  Palestinian-Jordanian private sector company was declared,  Faysal al-Husayni proposed that a Palestinian-Arab-international  conference be held in Jerusalem to develop the holy city and to  "create Palestinian facts" [on the ground].    If PEDRA [Palestinian Economic Development and  Reconstruction  Agency] is tantamount to our national authority's public sector,  and subsequently our newborn state's public sector, then the  founding of the Palestine Development and Investment Company on  23 March [1994] lays down the cornerstone of a new private  sector so as to complete the building of a national economic  structure. This structure is to undertake the burdens and tasks  of correcting the distortions inflicted by the occupation on the  economy of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; to draft the  development strategies of the future Palestine; and to form an  important tributary of future development in the homeland. It is  hoped that the private sector will secure 60 percent of the  investment resources needed for the Palestinian development  program, whose total costs are estimated on the basis of this  year's prices at $13.4 billion, of which $11.6 billion is for  basic costs, i.e., $1.16 billion annually, plus 12 percent to  cover inflation and 10 percent added to the total as reserves in  anticipation of the possible need for investment allocations  exceeding the current estimates.    Perhaps many people recall the complications engulfing  PEDRA's formation last October and the struggle the PLO  leadership waged in connection with this agency's makeup with  the IMF and with some parties planning to grant aid to the  self-rule authorities in Gaza and Jericho. Numerous objections  were raised against PEDRA's makeup, expressing the opinion that  this makeup favored politicians at the expense of economists and  specialists. The PLO's official position was expressed in a  phrase uttered by Chairman 'Arafat who said, "I will not be  another Gorbachev." One should keep in mind, however, that some  Palestinian circles concerned responded positively to these  objections!    The Palestine Development and Investment Company, which has  received the PLO's support and backing since it emerged as an  idea nearly a year ago, is tantamount to a melting pot for  attracting and organizing Palestinian resources and capabilities  inside and outside the occupied homeland. The purpose is to  enable this company to contribute to building the edifice of our  newborn state and to motivate other Palestinian parties and  notables to emulate this company's constituent assembly, each  party in its field of specialization and according to the  formula that it deems fit.    The idea of the company was born nearly a year ago and a  constituent committee was formed for the purpose under the  chairmanship of Munib al-Misri, a well-known Palestinian  businessman. It was agreed that the company's capital would be  $200 million and that a number of Palestinian businessmen and  financial institutions inside and outside the homeland would  contribute to this capital. The constituent committee included  Munib al-Misri; Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman of the Amman  Chamber of Industry; 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman as representative of  the Arab Bank; Kamal al-Sha'ir as representative of the  Engineering House; and Kamal Hassunah and 'Awni al-Misri of the  Cairo-Amman Bank.    When the necessary preparations were completed, the  company's  constituent conference was held on 23 March [1994] at the  offices of the Amman Chamber of Industry in Amman, Jordan's  capital. The conference was attended by brother Abu-al-'Ala',  Fatah Central Committee member and head of the PLO Economic  Department, who delivered an address on behalf of Chairman Yasir  'Arafat. The conference was also attended by brother Faysal  al-Husayni, chairman of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's  steering committee; Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the Jordanian  information minister; and al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, the  Palestinian ambassador to Jordan and Fatah Central Committee  member.  <H5>  Abu-'Ala': Six Strategies </H5>   In the address he delivered on behalf of brother Abu-'Ammar,  brother Abu-al-'Ala' paused before three main pivots on occasion  of "celebration of the launching of the first and most important  Palestinian private sector establishment." These pivots are:  first, goals of development in Palestine; second, development  strategies in Palestine; and, third, investment resources  necessary for the Palestinian development program. Abu-al-'Ala'  noted that the details of this development program are available  at the PLO's Economic Department.    Regarding the first pivot, brother Abu-al-'Ala' defined the  economic and social development goals and priorities of the new  Palestinian political entity and its national authority, both of  which will lead the economy and the society to achieve the  following:    1. Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks  experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the  occupation and of its actions.    2. Expand and improve the material, economic, and social  infrastructure.    3. Create a large number of work opportunities in the fields  of production, service, and others in order to absorb the  workforce suffering from unemployment.    4. Promote export-generating sectorsm which have the  intrinsic capability of earning foreign currency (tourism, for  example).    5. Meet our people's human needs in the areas of food,  clothing, housing, education, health, and other services.    6. Gain and resettle an effective technological capability,  considering that education, teaching, and training are three  meshed priorities in the program.    7. Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to  take part in all development opportunities freely and to  participate in constructing 185,000 new housing units in order  to make up for the shortfall in the area of housing and to  absorb repatriates.    8. Seek to achieve balance and equality between men and  women  and between the various districts and social and economic groups.    As for Palestine's development strategies, they must be  selected carefully and correctly and they must include a number  of strategies that contribute to enhancing and diversifying  production. These strategies include:    The first strategy calls for efforts to:    A. Establish a rational balance between agriculture and  industry.    B. Establish a rational balance between exports and imports.    C. Make maximum use of land and water resources.    D. Strengthen the bond and the interaction between the  various sectors.    E. Select the appropriate technology for all branches of the  economy with utter care.    F. Set up the establishments, centers, and frameworks that  support the economic activity.    Second strategy: it is embodied in the maximum mobilization  of the capacities and abilities of the diaspora Palestinians to  participate seriously in the building processes. This means  attracting significant assistance in the areas of finance,  investment, and in educational, administrative, and scientific  technology.    Third strategy: it is embodied in adopting the course of  self-reliance within the context of collective (i.e., Arab)  reliance. This does not mean retreating into a shell but rather  resorting to the maximal mobilization and use of society's  capabilities on sound bases and principles.    Fourth strategy: it is embodied in taking advantage of Arab  and international aid, with controls to ensure the sound and  correct implementation of projects.    The fifth strategy calls for respecting human rights and the  citizen's right to enjoy the basic freedoms and to participate  in politics on the basis of democracy and plurality.    Sixth, and final, strategy: it calls for the full  utilization  of the traditions that motivate and promote development as a  consequence of the feeling of liberation and freedom from  occupation and of the aspiration to build a homeland.    The Palestinian official also emphasized the importance of  creating a market economy and the importance of practicing  plurality and democracy to avoid the dangers of the single  opinion and, consequently, to ensure that all society  participates in shouldering the responsibility. Abu-al-'Ala'  also noted the importance of understanding the nature of the  special laws and economic conditions in the transitional phase,  which will be governed by the Declaration of Principles. But the  conditions will be [ultimately] determined by our action, by the  way we build our institutions and systems, and by their ability  to bring about practical change on the real ground.    Munib al-Misri, the committee chairman, spoke in his address  about the company's tasks and priorities, defining six of them,  just for example. These are:    1. The company will participate in Arab-Palestinian  joint-stock companies to be founded in the Palestinian  territories to participate with the private sector  effectively--the first of which will be the Palestine Pioneers  Investment Company; to implement economic plans capable of  correcting the flaw that has hit the economic structure  throughout the past decades; and to execute a large number of  economic projects that are expected to exceed $1 billion in  value.    2. The company will aid industries that exist in Palestine  currently--especially small industries--financially,  administratively, and technically.    3. It will launch efforts to encourage the private sector to  play a a role that supports and complements the public sector so  as to contribute to building the future state.    4. It will work to improve the investment climate so as to  attract Palestinian, Arab, and international investments.    5. In designing the company's legal structure and the  structure of other domestic joint-stock subsidiaries that  emanate from it, we have taken into account expansion of the  participation base so that the largest number possible of our  kinsmen can contribute directly to the economic development  process, provided that no single individual's participation  exceeds 1-percent of the company capital. The objective is to  provide the opportunity to everybody.    6. The joint-stock Palestine Development and Investment  Company will seek to achieve balanced development that  encompasses all economic sectors, with redoubled emphasis on the  production sectors which possess favorable advantages,  especially the industry, tourism, and construction sectors. The  objective is to provide extensive work opportunities, to boost  the existing industries, to implement projects that contribute  to the transfer of technology, and to achieve high added values.</p>

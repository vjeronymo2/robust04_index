			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKBUSTING  </P> <P> You have some nerve, Mister. I happened to be at the (New Kids) concert. It was  not a waste of energy to us, them or anyone else.  </P> <P> The only waste of energy was you writing this stupid article.  </P> <P> In the part where you said we fans would scream at almost anything, even the  stagehands' pre-show adjustment and so on, that was ridiculous. We only  screamed because we knew the New Kids were coming on soon.  </P> <P> They gave it their all, and we loved it. Donnie went on stage and yelled,  "Drugs suck!" Now what singer would go on stage and say that? We were very  grateful to him (and so were many parents). We thank him. Jonathan loves to  perform, but like many people he doesn't feel comfortable around humongous  groups. Yes, Jordan is the best singer in the group. He dances great. They all  can sing. Yes, even Danny Wood. He's a great singer. Joe McIntyre by far did  the best and most entertaining job of all. We practically died each time he  came out.  </P> <P> For all I know, you probably didn't even go to the concert.  </P> <P> Donnie said, "Don't take it when people are disrespectful to you or us." So  "Shut Up!" and Donnie told me to say it.  </P> <P> BECKY SHIBLEY, Age 14 1/2  </P> <P> P.S. Yes, not all New Kids fans are 5 years old.  </P> <P> P.P.S. You just lost a subscriber to The Times  </P></p>

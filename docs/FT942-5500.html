			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Mother's crusade to expose death toll: The Tiananmen Square killings, five years on Mrs Ding Zilin grieves to this day, with an intensity that is almost palpable, the death of her son slain by the Chinese army in the Tiananmen Square protests that erupted in Beijing in the late spring and early summer of 1989. Five years after Jiang Jielan, a 17-year-old high school student, left his parent's modest apartment for the last time to join the student protests, his mother has not forgotten nor has she forgiven those responsible. This year, she and her husband are fasting for the day to mark the occasion. In the years since the death of her only child, Mrs Ding, a 57-year-old professor of aesthetics, has conducted what has been virtually a one-woman campaign to highlight the extent of the killing and to expose the perpetrators. It has been a lonely crusade for which she has paid a price. She has been banished from the Communist Party and 'retired' from her teaching job at the People's University of China. Her apartment, which features a small shrine to her son's memory, is under constant surveillance and her every move monitored by security personnel. 'The shedding of my son's blood awoke me,' she says. 'It was the loss of my son that touched my conscience as a naive Chinese intellectual. I was too passive.' If information is power in a system accomplished at restricting its spread, then Mrs Ding's campaign, which involves seeking to record details of every Tiananmen death, could be more threatening to the state than other forms of protest. Ever since the Tiananmen massacre, the most bitter controversy has swirled about exactly how many were killed on June 3-4. The government claims victims numbered between 200-300, but Mrs Ding says the figure was close to 2,600. In a letter to last year's United Nation's Conference on Human Rights, she urged that the Chinese government be asked to release lists of people killed and wounded. She also demanded that an independent body be established to conduct an investigation of each victim, and that China be obliged to provide support and compensation for the families of those who perished. And finally, she is calling for the law to be use to punish those responsible for ordering the army to crackdown on the demonstrators. There could hardly be a demand more likely to rile the authorities, since some of China's most senior figures, including top leader Deng Xiaoping, were intimately involved in the decisions which led to the army firing on student protesters.</p>

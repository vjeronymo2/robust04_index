			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and Aleksandr </F> Kharchenko]    [Text] Dushanbe, 12 Mar -- Two people were detained on  suspicion of murdering Deputy Prime Minister Mayonsho  Nazarshoyev on Thursday [11 March] evening. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent learned this today from reliable sources in the  republic's law enforcement bodies. At the same time,  [spokesmen] at the republic's Ministries of Internal Affairs and  Security would neither confirm or deny this fact, confining  themselves to saying that a search operation was underway and  any information on the subject could not be disclosed for the  time being.    At the same time, a highly-placed official from one of the  power ministries was highly skeptical of the statement  distributed to the mass media by the press center of the  republic's procuracy general yesterday on the direct involvement  in the act of terrorism of the antigovernment group of Mullo  Kasym, in hiding in Kofirnikhonskiy rayon, a Dushanbe city  suburb. This is only one of the many versions being worked on  together with the other law enforcement bodies of the republic,  he said. However, according to the source, experienced  professionals have been called in in the search operation and  one can rest assured that the real criminals will be found  shortly.</p>

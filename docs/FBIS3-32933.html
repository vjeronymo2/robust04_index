			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jorge Asencio, director of the Guatemalan Banana  Producers Association, said yesterday Guatemala is standing firm  on its proposal to find a fair solution to the banana war with  the European Union (EU), more so now that Europe has withdrawn  its December offer and that GATT reiterated its ruling in favor  of Latin America.    Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico won a  second  victory when the EU withdrew the offer it was secretly  negotiating with Colombia in December 1993 and which had  received support from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The  offer was to increase the banana import quota by 200,000 tons.    These five countries presented a new proposal this week to  the EU based on Guatemala's plan, which consists of increasing  the import quota to 3.2 million tons, out of which 2.5 million  tons would be for Latin America and 700,000 for Africa,  Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries.    The EU said initially the new Latin American proposal was  unrealistic, but in the face of the firm persistence by the  proposing countries and the surprising Costa Rican withdrawal  from another group that backed the EU proposal, the EU decided  to withdraw its December proposal.    With the EU withdrawing its proposal, the 4-04 rule becomes  effective, the EU allowed to import only 2 million tons of  bananas, which must be shared with ACP countries.    Nevertheless, GATT officially informed its 117 member  countries yesterday of the report by the experts committee  (panel), which ruled the EU import regime, in effect since July  1993, violates international trade standards.</p>

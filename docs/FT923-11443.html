			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Warning shots over EC environment rules THE same environmental standards need to be applied throughout all European Community countries to avoid creating barriers to trade, Mr Karel van Miert said last night in London in his first public speech as EC environment commissioner. That principle should include drinking water and bathing water, he added. Mr van Miert's remarks follow a recent statement by Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment secretary, that some EC environmental directives might be repealed during the UK's presidency of the EC. This prompted accusations from opposition MPs and environmental groups that water standards would be targeted. Although Mr van Miert will hold the job for only six months until the end of the current commission, his tenure will coincide with the UK presidency. His reference to trade barriers reflects concerns that some member states might impose tough environmental standards not so much to protect the environment as to keep out imports. In a speech which also showed that he has adopted some of the policies favoured by his predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, Mr van Miert said new taxes should be used alongside regulation to persuade businesses to clean up the environment. Taxes on the emission of carbon dioxide and on road haulage were particularly desirable, he said. One of the UK's priorities in the six months of its presidency should be to secure EC agreement on how to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, he said. Mr Ripa di Meana was a champion of the carbon tax, a proposal that lost some of its force with his sudden resignation last month. The EC's action should not end at its own boundaries, Mr van Miert said. 'The threat posed to our air and our water by the state of nuclear reactors in central and eastern Europe is the most striking example.' Mr Howard, who was present for Mr van Miert's speech and later took part in a debate with him, said enforcement of environmental directives would be a priority of the UK's presidency. He also reaffirmed his commitment to subsidiarity - devolving decisions back to national level. 'We are still looking closely at whether EC environmental legislation would benefit from shedding weight,' he said.</p>

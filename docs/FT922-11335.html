			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Managers of troubled casino group to quit SIX of the senior management of London Clubs, the troubled casino group, are to resign in an attempt to safeguard the future of the company's six casinos and their 2,300 staff. In a message to staff, Mr Max Kingsley, chairman and managing director, said yesterday that he and five of his senior colleagues would leave London Clubs on April 30. His brief statement said: 'Since we have each served the company for well in excess of 20 years, we leave with great reluctance and regret, but do so in the hope that our departure will prove to be in the best interests of the majority of the company's employees.' The decision follows a series of emergency meetings of the main investors, led by Standard Chartered, the lead bank. It was seen as the best way of meeting police and Gaming Board objections to renewal of the licences for London Clubs's six casinos after a raid on the main London casinos last June. London Clubs' casinos include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and the recently opened Les Ambassadeurs at the end of Park Lane. It also manages the Carlton casino in Cannes. Yesterday's announcement is likely to be regarded in the industry as a high-risk strategy because its success depends on satisfying the police and the Gaming Board, which claim that the company is 'not fit and proper' to keep its casino licences. Mr Kingsley is known to have preferred to defend the company's record in court. Departure of the top management is not an admission in any way that operation of the clubs was in breach of the gaming regulations. The licensing hearings are due to open on October 19. A group of banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, Security Pacific Merchant Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Anstalt and Mitsui Trust, financed the company's Pounds 125m buy-out from Grand Metropolitan in 1989. The banks' determination to safeguard as much of their investment as they could appears to have been the deciding factor. They stand to lose about Pounds 55m if the group's casinos were to lose their licences, which would lead to the premises being disbarred from gaming. The police and Gaming Board's objections are believed to focus on the industry's own guidelines for conduct, with only one alleged infringement of the Gaming Act, relating to credit. London Clubs has denied any wrongdoing. Another issue that is understood to have worried the Gaming Board concerns complimentary services to attract foreign players (prohibited for British punters), such as funding air fares and hotel bills. Without that practice, which London Clubs claims is perfectly proper, the company might lose 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its turnover.</p>

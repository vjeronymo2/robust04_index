			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spain Will Start Constructing Four </F> F-100 Frigates in 1996"]    [Text] Madrid -- Spain will start constructing four F-100  frigates in 1996, in accordance with the international  cooperation agreement signed in Maastricht with Germany and the  Netherlands providing for the purchase of common equipment for  these frigates.    The program envisages seeking tenders from over 30 Spanish  enterprises as possible suppliers of the most important common  equipment. This could mean a 33-percent share and a similar  cooperation in the new developments. Spanish industry will also  take part in constructing the Netherlands' and Germany's  frigates, with a consequent 100-percent technological return on  Spanish investments.    A 75-percent share in constructing the F-100 frigates and a  15-percent contribution by the Spanish industries to the German  and Netherlands projects would thereby be achieved.  <H5>  Definition Stage </H5>   The project is at the definition stage, begun in November  1993, with a cost of of 891 million pesetas. The Bazan  enterprises, the Indra Group, SAES, and the Netherlands Signaal  enterprise will take part in this stage.    The F-100's, which will be delivered to the Navy between  2001  and 2003, will replace the Baleares frigates and will have low,  medium, and high altitude antiaircraft missiles,  surface-to-surface missiles, and helicopters.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / SNP ahead in Monklands poll The Scottish National party is narrowly ahead of Labour in Monklands East, scene of the by-election to choose a successor to John Smith, according to an opinion poll published by the Scottish Daily Express yesterday. Defeat on June 30 would be a blow for Labour, but the party dismissed the poll, saying that the sample size of 401 was too small to be reliable. The poll, by Market Research Scotland, put the SNP at 42 per cent, Labour at 38.7 per cent, the Conservatives at 2.2 per cent, the Liberal Democrats at 1.2 per cent and others at 1.5 per cent.</p>

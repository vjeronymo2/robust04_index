			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Milos Solaja] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, March 21 (TANJUG) -- One member of the  army of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) was killed and two were  lightly wounded Monday in infantry and artillery attacks by the  forces of the Bosnian Moslems on the Kupres Height, an important  strategic point in the southwest of the former Yugoslav republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to the Bosnian Serbs' military sources, the Moslem  attacks on Kupres continued for the sixth day.    The same statement said the Bosnian Serb forces were forced  to return fire and repel the attack as well as re-gained some 80  percent of the territories the Moslems seized several days ago.    The fighting in the Kupres war zone was another step in the  preparations for a major Moslem offensive planned for spring  this year. The attack on the Serb positions, 15 kilometers east  of the town of Kupres, was somewhat of a surprise as the Moslem  forces were not expected to show a stronger interest in this  part of Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage of the war.    The third warring party -- the Croatians, who traditionally  deem the area of the Kupres plain their "own" zone of interest,  were expected to take a much keener interest in this part of the  R.S.    However, the Moslems too, seem to have become increasingly  aware that the Kupres pass was of strategic significance as it  opened the way via Bugojno, Gornji Vakuf, Travnik to the Sava  River, in which way the Serb territories in the former Yugoslav  republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia were being divided  in two, thereby bringing the Serbian people into a position of  dependence in the future peace talks.    Also, the Kupres plain was in the former Yugoslavia one of  the most favorable areas to execute airdrops, something which at  this time did not imply much but could be decisive in case of an  outside intervention.    The recent attack only on the Serb positions near Kupres  seems to be at this time more of a tactical than broader  significance. This would primarily entail taking possession of  positions to deploy heavy artillery which would have played a  significant role supporting attacks on Srbobran (formerly Donji  Vakuf).    Thus, the assessment that one of the attacks by the Moslem  forces, planned as part of the spring offensive, would be  directed towards Srbobran and Jajce to form a springboard for  further "unification" of the territory of the "independent,  integral and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina" was borne out.    It was indicative that the attack in the Kupres war zone  occurred at the time of signing of the Moslem-Croatian  federation pact on Bosnia and its subsequent confederation with  Croatia.    By way of an agreement with the Croats, Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic won the needed political accord to try a  breakthrough towards those areas which have thus far not been  given him in the territorial division of interests. Also, a  significant part of the Moslem forces engaged so far in fighting  with the Croatian forces was now free to fight the army of the  Bosnian Serb Republic.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MoD failed to link orders with supergun - Trade and Industry Committee SENIOR officials from the Ministry of Defence yesterday claimed that lack of communication between government departments and within the MoD itself led to a failure to link British manufacturing contracts with the Iraqi 'supergun' project. The result was that British companies supplied components for Project Babylon, an Iraqi attempt to build several giant guns, even the smallest of which, the officials said, could have hit targets throughout Iran, Kuwait, and the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. Mr Nicholas Bevan, an assistant under-secretary at the MoD, told the committee that the 'compartmentalisation' of the MoD meant that an expert who examined an Iraqi order for steel tubes from Walter Somers, the Halesowen company, and decided they had no military use did not see a report a year later warning that Iraq was attempting to build a high-velocity gun. Mr Stan Crowther (Lab) said he found it 'astonishing' that no connection had been made. At the insistence of the MoD, the official who examined the contract, Mr Bill Weir, was allowed to give evidence to the committee behind closed doors. It remains unclear, however, why Mr Weir, given his apparent links with the security services, was unaware of the Iraqi project.</p>

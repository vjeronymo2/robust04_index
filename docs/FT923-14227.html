			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Rockwell to set up Czech parts venture ROCKWELL International, the US automotive, electronics and aerospace multinational, is to set up a joint venture in Czechoslovakia to supply components to the country's rapidly developing vehicle industry. The venture is the first in eastern Europe for the Dollars 12bn-a-year turnover Rockwell group. However, it is now exploring investment potential throughout the region, and is planning a significant presence at the first international Moscow motor show this year. Volkswagen, through its equity holding and management control of Skoda, is expected to be the leading customer for the Czech venture, in which an initial Dollars 11m is being invested. However, Rockwell said yesterday it is expected that the venture will supply other vehicle makers in Czechoslovakia and export markets. The agreement, reached with the Ministry of Privatisation of the Czech Republic, provides for Rockwell to assume control and majority ownership of manufacturing facilities at Liberec, 120km north-east of Prague. The venture, to be known as Rockwell Automotive Body Systems - Liberec, initially will develop, manufacture and market window regulators, seat slides and other body components. Its products and manufacturing programmes will be integrated into Rockwell's global Automotive Body Systems division. In Europe alone, these operations employ 4,300 people at plants in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, with sales last year of Dollars 580m. Rockwell said yesterday extensive training programmes would be introduced at Liberec to bring the plant up to 'world class' manufacturing standards. The deal comes as Rockwell and other large components groups are preparing for a big expansion in the value and complexity of the vehicle body systems they supply to vehicle assemblers.</p>

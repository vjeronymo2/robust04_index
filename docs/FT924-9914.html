			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Rate cut helps lift gilts FALLING interest rates and an increasing emphasis on economic growth helped to boost UK government bond prices last month, making the gilt-edged securities market the top-performing government bond market in local currency terms in October. Gilts gained 5.59 per cent last month, and have risen by 17.27 per cent in the year to date, according to figures compiled by J. P. Morgan. The gilt market rallied on the combination of hopes of lower interest rates following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, the release of poor economic data, and the government's determination to implement a strategy for growth. The base rate was cut from 10 per cent to 9 per cent on September 22, and by a further percentage point to 8 per cent on October 16. Spain, Denmark and the Ecu were the next best performing bond markets in local currency terms, with gains of 5.12 per cent, 4.35 per cent and 4.16 per cent respectively.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By researcher Chon Hyon-jun] </F>   [Excerpt]  <H5>  Kim Il-song Death, North Korean Collapse Scenario </H5>   [Passage omitted] Up to now, the scenarios for a North  Korean  [DPRK] collapse have called for popular uprisings, a military  coup d'etat, invasion of the South, and so on, but these have  all been centered around Kim Il-song's demise. The common ground  of these assertions is that despite Kim Chong-il's lack of  ability as a supreme ruler, he became heir with the absolute  support of his father, the supreme authority. Using Kim  Chong-il's lack of ability, that is his lack of legitimacy,  doubts about his crisis-management ability, personality defects,  and so on, as the basis of their assertions, those arguing for  an early collapse of the Kim Chong-il regime in particular say  that immediately after the death of "godlike" Kim Il-song, or  within two to three years thereafter, the DPRK people and  bureaucrats will drive out Kim Chong-il because they link the  causes of their economic stagnation with the 1973 decision  within the party to make Kim Chong-il heir.    Thus, to present a counterargument to the scenarios dealing  with the collapse of the DPRK system, we must examine the  following questions. First, is the DPRK economy really in so bad  a state as to make recovery impossible, even if there were a  turnaround in circumstances? Second, does Kim Chong-il lack  authority as "Suryong [leader]," is he incompetent, and is the  support he receives from the party, government and military  bureaucracy and from the people, the ruled, voluntary or is it  forced? Third, are the general characteristics of socialism as  strong in the DPRK as they were in the former Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe or are the special characteristics of the DPRK  strong? Of course, a strict distinction must be made between  systemic and governmental change.  <H5>  North Korean Economic Crisis </H5>   Is the DPRK economy really in so bad a state as to make  recovery impossible? Proponents of a DPRK collapse due to  economic backwardness say food riots have been continuously  occurring recently due to the following: The DPRK economy  entered a gradual decline beginning in the mid 1970s. It  recorded a growth rate [as published] of 3.7 percent in 1990,  5.2 percent in 1991 and 7.5 percent in 1992, and its  factory-operation rate was only 30-40 percent. Grain production  was a mere 4.812 million tons in 1991, 1.6 million tons short of  the total demand of 6.4 million tons, and it was short 2 million  tons in 1992. The DPRK has not officially published economic  statistics, however, so is not asserting that the DPRK economy  is in the worst state possible based on estimates derived from a  "New-People's-Account [Sin Kukmin Kyejong]" computation method  excessively "our-style capitalistic" reasoning?    Experts on the DPRK economy set forth obstacles to an  accurate understanding of DPRK economic reality generally for  the following reasons: first, due to the closed nature of DPRK  society, the DPRK does not officially publish statistical data  on its economy every year; second, due to differences in  economic systems, statistical concepts and standards are  different; and third, exchange-rate problems between DPRK  currency and foreign currency are not clear. Because in the  DPRK, prices are artificially decided by the National Price  Committee, not by the principles of a market economy, the  functions and roles of currency are different from those of a  market economy and this makes objective analysis difficult. In  actuality, statistics on the DPRK GNP differ with each research  organization. The DPRK GNP estimates calculated by the  Unification Board, CIA (U.S. Central Intelligence Agency), IISS  (Institute for International Strategic Studies), and SIPRI  (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) are all  different. The figures of these research organizations differ by  as much as 200 percent. This suggests that, ultimately, theories  on the continuous negative growth of the DPRK economy may differ  according to the statistical method used. Of course, these  differences are not a basis for denying the backwardness of the  DPRK economy.    What is important, however, is that the backwardness of the  economy itself is not a sufficient condition for the collapse of  the DPRK Government. There is a deep relationship between a  change in government and economic backwardness, the degree of  corruption among the power elite, and the extent of efforts by  the bureaucracy to revive the economy. Only if the bureaucrats  live well and corruption is rampant while the DPRK people shed  their blood and sweat to surmount economic hardships, will the  people certainly revolt. We will discuss the issue of change,  therefore, by examining the corruption of the power elite and by  examining what efforts the DPRK has made to revive its economy.    To what extent are the DPRK bureaucrats really corrupt? In  1991, Kim Chong-il criticized the corruption and bureaucracy of  government officials with the statement, "Our style of socialism  centered in the masses of the people will certainly be  victorious." This was a warning concerning the easygoing  attitude, inertia, and corruption of the bureaucracy. Many  defectors give witness to the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy.    Concerning the degree and scale of that corruption, however,  they make conflicting claims. At least, they say, the corruption  of the DPRK bureaucracy is not as bad as that of the former  Soviet Union's nomenclatura or of East Europe's communist  parties. Moreover, their claims that systemic mechanisms for  preventing corruption are exhaustive are important. That is, due  to the development of a "ratification system" (a  promotion-screening system) at each level to guarantee  strictness in supplementing personnel, the development of a  mutual surveillance system of criticism and self-criticism,  consistent penalties, etc., the extent of bureaucratic  corruption is probably not "general," contrary to what has been  reported. Thus, it would be a more realistic analysis to say  that the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy is not serious  enough to give rise to a change in the system.  <H5>  North Korean Government Efforts at Economic Revival </H5>   Next, let us look at what efforts the DPRK bureaucracy has  been making to revive the economy.    In a speech given in the "Industrial Zealots Rally [Kongop  Yolsongja Taehoe]" held in 1975, Kim Il-song stressed the need  for foreign trade and economic cooperation with the West:  "...Although until now, we have generally traded with only  socialist countries, we must now do a great deal of trade with  newly independent nations and with capitalist nations as well.  Under conditions of rapid economic development and the  appearance of new economic sectors, we cannot satisfactorily  obtain what we need by depending on socialist markets alone."    Based on this "teaching," trade with the West jumped. As a  result, in the mid-1970s the percent of overall DPRK trade made  up by trade with the West increased rapidly, up from 11.1  percent in 1965 to 40.6 percent in 1975. In the 1980s, the DPRK  showed more aggressiveness in its foreign-trade policy. In the  Thirrd Session of the 7th Supreme People's Assembly held in  January 1984, by adopting a bill entitled, "On Developing Trade  by Strengthening North-South Cooperation and the Foreign Trade  Enterprise," it made a clear switchover in its external economic  policy.    After 1982, the DPRK leadership started to show interest,  for  example by visiting China's special economic zones, in the  results of the economic development achieved by China through  its publication of the 1979 "Foreign and Domestic Joint-Stock  Enterprise Law." This series of events is the background behind  the establishment of North Korea's "Joint Management Law." Its  basic strategy is to import foreign capital and advanced  technology without shouldering the burden of repaying foreign  debt and to use this in economic development. Although it is  true that, contrary to the DPRK's original intention, the  results of the Joint Management Law were slight due to  inadequate economic conditions and to political and economic  inflexibility, by establishing the "Foreigner Investment Law  [Oegugin Tuja Bop]" and other laws supplementing the Joint  Management Law between 1992 and 1993, the DPRK expressed a  continued intention toward a "misquito-net [bangchungmang]"  style of opening to foreign countries.    Since July 1989, along with its pursuit of developing  special  economic zones in Najin, Sonbong, and Nampo, DPRK announced its  "Sonbong District Trade Zone" development plan in accordance  with the Tumen River Basin Development Plan begun under the  management of the UNDP in 1991. The main gist of this plan was  to develop the area into a center of Northeast Asian economic  cooperation and transportation by expanding harbor facilities in  Chongjin, Najin, and Sonbong in the northeastern coastal region  and by building highways as well as supplementing existing  railways and roads connecting to this region in China and the  Soviet Union. Also, development of this region entailed  accepting the public investment, technological exchange, joint  management/production of neighboring countries, and attracting  partners for marine-products processing, clothing manufacturing,  electronic-product assembly factories, etc. The DPRK actively  encourages participation by South Korea also, and Deputy Prime  Minister Kim Tal-hyon even visited the ROK directly, inspecting  various industrial facilities.    We can assess that the DPRK elite have thus been doing their  best to break through the economic crisis, even if only within  the limits of what would minimize influences that might cause  the collapse of the system. Although this has not produced  results worthy of particular note due to the contradictions of  the socialistic system itself and the excessive caution of the  DPRK ruling class--that is, due to efforts to minimize the side  effects of economic liberalization, it is maintaining the  economy at a level where the DPRK people can lead at least a  minimally acceptable life. More important, however, is that  these efforts by the ruling class are acting in a purely  functional way to create in the people a sense of unity with the  state. Also, the reason DPRK economic backwardness does not lead  into dissatisfaction with the system is to be found in the fact  that the DPRK people invest more time and passion in working to  overcome poverty than in criticism about it. Not only is this  because of the DPRK people's low level of political culture, but  it is also because they show an accommodating attitude,  accepting reality as fate, which results from a loss of  opportunities for comparison due to social control.    We must not overlook the fact that the DPRK's surrounding  circumstances could be worse. Despite all obstacles, including  the nuclear-inspection issue, China continues economic aid to  the DPRK because it does not want a DPRK collapse; Russia also  gives tacit approval to unofficial economic dealings with the  DPRK; and even the U.S. exported about 250 thousand tons of  grain to the DPRK in 1993 alone, justifying it as humanitarian  aid. Also, although not an official relationship, the DPRK  continues unofficial economic exchange with Japan. Even its  trade with the ROK reached about $200 million in 1992. If the  nuclear issue is concluded satisfactorily, the DPRK will gain  improved relations with the United States and Japan, and because  economic cooperation with other countries, including the ROK,  will increase, the DPRK economy could take a turn for the  better. Thus, we must conclude that, depending on the external  environment, the DPRK economy always has potential for  improvement.  <H5>  Kim Chong-il's Policy To Make Himself "Suryong" </H5>   Next, the scenario predicting the collapse of the Kim  Chong-il regime after the death of Kim Il-song is in error in  that it attempts to distinguish between Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il. According to this position, although Kim Il-song  secured his status as "suryong" through his armed resistance to  Japan, socialist construction and "victory" in the Korean War,  Kim Chong-il has no such record and the economy actually began  to deteriorate after he came on the scene. The people,  therefore, pretend to support him while Kim Il-song is alive.  After the death of Kim Il-song--the controlling power  maintaining the system, however, the people will pull down the  Kim Chong-il regime, either immediately or within 2-3 years.    The questions here are: Is it really possible to distinguish  between Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il; and has Kim Chong-il  secured status as "suryong." The transfer of power in the DPRK  is, in a strict sense, the handing over of the mantle of  leadership as "suryong." For Kim Chong-il, it is securing this  invisible authority as suryong, rather than possessing visible  and institutionalized authority such as the position of  president or secretary general of the party, which is his  essential task. There is no office called suryong in the DPRK  system. However, the conclusion of Chuche Thought, the basic  ideology guiding DPRK, is the "theory of the suryong," and  because it is not through the offices of president or general  secretary that Kim Il-song rules, but through his "authority as  suryong," the key to a smooth succession is for Kim Chong-il to  inherit this authority.    What, then, has Kim Chong-il done to secure authority as  suryong? First, he has worked to highlight his image as a great  thinker. This is to emphasize his talent as a philosopher,  second only to Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Kim Il-song--all of  whom considered themselves philosophers. To do this, besides his  many writings on art, including A Study on Cenematographic  Art [Yonghwa Yesul Ron], he published works such as  On Chuche Thought [Chuchesasang e Taehayo] in 1982,  On Several Problems Presented By Chuche-Thought  Education [Chuche Sasang Kyoyang eso Chegidoenun Myochgaji  Munje e Taehayo] (a completion of his ideas on the social and  political organism) in 1986, Our Style of Socialism  Centered on the Masses of the People Will Certainly Be  Victorious [Inmindaejung Chungsim ui Urisik Sahoejuui nun  Pilsungbulpaeida] in 1991, The Historical Lessons of  Socialist Construction and Our Party's Overall Line  [Sahoejuui Konsol ui Yoksajok Kyohun kwa Uridang ui Chongnoson]  in 1992 and Slander of Socialism Is Impermissible  [Sahoejuui e Taehan Hwebang un Hoyongdoel Su Opda] in 1993,  supplementing the core value system of the DPRK, Chuche Thought,  at the right time. Thus, there is no harm in assessing his  ability to reinterpret Chuche Thought as "high level."    Second, he concentrated his efforts on highlighting his  image  as a statesman. By exercising "working-level leadership" of  large-scale construction sites, such as light and heavy industry  factories and "private homes [Sallim Chip]," and of  export-product exhibition halls, he worked to highlight his  image as a "construction genius." Also, by stressing the  importance of consumer products through working-level leadership  in 1984, he injected vigor into the production of consumer  products. It appears that the liberalization policy for raising  the people's standard of living presently in progress is being  carried out centered on Kim Chong-il and the elite surrounding  him. Although his liberalization efforts are probably  "selective," it appears they will continue in the future as  well. Of course, this effort to revive the economy is an  essential stage for casting off the criticism that the economy  worsened as he began to take control of the party in the early  1970s and for securing his authority as suryong.    Another important point is that the above series of policies  to make Kim Chong-il the suryong were not developed in isolation  from Kim Il-song. That is, the fact that Kim Il-song policy and  Kim Chong-il policy are not independent from each other, but are  progressing as a unity is important. Ultimately, the attempt to  divide Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, whose relationship can be  referred to as "One mouth, two heads" or "Duality in one body,"  is the product of a lack of understanding of the "the leader's  [suryong] unified system of rule."  <H5>  Kim Chong-il's Leadership Ability </H5>   With this, one thing that must be discussed is the question  of the extent of Kim Chong-il's actual political ability. Up to  the present, the assessment of Kim Chong-il's character has been  divided into two groups, positive opinions and negative  opinions. We will examine the negative opinions first.    First is criticism of his ability. According to this, he was  chosen as successor despite his total lack of personal ability,  merely because of the glory of the absolute ruler, Kim Il-song.  Almost without knowledge of areas other than art, Kim Chong-il  authorizes most papers presented by his secretaries without  correction, the claim goes. Those with this outlook assert that  because Kim Chong-il does not have his father's  crisis-management experience, the people do not trust him.    Second is the problem of his style of rule. He is criticized  for his lack of character as a leader. As a movie enthusiast, he  wastes foreign currency on importing movies and reminds people  of a capitalist bum, whiling away his time watching movies.    There is also criticism of the policy decisionmaking process  and the problem of a crippled distribution of power. That is,  because Kim Chong-il prefers a "reception-center political  style" (kitchen cabinet), rather than through the normal process  of debate, impromptu decisions are made. Because these are more  influential that normal decisions, bureaucrats unable to  participate in this group remain as a potentially dissatisfied  force, it is argued.    Third is the problem of his character. It is argued that  because he lost his mother early and grew up under a stepmother,  his character became fastidious and twisted. People began  flattering him early on, so he is insolent and behaves  arrogantly, such as by holding his arms behind is back even in  front of Kim Il-song, it is asserted.    Conversely, there are also those giving a positive  assessment  concerning these problems. First, some assert that, hidden by  the might of the political giant, Kim Il-song, he has been  unable to receive a just evaluation. The reason he is not  popular, according to this analysis, is that in being extremely  [as published] loyal to his father, Kim Chong-il refrains from  any political activity that might hurt his father's authority.    Second is a problem related to movies--after graduating from  Kim Il-song University in 1964, the first area he started  gaining experience in was propaganda and agitation. Ideological  theory was an important means of maintaining the system. Movies  were, given the cultural level at the time, the quickest and  most convenient medium capable of conveying the state's  objectives and stirring up emotion, mobilizing the masses toward  the goals fixed by it. He could not help, therefore, but  naturally become interested in this area, the argument goes. Of  course, his talent for art is actually reported to be  outstanding.    Third, an assessment of Kim Chong-il's arrogant attitude is  also different. Kim Chong-il's concern for not only the  first-generation revolutionaries, but also for the children of  dead revolutionaries is said to be out of the ordinary. For  military veterans in particular, he is said to protect their  livelihood, even promoting them; he is so polite to veteran  revolutionaries, he even goes around visiting them on New Year's  Day, offering them the traditional bow of respect and presenting  them with presents of hairdye. According to the testimony of  defected diplomat Ko Yong-hwan, when the Ministry of People's  Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u had a traffic accident and was  near death, Kim Chong-il took quick action, saving him. Through  such examples, we can see that Kim Chong-il's attitude toward  the revolutionary generation is not as haughty as is reported.    This writer's position is that Kim Chong-il may not be  greatly troubled by formality but is more concerned with  substance and may possess an open personality due his artistic  character. This writer believes that there is a high probability  that the extreme assessments of the wild extravagance of Kim  Chong-il are biased. Of course, this is not a personal  justification of Kim Chong-il himself. Despite the many  skeptical perceptions of him, given the fact that in the 30  years since 1964, Kim Chong-il has accumulated political  statesmanship and, even at present, he exercises actual,  absolute authority, it is the conclusion of this writer that he  has political ability and is likely to exercise strong authority  in the future as well. This is particularly the case since in  1993 when he declared a state of semi-war (8 March), declared  the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, and so on, and now appears  to have passed the "national-crisis-management test." Because  there is a high probability that this was an internal following  of precedent for his accession to the position of supreme ruler,  this writer believes that as long as the DPRK does not suffer a  preemptive attack by the U.S. or other countries, Kim Chong-il  will not attempt a militarily adventuristic, first strike on the  ROK.  <H3>  Party, Government, and Military Bureaucracy Support for Kim  Chong-il </H3>   What must be discussed next is the degree of support for Kim  Chong-il in the party, government, and military bureaucracies.  In a system of strong, one-man rule such as in the DPRK, having  a wide reputation is an absolute precondition for the successor  to inherit power. In this aspect, Kim Chong-il is perfect. The  proof of this is the repeated confirmation by the DPRK's supreme  ruler Kim Il-song of Kim Chong-il as his successor and his  securing of the necessary offices. Anyone who would become  supreme ruler in the DPRK, a country maintained by a triune  governing structure of party, government, and military, must  gain control of these ruling organizations. This means that, by  whatever means, he must secure the power elite as a support base.    Thus, since the 1960s Kim Il-song has in fact devoted his  energies to securing the support of the power elite, the basis  of rule, for Kim Chong-il. As a result, he was able to secure  the support of the 1.5 and second-generation revolutionaries.  The 1972 decision on Kim Chong-il as successor was possible  because he had the approval of the first-generation  revolutionaries. There are those who actually assert this. A  division of Kim Chong-il's support base is as follows: first,  Kim Il-song's partisan comrades; second, party and government  bureaucrats in their 50s and 60s who are well-trained through  foreign schooling or travel; third, graduates of Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute and Kim Il-song University; fourth,  former members of Three-Revolutions Teams; fifth, the "Korean  Socialist Workers and Youth League [Sarochong]", a party  auxiliary organization composed of youth ages 14-30; sixth,  military forces around him and numerous party organizations  within the military; and lastly, relatives and in-laws.    The Kim Chong-il power base is thus "comprehensive."  Horizontally, it includes the party, government, and military,  all three elements sustaining power. Vertically, it takes in  each sector, from the top to the very bottom. Also, not only  does Kim Chong-il's power base include people from each sector  horizontally, scholars, scientists and technicians, party  bureaucrats, soldiers, vertically, it contains the older (60s  and 70s), middle-aged (50s) and younger (30s and 40s)  generations.    In the DPRK, predominated by a party, control of the party  is  essential for securing and maintaining power. Here we can say  that control of the party signifies complete command of both the  Politburo and the Secretariat. This is because the authority of  the Secretariat is almost absolute. Article 26 of the "Korean  Workers Party Regulations" reads, "When necessary, the  Secretariat deliberates and makes decisions on problems within  the party, such as party personnel changes and pressing  problems, and organizes and guides the execution of its  decisions." In the October 1980 sixth party conference, this  party regulation was created as Kim Chong-il was appointed to  secretary so he could "grab hold" of the reins of the party,  government, and military. Afterward, he organized and reshuffled  party organizations as he saw fit. Ultimately, we can see that  the Secretariat actually surpasses the Politburo, given the fact  that the supreme ruler Kim Il-song holds the office of general  secretary and number-two man Kim Chong-il acts as agent of his  authority.    By gaining control in the Secretariat of the organs of  physical coercion, the National Defense Commission, the Social  Safety Commission, the People's Armed Forces and General Bureau  of National Security [Howi Chongguk], through the "Organization  Leadership Commission [Chojik Chido Pu]"--the key to maintaining  power, thus controlling the elite, Kim Chong-il secured the  position of actual, supreme ruler. All positions in the  Secretariat are filled with Kim Chong-il's royal-guard group of  technocrats: Kye Ung-tae, Chon Pyong-ho, Han Song-ryong, Choe  Tae-pok, Kim Chung-rin, Pak Nam-ki, So Kwan-hui, Yun Ki-pok, Kim  Yong-sun, Hwang Chang-yop, Kim Kuk-tae, and Kim Ki-nam.    Kim Chong-il has used well a policy of identification with  is  father: his father becoming absolute is his own becoming  absolute. This policy was clearly seen in his recruitment of  personnel into the power elite. Kim Chong-il politically weeded  out beforehand anyone who might be able to oppose the Kim  Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary regime by adopting a  "ratification system." Ultimately, only relatives, in-laws, and  children of revolutionaries with good backgrounds received  preferential treatment. They gained power by "carrying on the  family line." We can say that, ultimately, the power elite of  the Kim Chong-il system realized a firm, united organization  centered around the "leader [suryong]" Kim Il-song and the  "little leader [chagun suryong]" Kim Chong-il.  <H3>  The Establishment of Kim Chong-il's Leadership of the  Military </H3>   In this context, we will do a deeper analysis of the  military's attitude concerning the hereditary system and whether  it will "carry on the family line" and be loyal to Kim Chong-il  after the death of Kim Il-song. The Kim Chong-il regime will be  a period of transition. Behind the question of what attitude the  DPRK military will take during that time are questions, related  to the issue of the hereditary system, of whether the armed  forces will bring about change in the system through a coup  d'etat either before or after the death of Kim Il-song and, in  the event of trouble between pro-Kim and anti-Kim factions in  the course of Kim Chong-il's succession to power, of which side  the military will support.    As the DPRK system was being prepared for Kim Chong-il to  become heir in the early 1970s, the problem of establishing his  control of the military naturally came up. To eliminate this,  his weak point, Kim Il-song had Kim Chong-il lead the  "Three-Revolutions Team Movement" beginning in 1974. In 1973, he  expanded the "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement" to the  military, strengthening its solidarity with ground-level  elements within it. The "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement"  could not but succeed as a means of controlling the military.  Not only was it a government movement strongly supported by  Kim Il-song, but Kim Chong-il also worked passionately for its  success. The basis for this conclusion can be found in the  papers published by high-level generals every year since 1975 at  every important military function, praising the movement and  calling for strong solidarity oriented around Kim Il-song and  the party center (Kim Chong-il).    Even in the 1980s, the military continued its oath of  allegiance to the hereditary regime continuing from Kim Il-song  to Kim Chong-il. In the ceremony commemorating the 48th  anniversary of the founding of the People's Army, O Kuk-ryol  emphasized Chuche Thought, saying, "The soldiers of the People's  Armed Forces and all the people must go on, emphasizing and  fulfilling the teachings of the great leader and their  embodiment, the policies of the party." To stir up the moral of  the troops, Kim Il-song reorganized the MPAF and the National  Defense Commission in the April 1982 First Session of the  Seventh Supreme People's Assembly, taking them out from under  the Cabinet, making them directly subordinate to the Central  People's Committee. In April 1985, he promoted MPAF minister O  Chin-u from general to vice marshal and Colonel Generals O  Kuk-nyol, Paek Hak-nim, Kim Tu-nam, Yi Ul-sol, Chu To-il, Kim  Pong-yol, Kim Kwang-chin and Yi Tu-ik, eight veterans [an  honorary title], to general. In 1988, he restored Choe Kwang,  who had lost his job in 1968, making him Chief of Staff of the  People's Armed Forces and after the 1990 Ninth Supreme People's  Assembly, in December, he made him the third-ranking candidate  member of the party Politburo.    To commemorate his 50th birthday (16 February 1992), Kim  Chong-il gave special promotions to the next higher rank to  officers ranging from junior lieutenant to major, to promote  their loyalty. On 20 April 1992, he and O Chin-u were promoted  to marshal. At the same time, he promoted Choe Kwang, Yi Ul-sol,  Chu To-il, Choe In-tok, Paek Hak-nim, Yi Tu-ik, Kim Pong-nyul,  and Kim Kwang-chin, eight military veterans, to "vice marshal."  As the supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed Forces, he  issued an order on 23 April 1992 promoting his supporters: Tae  Pyong-nyol and 15 others to general, Kim Ha-kyu and 27 others to  colonel general, Kim Tae-sik and 95 others to lieutenant  general, and Yi Hyong-sop and 523 others to major general. Thus,  he firmly established his military base of support.    Later, commemorating the "40th Anniversary of Victory," on  17  July 1993, Kim Chong-il appointed, through "marshal" O Chin-u,  Choe Chun-kil and 13 other Korean War veterans to lieutenant  general and Yom Tae-kyong and 84 others to major general,  stimulating their moral. In the "Old Soldiers' Rally [Robyong  Taehoe]" held on July 23, 1993, People's Armed Forces Chief of  Staff Choe Kwang said concerning this, "Taking as our example  that conviction, that spirit with which we served the great  leader, making our bodies guns and bombs, we must defend to the  death our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, no matter what  violent gale blows," pledging to be loyal, "carrying on the  family line." It appears that, ultimately, the military  bureaucracy will continue to be loyal even after the death of  Kim Il-song as long as Kim Chong-il does not do anything  "strange," such as rapid reform, that would endanger the  preservation of the system.    What of the people's support of Kim Chong-il? Of course,  this  is very difficult to assess given the present circumstances.  However, the DPRK people generally believe there will be a  smooth transfer of power to Kim Chong-il, according to an  analysis of questionnaires given to defectors. Because the DPRK  people perceive their leaders, beginning with Kim Il-song and  Kim Chong-il, to have been born possessing special "innate"  abilities, challenge to authority and denial of Kim Il-song and  Kim Chong-il are considered forbidden, according to defector  testimony. Also, the DPRK people are believed to think of Kim  Chong-il, not as the son of Kim Il-song, but as a "comrade"  always near, listening to and solving all their problems.  Concerning "being loyal, carrying on the family line," it is  said that because they think of it as a kind of family-property  system in which a son inherits and continues father's work, they  understand it just as they do the idea that a miner's son must  become a miner and a latheman's son must become a latheman.    As we observed above, Kim Chong-il can be said to be doing  his best to raise the people's standard of living within the  limits of his authority. What is important is that the people  have no great interest in the hereditary regime itself. That is,  due to a lack of experience in voluntary participation and to  political indifference caused by their patriarchal political  culture, the people accommodate to the system. This writer  thinks wrong the conclusion that, without Kim Il-song, Kim  Chong-il will ultimately awaken the DPRK people from their myths  and that this will lead into the collapse of the DPRK regime.  <H5>  Special Characteristics of the North Korean Power Structure </H5>   Next, we will discuss special characteristics of the DPRK  power structure distinguishing it from the former Soviet Union  and Eastern Europe. The special characteristics of the DPRK  system can be organized as follows.    First, it is a long-term, father-son hereditary structure.  Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the DPRK  overcame the ideological quarrels of the early regime,  establishing a unified system of rule comparatively early. Later  on, Kim Il-song appears to have thought the only way to ensure  that his existence as father of the nation is passed on to later  generations was to see that his family was idolized and, as in a  patrimonial patriarchy, to pass on his power to his eldest son  Kim Chong-il. Of course, there were artificial attempts to  inherit power in some socialist countries also, such as the  former Soviet Union and some countries of Eastern Europe, but  these all failed. Even these were only attempts to hand over  power to an associates or subordinate, not to a son. Thus, we  can say that DPRK's father-son transfer of power by inheritance  is unique.    Due to fears of a coup d'etat and general revolution, during  their time in power, dictators arrange for the power elite to  thoroughly hold each other in check, watching and controlling  them through organs of violence. They tend not to cultivate a  number-two man while in office because they fear conspiracy. As  a result, the designation period of the number-two man is short.  Thus, the predecessor dies without giving his successor  sufficient time to strengthen a power base, resulting in his  fall from power. There are also situations in which the  designation of a successor occurs unofficially, only between  those concerned; remaining leaders refuse to acknowledge the  legality of this, resulting in his fall from power.    To prevent this, in 1972 when he was 60 and Kim Chong-il was  30, Kim Il-song unofficially designated Kim Chong-il as his  successor in the party; during the 20 years since then, he has  strengthened a firm power base for him in the party, government,  and military.    Second, it is a structure of relatives and in-laws and of  individuals holding multiple positions. One of the unique  characteristics of the Kim Il-song power structure is the fact  that most of his relatives and in-laws appear in key posts,  differing from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  Filling key positions, these relatives and in-laws of Kim  Il-song and Kim Chong-il support the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il  hereditary regime more faithfully than any other of the elite.  Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, DPRK had no  experience of freedom before communization. Thus, patrimonial  traditions remain across the whole of society, making rule by  "blood relatives [yukchinjok]" possible. Power in the DPRK is  amassed and concentrated in the hands of about 40 of the power  elite. High-ranking elite hold multiple key positions in the  party, government, military, and Supreme People's Assembly,  making for easy harmony between the party, government, and  military and raising the effectiveness of policy. From this  aspect, it is apparently difficult for factional strife due to  differences in group interest or line, or strife between  reformists and conservatives, to arise.    Strife is unlikely to arise in the DPRK for the following  reasons: First, succession of power is going to the oldest son  in accordance with patrimonial tradition. Also, because  preparation for the succession has been going on over the long  period of the last 20 years, it is unlikely that there will be a  movement to downgrade the predecessor or revolutionary change as  in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Second, because  the present power-elite structure is already firmly behind the  Kim Chong-il succession, it will be difficult for trouble to  form within the elite group even after the death of Kim Il-song.  Third, as for the pluralism which appeared in the Soviet Union  after Khrushchev's campaign to downgrade the status of Stalin,  it seems unlikely to appear in the DPRK. This is because strife  is not permitted due to a political situation permitting only  one philosophy, one system, and one line; the rest are purged.  Fourth, although in the DPRK too there have been small changes  in the character of the power elite, such as a gradual increase  in the number of specialist bureaucrats, the extent of these  changes is minuscule compared to the former Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe. Not only this, but because the ranks are filled  with "double-natured bureaucrats," based on the principle,  "party member first, specialist second," their loyalty to Kim  Il-song and Kim Chong-il is high.    Thus, although there may be developing a weak foundation  from  which trouble can form, expression of such strife as was seen in  the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is still unlikely in  the DPRK. More important is the fact that the DPRK power elite  will not stir up trouble over the regime's line even to maintain  their own positions. Given the degree of cohesion among the DPRK  power elite, spontaneous, external expression of strife related  to reform and liberalization appears improbable. Even if they  were to understand that opening up to the outside world as a  response to changes in their surrounding environment is  unavoidable, their method would be to pursue a very careful,  "mosquito-net"-style, selective liberalization.  <H5>  Looking at the Kim Chong-il Regime Rationally </H5>   Additionally, North and South Korea experienced the horrible  tragedy of fratricidal war called the Korean War. The ROK's "red  complex" and the DPRK's "Yankee complex" are greater and deeper  than can be discovered in any other divided country. In a  relatively inferior position, the DPRK's anxiety is incomparably  greater than that of the ROK. Thus, even if the "Two Kims" (Kim  Il-song, Kim Chong-il) did not exist, the next supreme ruler,  whether in an authoritarian system, a military dictatorship or  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will try to maintain  the DPRK as a nation.    Even in the worst-case scenario in which Kim Chong-il is  overthrown and an unexpected figure becomes leader, it is  possible he will call himself the successor of Kim Il-song and  do his best to maintain the DPRK as a nation, even making use of  "Kim Il-song-resurrection theories [Kim Il-song puhwal ron]" if  need be. In this context, even if the DPRK does not carry out a  first strike, in the event an extreme situation develops, such  as a bombing of the DPRK by the United States and other  countries, we cannot preclude the possibility that the DPRK will  choose to "fight to the death [okswae]" rather than abandon its  nationhood.    In conclusion, in the past, there was an era when, clinging  to the "Fake Kim Il-song Theory," even bringing up his name was  considered taboo. Yet, Kim Il-song is unshakable despite the  sudden changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  Far from falling from power due to internal rebellion, he is  actually more revered by a people enveloped in a fear of sudden  change. Thus, our "Fake-Kim-Il-song-Theory" understanding of and  policies toward the DPRK have been proven unrealistic. By  responding while overlooking Kim Il-song's ability and suitable  research on the special characteristics of the DPRK system, we  have been unable to come up with effective measures to counter  the DPRK's unification policy toward the South.    Looked at in the above context, our evaluation of Kim  Chong-il may be the same. He may not compare to the "unique"  leader, Kim Il-song, but he will manage the system in his own  way, based on the support of the people and bureaucracy  resulting from over 30 years of public life and the special  character of DPRK's suryong-centered system. It is the  conclusion of this writer that in the future, through gradual,  selective reform and liberalization, he will satisfactorily  solve the problems of economic backwardness, the DPRK's  relationship with the U.S., North-South relations, and so on.  Therefore, by excessively stressing only his irrational side,  we are only preparing measures based on the theory that the Kim  Chong-il regime will collapse soon after the death of Kim  Il-song, neglecting the preparations for gradual unification  that would be needed in the event of long-term survival by the  Kim Chong-il regime. This would be to repeat the same blunders  caused by the "Fake-Kim-Il-song Theory."</p>

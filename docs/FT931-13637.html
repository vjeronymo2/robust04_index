			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower bad debts lift TSB Scotland TSB BANK Scotland, an offshoot of the TSB group, increased its annual pre-tax profits by a little more than 3 per cent in the year to October 31 1992, in what Mr Alastair Dempster, chief executive, called 'a very difficult economic climate'. After provisions for bad and doubtful debts down from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 8.7m, pre-tax profits were Pounds 79.4m (Pounds 76.9m). Operating profit before the provisions fell slightly from Pounds 91.6m to Pounds 88.2m. The Edinburgh-based company said revenue suffered from the introduction of lower margin savings products, necessary to remain competitive. The cost-income ratio rose from 52.6 per cent to 54.5 per cent because of the decline in income, although costs were held down. Mr Dempster said that the bad debt provision was more in line with the normal level. The 1991 charge had been exceptionally high because of two large items. TSB Bank Scotland focuses on lending to individuals and is one of the top mortgage lenders in Scotland. It also does commercial lending, while new corporate lending is handled by TSB's Hill Samuel subsidiary. Total assets rose over the year from Pounds 2.85bn to Pounds 3.5bn. Mr Dempster was cautiously optimistic about prospects for the coming year.</p>

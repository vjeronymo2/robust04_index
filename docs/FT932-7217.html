			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Tesco Five months after its announcement, Tesco's foray into France through the acquisition of Catteau looks even odder. With Tesco's mainstream business still under pressure, shareholders will hardly welcome management time being diverted across the Channel. The stock market is asking some tough questions about Tesco's performance in the UK - as shown by an above-market yield. Some convincing answers would be appreciated. By itself, though, Catteau will not do much harm, even if it does go horribly wrong, since it only accounts for a minuscule proportion of Tesco's total sales. It is what comes next that provokes the worries.</p>

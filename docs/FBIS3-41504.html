The Lords is to set up the ad hoc committee in the New Year.  It will have as its remit to consider the Government's report to  the United Nations--due by the end of the year, but not now  expected to be published until mid-January--on its strategies  for making economic development environmentally sustainable.    The new Lords committee, with powers to call for evidence  from across the range of Government departments, is likely to  give a close scrutiny to ministers' plans. Several leading  members of the Upper House are keenly interested in the topic  and are expected to home in on any policy inconsistencies  between departments.    The concept of sustainable development has become a  blueprint  in recent years in international circles. The Bruntland report,  prepared by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and  Development, chaired by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gro  Harlem Bruntland, defined the concept as ``development that  meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability  of future generations to meet their own needs.''    The policy attempts to integrate concern for industrial and  economic development, particularly in the Third World, with the  need to care for the environment. It therefore links government  and intergovernmental strategies on such topics as economics,  transport, trade, energy and industry with issues such as public  health and conservation and care for the environment.    Britain agreed at last year's United Nations ``Earth  Summit''  in Rio de Janeiro to present its strategy plans by the end of  this year to the new UN Commission on Sustainable Development.  Earlier this year, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary,  published a public consultation paper on the subject, but  officials say the Government's report has been delayed by the  November Budget, when measures such as taxing domestic fuel  bills were introduced. The Government hopes that such measures  will help it meet its international treaty obligations to cut  emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to  changing the Earth's climate.    Launching his consultation document, Mr. Gummer said that  the  essence of sustainable economic growth was that ``we cannot pay  for our development out of our children's purses.'' He added:  ``Sustainable development simply means growing in ways for which  future generations will thank us. It does not mean being against  development. That would do our grandchildren no favours. It  means instead developing in such a way that we respect the  delicate balances on which our lives depend.'' [Passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Rail chief gets tough with rebel Italian engine drivers THE management of Italy's loss-making state railways, FS, has carried out a threat to deny pay increases to employees responsible for unauthorised industrial action. The threat had its desired effect of limiting the number of engine drivers who carried out a 24 hour strike over the week-end. This tough stance by Mr Lorenzo Necci, head of the FS, may mark a watershed in industrial relations in sensitive sectors such as transportation, where workers have traditionally been able to hold the public and employers to ransom. Mr Necci was brought in almost two years ago to run the FS on an emergency basis. To limit the impact of transport strikes on the public, the government has increasingly invoked new powers, introduced in July 1990, to enforce minimum services; but this is the first occasion when strikers have been penalised through the pay packet. According to the FS at least 60 per cent of the trains were able to run normally. The strike was called by a rebel drivers union which refused to accept a wage and work conditions contract negotiated for all railway employees by the three main trades union confederations. The latter have backed Mr Necci's action. The rebel train drivers want higher wage packets than those already negotiated on their behalf and fear a deal behind their backs to introduce single driver trains. Facing cuts in government funding of the railways and under pressure to raise productivity and achieve profitability, the FS management has little option but dig in its heels. The FS has accumulated debts approaching L50,000bn. (Pounds 23.25bn). Losses last year were L3,625bn despite total state transfers of over L12,000bn. The main problems faced by Mr Necci are an inflated payroll, the lowest passenger fares in Europe and uncompetitive freight business. From 209,000 employees in 1989, the number is due to fall to 168,000 this year. But management hands are tied by a mixture of government reluctance to endorse a major realignment of fares and the unresolved issue of how to tackle the railways huge accumulated debts. In addition to accumulated operating losses the FS has social security debts, mainly related to pension payments, of L30,000bn.</p>

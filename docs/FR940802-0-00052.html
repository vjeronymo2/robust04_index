			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also believes the commingling and distillation-related emission effects of today's rule to be minimal under the first few years of the program. The renewable oxygenate program does not provide incentives to increase summer ethanol, so commingling- and distillation-related nonexhaust VOC and toxics emissions from summer RFG should be unaffected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed previously, today's rule is not expected to significantly increase carbon monoxide emissions in the long term. In the short term, however, today's rule may reduce carbon monoxide emissions as refiners blend additional oxygenates during the first few years of the renewable oxygenate program (as discussed above). This increase in oxygenate content would reduce carbon monoxide emissions, and such reductions would occur during the winter months when carbon monoxide exceedances are most common.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Global Warming Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the DOE report, today's rule is unlikely to result in global warming benefits in the near term. In the longer term, however, today's rule is expected to stimulate investment in higher-efficiency renewable oxygenate production processes which could offer significant global warming benefits. Additional discussion of the potential global warming benefits of today's program is contained in section III.H of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Non-Air Quality Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is concerned about other environmental impacts of the renewables requirement such as water pollution and soil erosion. Comments were submitted to the Agency stipulating that, as a result of the renewables program, corn may be grown in place of soybeans and hay plant rotations which could result in decreased soil quality including compaction, salination, acidification, and loss of biological activity. New corn production to support increased ethanol demand in response to today's rule could also increase soil erosion and affect water quality and water flow. Corn farming was alleged to be the primary cause of agro-chemical contamination of groundwater. In addition, the increased barge shipments of ethanol resulting from this program were alleged to increase the environmental risks and clean-up costs associated with potential ethanol spills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in section III.F, EPA has concluded that the renewable oxygenate program is unlikely to have a significant impact on total corn output in the near term. The expected 490 million gallons of new ethanol demand resulting from today's rule would require an increase in corn production of only approximately 2 percent. Thus, the environmental impacts associated with increased corn production are also expected to be small. In addition, future farming efficiency improvements are expected to reduce the environmental impact of corn production. Furthermore, the commercialization of ethanol production techniques which rely on agricultural wastes or cellulosic feedstocks would eliminate the need to increase corn production to support this program. As mentioned previously, EPA expects the renewables requirement to help stimulate development and commercialization of such technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also believes that any adverse soil and water impacts from today's rule will be adequately addressed through means other than the renewable oxygenate program. Concerns related to the water impacts of ethanol production will be controlled under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. USDA has several programs in place to address soil erosion, and the Coastal Zone Act of 1990, which requires a nutrient management plan for covered areas, has helped increase farm efficiency and reduce nutrient and agrochemical runoff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

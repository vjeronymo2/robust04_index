			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GILBERT ADVANCES PAST PUGH  </P> <P> Top-seeded Brad Gilbert and third-seeded Luiz Mattar advanced to the  quarterfinals of the $200,000 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships Wednesday at  Charleston, S.C.  </P> <P> Gilbert defeated Jim Pugh, 6-3, 6-3, after Mattar beat Alex Antonitsch, 6-3,  6-7 (8-6), 6-4, in a match that lasted nearly 2 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Michael Chang defeated Diego Perez of Spain, 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Gilbert, using a strong serve and forehand, dominated Pugh, ranked 69th in the  world. Gilbert, ranked 16th, won the first set after disputing a fault call on  his serve that was changed by the line umpire.  </P> <P> Gilbert broke Pugh at 15-15 to open the second set, then earned a second break  to win the match with a backhand down the line.  </P> <P> Two-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker of West Germany defeated Javier  Sanchez of Spain, 6-1, 6-3, to advance to the third round of the $692,000  German Open tournament at Hamburg, West Germany.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Ivan Lendl also advanced by beating Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet  Union, 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> "I had expected a tough match," Lendl said. "You can't get used to clay in just  one game."  </P> <P> Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, blasting heavy top-spin shots with precision,  opened defense of the Italian Open title with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Laura  Golarsa of Italy at Rome.  </P> <P> Sabatini, of Argentina, ranked No. 3 in the world, settled down after a slow  start and overpowered the 81st-ranked Golarsa in about an hour.  </P> <P> "I played really well," Sabatini said. "I moved really well and I had very good  concentration."  </P> <P> Golarsa, who has never won a pro tournament, said:  </P> <P> "It's useless to look for a miracle."  </P> <P> In other second-round matches involving seeded players, No. 9 Terry Phelps  defeated Kathy Caversazio of Italy, 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> No. 10 Bettina Fulco of Argentina defeated qualifier Celine Cohen of  Switzerland, 6-4, 6-2; No. 12 Isabelle Demongeot swept Marzia Grossi of Italy,  6-4, 6-1; No. 13 Barbara Paulus of Austria beat Amanda Coetzer of South Africa,  6-2, 6-4, and No. 14 Nathalie Tauziat of France rallied to defeat Elna Reinach  of South Africa, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden defeated Finland's Veli Paloheimo, 2-6, 6-4,  6-2, in a $160,000 men's tournament at Ede, the Netherlands, and advanced to  the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Also in the second-round, Argentina's Horacio de la Pena beat seventh-seeded  Australian Mark Woodforde, 6-1, 6-4; Jose Luis Clerc of Argentina ousted  fifth-seeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-1, 6-2; sixth-seeded Anders Jarryd of  Sweden eliminated Michiel Schapers of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-2; and  eighth-seeded Derrick Rostagno of Czechoslovakia beat New Zealand's Kelly  Evernden, 6-0, 4-6, 6-4.  </P> <P> Yannick Noah of France has pulled out of next week's $1-million Italian Open  because of a foot injury, organizers said in Rome.  </P> <P> Noah, whose aggressive go-for-broke style made him a crowd favorite at the Foro  Italico, won the Italian Open in 1985.  </P> <P> Noah's replacement was named in the 64-player field.  </P></p>

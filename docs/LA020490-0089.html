			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DIAGNOSIS OF THE CURIES;  </P> <P> GRAND OBSESSION MADAME MARIE CURIE AND HER WORLD BY ROSALYND PFLAUM (DOUBLEDAY:  $22.50; 496 PP, ILLUSTRATED  </P> <P> Rosalynd Pflaum's "Grand Obsession: Marie Curie and Her World" is a series of  overlapping biographies of Marie and Pierre Curie, their daughter, Irene, and  her husband, Frederic Joliot-Curie. All Nobel Laureates, they dominated the  field of radioactivity in France during the first half of this century.  </P> <P> Feminists will be disappointed. Despite the lip-service Pflaum pays to the  slights and institutional obstacles that being female visited upon the distaff  Curies, she writes about scientists who happened to be women, rather than women  scientists. Moreover, she describes both Marie and Irene Curie in the contexts  of their marriages. She does not even elaborate on the matter of nomenclature  -- the apparently painless transformation of Manya Sklodowska, a fervent Polish  nationalist -- to Marie Curie when she married the French chemist. In contrast,  a generation later, Frederic Joliot, enamored of his wife's lineage, went the  extra mile to hyphenate her name with his, becoming Joliot-Curie.  </P> <P> Pflaum has set herself a difficult task in this thoroughly researched book. She  presents four separate biographies, explains the lives of her subjects in the  context of the science as well as the social history of their times, and  addresses earlier biographers and critics in an effort to set the record  straight. The result is uneven, a book rich in detail, scientifically literate  but occasionally naive.  </P> <P> Pflaum focuses on issues that dominated contemporary headlines, including the  alleged affair between Marie Curie and her colleague Paul Langevin in 1911 and,  a generation later, on the turmoil over Frederic Joliot-Curie's activities  during the German occupation (when he had the opportunity to escape France and  refused to leave). Pflaum reflects on these issues, recapitulates the old  gossip as well as the evidence, but sheds little new light.  </P> <P> She is at her best in her cameo portrait of Dr. Eugene Curie, Pierre's  free-thinking father, who lived with them and who remained, after Pierre's  horrific death beneath the wheels of a wagon on the rue Dauphine, to care for  their small daughters. Later, Pflaum presents a vivid picture of the World War  I front to which Marie, with her then-teen-aged daughter Irene at her side, had  lugged her X-ray machine to help treat the wounded.  </P> <P> Pflaum follows the early years of nuclear research in the makeshift laboratory  where Marie single-mindedly and patiently separated a few grams of radium out  of the literally tons of pitchblende she had had dumped in the yard outside.  Never, it seems, did the Curies seriously question the wisdom of working with  radioactive materials, not even after each of them in turn showed symptoms of  extreme fatigue and unhealing sores that signal disease.  </P> <P> The Curies believed that the discovery of radioactivity would enhance human  life, and in its early years, X-rays did seem only a boon to medicine;  radiation therapy had not yet revealed a dark side. A generation later, with  the explosions over Japan, Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie felt betrayed by  their American colleagues. To them, science was unequivocally a force for good,  and they did not seem to comprehend how their work could be interpreted as an  evil genie released to wreak universal havoc.  </P> <P> Pflaum captures the international spirit of science in a world before people  needed passports to travel and Nobel Prizes, still new, were accepted in the  spirit of pacifism. The Curies, not alone, believed in "pure" science. Their  ambitions took the form of a desire for recognition, for professorships,  appointments, and financial subvention of their research. But they did not seek  patents or the creation of personal fortunes. Even their Nobel money, never  inconsequential, was spent on their work, or on domestic assistance so that  they could work even harder.  </P> <P> Pflaum projects mixed feelings about her subjects. In one paragraph, she  admires Marie: "An amazing, brilliant woman, whose doggedness and stubbornness  had overcome immense hardships." Then she adds, gratuitously, "But she was  never the genius Pierre was."  </P> <P> Brilliant but not a genius? How does one measure the difference? Perhaps Pflaum  is registering distaste for the woman she portrays as monomaniacal and  humorless, whose children were saved from neglect only by their good fortune in  having a benevolent grandfather. Yet both daughters seem to have matured into  productive women with deep affection for their mother.  </P> <P> Biographers do not have to like their subjects, but Pflaum wavers between  making judgments and making excuses for hers. Discussing the Langevin affair,  she feels obliged to remind the reader that Marie was only 39 when she was  widowed, and had a healthy interest in men. When documenting Marie's arranging  for Irene to get a position at the Curie Institute, Pflaum dismisses the  irregularity, writing that "Scientists are not saints." Few of us think they  are.  </P> <P> Referring to Frederic's actions during the Nazi occupation when he worked with  German scientists in his laboratory by day and, a Communist, fought with the  Resistance by night, she asserts, "But those who never lived in an occupied  country cannot, especially in retrospect, pass judgment on those who have."  This is a peculiar statement on two accounts: She does not make any sort of  case for Joliot-Curie's culpability, and if there was one, surely historians as  well as all people of good will have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to  judge human behavior in difficult times.  </P> <P> With the Curies now gone, it is a good time to review the special role they  played in the creation of a nuclear-shadowed world. Pflaum presents a generous  portrait that they probably would have accepted as fair.  </P> <P> I suspect that they would have objected, however, to the jacket copy, which  says that the family won three Nobel Prizes in two generations. The number is  five. Individuals who share the award do not receive half a prize, even when  they happen to be married to each other.  </P> <P>  Kevles is author of "The Females of the Species" (Harvard University Press).  </P> <P> </P></p>

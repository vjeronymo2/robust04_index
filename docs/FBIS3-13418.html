The peace  process cosponsors -- Russia and the United States -- will do  well to coordinate their positions, Mr. Rabin told Andrey  Kozyrev.    He reiterated the Israeli stand that there is no point in  reopening signed agreements, and that the PLO should return at  once to the negotiations with Israel. Our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz notes that the visiting statesman  called on Israel to make a move that will persuade 'Arafat.    The meeting, which was held in the prime minister's Tel Aviv  office, was also attended by Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of  the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, and Shim'on Sheves,  director general of the Prime Minister's Office.

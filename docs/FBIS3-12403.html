			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, March 1 (AFP)--The PLO leadership decided  late Monday [28 February] not to resume talks with Israel until  it gets security guarantees for Palestinians, an authoritative  source here said, amid reports of "hopeful signs" from the  United Nations.    Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation  Organisation's executive committee, emerged from the committee's  second meeting here in two days to say that there would be no  resumption of talks until there were guarantees of security and  "international protection" for the Palestinians.    The decision casts doubt on the invitation by US President  Bill Clinton to both sides to begin accelerated talks in  Washington on Wednesday to speed up the peace process. Israel  has accepted Clinton's initiative.    Monday's session, under the chairmanship of PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat, lasted two and a half hours, but was adjourned until  later Tuesday to await the outcome of a United Nations Security  Council debate on the massacre, Ghawshah said.    That debate, held over from Saturday amid sharp disagreement  between the PLO and the United States, was due to have begun  around 0100 GMT Tuesday (8:00 p.m. Monday in New York).    Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations,  said in New York that negotiations prior to the debate were  "going well."    The current Security Council chairman, Roble Olhaye of  Djibouti, said the delegations had "accomplished a lot" and that  there were "hopeful signs for a resolution."    The PLO's representative at the United Nations, Nasir  al-Qidwah, said he might well address the council, and that the  Americans would not stand in his way, as they often did.    Talks in the Council snagged Saturday on Washington's  opposition to PLO demands that the UN send an international  peacekeeping force to the occupied territories, a move rejected  by Israel.    PLO leaders have also slammed as "inadequate" Israeli  pledges  to disarm the most extreme of the Jewish settlers in the  occupied territories, in the wake of Friday's massacre of 52  Muslim worshippers in the West Bank town of Hebron.    They want all settlers disarmed, an unreasonable demand in  the eyes of the Israelis, who point to continuing attacks on  settlers by Muslim extremists.    Israeli premier Yitzhaq Rabin announced in Jerusalem on  Monday that Israel would accept the deployment of an  international civilian force in the occupied territories.    "We would accept the stationing of an international presence  in Gaza and Jericho, but it should not consist of military  forces and should comply with the Oslo Declaration of  Principles" on Palestinian self-rule signed last September,  Rabin told representatives of American Jewish organisations.    But another PLO executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq told  AFP after Monday's session that Rabin's offer was "derisory".    The PLO's mainstream Fatah movement announced Monday that it  had ended the ceasefire it declared to celebrate the historic  September 13 accord with Israel on limited Palestinian autonomy  in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.    Shortly afterwards its Fatah Falcons guerrillas claimed  responsibility for the murder of an 80-year-old Israeli who was  hacked to death with an axe at Kfar Saba north of Tel Aviv.    Fatah supporters paraded in the Dayr Balah refugee camp in  the Gaza Strip on Monday evening to claim the murder as an act  of revenge.    Ghawshah also said the PLO leadership had resolved to  increase its diplomatic activity to win worldwide backing for  its demands, by making representations to the Arab nations, the  non-aligned movement, the Russians, the Americans and the  Europeans.    Three Arab delegations pulled out of talks with Israel in  Washington on Sunday in protest at the massacre, after PLO  leader Yasir 'Arafat criticised the Israeli army for failing to  stop US-born doctor Barukh Goldstein emptying three and a half  clips from his Galil automatic rifle into the worshippers.    And the Arab League council in Cairo on Sunday framed an  uncompromising resolution blaming Israel for the attack.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a meeting of the Democratic Party [PD] Steering  Collegium, Chairman Petre Roman outlined the party's position  regarding the current political issues.    In his speech, Roman said that the only way to solve the  current crisis situation is to conclude a national pact among  the PD, the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR], and the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].    The PD chairman also briefed the meeting's attendants about  the PD's [separate] negotiations that are currently under way  with the CDR and the PDSR and presented the party's stance  regarding the [6 March] government reshuffle and the possibility  of early elections. Referring to the latter issue, Roman said  that in the PD's view, early elections would lead to a disaster,  since the electorate, which was betrayed during the last  electoral campaign, has lost confidence in everyone and  everything.</p>

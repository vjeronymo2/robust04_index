			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: BCH to take full control of Banco de Fomento BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish bank, is to acquire full ownership of Banco de Fomento in which it has a 66 per cent shareholding, with a view to disposing of the subsidiary bank's 165-branch network, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. BCH, which will be employing equity from its own treasury stock for the takeover, will be offering one of its shares for every two of Fomento in an acquisition representing Pta10.3bn (Dollars 82m). Brokers recommended the bid, noting that BCH paid a dividend of Pta210 per share last year, against Fomento's Pta90 per share payout. BCH said that following the takeover it would put aside Fomento's cash flow, which stood at Pta5.9bn last year, for pension funds and reserves. In 1992 Fomento's coverage of non-performing loans stood at 70.5 per cent, down from 84.4 per cent the year before. Analysts saw BCH's decision to strengthen Fomento's balance sheet as heralding a disposal of the bank network.</p>

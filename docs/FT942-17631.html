			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Sports clubs win big VAT rebate Sports clubs will be entitled to rebates of as much as Pounds 40m because the government yesterday amended value added tax regulations to bring them into line with European Union guidelines, Robert Corzine writes. The new regulations mean that playing members' subscriptions to non-profit sports clubs will no longer attract VAT. The ruling is retrospective to 1990, so the government will have to reimburse the clubs for the more than Pounds 40m they have paid in VAT on such subscriptions during the past four years. VAT will continue to be levied on social memberships to sports clubs.</p>

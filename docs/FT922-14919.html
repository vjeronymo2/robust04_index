			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Honest man - Ballot Box The chairman of one ward Conservative association in north-west England said yesterday: 'Our whole strategy now is just to get our vote out. We are not trying to convert anyone. Any change we are discovering on the doorstep is the other way - to the Liberal Democrats or Labour. The game is being played in our half, not theirs. 'Defence is now our only option. We are very disappointed with the performance of Central Office. Lamont has been a disaster and Heseltine under-used or wasted. 'Hurd seems to have played little role, despite the wide respect he commands. And I'm afraid John Major looks far too much like a civil servant.'</p>

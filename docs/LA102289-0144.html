			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. DRE JOINS AN ILLUSTRIOUS PACK;  </P> <P> IN THE LAST YEAR, PRODUCER HAS HIT WITH ALBUMS FOR N.W.A, EAZY-E, J. J. FAD AND  THE D.O.C.  </P> <P> "Calling Dr. Dre.... Calling Dr. Dre.... Calling Dr. Dre," the young record  producer known as Dr. Dre droned mockingly as he sat in a Westside deli one  recent morning.  </P> <P> Dre, wearing a Raiders cap, jacket and warm-up pants, was hoping to dig into  his hefty ham-and-cheese omelet, but his pager kept going off, signaling  another call -- probably one more record executive trying to get in touch with  this suddenly hot producer.  </P> <P> In the last year, Dr. Dre (real name: Andre Young) has produced hit albums for  N.W.A, Eazy-E, J.J. Fad and the D.O.C., and there's nothing like success in the  record business to get the phone ringing.  </P> <P> Traditionally, a producer in black music has been considered as crucial to the  success of a record as a songwriter is in country music. The list of celebrated  producers ranges from Bumps Blackwell and Sam Phillips to Phil Spector to  Motown's Holland-Dozier-Holland and Philadelphia International's Gamble &amp;  Huff to the omnipotent Quincy Jones to Richard Perry and Willie Mitchell to  such contemporary hotshots as Prince, Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis,  L.A. &amp; Babyface and Matt Dike and Mike Ross.  </P> <P> Just joining the pack: Dr. Dre.  </P> <P> That's why his beeper keeps beeping -- even at the breakfast table.  </P> <P> Dr. Dre picked up a portable phone and snapped, "Yo! Make it quick."  </P> <P> After the conversation, he put down the phone and returned to his omelet.  </P> <P> "Where were we?" he asked.  </P> <P> Before the phone call, Dr. Dre, who's also a composer and a member of the  controversial rap group N.W.A, had begun to explain how he helps create all  those hits.  </P> <P> From his quizzical frowning, you'd have thought he'd been asked a question  about nuclear physics.  </P> <P> "I don't know what I do, I just do it," he said. "I don't know how to explain  it, because I learned how to be a producer myself through trial and error. It's  instinct. It's feel. It's knowing what's happening on the street. It's judgment  -- what I think will work and what won't. A lot of it is very spontaneous. A  lot of D.O.C.'s album was done on the spot in the studio."  </P> <P> What's his biggest asset as a producer?  </P> <P> "My ear," he replied. "I have a good ear for what's authentic, for what people  will like. For street rap, it has to sound real, like the kids were overhearing  somebody talk on the street. A lot of rap is phony -- talking about stuff  people don't care about and talking about it in a way that doesn't sound real.  Our stuff is hip because it's real. The fans can tell right away."  </P> <P> Along with Dike and Ross, the team behind Tone Loc, Dr. Dre, 24, is one of the  reasons Los Angeles rap has hit the mainstream in a big way this year.  </P> <P> Unlike the stereotypical rapper, Dr. Dre doesn't come across as an egomaniac.  During the interview, he was fairly aloof and serious -- a bit nervous, in  fact, at least initially. Doing interviews clearly isn't one of his favorite  activities.  </P> <P> Dr. Dre works for Ruthless Records, a record label and production company  founded by Eazy-E, who grew up with him in Compton. He calls it one big happy  musical family, with Dr. Dre, the D.O.C, Ice Cube and the various artists  writing for all the albums, and with Dr. Dre guiding the productions, with  assistance from D. J. Yella.  </P> <P> Contrary to popular belief, Eazy-E isn't the company's primary creative force,  though he's listed as executive producer on the albums.  </P> <P> "I'm the main creative force in the company," Dr. Dre insisted  matter-of-factly. "Eazy is business-oriented. He knows street rap, but not the  pop side of things. He doesn't have the final say in terms of production; I do.  He's the business man, but I'm the music man, the production man."  </P> <P> "Versatility is my middle name," Dr. Dre said -- one of the few times he blew  his own horn. It's not a idle boast. There is remarkable diversity in his  productions. Those electric, hip-hop rhythms -- the sound of the street,  according to Dre -- are a common denominator in his four hit albums. But  they're all different, covering the rap spectrum.  </P> <P> N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" is a dark, explosive album full of anger and  rage about ghetto life. Its most famous song is "---- Tha Police," which  includes such savage, anti-law-enforcement commentary that it inspired an FBI  representative to write a letter of complaint to Priority Records, which  distributes Ruthless.  </P> <P> "N.W.A is nasty and hard-core," Dr. Dre said. "N.W.A is about what the kids in  Compton are feeling. That's how they feel about the cops. That's why they can  relate to that song. We didn't make this stuff up. It's right there. Get any  kid out of Compton and put a mike in his hand and tell him to rap. What you'll  get is the same kind of stuff as on the N.W.A album. The next N.W.A album is  going to be even more hard-core."  </P> <P> At the other end of the spectrum is J.J. Fad, the female trio that offers  clean-cut raps about romance. Eazy-E's album is what Dr. Dre calls street  funny, mostly ribald and good-natured. "Eazy tells funny stories and makes you  laugh," Dr. Dre said.  </P> <P> The D.O.C.'s album is also clean-cut rap -- but with a hard edge. "There's  strong, street beats and strong delivery, but no profanity," Dr. Dre said. "We  tried to put a hard-core song on it, but Atlantic Records (which distributes  the album) took it off. This song could have been on an N.W.A album but  Atlantic didn't want anything like that for the D.O.C. album."  </P> <P> The D.O.C. is a 21-year-old rapper that Dr. Dre discovered in Texas. "I liked  the fact that he has a tight delivery and a strong voice," Dr. Dre said. "He's  also a fast writer. He was raw, but I was sure he could be shaped into a good  rapper."  </P> <P> Dr. Dre's next album, due out soon, features R&amp;B singer Michel'le -- who  doesn't rap. "I wanted to try something a little different," he explained. "Her  album has a rap feel. The songs have rap music tracks -- the kind you'd hear on  a rap album -- but Michel'le is doing vocals, not rap. A lot of radio stations  won't play rap but would play a song with vocals that has a rap feel."  </P> <P> You'd think a producer who's had such great pop success -- mainly with J.J. Fad  and the D.O.C -- would be gearing songs to radio when he's at work in the  studio.  </P> <P> "I don't care about radio," he said. "When I'm working on records, I don't try  to make anything for radio. What radio does is makes records sell faster. Rap  can sell without radio. Look at N.W.A. That album sold without radio airplay."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, he's not big on sampling either. Sampling -- using snippets of  old records as musical building blocks -- is the backbone of rap. Dr. Dre,  though, is critical of this practice.  </P> <P> "You can't sample like you used to," he pointed out. "The problem is the  popularity of CDs. When you use parts of those old records, you get a lot of  hiss. Now that CDs are so popular, you need a clean sound. The thing to do is  to not use the originals but to re-record what you want to use so you'll have  good sound and no hiss.  </P> <P> "But I've been trying to get away from sampling. I won't do it unless I have  to. There are other ways."  </P> <P> Dr. Dre spent most of his life in the ghettos of Compton and Paramount. "I'm  from the streets," he said. "That's important. I know what street rap sounds  like. I've lived it. I stay in touch with it."  </P> <P> But with all that money he's making, these days Dr. Dre can afford to sample  street life only when he has to. He's graduated from the ghetto -- having moved  to to Westlake. After breakfast, he had to rush home because some new furniture  was being delivered.  </P> <P> "After all those years I like being somewhere where I don't have to worry about  walking outside and getting shot," he said. "I can leave the key under the mat  in the place in Westlake. If you do that where I used to live, it's an  invitation to be ripped off."  </P> <P> A recent theft was, for him, unofficial affirmation of his decision to move.  While being driven by Michel'le, an R&amp;B singer whose album he just  produced, his Mercedes was stolen at gunpoint in Inglewood.  </P> <P> "I've had enough of that kind of stuff," he said. "Living in these dangerous  places gets to you. You have to get out to keep your sanity. The peaceful life  is nice."  </P> <P> But, while he was living in those dangerous places, Dr. Dre acquired the source  material for the rap records that have turned him into a prominent  record-industry figure. Working as a deejay in Compton clubs in the mid-'80s,  Dr. Dre -- who has no musical training and, he admitted, can't even carry a  tune -- developed an interest in producing.  </P> <P> "Me and D.J. Yella would copy other people's records and make the changes we  wanted to make," he recalled. "We set up a demo studio in back of this one club  and worked on demos all week. Then we'd play them on the weekends at the clubs.  I knew how I wanted those records to sound. Then I decided I wanted to produce  my own records."  </P> <P> That's where his old buddy Eazy-E came in. Dr. Dre approached Eazy-E, who has  said that he financed his company with proceeds from his drug dealing, to  invest in a group called HBO. That deal fizzled because the group balked at  doing a song that later became the first single for Eazy. That single,  "Boyz-N-the-Hood," and N.W.A's "Dopeman" single, launched Dr. Dre's career as a  producer in late 1986. By early this year, those artists had hit albums,  produced by Dr. Dre.  </P> <P> Dr. Dre is a rapper too, working with N.W.A. He's quite modest about his  rapping skills -- though he's very effective on "Express Yourself," a cut on  the N.W.A album.  </P> <P> "I'm not a great rapper," he said. "I'm not as good as D.O.C. or Cube. I know  what it should sound like, but I can't quite do it myself as well as I'd like  to. As a producer I know what it's supposed to sound like -- and my raps aren't  quite strong enough. That's why my future is in producing and writing -- not  rapping."  </P></p>

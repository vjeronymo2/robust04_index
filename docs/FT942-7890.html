			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Portugal's spy chief quits in row The head of Portugal's main intelligence service, the SIS, resigned after it emerged his agents illegally reported on politicians and investigated corruption on the island of Madeira, the government said yesterday. The interior minister, Mr Manuel Dias Loureiro, also said that the head of SIS operations in the autonomous island off the coast of Morocco had also been sacked. Mr Dias Loureiro told a news conference that an inquiry by a parliamentary commission showed the SIS in Madeira had become involved in activities beyond its charter. Mr Dias Loureiro said the head of SIS, Mr Ramiro Ladeiro Monteiro, had resigned in the light of these findings, even though he was not directly responsible for the illegal activities in Madeira. Mr Joao Evangilista, the head of SIS operations in Madeira, had been sacked, he added. Portugal has been swept by rumours of spying since police found a hidden microphone in the office of Mr Jose Cunha Rodrigues, the chief state prosecutor in Lisbon. Mr Dias Loureiro said police were still investigating that incident.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Police pay likely to rise by up to 4.4% Britain's uniformed police are likely to secure a pay rise this year of as much as 4.4 per cent despite the government's three-year freeze on public sector pay bills which starts this spring. The proposed increases are being budgeted for by the government. Talks have been held between local authority employers and government officials, although final approval for the exact size of the increases rests with Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. The size of the likely police pay rise is well above the inflation rate and will be bound to infuriate public sector unions, which have rejected the government's public sector pay freeze strategy announced last month by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, in his first unified Budget. The actual pay increases police can expect will be based on data from the government's Office of Manpower Economics. The recommendations will be presented to Mr Howard by the independent Police Negotiating Board for implementation in September. Local authority employers have already been told that their budget allocation for the next financial year is based on an assumption that they will have to meet wage rises of at least 4 per cent for the uniformed ranks and around 3 per cent for the rest of the staff in the police service. The wage increases are to be funded from the overall government budget allocation for the police. That will rise from Pounds 5.5bn in the present financial year to Pounds 5.8bn in the next. At the same time, many councils are concerned that they will be unable to make enough savings to meet the 2.4 per cent pay rise expected by teachers in April.</p>

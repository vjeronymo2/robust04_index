			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL SHOCK COULD DRAIN WORLD BANK, CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> In a new indication of the escalating economic fallout from the Persian Gulf  turmoil, the head of the World Bank said today that he may be forced to call  upon rich nations to boost their support for the international lending  institution by early next year.  </P> <P> World Bank President Barber Conable said that if oil prices remain at current  high levels over the next three months, his institution would not have enough  in existing resources to cushion the shock on the world economy.  </P> <P> Conable's comments represented a change from his position just a few days ago.  At that time, he and officials of the the International Monetary Fund insisted  that they could handle the economic impact of the gulf crisis with available  resources.  </P> <P> However, as delegates from 154 member countries of the two institutions were  holding their annual meeting this week, the price of oil jumped at one point to  close to $40.  </P> <P> Conable told reporters today that if oil prices stayed at high levels into  1991, he believed it would be necessary to ask for voluntary contributions from  major industrial countries and oil-producing nations. That money would be used  to make no-interest loans to countries especially hard hit by the rise in oil  prices and other economic fallouts from the gulf turmoil.  </P> <P> Other officials of the World Bank suggested that the proposed new lending  facility would be available to work with the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination  Group, the steering committee of donor countries unveiled by President Bush in  his speech to the IMF-World Bank opening session on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officials said that donations raised by the crisis group, which is headed by  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, might be funneled to this new lending  facility for distribution to needy countries.  </P></p>

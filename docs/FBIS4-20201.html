			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative on Cyprus, arrived in Cyprus from Turkey this  afternoon and will meet [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas at  1800 this afternoon.    Speaking at Larnaca Airport on his arrival, Clark avoided  announcing the Turkish stance on the 21 March document on ways  of implementing the confidence-building measures. Replying to a  series of questions from CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  on the issue, Clark said that he did not expect Turkish  authorities to explain their recent statements that they perhaps  intended for someone else. He said he had the opportunity to  deal with some wrong impressions that exist in Turkey, one of  which is that there are two documents. There are not two  documents but one and we will discuss ways to implement it.  Clark also noted that the decision to accept or reject [the  document] should be made by the two communities based on actual  events. He also said that he will not present a new set of  proposals. Asked about the purpose of his meeting tomorrow with  President Glavkos Kliridhis, who has accepted the document,  Clark answered that he will discuss ways of implementing the set  of proposals that Kliridhis and Denktas have accepted in  principle. Furthermore, Clark said that he would be surprised  if a new extension is given for an answer from the Turkish side.</p>

Specifically, the Agency is proposing to amend &sect;266.20 so that non-encapsulated uses of slag residues produced from high temperature metal recovery (HTMR) treatment of electric arc furnace dust (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061), steel finishing pickle liquor (K062), and electroplating sludges (F006) are not exempt from RCRA Subtitle C regulations. This action is being taken to partially implement a settlement agreement entered into by the Agency on August 13, 1993 with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC). If today's proposed rule is finalized, non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived from K061, K062, and F006, as waste-derived products placed on the land, will be prohibited unless there is compliance with all Subtitle C standards applicable to land disposal. This rule would not prohibit encapsulated uses of wastes that meet &sect;266.20 requirements. The rule also would not prevent the disposal of HTMR slags in a Subtitle D unit if the residuals can meet the risk-based exclusion levels specified in &sect;261.3(c)(2). The Agency is currently assessing and also seeks comments on whether the necessary data are available to establish risk-based generic exclusion levels for HTMR slags used in non-encapsulated manner.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is requesting public comments on today's proposed rule and criteria used for defining non-encapsulated uses.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Existing Regulations for Hazardous Wastes Used in a Manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constituting Disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, hazardous wastes that are used in a manner constituting disposal (applied to or placed on land), as well as waste-derived products that are produced in whole or in part from hazardous wastes and used in a manner constituting disposal, are not subject to hazardous waste disposal regulations provided the products produced meet two conditions. First, the hazardous wastes must undergo a chemical reaction in the course of becoming products so as to be inseparable by physical means (see &sect;266.20(b)). A second condition for exemption is that the waste-derived products must meet best demonstrated available technology (BDAT) treatment standards under the land disposal restrictions program for every prohibited hazardous waste that they contain before they are placed on land (see &sect;266.20(b)). Note that hazardous waste-derived fertilizers that utilize hazardous waste K061 as a source of zinc are exempt from regulation without complying with either of these two conditions (see also &sect;266.20(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exemption in &sect;266.20 is used for residuals (``slag'') generated from the treatment of hazardous waste K061 (and, to a limited extent, F006) using high temperature metal recovery (HTMR) processes. Section 266.20 is applicable because the majority of this slag is used in highway construction materials ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as road-base), and a limited amount is also used by directly applying it to road surfaces ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as an anti-skid or deicing agent). (See 56 FR 15020, April 12, 1991.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 18, 1992 (see 57 FR 37194), the Agency finalized a generic exclusion for nonwastewater slag residues generated from the HTMR treatment of several metal-bearing hazardous wastes (K061, K062, and F006). This rule expanded a generic exclusion EPA originally published that applied only to HTMR slag from K061 (see 56 FR 41164, August 19, 1991) to include slags from F006 and K062. These HTMR slag residues (i.e., from K061, K062, and F006) are currently excluded from the hazardous waste regulations provided they meet designated concentration levels for 13 metals, are disposed of in subtitle D units, and exhibit no characteristics of hazardous waste (see &sect;261.3(c)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

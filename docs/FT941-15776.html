			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: BP BP had flagged its intention to move on the petrochemicals business well in advance. The company played a leading role in last year's failed attempts to co-ordinate cuts in European ethylene production capacity, but had equally made it clear that it would act unilaterally if necessary. The decision to shut Baglan Bay's ethylene cracker looks sensible given the plant's high production costs. Nor is BP ceding much to competitors by moving alone, since the Baglan capacity has been effectively replaced by lower cost production at Grangemouth. Other producers will have to make their own cuts if they wish to edge back towards profitability. Taking a Pounds 200m charge in its 1993 figures allows BP to do a good deal more than simply close the Baglan cracker. It should finance sufficient restructuring for the company to meet its 5 per cent rate of return target for the chemicals business this year. It also usefully trims profits in 1993, when the company has done well, and gives it a fighting chance of improving earnings this year, despite the current weakness in the crude oil price. That helps BP remain flexible about its dividend. Until the crude price fell in December, the company had been expected to decide whether to start increasing the payment in the first half of the year. Now it can choose whether to argue that difficult upstream and downstream conditions require caution, or that earnings have returned to a stable upward path which permits a modest rise. Either way, a range of options looks badly needed in conditions tougher than any conceived when Mr Bob Horton quit the chair 18 months ago.</p>

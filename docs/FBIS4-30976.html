			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "An Example of Dangerous State </F> Improvisation"]    [Text] Belgrade -- "The offer made by Slobodan Milosevic to  Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania to form a union of Balkan  states, which became known during his recent visit to Bucharest,  is just another arbitrary act of the Serbian president and an  example of dangerous political and state improvisation," the  Information Council of the Serbian Renewal Movement said. The  statement further points out that "the most dangerous aspect of  this act is that Milosevic is actually offering a so-called  defense union, which is really a military pact. Considering the  international circumstances and Milosevic's personal reputation,  the proposal will justify all the critics in the world who  insist that a war-mongering policy predominates in Serbia.    Such a major move, with such far-reaching consequences,  cannot be made by a single individual anywhere in the civilized  world, particularly not secretly. This offer became known to the  Serbian public through Romanian sources. Therefore, the Serbian  Renewal Movement demands that the president of the republic, who  created this latest scandal, pushing Serbia further into  isolation, come before the National Assembly and explain what is  going on.</p>

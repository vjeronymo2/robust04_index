			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Shocks hit LA after quake kills 24 Los Angeles residents last night feared further damage to their homes as after-shocks hit the city following a severe earthquake that left at least 24 people dead. Emergency shelters quickly filled up and thousands of people were evacuated from damaged homes in the San Fernando Valley, a suburban expanse of about 3m inhabitants. Seismic experts warned of a 1 in 4 chance of another big earthquake in coming days. President Bill Clinton declared southern California a federal disaster area, paving the way for low-interest loans and emergency funds, after yesterday's quake which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and badly disrupted transport and communications. About 100 fires broke out around the city as gas pipes ruptured while 1m people were left without power. In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of central Los Angeles, emergency workers pulled 14 bodies out of a three-storey block of flats that partly caved in. 'It was like a bomb going off,' said a third-floor resident who escaped over a balcony. 'One big jolt, it lifted the building up off its foundation, pulled it over and slammed it down within a three-second period.' People were also feared trapped inside a collapsed multi-storey car park at Northridge's shopping centre. Officials said a streetsweeper was still alive even though tons of rubble had fallen on his vehicle. In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley aerial television photographs showed whole streets in flames. Residents of a Sylmar mobile-home park huddled together, sobbing and embracing each other, as they watched their trailer homes go up in flames. Dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the intense heat of gas fires. Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the quake caused many houses to slide off their foundations. Up to 1,000 buildings in the city were damaged, including two hospitals, which have been closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated with walking wounded' and officials said transport conditions were 'horrendous'. The earthquake, which was felt 300 miles away in Las Vegas, struck at 4.31am Pacific Standard Time, according to the US Geological Service. Had it struck two hours later, in the rush hour, fatalities would probably have been much higher, officials said. Yesterday's Martin Luther King holiday also meant that many businesses were closed. Among the dead was a motorcycle policeman thrown off a highway when the quake split the road in two. Several raised freeways to the north and west of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest in the US, was severely damaged. Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley were badly damaged. The entire area was without water. The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles, the US's second biggest city, are reminiscent of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, and in which more than 50 people died. Repairs and reinforcements to San Francisco's freeway system are not expected to be completed for another two years. The city's airports, which were closed immediately after the earthquake, reopened by mid-morning. However, delays were exacerbated by more than 200 after-shocks, including four measuring over 5 on the Richter scale. Telephone services to the Los Angeles area were yesterday limited to emergency calls and 1,500 national guards were deployed to assist emergency workers, amid reports of looting.</p>

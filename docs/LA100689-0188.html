Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> INDOOR FOOTBALL COMING TO BRITAIN  </P> <P> Britain, already wild about American football, is about to get its first taste  of the game's indoor version.  </P> <P> Promoters said today that an Arena Football League exhibition game between  Detroit and Chicago will be held at the London Arena on Nov. 18.  </P> <P> Football already has an enthusiastic following in Britain. National Football  League games are aired on British television each week and draw large  audiences. NFL exhibition games have attracted near-capacity crowds to the  80,000-seat Wembley national soccer stadium each of the last four summers, and  almost 100 clubs play in semipro football leagues around Britain.  </P></p>

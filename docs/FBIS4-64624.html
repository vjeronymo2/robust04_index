			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, Strasbourg] </F>   [Text] The Strasbourg Parliament tonight overwhelmingly  approved the enlargement of the European Union [EU] to sighs of  relief from leaders in the current 12 member states.    MEPs [Member of European Parliament] cleared the way to  admit  Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden at the start of next year  after months of threats to scupper the deal because of  concessions given to Britain over voting rights.    Britain's 45 Labour and 31 Tory Euro-MPs helped make up a  massive majority in favour of enlargement. It was the biggest  exercise of power in the Parliament's 36-year history.    There were slightly different majorities in each of the four  separate votes -- 374 for Austria and Norway, 377 for Finland  and 380 for Sweden. In each case there were fewer than 24 votes  against and about 60 abstentions. A minimum of 259 votes out of  a possible 517 were needed to admit the four new members.    The outcome followed last minute claims from opposers that  the Parliament had capitulated to EU governments without  exacting sufficient guarantees of its future involvement in  legislation. The size of the majority prompted rousing applause  in the packed chamber.    Parliament President Egon Klepsch declared: "This is of  historic importance. The general public has become aware that  this European Parliament has great powers and uses them with a  great sense of responsibility."    Earlier, the leader of Britain's Labour MEP's, Pauline  Green,  told the chamber that it was the most important vote in the  history of the Parliament.    "Probably for the first time, but certainly not for the last  time, EU governments are being forced to focus on the importance  of Parliament's role," she said.    A British Government spokesman in Strasbourg said: "The size  of the majority will hopefully send a positive signal to the  four countries as they prepare for their referendums."    A narrow vote in favour or a rejection would have been  seized  on by Tory sceptics as more evidence that too much power has  been transferred to Brussels and Strasbourg.</p>

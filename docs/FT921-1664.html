			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'Labour gain' stocks extend lead THE FIRST full week of the general election campaign proper has seen a clear gap open in the FT Election Share Index between those shares that stand to gain if Labour wins and those that would lose from a change of government. The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit from a Conservative win. The 'Labour gainers' have outperformed the main big-company index, the FT-SE 100, and are very close to the level at which the campaign started. 'Conservative gainers', on the other hand, have lost 6 per cent of their value during the campaign, with some shares much more badly affected. BET, for example, the business services company, has seen its shares drop from 153p to 125p, an 18 per cent fall. Investors are worried that the company's costs would rise if a Labour minimum wage pushed up the pay of office cleaners and other service workers. (BET argues that it should not be included in this portion of the index, as it has a construction business that stands to gain from any increase in infrastructure spending if Labour wins.) Courtaulds Textiles, down 9 per cent, also stands to lose from a minimum wage. Another big loser, National Power, down 12 per cent, is threatened with tighter regulation under Labour. The performance of the Labour gainers has been helped by BAT's 5 1/2 per cent rise since the election was called - mainly due to the company's announcement last week that it would pay a higher dividend. The 4.7 per cent drop in the share price of Land Securities, the worst-performing Labour gainer, is indirectly connected to politics. Property firms are particularly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates, which have been rising steadily over recent weeks as both parties have indicated they would increase public-sector borrowing. The index at market close on Friday was: Labour win/ Conservative defeat shares 99.26; Conservative win/Labour defeat shares 93.42; FT-SE 100 index, rebased 97.37. The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections of the index are set to 100 at that date. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index - which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT ELECTION SHARE INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour win/Conservative defeat stocks (% change since March 11)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Janata Dal has split again with 14 members of  the Lok Sabha deciding to form a new group. They all met the  speaker in New Delhi today and made a formal request to allot  them separate seats. The members include, Mr. Rabi Ray, Mr.  George Fernandes, Mr. Chandrajit Yadav, Mr. Nitish Kumar, Mr.  Abdul Gafoor, Mr. Harikishore Singh and Syed Shahabuddin. Ten  of them are from Bihar.    At a joint news conference, the MP's claim to represent the  real Janata Dal. They said following the refusal of Mr. V.P.  Singh to assume the leadership, the Janata Dal has been without  a sense of direction. He said there is no option but to split  in order to revive the party. Leaders of the split group have  decided to hold a national convention in August to formulate  their future course of action. Mr. Rabi Ray claimed the support  of majority of the Janata Dal parliamentary party and its state  units. He firmly ruled out any of its member joining the  Congress-I.    This is the second split in the Janata Dal after 1991  general  elections. In 1992, 20 MP's led by Mr. Ajit Singh broke away  from the party. Later, 17 of them joined the Congress-I in two  stages. The rest of the group led by Mr. Rashid Masood merged  with the Samajwadi Party. The Janata Dal leader and former  prime minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has described the split as a  logical conclusion. He expressed the hope that the new party  will unite the forces of social justice.</p>

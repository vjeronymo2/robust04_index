			<p>BFN     [Text] A statement sent on Monday to Duma members by the  leaders of four Russian defense trade unions, speaks of the  inevitability of the Russian government repealing the state  order for the defense industry if the cut-backs in state funding  of arms purchases laid down in the draft 1994 budget remain in  force. The leaders base their call on the fact that the money  reserved will only pay for the debts for goods already produced.  In addition, 80 percent of defense enterprises will go bankrupt  and 1.4 million people lose their jobs simultaneously.    The statement stresses that 30 trillion rubles will be  required for the payment of unemployment benefit alone and the  inhabitants of 70 factory towns will be without means for  survival.    In order to prevent such a turn of events, the leaders  believe it essential to insist on the preservation of the level  of funding in line with the state order for 1994 and on opening  credit lines for conversion programs. They also call on  deputies to take measures to increase the budget income by  stimulating production, collecting taxes fully, effectively  organizing the sale of arms and military technology abroad as  well as the export of civilian products produced at military  plants following conversion, with the direct involvement of the  producing enterprises.</p>

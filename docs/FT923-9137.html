			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Trinity term Aiglon Ltd and L'Aiglon SA v Gau Shan Company Ltd (FT, June 26) GRANTING AN application by the plaintiffs to set a side a Mareva injunction, as well as an order for disclosure of assets, which the defendant had obtained, Mr Justice Hirst stated that the litigation had arisen out of an award of the technical appeal committee of the Liverpool Cotton Association in favour of the first plaintiff, an English company and the second plaintiff, a Swiss company. The award was against both companies and stated that the sellers 'are in fact Aiglon Ltd. For the purpose of this appeal there is no real distinction between the two companies'. It was submitted that by no stretch of the imagination could the appeal committee have had jurisdiction to determine whether SA were party to the sale contract, so that the award against SA on the footing that they were contractually subject to the arbitration was a nullity (Duke of Buccleuch (1870) 5 Exch Cas 221). It was common ground that the arbitrators had exceeded their jurisdiction in deciding that SA were party to the contract. That part of their award was a nullity. There was therefore no award to enforce so far as SA were concerned, and it was no part of the court's function under section 26 to salvage it by considering the issue as to who was party to the contract. Aiglon Ltd and another v Gau Shan &amp; Co Ltd Gau Shan &amp; Co Ltd v Aiglon Ltd and others (FT, July 1) FURTHER TO the decision of the court (as reported above), the defendant now applied to extend the Mareva and ancillary order on entirely fresh grounds, including a claim against SA under section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Section 423(2) of the 1986 Act provided that where a person entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court might make an order 'restoring the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into'. The evidence demonstrated a strong case showing that Ltd had entered into a transaction with SA offending against section 423, alleging that assets had been put out of Gau Shan's reach, apparently at an undervalue, by transfers to SA at a time when the arbitration award had been made. Mr Justice Hirst stated that a good arguable case had been established, on the footing that there was credible evidence that SA's assets might in part be the assets of Ltd which had, as a result of the asset-stripping operation, put it out of its power to meet the arbitration award - so that an injunction against Ltd alone was likely to be inadequate to protect Gau Shan. Those conclusions provided a firm basis for continuing the Mareva injunction, subject to the court's overriding dis-cretion. Securities and Investments Board v Pantell (FT, July 2) SOLICITORS, AS third, fourth and fifth defendants appealed from a decision in which the vice-chancellor had refused to strike out a claim against them in an action by the Securities and Investments Board against Pantell SA and others. Dismissing the appeal, on the alleged facts for the purposes of the striking-out application, the Court of Appeal stated that Pantell had distributed misleading advertisements and had carried on unauthorised investment business in the UK in contravention of the Financial Services Act 1986. The solicitors had acted for Pantell, and the SIB had sought a remedy against them under section 6(2) of the act in that they had been knowingly concerned in the contravention by Pantell. The fact that a person 'knowingly concerned' had not received anything under the transaction did not restrict the court's power to make a section 6(2) order against him, the appeal court stated. Kirklees Borough Council v Wickes Building Supplies Ltd (FT, July 3) SECTION 71(1) of the Shops Act 1950 provided that it was the duty of every local authority to enforce the provisions of the act 'and for that purpose to institute and carry on such proceedings in respect of contraventions as may be necessary to secure observance thereof'. Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 provided that local authorities 'in the case of civil proceedings, may institute them in their own name'. In an endeavour to deter large stores from opening for Sunday trading in contravention of section 47 of the act, the local authorities had sought injunctions to restrain stores from infringing the section. The stores invoked EC law that section 47 was inconsistent with Article 30 of the European Community Treaty. At first instance, the judge had held that he had discretion whether to require the local authority to give an undertaking in damages but decided against that requirement. The Court of Appeal reversed his decision. In allowing the local authority's appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Goff stated that the question whether section 47 was inconsistent with article 30 had been referred to the European Court of Justice. If the European Court should hold that section 47 was invalid as being in conflict with article 30, the UK might be obliged to make good damage caused to individuals by the breach of article 30 for which it was responsible. It did not follow, however, that the council should be obliged to give an undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an injunction. Zucker and others v Tyndall Holdings plc (FT, July 8) THE APPELLANTS had validly exercised an option to sell their shares in a three-month period due to expire on June 24 1992. In March 1992 they issued a writ for specific performance and obtained an ex parte Mareva order. The judge at first instance concluded that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction in the circumstances. Dismissing the appellants' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that as the law stood at present, for the purpose of a Mareva injunction, it was necessary to demonstrate that a legal or equitable right had been interfered with or invaded, or such an invasion or interference was threatened. Though interlocutory relief could be obtained in certain circumstances to protect an equitable interest even before the time for performance under a contract had arisen, on the facts of the present case it was not open to the court to grant an injunction. The Wondrous (FT, July 9) THE SHIPOWNERS were covered under a loss of hire policy for 'war loss of hire and/or earnings'. By clause 1.2 of the hulls clauses the insurance covered loss to the vessel caused by 'seizure, arrest, restraint or consequences thereof'. By clause 4.1.5, however, it excluded 'arrest, restraint, detainment . . . by reason of infringement of any customs or trading regulations'. The shipowners contended unsuccessfully at first instance that they could claim under the policy when the vessel was prevented from earning hire in consequence of being 'detained' within the meaning of clause 1.2. The judge had found that the immediate cause of the detention was failure to comply with local custom laws. He referred to 'detention' in the conditional sense that if the vessel had tried to leave before paying port dues it would have been forcibly detained. In that sense only was it being detained. As to the furnishing of the foreign currency guarantee by the exporter, the judge found that if the owners had been prepared to put up the foreign exchange, the port authorities would have been satisfied. As to clause 4.1.5, the judge held that the exclusion of loss arising from restraint or detainment 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations applied. The judge said 'restraint' and 'detainment' had to be given a wide commercial interpretation, and in a commercial sense the vessel was detained 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations. The Court of Appeal dismissed the owners' appeal on the grounds that the judge's reasoning could not be impeached.</p>

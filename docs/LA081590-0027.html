			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Where Oh Where Is the O'Keeffe Painting?: A Georgia O'Keeffe painting has been  formally declared "lost" by the Art Institute of Chicago, 20 years after a  search for the misplaced painting began.  </P> <P> Officials of the museum had continued to hope over two decades that "East River  from the Shelton" would turn up, institute director James Woods said Tuesday.  But after a recent inventory of 1,500 pieces in the museum's department of  20th-Century paintings and sculpture, Wood said officials acknowledged that the  painting was nowhere to be found. The 1926 work, valued between $250,000 and  $500,000, depicts the view from a Manhattan hotel in which O'Keeffe and her  husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz, lived. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

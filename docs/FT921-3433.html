			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Personal View: Polls that move markets Market rises on poll result.' 'New poll hits market.' This is the kind of headline we can expect over the next few weeks. There is much at stake. The consensus is that the FT-SE 100 Index will be about 10 per cent higher if the Conservatives win than if Labour wins and somewhere in between if there is a hung parliament. As the chances of each outcome change, so the market moves to reflect the new information. The interesting question is whether opinion polls should have so much influence on the stock market. Each poll contributes to the state of knowledge, but the relative importance of the information depends on two factors. The first is the difference in level of the FT-SE 100 which could be expected under different governments. With no difference, there would be no response. However, it seems likely that the market would be higher if the Conservatives won, as already indicated. The second is the change in the probability of a Conservative or Labour win which each new poll indicates. As the election approaches, small changes in the polls may have an increasing impact on probabilities. Consider a change from the Conservatives and Labour level-pegging to a three-point lead for the Conservatives. Such a change now would not greatly affect the probabilities because it could easily be reversed by election day. However, such a change on election eve would indicate a huge increase in the probability of a Conservative win and would definitely move the market. The record from the 1987 election can be used to show how closely the market reflects the probabilities as derived from the polls. In the first half of that year there was a roaring bull market, so it might have been expected that the election was merely a sideshow. Research indicates the opposite: the stock market took very careful account of the opinion polls in the 1987 election. Figure 1 plots the FT-SE 100 Index and the Conservative lead in the polls from April to June of that year. There is not much relationship between the lead and the index, even during the election campaign of May 11 to June 11. The reason for this is quite straightforward. On May 14 the Conservatives had a lead of 12 points, but that could easily have drifted away by election day. On the other hand, the smaller lead of 7.3 points on the eve of the election could not possibly have been reversed with just one day to go. In Figure 2 the poll information has been transformed into the probability of a Conservative win, taking account of the number of days left to go. There is a very close correspondence between the FT-SE 100 and the probability of a Conservative win - the simple correlation is 0.94. The chance of the Conservatives winning (based on the polls), was never worse than 87 per cent and by the last four days of the campaign approached 100 per cent. The market followed that chance with great precision and so, on election day, the FT-SE 100 already reflected the Conservative win. After the result there was hardly a ripple in the index. The stock market in 1987 was, therefore, well-tuned to interpreting opinion polls. By contrast the FT-SE 100 options market was not. If the result of an election is expected to move the market, it may be a good strategy to buy both a call and a put option (a straddle). This is a two-way bet. If the market rises, the call pays off, and if the market falls, the put pays off. The only problem is determining how far the market is likely to move, because that determines how much the options are worth. It is possible to take the options prices on any day and use them to reveal the probability of a Conservative or Labour win. While the opinion polls drifted in the Conservatives' favour in 1987, the options prices indicated exactly the opposite. By the eve of election the options implied there was a 28 per cent chance of the Conservatives losing, whereas the polls indicated such a loss to be almost impossible. The options prices were wildly inconsistent with the opinion polls: investors were paying far too much for their 'two-way bets'. So what are the lessons of 1987 for 1992? The first is that unless one party draws well ahead, the stock market will be very sensitive to opinion polls and the sensitivity will rise as election day approaches. However, if one party does pull ahead, expect an immediate move in the market and nothing more after the election. The second lesson is that it would be wise to do some calculations before taking a two-way bet with the index options. The odds on offer may not be very good, although they look reasonable at present. If you want to punt on the election, it may be better to approach the bookies. In 1987 the bookies' odds were far more consistent with the opinion polls than were those offered by the options market. The author is Professor of Finance at the City University Business School</p>

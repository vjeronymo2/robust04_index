			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Politics ground Jordanian airline sell-off JORDAN'S economy is growing rapidly and the private sector is buoyant. But plans to privatise Royal Jordanian, the state-owned airline, have made little headway since the idea was first aired by the government five years ago. The sale of the airline remains a difficult political pill for the government to swallow. The main problem lies with transforming it from an over-staffed and debt-laden operation into a business with clear investment appeal. Royal Jordanian has borrowings estimated at between Dollars 250m and Dollars 300m, and although the airline is making steady profits at the operating level, they come down with a bump once borrowings costs are taken into account. According to preliminary figures, operational profits for 1992 totalled Dollars 54.3m whereas interest payments were running at around Dollars 40m. Last year, Mr Mahmoud Balqez, Royal Jordanian's chief executive, told a conference of regional directors: 'One of the reasons for privatisation is the generation of enough cash and working capital vis a vis the presently acute undercapitalisation while we debate how best to meet our past obligations and re-start with a fairly clean slate.' Exactly how the slate will be wiped clean is not clear. The ball is very much in the government's court. Treasury officials say that more than 60 per cent of the airline's borrowings are included in Jordan's Dollars 6.5bn of foreign debt which is tightly managed under the watchful eye of the International Monetary Fund. Observers blame the airline's stretched balance sheet on over-expansion during the 1980s and the cost of the Gulf war, notably soaring insurance premiums and the need to relocate large parts of its fleet to Vienna and Maastricht. Another obstacle to be circumnavigated is the political sensitivity aroused by the prospects of mass redundancies as a result of privatisation. With a payroll of 4,700, Royal Jordanian is an important employer. Unemployment in the kingdom is presently running in excess of 20 per cent. A government privatisation committee is currently working to develop a preliminary strategy for the flotation. It will shortly pick international consultancy to oversee the privatisation process. The shortlist includes Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernest &amp; Young, KPMG, Price Waterhouse and Deloitte Touche Ross. According to members of the committee, the sell-off will occur in two stages. First, the airline will be registered, probably this year, as a government-owned company rather than a corporation. Under its new guise, and in collaboration with the appointed consultancy, it will undergo a major restructuring. This will include increasing capital (presently Dollars 32m), rescheduling debts, and examining the profitability of fleet structure and routes. Government shares will then be sold to private investors that may include other airlines. 'We will be very responsive to know-how and experience, not necessarily capital,' says a former minister of transport who has been closely associated with the privatisation debate. With the tourist traffic recovering, the number of passengers carried rose by 40 per cent to 1.1m in 1992. Cargo operations carried 44.5m tonnes of freight compared with 41.6m tonnes in 1991 but remain well below capacity.</p>

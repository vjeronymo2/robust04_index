			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hershey to Build Factory: Hershey Foods Corp. will build a $100-million  chocolate factory near its existing plant in Hershey, Pa. Ground-breaking is  set for late this summer for the 130-square-foot plant, which will process  chocolate for the company's main factory. The new plant will house about 60 new  employees. Start-up will mean a reduction of employees at the main factory as  new machinery replaces older, less efficient equipment, the company said.  Hershey Foods President Kenneth Wolfe said it was not yet known how many  employees at the main plant will be affected, but he said the company will try  to ease job reductions through retraining and attrition.  </P></p>

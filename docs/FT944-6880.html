			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Workers 'may call for cut in hours' Workers could start to press for a cut in their working week because of the economic recovery, says a report from Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analyst. The study found significant differences between the working hours of manual and non-manual staff in a survey of 500 organisations. More than half of manual employees work a 39-hour week whereas non-manual employees work a 35-hour or 37-hour week.</p>

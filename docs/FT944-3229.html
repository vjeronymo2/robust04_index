			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant hotel showing behind 14% rise at Vaux Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux, the hotels and pubs group, yesterday mounted a thinly veiled criticism of Queens Moat Houses, the rival hotel chain living on the sufferance of its banks while it refinances Pounds 1.3m of debt. 'Certain companies, which ran into financial difficulties, have been kept afloat with subsidies from their bankers enabling them to gain a competitive advantage over properly financed companies,' he said. Sir Paul was unveiling a 14 per cent rise in Vaux's pre-tax profits from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 29.3m for the year to September 30, with a strong contribution from its Swallow Hotels chain offsetting flat beer profits. The current year was running ahead of budget, he added. Companies subsidised by their bankers disrupt the hotel market and 'pay excessive salary' levels to attract staff. Liquidating such companies would have avoided the problems, he said. Swallow reported a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 15.9m as occupancy and room rates improved to give a 3.8 per cent increase in room yield. Profits from brewing and tenanted pubs were flat at Pounds 21.5m despite a 6 per cent increase in volume of beer brewed to 550,000 barrels. Vaux maintained its 4 per cent share of the northern draught market which had fallen 2.6 per cent. Extensive price discounting continued in the on and off trades. Profits from Vaux Inns, the managed pubs, edged ahead to Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.9m). Planning permission delays meant some pubs were closed during the summer for refurbishment. St Andrews nursing homes reported a 23 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 17.3m on a 30 per cent increase in beds. Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 243.5m (Pounds 234.9m). A proposed final dividend of 6.5p makes a total of 9.85p, up 3.7 per cent. Earnings per share were 17.88p (16.01p) before property profits and a tax credit and 16.5p (14.75p) after. COMMENT Vaux has two conflicting calls on its limited cash: spending more to develop its pub estate and raising dividends for investors used to a high yield. It tilted yesterday towards investment, which could undermine the shares a little. On the trading front, a cyclical recovery of hotels will more than compensate for flat beer and pub profits to give pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 31.5m for earnings of 17.4p. On a forward multiple of 13, the shares are a hold at best.</p>

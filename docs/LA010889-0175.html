			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBERING FAWN BRODIE  </P> <P> Regarding David Johnston's double review of "A Gathering of Saints" by Robert  Lindsay and "The Mormon Murders" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith (Book  Review, Dec. 18): Johnston states in his review that Robert Lindsay's book on  the recent Mormon forgeries and murders "is easily the best single volume ever  written to explain the church as it is, not as it wants to be seen." I have not  read Lindsay's book, but I don't know whether it can "easily" claim this  distinction over the book the reviewer omits mentioning, the remarkable  biography of Joseph Smith, "No Man Knows My History," by the eminent historian  Fawn M. Brodie, who taught for many years at UCLA and is now deceased.  </P> <P> Originally published in 1945, Brodie's book is wonderfully written, a  thoroughly compelling yet scholarly look at the man who founded the church, and  its history. It's a marvelously understated, witty, yet compassionate study,  which so upset church leaders that one of their members, Hugh Nibley, published  a rebuttal entitled "No Ma'am That's Not History." It was virtually impossible  to obtain a copy of Brodie's book in Utah when I was growing up.  </P> <P> It's worth reading on a number of levels: as a record of the Utopian era in  American development; as a history of Western conquest; as a study of the  development of a uniquely American religion. Also, I agree with Brodie, who  expressed surprise that no one has ever opted to regard The Book of Mormon as  an example of early American frontier literature.  </P> <P> JUDITH FREEMAN  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

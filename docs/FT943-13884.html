			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Germany joins moves to send aid for Rwanda The German government yesterday provided an aircraft to carry humanitarian aid to central Africa, the first sign that Germany will join the international humanitarian effort for refugees fleeing fighting in Rwanda. However, a Bonn official said there were no further plans for the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, to take part in efforts to put an end to the bitter fighting in the African republic. In the Rwandan capital Kigali, UN officials said up to 2m Rwandans were on the move in southern Rwanda and a mass exodus there could become a crisis. In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sadako Ogata, appealed for an immediate ceasefire to avert a disaster as rebel forces drove tens of thousands of refugees and the defeated army across the border into Zaire . Germany's move comes days after a decision by the constitutional court in Karlsruhe allowing German troops to join UN operations outside the Nato area. The government has taken part in a number of humanitarian operations in recent years, including Cambodia and Somalia, but the court ruling prevents opposition parties from contesting the decision as they had in the past.</p>

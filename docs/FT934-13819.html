			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Training sale to 'fraudster' attacked LABOUR MPs yesterday stepped up their attack on the government for failing to prevent 13 privatised skill centres being acquired by a company whose chief executive, Mr Patrick Doyle, was a 'convicted fraudster'. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said in the Commons that Mr Doyle, chief executive of AST Training, had been imprisoned for 'forgery and fraud'. Mr Rhodri Morgan, a Labour frontbencher, is among the signatories of a motion which levels a charge of 'collusion' against Arthur Andersen, receivers of Astra Training Services, the privatised skillcentre network of the Department of Employment. It claims that 'alternative purchasers were unable to get information from Arthur Andersen'. Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, said the government had no power to tell the receiver 'to whom he should sell the assets of a private company'. She said the government had been assured by the training and employment councils that they could supply all the training that used to be provided by the closed Astra outlets.</p>

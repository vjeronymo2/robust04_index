			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS GARBAGE BAN FOR FOOD TRUCKS  </P> <P> The House overwhelmingly passed legislation to ban the hauling of garbage,  chemicals and hazardous wastes in the same trucks and railroad cars used to  carry food, beverages and grains. The bill, which is opposed by the Bush  Administration largely because it would require the Transportation Department  to assume enforcement responsibility, also states that asbestos, infectious  waste and other health-threatening items must be shipped only in vehicles  designated for that purpose. The prime target of the bill, which now goes to  the Senate, is "backhauling," using trucks that carry food cross-country to  carry garbage on the trip home.  </P></p>

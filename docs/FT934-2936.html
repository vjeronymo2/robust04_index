			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Jobs and trade threaten summit: European leaders split over costs of Gatt and need to tackle unemployment European leaders gather today for a two-day summit likely to be disrupted by internal rows over the cost of a world trade deal now within sight. Further tensions are expected to surface in the debate on how to tackle the continent-wide unemployment crisis, and on a white paper on jobs and growth prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The summit is likely to expose an ideological fault line in the EU, centring on the degree of labour market deregulation necessary to create jobs and the cost of infrastructure investment needed to make Europe more competitive. On Gatt, the 12 member states must accommodate French insistence that its farmers will not have to take more land out of production to meet the requirements of a new world accord on subsidised food exports. This has pitted Paris against Bonn, which is also resisting French demands that the EU puts in place tougher trade defence mechanisms equal to those of the US. France's hard line has encouraged other member states such as Portugal, Greece and Spain to bring pressure on their partners to compensate for shortcomings in the likely Gatt accord on textiles, maritime transport and Mediterranean farm produce. Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for a commitment to act on the white paper's conclusions. 'There is quite a lot of agreement on the orientation; the debate will centre on the financing of it,' a senior Belgian official said. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is expected to try to paint Mr Delors' blueprint as a free-spending, interventionist recipe. But other British officials at the summit played down the likelihood of confrontation and described the white paper as an intellectually respectable document. Another source of contention is Mr Delors' proposal for the EU to spend up to Ecu20bn (Dollars 22.8bn) a year to the end of the century as a catalyst for heavy pan-European investment in roads, rail, energy, environment and advanced information networks. The projects are to be funded partly through new European Union bonds amounting to Ecu8bn a year. Britain may get backing from Germany to oppose the new bonds, but French officials predicted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would support the scheme on the basis of a yearly review. The budget-conscious Dutch have already signalled support for the scheme. In London Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attacked Mr Delors' plans, saying there was no evidence of the need for Community borrowing for infrastructure improvements across Europe. Commission officials warned that promises of financial compensation in relation to the Gatt deal risked wrecking the seven-year budget deal struck a year ago at the Edinburgh summit after highly divisive negotiation. The UK and Germany are adamant that the budgetary ceiling agreed at the time cannot be breached. Mr Delors, who is approaching the end of 10 years in charge of the Commission, intends to sell with some of his old vigour his prescription for a Europe which creates more jobs while becoming more competitive. He also intends to leave European leaders in no doubt that they face additional responsibilities following the entry into force last month of the Maastricht treaty. With support from the Belgian presidency, he will tell leaders that their national economic policies are a matter of 'common interest'. He will also suggest that he favours a stronger role for the European monetary institute, the precursor of a future European central bank which will manage the planned single European currency. Summit leaders must also tackle the delicate question of how the prospective enlargement of the Union to embrace Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway will affect the balance between big and small countries' voting strengths.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, April 9 KYODO -- Japan on Saturday [9  April] acceded to Singapore's request to retain until the year  2000 a tax privilege that Japan grants to developing countries,  although the island republic is now Southeast Asia's most  developed economy.    Under a taxation agreement signed by officials from the two  countries here on Saturday, most Japanese companies operating in  the island republic will continue to be exempted from taxation  on their profits both in Singapore and Japan.    Currently, most Japanese companies here are exempted from  paying corporate tax because Singapore has offered tax  concessions to attract foreign companies to set up businesses in  the country.    These companies also do not pay tax in Japan because  Japanese  tax authorities view them as having paid tax in Singapore -- a  privilege Japan normally grants only to developing countries to  help them lure much-needed foreign investments to build up their  economies.    Japan and Singapore first signed the agreement in January  1971 when Singapore was struggling to reverse its  poverty-afflicted status after independence from the British in  1965.    With the island republic now enjoying a per capita income of  more than 21,271 Singapore dollars (13,548 U.S. dollars),  sources said Japan asked to revise the agreement in the hope of  ending the tax privilege earlier. But Japan gave in to  Singapore's request to keep the agreement during the  negotiations.    The revised agreement -- which prevents double taxation and  fiscal evasion -- was signed by Japan's Ambassador to Singapore  Tomoya Kawamura and Koh Yong Guan, Singapore's commissioner of  inland revenue.    In a statement issued Saturday, Singapore's inland revenue  authority did not elaborate on the tax privilege, referring to  it only as "continuation of the existing tax sparing provision  for income" until the year 2000.    It also said the new agreement will "further facilitate the  cross flow of trade, investment, financial activity and  technical know-how between Singapore and Japan."</p>

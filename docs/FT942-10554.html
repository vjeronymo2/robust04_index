			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / State-owned airline prepares to leave the nest: How the reorganisation of Germany's Lufthansa is cutting costs There is nothing Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman of Lufthansa, dislikes more than hearing the German airline described as 'state-owned'. 'It suggests that we are inflexible and bureaucratic,' he fumed as he explained his privatisation plans in Frankfurt last week. After a massive reorganisation over the past two years, with further rationalisation to come, the airline no longer deserves the stigma of state ownership, Mr Weber claimed. Indeed, his dream of a private sector Lufthansa will shortly become a reality as a result of a complex deal with the government over pension arrangements for the airline's employees completed last week. The mechanism for the move away from state control will be a rights issue in which the government will not participate. By forgoing its rights to new shares, the government's stake will fall from 51.42 per cent towards 40 per cent. The rights issue is likely to take place soon after the airline's annual meeting in early July. Later in the year, the government will start to sell off its remaining stake, said Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. Mr Weber says that Lufthansa will undergo a metamorphosis as spectacular as that of British Airways, the former UK state-carrier privatised in 1987 which is now one of the world's most successful airlines. Mr Weber believes that by the end of the century, the world airline industry will be dominated by a few internationally competitive airlines. A private sector Lufthansa will be one of the survivors, he maintains. The restructuring began in 1992 after the airline incurred a pre-tax loss of DM300m (Pounds 121m) the year before. 'We were on the brink of running aground,' Mr Weber said. 'It was essential to put the ship back on the right course.' Mr Weber's three-pronged strategy for guaranteeing the airline's survival is: Cost-cutting. Lufthansa reduced its costs by DM1bn in 1992 and by a further DM500m last year, leading to a 15 per cent increase in productivity. The airline trimmed its workforce from 48,000 at the beginning of 1992 to below 40,000 now. The aim is to cut costs by another DM500m a year by 1997. The airline introduced new measures to boost revenue, ranging from encouraging higher standards of customer service to introducing products such as the frequent flier programme. These measures helped raise the number of passengers carried last year by 3.8 per cent and the volume of freight by 5.4 per cent. This offset falling prices, and turnover for the parent company was flat at DM15bn. A new approach to partnership arrangements with other airlines. The most tangible example of the new strategy was the link-up with United Airlines giving Lufthansa a long sought-after transatlantic partnership. The full impact of these measures on the airline's financial position will become more clear next week when Lufthansa releases its 1993 group-wide figures. A hint of what is in store came in March when Lufthansa announced that the parent company cut its losses last year from DM296.9m in 1992 to DM50m last year while net losses dropped from DM372.8m to DM110m. Mr Weber said last week that the airline enjoyed better than expected results in the early part of 1994 and was on course to break even at an operating level for the full year. 'With the government as majority shareholder, the airline is still operating with one hand tied behind its back,' said Ms Nuala Corry and Mr Graham Moynes at NatWest Markets in London. 'One gets the feeling that they are itching to do a lot more to reduce costs.' Mr Andrew Barker at SG Warburg in London says further cuts are necessary as costs are still high by international standards - at Dollars 54,440, labour costs per employee are 15 per cent higher than BA and 19 per cent higher than at KLM. Aware of the political sensitivities of cutting jobs, Mr Weber says that the main impact of privatisation will be 'the psychological effect on employees and customers', not the opportunity to cut costs. But he is acutely aware of the harsh competitive environment in which airlines operate and a private-sector Lufthansa is likely to make further swingeing job cuts.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Council spending on IT attacked Local authorities in England and Wales are spending almost twice as much as they need to on information technology, the Audit Commission claims in a report published today. Annual spending of Pounds 290m on IT central functions such as the council tax and the payroll could be cut by Pounds 130m, according to the government's public spending watchdog. It says savings of Pounds 50m are available in the short term. These are the biggest proportionate public sector savings the commission has identified since it was set up 10 years ago. The report says that local government reorganisation, intended to take place in 1996 and 1997, could add to costs with the increase in tasks. Failure to prepare for the changes has put services 'at risk'. The commission looked at seven core functions which require broadly comparable information technology sys-tems for all councils: council tax, national non-domestic rates, housing repairs, housing rents, housing benefits, payroll and payments. Some authorities paid twice as much for these systems as others. The report does not cover the Pounds 210m that councils spend on information technology for services such as planning and education, because these are harder to compare and quantify. Mr Bob Chilton, director of local government studies for the commission, said that substantial savings could also be made in these areas. 'The overriding issue is that users must take control,' he said. 'Providers have dominated, and users have found it difficult to negotiate price or content. Users have treated IT as a free good, because it's not on their budget.' Many systems are under-utilised, or include functions that are never used, he said, and most councils still treated IT as a separate central function. The commission wants decisions on IT spending delegated to users, such as education departments and direct service organisations. It believes that compulsory competitive tendering for councils' IT departments, which will be enforced for English metropolitan councils next year, could help. This will force individual departments to outline precise specifications of their needs, it says, and eliminate waste. Local authority organisations accepted the report's findings, which they said would help to identify overspending. The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said, however, that the 'significant upheaval and cost' of reorganisation would jeopardise any benefits.

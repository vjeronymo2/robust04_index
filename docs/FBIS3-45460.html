			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter From Britain" by staff reporter Li Wenzheng </F> (2621 2429 2398): "British Conservative Government Again  Shocked by Scandal"]    [Text] London (RENMIN RIBAO)--With the arrival of the new  year, more scandals in British political circles have been  brought to light, and several government ministers have been  forced to take the blame and resign. As a result, the  reputation of the Conservative government is going downhill, and  the position of Prime Minister John Major is becoming more  precarious each day.    At the beginning of this year, British society was shocked  by  a scandal where Environment Minister Tim Yeo had an illegitimate  child. Because this minister had always been an advocate of  John Major's new idea of "back to basics," the mass media raised  the issue: If it attached great importance to "traditional  values," the Conservative Party should not act against family  and individual moral standards either. Facing a public outcry  for Yeo's resignation, Prime Minister John Major claimed that  "the illegitimate child" issue was a private matter for Yeo and  that it was up to him to decide whether he should resign from  office. John Major's remarks aroused greater resentment among  the public. As a result, Yeo's constituency demanded that he  resign immediately, while criticism from the media also  intensified.    The forced resignation of Tim Yeo was followed by another  scandal. Secretary to the Cabinet Alan Duncan went so far as to  buy a council house illegally for 50 percent less than the  market price, thus earning a profit of nearly 200,000 pounds.  Then, on 10 January, the Earl of Caithness, the minister of  state for transport, announced his resignation. It was  disclosed that the cause of his resignation was the suicide of  his wife, who could not bear the minister's extra-marital  affairs.    If we say that the disgraceful series above only impaired  the  reputation of individuals, then another scandal revealed by  major British newspapers the other day could do great harm to  the image of the Conservative Party as a whole.    According to a 250-page report released by the relevant  auditing department in London, Westminster City Council, which  is claimed to be the "flagship" council of the Conservative  Party in Greater London (and which includes major commercial and  tourist areas in London proper), had misappropriated up to 21.25  million pounds of public funds to canvass for the Conservative  Party. This incident immediately gave rise to a public uproar,  and some people believe that "the Conservative Party is corrupt  and that they have abandoned basic traditional values."    In recent years, Britain has been plagued by a worsening  economic recession and drastic increases in unemployment and  crime rates, and complaints are heard everywhere. People from  Britain's political and economic circles have always blamed the  leaders of the Conservative Party for "their lack of creativity"  as well as their inability to shoulder the heavy duty of leading  Britain. Under such circumstances, in order to establish a new  image for and restore the prestige of the Conservative Party,  John Major raised the slogan of "back to basics" at the party's  annual conference in October 1993. The essence of his slogan was  to implement basic economic policies, including maintaining a  low inflation rate, advocating free markets, and supporting the  development of enterprises; attaching greater importance to  basic social values, such as exercising self restraint,  respecting the law, and showing concern for others; and to  restoring the traditional values of "being honest and upright in  one's way, and being particular about one's manners." For a  time, the public cherished the hope that Major's slogan could  inject a certain vigor into British society, which has been  dejected and apathetic for many years. That is why public  resentment is soaring after the moral scandals inside the  government were exposed, and people have deemed the Major  administration a "hypocritical" government. It is clear that  the accusations made in political circles and the media have  already gone beyond the moral standards of individuals and have  touched upon the credibility and reputation of the leaders of  the Conservative Party.    The results of the latest opinion polls show clearly that  the  Conservative Party has fallen behind the Labor Party by 25  percentage points, with an approval rate of a mere 26 percent.  People generally believe that the unceasing scandals in the  Conservative Party have made the Major administration, which  already suffers low prestige among the public, to further lose  the trust of the British public. It is probable that the Major  administration will choose to reshuffle the cabinet at an early  date; otherwise, it will surely suffer losses in the local  council elections and the European Parliament elections  scheduled for this May and June. By then, the problems may be  so serious that one or two resignations by ministers will be to  no avail.</p>

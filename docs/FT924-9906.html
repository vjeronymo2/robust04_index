			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago grain trade ignores Gatt worries as futures rally CHILL WINDS over the North American plains and the first snows in Minnesota helped lift the prices of Chicago maize and soyabeans futures yesterday, as the foul weather briefly delayed the bumper harvest. Grain traders, focused squarely on the progress of the crop and the outcome of Tuesday's national elections in the US, were all but oblivious to the international trade talks going on at a hotel only blocks from the soyabean pits at the Chicago Board of Trade. The talks, billed as the last in the six-year-long negotiating marathon known as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, were seen as an 'insignificant' feature in the morning grains rally. 'Political events are harder to predict than the weather,' said Mr Daniel Basse, senior analyst for the Illinois-based firm, AgResources. 'At least with the weather, we can get a 10-day forecast.' With 38.5 per cent, or about 270m bushels, of this year's US soyabean crop scheduled to be exported to the European Community this marketing year, the failure of Gatt and an ensuing trade war could push the price of Chicago soyabean futures down to Dollars 5 a bushel 'fairly quickly', Mr Basse said. Soyabean futures for January delivery closed at Dollars 5.52 3/4 a bushel on Friday, and had rallied another 3 1/4 cents in late trading yesterday. The Monday rally, Mr Basse said, reflected the traders' unwillingness to come to grips with the importance of Gatt. 'I don't really think the traders understand the implications (of a failure of Gatt). It has been an ongoing development, over several years and most of these guys don't have any experience with a trade war. They don't think it can happen.' Mr Richard Feltes, research director for the big Chicago-based brokerage firm, Refco, suggested, however, that the market had already written a failure of Gatt into market prices. 'I think the majority of people who watch this closely believe that Gatt's not going to happen,' he said. He added that those same people did not believe that a Gatt failure would spark a trade war, which explained the indifference of the grain markets. 'Traders don't think (US President) Bush has got the guts to throw Dollars 1bn in sanctions on the EC,' Mr Feltes said. 'They just don't think he will pull the trigger on a trade war. World leaders in the '90s don't start trade wars, especially over soyabeans.' A report on US exports sales released last Thursday showing that fully half of this year's projected soyabean exports, or about 339m bushels, had already been placed, was central to the two-day soyabean rally, traders said. That volume of sales only six weeks into the new marketing year was something of a benchmark for the US, they said.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The 46 toilets finally have arrived from the plant in Ohio, meaning the El Paso  Diablos of the double-A Texas League will move into the new Cohen Center either  tonight or Tuesday. . . .  </P> <P> The switch to the modern 10,000-seat ballpark from 66-year-old Dudley Field  signifies progress for the club, but also the end of one of the most colorful  eras in minor league baseball. . . .  </P> <P> Eventually, Dudley Field will be torn down and the neighboring El Paso Zoo will  be expanded. But, really, that's what Dudley Field has been since 1924. A zoo.  . . .  </P> <P> Two hundred eight home runs were hit one season at Dudley, where the elevation  is 3,695 feet and the power alleys are 365 feet. . . .  </P> <P> On a Saturday night in 1985, El Paso beat Beaumont, 35-21. The next day,  Beaumont scored nine runs in the first inning and won, 20-13. . . .  </P> <P> A storm hit El Paso one summer evening. It rained everywhere but at Dudley  Field. A nickname was born. Dudley Dome. . . .  </P> <P> Paul Strezlin, a junior high school principal, is the only public address  announcer ever to be thrown out of two games. The last time it was for playing  a tape of Linda Ronstadt's "I've Been Cheated," after a call he didn't like. .  . .  </P> <P> Ten-Cent Hot Dog Night was the promotion Sunday. Last year, 3,000 fans devoured  16,000 dogs before the supply ran out in the seventh inning. . . .  </P> <P> After every Diablo home run, a hat is passed around in the stands. The lucky  batter will collect an average of $50. . . .  </P> <P> In the seventh inning Saturday night against Wichita, Jesus Alfaro cleared the  right-field fence with a game-tying homer. "That's a $100 homer," predicted  Rick Cantu of the El Paso Times in the press box. "He's been here more than six  years and he's very popular." . . .  </P> <P> Alfaro, a designated hitter, started passing the hat behind the Diablos'  dugout. . . .  </P> <P> The longest home run anybody here can remember is a shot by Darryl Strawberry  of the Jackson Mets that was estimated at 500 feet. . . .  </P> <P> Sign at the souvenir stand: "Advice, 25 cents." . . .  </P> <P> There are 52 signs gracing the outfield fences, advertising malls, sheet metal  works, banks, restaurants, radio stations, newspapers and the U.S. Army. . . .  </P> <P> The winning run Saturday was set up when the Diablos' Sandy Guerrero tagged up  from first all the way to third. He did this while Wichita center fielder Mike  Humphreys was being revived by trainers on the terrace in center field after  making a spectacular catch and crashing into the wall. . . .  </P> <P> Among owner Jim Paul's many promotions is a night when a fan manages the team.  . . .  </P> <P> Only three of the eight teams in the Texas League are located in Texas, and the  league office is in Arkansas. . . .  </P> <P> The most famous person in uniform this series was Wichita pitching coach Jon  Matlack. . . .  </P> <P> Cohen Center is named after Andy and Syd Cohen, who went from the El Paso  sandlots to the major leagues. Syd was the last man to strike out Babe Ruth. .  . .  </P> <P> Crowds are expected to rise from the current average of 1,550 at Dudley Field  to 4,000 at Cohen Center, but, somehow, it just won't be the same. . . .  </P> <P> Dr. Ferdie Pacheco of NBC rates the five heavyweights getting the most  attention: 1. Mike Tyson, 2. Evander Holyfield, 3. Buster Douglas, 4. Razor  Ruddock, 5. George Foreman. . . .  </P> <P> "Holyfield will beat Douglas," Pacheco said. "He's got superior athletic  ability and he has the confidence that only an unblemished record brings you."  . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes courtesy of Jim Murray: Giant third baseman Matt Williams and  Harmon Killebrew. . . .  </P> <P> A chip shot away from Interstate 10 in El Paso is Lee Trevino Drive. . . .  </P> <P> There's a possibility that a Laker-Clipper game will be shown as part of NBC's  regular-season NBA package. . . .  </P> <P> Marv Albert looks for the New York Knicks to keep Coach Stu Jackson, but make  at least one important trade. . . .  </P> <P> Stay In School: This may be remembered as the year that the players who could  have gone first in the NBA and major league baseball drafts -- Larry Johnson  and Todd Van Poppel -- instead decided to continue their education. . . .  </P> <P> Average number of runs scored by winning teams in the National League Friday  was 13. . . .  </P> <P> I'm not sure if Monica Seles' grunts or shots are more disconcerting to her  opponents.  </P></p>

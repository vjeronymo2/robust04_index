			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Gatt slow to adopt aircraft subsidy accord THE US and the European Community are making slow headway in attempts to generalise their bilateral deal on aircraft subsidies to other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The aim is to revise Gatt's existing code of fair practice on trade in civil aircraft by the end of this year, in parallel with the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations. However, it has proved more difficult than expected to extend the bilateral agreement - which covers only large airliners, and was designed to limit state supports for the European Airbus - to small aircraft, components, and a variety of national aids for aircraft development and production. The revised code is being discussed in conjunction with the proposed Gatt code on subsidies included in the December 1991 package of draft Uruguay Round accords. The US-EC Airbus deal, signed last summer after eight years of transatlantic feuding, prohibits subsidies for aircraft production and caps development support at 33 per cent of spending. It also places curbs on indirect supports, such as those derived by US manufacturers from government defence and aerospace contracts.</p>

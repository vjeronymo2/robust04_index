			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S A READER WHO LIKES THE NEW SECTION  </P> <P> Perhaps the readers who complain about the new Real Estate Section don't  realize the paper goes to more than a million subscribers, many of whom want to  buy or sell houses, fix them up inside and out or perhaps landscape the  grounds. If these grousing readers aren't interested in such things, let them  read only commercial trade papers, of which there are aplenty.  </P> <P> I've been reading The Times for 40-plus years and have bought thousands of  dollars worth of ads in the Real Estate Section.  </P> <P> I read the section then mainly to check placement of ads. Now I read it with  great interest as a homeowner and real estate investor. If I were a contractor,  developer or anyone else in the real estate business, I'm sure I would still  want to read it, as a direct line to customers with useful feedback.  </P> <P> DON McKENZIE  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

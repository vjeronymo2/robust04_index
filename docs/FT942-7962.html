			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Bosch-Siemens looks to increase market share by acquisitions Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Germany's largest producer of white goods, is seeking acquisitions in the UK, France and Italy to strengthen its position in the fiercely-competitive DM45bn (Pounds 18bn) European market. The Munich-based concern, owned jointly by Bosch, the car parts group, and Siemens, the electrical and electronics giant, is Europe's second biggest producer of white goods with a 15 per cent market share. Electrolux of Sweden has 22 per cent. Dr Herbert Worner, president and chief executive of Bosch-Siemens, wanted to raise the group's European market share to between 18 and 19 per cent within five years, through organic growth and acquisitions. This week, Bosch-Siemens announced a sharp fall in group pre-tax profits from DM346m to DM234.6m. The 1992 figure included a final DM100m subsidy for the company's Berlin washing machine plant. Group sales fell 5 per cent to DM6.66bn with non-German sales accounting for only 42 per cent of the total. Dr Worner said: 'I think we have to change, we must improve our position in the other big European countries.' Bosch-Siemens has more than 30 per cent of the German market, Europe's largest, and market leadership in Spain, Austria and Greece. It is considering partnerships with manufacturers in the UK and is looking at making acquisitions in Italy. Any takeovers by Bosch-Siemens would continue the consolidation in the European white goods industry. Dr Worner said companies with sales of DM1.5bn to DM2bn would find it difficult to survive on their own. Overall, sales and profits had improved in the first four months of 1994, he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WHEN WORDS COLLIDE  </P> <P> Spike Lee and Arsenio Hall at odds? Not at all, Hall insists.  </P> <P> There's been conjecture that Lee might never get on "The Arsenio Hall Show"  after the film maker's critical barbs about Hall's buddy, Eddie Murphy, that  appeared in Calendar last April. But Hall has booked Lee to appear on his  late-night chat show June 27 to promote Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which opens  in 350 theaters on June 30.  </P> <P> "I've had people come up to me and say, 'I guess Spike isn't going to be on  your show now' -- making assumptions that are not true," Hall said. Hall said  he hasn't read Lee's comments -- Lee accused Murphy of failing to do his share  to help other blacks in the film industry -- and that there's no bad blood  between them.  </P> <P> "No one's closer to me than Ed," added Hall, "and he's never said a negative  thing about the man. When we talk about young black film makers, it's Spike's  work we respect, because he's got (courage)." Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

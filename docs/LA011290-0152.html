			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> POLICE DONATING OLD UNIFORMS TO MEXICO  </P> <P> The uniforms that once outfitted the city's 330-member police force will soon  be seen on the streets of Mexico.  </P> <P> Anaheim police changed the color of their uniforms from tan to blue last year,  leaving the department with about 2,500 unwanted sets of tan shirts and pants.  </P> <P> As a gesture of good will, most of the uniforms will be donated to needy law  enforcement agencies in Mexico, Capt. Randy Gaston said.  </P> <P> Local police occasionally work with Mexican authorities to catch suspects who  flee the United States, Gaston said, and police officials hope the donation of  uniforms will increase cooperation on these cases. Such cooperation must be  solicited since there is no legal requirement for Mexican police to assist with  investigations of crimes committed in this country, he said.  </P> <P> Previously, the uniforms have been given to charity or destroyed. The uniforms  are worth less than $100 each, according to Anaheim police.  </P> <P> Following the City Council's approval of the donation, the Police Department  will decide which Mexican police agencies will receive the uniforms, Gaston  said. In addition, some uniforms and other equipment such as batons will be  donated to the police academy at Golden West College.  </P></p>

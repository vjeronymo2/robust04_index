			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Consumers body cautions on free flights HOOVER, the home appliance brand owned by US manufacturer Maytag, seems to be making an offer hard to refuse. Customers spending at least Pounds 100 - slightly less than the price of the company's cheapest vacuum cleaner - are being offered 'two free return flights to the US.' But the Consumers Association, which has already received some complaints about the offer, suggests it may be a good idea to study the small print. Hoover refused yesterday to discuss details of customer response to its heavily advertised offer. It has increased production, particularly at its Cambuslang factory in Lanarkshire, but will not say by how much. The company said yesterday no figures for sales of appliances would be issued until the promotion closes at the end of this month - if they are issued at all. Mr Keith Richards, a barrister with the Consumers Association, said he was particularly concerned about the stipulation that the 'free flight voucher cannot be used with any free accommodation or free ownership offers, unless authorised by Hoover'. He said that might rule out anyone wishing to stay with relatives or friends. Mr Richards said the Consumers' Association had received few complaints yet concerning the Hoover offer, but had found with similar offers from other companies that while the flights were given away free, accommodation was often tied to them. 'What people have complained about is the requirement to book accommodation through a specified agent from a specified list of hotels. They have discovered that if they ring up the hotels direct, they are offered the same accommodation at half the price. If they had bought a bucket-shop flight and booked the accommodation themselves, they could probably have got the whole package cheaper than through the free flight-with-tied-accommodation offers.' Hoover said the company would not use the clause in that way. 'If you wish to stay with friends or relatives or make your own accommodation arrangements then you are perfectly free to do that. This is a no-strings-attached promotion.' Hoover needs to sell more domestic appliances. Hoover Europe made a Dollars 16.2m (Pounds 10.60m) deficit in the first nine months of this year, compared with an Dollars 8.9m loss for the same period last year. Mr Tony Barton of The Marketing Store, a sales promotion specialist agency, said: 'All travel offers in the end come down to the small print. While promotions like these shift product, in the long term they can be counterproductive if the consumer discovers that the conditions are onerous. In any case it can only be a short-term measure for Hoover. How many vacuum cleaners does one need?' Hoover does not require customers to book accommodation, but, as Mr Richards pointed out, 'It is very difficult to book your own accommodation direct, if you don't know precisely when your flights are going to be - and there is no guarantee that you will get the flight dates you nominate.'</p>

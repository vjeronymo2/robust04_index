			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY ACQUITTED OF DRIVING UNINSURED CAR  </P> <P> John F. Kennedy Jr. has been acquitted on a charge of driving an uninsured  vehicle, the state Department of Motor Vehicles announced.  </P> <P> Kennedy's attorney on Friday took evidence to the DMV that his client's car was  insured when police ticketed him, a department spokesman said. The charge was  dismissed, although the DMV has six months to verify the Kennedy documents.  </P> <P> A charge of driving an unregistered car was put off until Sept. 29, which also  is the deadline for Kennedy to pay a $127 fine on his guilty pleas to speeding  and driving an uninspected vehicle.  </P></p>

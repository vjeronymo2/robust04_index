			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLMATES HELP SPELL THE DIFFERENCE FOR TROUBLED PUPILS  </P> <P> The first time the 10th-grade student at O'Farrell School of Creative and  Performing Arts showed up at a weekly student support group, it was only to  give moral support to her boyfriend, who had elected to attend in lieu of  serving after-school detention.  </P> <P> But on her second visit -- drawn back by the comfort of some three-dozen  students talking of common problems with alcohol or drugs or parents -- the  girl stammered out that she had contemplated suicide during the Christmas  holidays.  </P> <P> Immediately, the school nurse, who also sits in every Tuesday, prepared to  contact the parents to arrange professional help, while other students -- a few  of whom had also thought about taking their own lives at one time -- surrounded  the girl to offer their hugs, their telephone numbers and promises of support.  </P> <P> Two months later, the student continues to show up every Tuesday after school,  chronicling her slow but steady progress in coping with home and academic life  and showing that positive results can come from seeking assistance. Her mother  comes regularly to a support group for O'Farrell parents, held at night twice a  month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peer Counseling  </P> <P> The group that helped the girl was established last fall by O'Farrell students  and administrators, an extension of the school's extensive peer counseling  program, where students are trained in communication and listening techniques  to seek out classmates in need of a caring hand.  </P> <P> Peer counseling in some fashion has been used in schools for many years, mainly  to have higher-achieving students tutor students at risk of failing  academically. But in the past several years, schools across the state have  begun to emphasize the role that teen-agers can play in helping peers who have  problems with stress, alcohol, drugs, broken families or parental abuse.  </P> <P> The staff at O'Farrell, a magnet school in Southeast San Diego that attracts  students citywide for its performing arts curriculum, has enthusiastically  endorsed the peer counseling efforts of teacher Paul Combs. His students offer  help one-on-one and also run the campus Students Against Drunk Driving club,  work with disabled students to make them feel more at home at O'Farrell, and  set the ground rules for the Tuesday after-school sessions.  </P> <P> At Orange Glen High School in Escondido, teacher Darwin Bree also runs a large  peer counseling effort. His students receive regular referrals from the  school's adult counselors and also work with neighborhood social-service  programs for teens.  </P> <P> Chula Vista High School students have been asked to co-sponsor a statewide peer  counseling conference in San Diego this April. More than 2,000 students and  teachers from across California are expected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Getting Started  </P> <P> "All the documentation shows that, especially from junior high on, kids are  influenced more by their peers than by anyone else," said Allan Bright, a  project specialist with the county Office of Education. Bright has created a  steering committee of educators to help schools develop peer counseling  programs.  </P> <P> "We know that negative peer pressure can be intense, where kids succumb to  alcohol and drug use and an inability to say 'no,' so here we are saying that  students can bond together over issues that are positive."  </P> <P> Psychologist John Giebink, who heads the student health services at UC San  Diego, said professional counselors "are always somewhat reluctant to allow  that lay people can be effective . . . but I think there is general agreement  today that these programs can be worthwhile and effective because they open up  an avenue for students or people who will otherwise be reluctant to get  themselves involved with professionals.  </P> <P> "You must constantly stress, however, that peer counselors are not  professionals and that they must always be aware of getting in over their  heads."  </P> <P> Teachers and students in the O'Farrell and Orange Glen programs readily  acknowledge there are limits and that they are practicing therapy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focused Listening  </P> <P> "We constantly harp on the fact that we are not equipped to diagnose or  prescribe, that we are there to support and listen and give suggestions for  referrals to send on to others who can do things," said O'Farrell's Combs, a  former race-human relations counselor for the San Diego district. "But it is  true that a great deal of help can be given by someone who listens and cares"  in what Combs calls focused listening.  </P> <P> At O'Farrell, Combs -- who also teaches English and sings in the San Diego  Opera chorus -- has about 30 students a year sign up for peer counseling. He  began the course as a result of his race-human relations experiences, where he  found that teachers and students can accomplish as much counseling as  administrators.  </P> <P> "The key is to persuade kids that they can make an actual, measurable,  observable difference in the way things happen on campus," Combs said.  </P> <P> The two-semester class teaches students communications and problem-solving  techniques, how groups function, and how leaders can guide a group and improve  dialogue, Combs said. There is also instruction in recognizing alcohol- and  drug-related problems and various theories behind professional counseling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Establish Trust'  </P> <P> "We learn to establish trust and respect for a person despite (his or her)  problems," senior Cynthia Alvarez said.  </P> <P> Added peer counselor Rosemary Barnes: "We are taught to point out that there  are other ways of dealing with problems besides taking drugs, for example. But  we do it through suggesting alternatives and supporting students in seeking  options . . . and telling them that we respect them for coming to us."  </P> <P> Heidi Vaught said that students who approach her and peer counselors "already  in a sense have identified their problem, and what we try to do is get them to  come around to our point of view without preaching, because they will value the  solution more if we don't preach."  </P> <P> Attendance coordinator David Libbey, the school's on-site disciplinarian, has  directed many students to peer counseling as an alternative to detention, which  he found had little lasting effect for most campus violators. "I think that  most kids do know right from wrong, but peer pressure to (do the wrong thing)  is very, very strong and many kids are followers. . . . We're telling them that  this is a way to get out of that."  </P> <P> Combs' class, now in its fourth year, has received powerful support from  O'Farrell Principal Florence Johnson, who subscribes strongly to the theory  that students should be treated as much like adults as possible.  </P> <P> "To me, when students come up with an idea, I really try to listen and make it  come true," Johnson said. "Peer counseling works well, the kids are very, very  competent, it fills a need that the (adult) district counselors could never  handle due to time, and it doesn't cost us any additional money."  </P> <P> Johnson has a reputation among San Diego principals for having a particular  interest in the emotional well-being of students, in part because of her own  background in successfully adopting and raising five foster children.  </P> <P> "Florence has the interest and real commitment to the whole child -- not that  other principals don't consider that -- but rather that she has strong  expertise in counseling and is particularly keen about improving students'  self-esteem," said Beverly Foster, the assistant school district superintendent  who oversees O'Farrell.  </P> <P> "For peer counseling to succeed, the administration has to make it a top  priority, and she has done that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> On-Campus Support  </P> <P> Johnson agreed to the Tuesday group after peer counselors said that some  students, who were in drug rehabilitation, could use an on-campus support  group. She had it broadened to include students who just wanted to talk about  problems or who simply were seeking friendship. Both she and other teachers  share their own experiences as well, letting students know that adults also  must cope with stress and failure.  </P> <P> The Tuesday sessions offer no direct "should or should not" advice. Everyone is  guaranteed confidentiality unless someone talks of committing a crime, of  suicide, of child abuse or of being pregnant, Libbey said. A student who talks  about a particularly pressing problem may be approached afterward by the nurse  or Combs and asked about the possibility of seeking professional assistance.  </P> <P> The other day, 40 students showed up after school. Among them were recovering  alcoholics, those with alcoholic parents, recovering drug addicts, some worried  about child abuse, and many just present to express support for fellow  students.  </P> <P> "I'm here because I care" was a common refrain.  </P> <P> Nurse Catherine Brugman shared her pain with students over her mother's recent  death. A San Diego police officer who works with the school recounted painful  personal events so that students would understand that she is also open and  sympathetic to communication, and not a person to be seen just as an enforcer  of rules.  </P> <P> A few students said that such open communication with their parents was "easier  said than done." Another pointed out that "the resolution doesn't always happen  like in 'On Golden Pond,' " the movie where an estranged daughter and father  reconciled differences as he neared death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents' Meetings  </P> <P> The same problems with relationships came through at a nighttime parents'  meeting. Libbey has found parents supportive of peer counseling, since parental  approval is needed before a student can be assigned to the program instead of  regular detention. At the night meeting, parents heard from vice principal Jean  Mason, who brought her college-age daughter along to talk about the highs and  lows of raising children as a single parent.  </P> <P> "I think parents need to see that we as teachers are not perfect either, that  we cope with some of the same things they do, that they are not alone," Johnson  said.  </P> <P> While Escondido's Orange Glen High, nestled among Eucalyptus trees on the  outskirts of the North County city, at first seems a world away from  O'Farrell's urban core, the need for peer counseling is just as great to  improve attendance and avoid problems, school administrators said.  </P> <P> "The peer counselors are terrific in being out on campus, with their sensors  out, to find situations before they become crises, as sort of an early warning  system," said Bea Warner, an adult counselor at the school. Warner told of one  student who came to her terribly upset over having broken up with a boyfriend.  </P> <P> "Her mother and all her friends told her just to forget it and go on," Warner  said. "But she needed a peer counselor who took more of an impartial attitude.  . . . I hope the solution is the same as that suggested by her friends, but  it's important that the answer come on her own."  </P> <P> At Orange Glen, the students in Darwin Bree's class -- after going through  training similar to that at O'Farrell -- have students they see on a weekly  basis. Many are referred by the adult counselors, others by teachers who worry  when a student becomes lethargic and spends time in class with a head on the  desk.  </P> <P> "As we make referrals to a peer counselor, we make it clear that we are very  aware of who is good to refer and who needs therapeutic intervention by a  psychologist," Warner said. "I am not giving them students with potentially  major disorders."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crisis Management  </P> <P> Fellow counselor Joan Freitas praised the peer counselors for their  participation in the school's crisis management team, which has dealt with the  aftermath of three suicides by students during the past year. Some classmates  take blame for the deaths; others have contemplated a similar act.  </P> <P> "The peer counselors know how to take charge, such as determining that seniors  respond in a different way than ninth-graders and need different kinds of  intervention," Freitas said. "We have revised our program as a result of that."  </P> <P> Peer counselor Larry Martineau said that a key element during training is  learning about yourself. "You learn what your limits are," Martineau said. "We  also learn that we have to support each other as peer counselors," which  instructor Bree does during weekly debriefings with his class each Friday.  </P> <P> "The closeness we have as a group is incredible," senior Ed Simm said. "When we  walk into class, everyone gives each other a hug." At the end of training  sessions each year, Bree takes the class on an Outward Bound wilderness  experience, which he said "binds" the students together even more tightly.  </P> <P> In addition, Bree has professional counselors from Escondido's Neighborhood  Recovery Center and Escondido Youth Encounter work with the class. Several  students also serve as counselors for the community programs, which Bree said  gives them additional skills in dealing with teen-agers. The class periodically  visits junior high schools and members talk about drugs as well as give  orientations for eighth-graders who will attend Orange Glen the next year.  </P> <P> "A lot of students in school these days are hurting from something and teachers  don't have the time or training to intervene," Orange Glen teacher Marilyn Tam  said. "While peer counseling doesn't always succeed, I have never seen a  negative impact."  </P> <P> Said O'Farrell's Johnson: "I think peer counseling will improve attendance and  morale, and especially in getting students to take more responsibility for  their role in the educational system."  </P> <P> The O'Farrell 10th-grade student who shared her thoughts of suicide would  agree.  </P> <P> "I have been helped to get motivated more to work in class, although doing well  in school has not been my No. 1 priority," she said. "But the group has given  me some confidence to confront the academic side and I think it has helped me  understand my parents a bit more.  </P> <P> "I really need the group."  </P></p>

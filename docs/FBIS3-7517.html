			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear  dispute is a huge obstacle to attracting foreign tourists in  "Visit Korea Year '94," tourism sources said Saturday.    News media in the United States and Japan carried successive  stories on issues related to the nuclear problem this week,  including possible United Nations sanctions against North Korea,  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and growing  tension on the peninsula, all of which have probably discouraged  foreigners from wanting to visit.    Many foreign tourists are voicing concerns to the overseas  offices of the Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC), hotels and  travel agents about their safety in Seoul.    This is partly caused by exaggerated reports on the nuclear  row carried by the American media, the sources said.    The U.S. State Department has yet to designate South Korea  as  a danger area in its travel advisory, but if the United Nations  imposes economic sanctions on the North or Patriot missiles are  deployed in the South, the country is likely to earn this  dubious distinction.    The travel advisory is important since other nations'  tourism  industries regard it as a reliable recommendation: If South  Korea is listed as a dangerous area, the number of foreign  tourists is likely to decline sharply, the sources said.    Some Japanese tourists, citing deep concerns about the  nuclear problem, have canceled planned visits to Seoul in April  and May. Japanese account for nearly half of the total foreign  tourists, so their cancellation of tours to South Korea will  weaken the tourism industry here.    The director-general of the Tourism Bureau at the  Transportation Ministry, Chong Chong-hwan, said, "it has not  reached a point where tourists should worry much about the  problem now. But we have ordered the overseas offices of the  KNTC to ensure that foreigners know their security is guaranteed  here."</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALL MAY GIVE BURBANK SOME RESPECT;  </P> <P> RETAILING: THE MODEST DOWNTOWN HAS BEEN THE BUTT OF MANY JOKES, BUT THE EARLY  SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDIA CITY CENTER COULD PUT AN END TO THAT.  </P> <P> The night before the Ikea furniture store opened its doors in Burbank, Fred  Bruning had trouble sleeping.  </P> <P> "I was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, saying what if they don't come?"  recalled Bruning, chief of staff of Alexander Haagen Co., developer of the  $300-million Media City Center shopping mall where Ikea is the first tenant.  </P> <P> But shoppers came in droves, making Bruning's job easier. The hoopla  surrounding Ikea's opening persuaded at least three other retailers to go ahead  and open stores in the 1-million-square-foot center, which is Burbank's first  major shopping mall, he said.  </P> <P> The mall's developers weren't the only people breathing a sigh of relief.  Burbank officials see the development as a beginning of a renaissance for its  downtown -- long lampooned by Johnny Carson and others who poked fun at the  city, partly because of its downtown of modest, mostly single-story buildings.  For example, KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman once quipped about Burbank's  founding: "A town with one bank and one Burger King, so they just shortened the  name."  </P> <P> But the development -- designed to ultimately include four office buildings and  a hotel -- is going forward at a time of uncertainty for the economy. It is the  only big shopping center currently under development in California -- others  have been shelved because of the sluggish economy, Bruning said. Ikea's hit  opening does not guarantee success for the entire mall in the long run. The  mall might even run into problems signing up smaller stores if they suffer  through a weak Christmas elsewhere.  </P> <P> Mike Zugsmith, who runs a commercial real estate brokerage in the San Fernando  Valley, said: "If this holiday goes poorly, they'll have a difficult time  leasing out those satellite shops."  </P> <P> Bruning agreed, conceding: "Some tenants that have given us commitments might  not go forward if it's a terrible Christmas" for them. But he and city  officials said Ikea's initial splash bodes well, particularly because Ikea will  always be crucial to the entire mall.  </P> <P> "We were pleasantly surprised and pleased," said William Kelly, deputy city  manager and director of redevelopment for Burbank. "It clearly showed how  strong a magnet or target store it's going to be."  </P> <P> The mall might also benefit from the relative affluence of Burbank residents.  Haagen's studies show that, despite an old stereotype about Burbank being a  blue-collar town, the average household income within a five-mile radius of the  Media City Center is $2,500 higher than that in the same radius around the  nearby Glendale Galleria.  </P> <P> That statistic helped persuade Bullock's, a unit of R. H. Macy &amp; Co., to  come aboard, Bruning said.  </P> <P> Bruning said Burbank has other factors that should help the mall. For instance,  the Glendale Galleria suffers from its own success, with parking and congestion  frequently a problem that will send people next door to Burbank, Bruning said.  The Media City Center's site alongside Interstate 5 offers easy access from the  San Fernando, San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys, he added.  </P> <P> Diana Novak, a marketing consultant for Haagen, also noted that the  entertainment industry -- an enormous presence in Burbank -- often does well  when the economy suffers. (The mall's name refers to the area's entertainment,  or media, district.) People look to the movies and other entertainment for  escape and as a less-expensive outlet than, say, a vacation, Novak said.  </P> <P> The city of Burbank has more at stake in the shopping mall than its pride.  Instead of buying the property, Haagen, a Manhattan Beach-based concern that  has built about 50 shopping centers over its 35-year history, leased the land  from the city for 95 years in exchange for giving the city 50% of its profit  from the project. Estimates show that the profit could be $1 million by 1996,  with half going to the city, Bruning said. If Haagen ever sells the center, the  city would get half of the proceeds.  </P> <P> Although signing up tenants for the shopping mall is going well, things are  moving much slower for the other elements of the 41-acre project.  </P> <P> No major tenant has yet signed up for the office space. The first tenant is  expected to sign on by early next year, said C. Drew Planting, senior broker at  Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the offices' leasing agent. The first office buildings  are expected to break ground next summer.  </P> <P> However, broker Zugsmith sees potential problems there as well. There's ample  office space in the area, and Lockheed Corp.'s departure from Burbank is adding  to it because firms that served Lockheed are cutting back or closing, he said.  </P> <P> As for the hotel, negotiations are under way with Sheraton, a unit of ITT  Corp., but that project also has not been finalized, Bruning said.  </P></p>

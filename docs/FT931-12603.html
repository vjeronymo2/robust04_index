			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE futures finished with gains of around Dollars 32 to Dollars 40 on key positions but were well below the day's highs as the market continued to experience a modest technical bounce after recent heavy losses. However, dealers said the rally had been relatively muted and it was quite possible that the downtrend would resume shortly. New York arabica coffee prices were ahead in late trading. London COCOA closed with pared gains; the market seems set for a period of range trading between Pounds 690-Pounds 700 and Pounds 740 a tonne for the March contract, dealers said. The weakness of sterling continued to underpin values. GOLD steadied on the London bullion market after Comex held downside support following early losses. But sentiment leaned towards the market drifting down to test the Dollars 330 a troy ounce level. Nymex PLATINUM prices were down on profit taking at midday. But continued concern over the availability of supply in the physical markets was limiting losses. Compiled from Reuters</p>

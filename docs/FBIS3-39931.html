			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang </F> Schaeuble by unidentified correspondent in Hamburg on 23  February -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Where does the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] stand after this party congress in Hamburg?    [Schaeuble] Well, despite some pessimistic predictions, at  this party congress -- just as in Berlin half a year ago -- the  CDU once again proved that it is cohesive; that with Helmut Kohl  it is determined to continue leading this country into a good  future, to complete Germany's unification, to overcome the  economic problems, to create work for all, and to guarantee  external peace and internal security. And we know that we can  do this best with Helmut Kohl.    [Reporter] This was also Helmut Kohl's party congress. Do  you think that his charisma, which has attracted the party here  in Hamburg, can also be conveyed to the outside?    [Schaeuble] Quite certainly, quite certainly. Helmut Kohl  is the chancellor of German unification. He has been the most  successful German chancellor for 12 years. It was Helmut Kohl's  party congress, and the CDU wants to win the 1994 elections with  Helmut Kohl so as to continue its work for Germany's future.</p>

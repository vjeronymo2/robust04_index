			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Angry workers vow to fight job cuts ONE thing that really irritates workers at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of Volkswagen, is that the parent German group even brought in soil when it built a new plant at Martorell, 35 kilometres west of the old Seat factory at Barcelona. 'VW changed the Spanish washroom taps at Martorell to German ones and laid down German earth for the gardens,' Mr Inocencio Jaramillo, a Seat union organiser, said yesterday at the main plant in Barcelona. He and the other 12,000 workers could soon be out of a job. The gleaming Martorell plant, opened earlier this year following a Pta244bn (Pounds 1.2bn) investment, was supposed to be the symbol of VW's future in Spain. The Barcelona factory, now more than 40 years old, is the obsolete symbol that VW would prefer to forget. Although the German group has not specified the closure of the Barcelona plant, it has indicated it wants stringent cuts in its loss-making Spanish subsidiary. It was the failure to deliver such cuts that led to the resignation of Seat's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, on Wednesday. Few at Seat doubt that the cuts mean the curtain will come down on the old plant but the Barcelona workers are quietly confident that their cause is not yet lost. 'VW simply cannot do it,' said Mr Jaramillo, a neatly dressed clerical worker who held court, surrounded by boiler-suited colleagues, in the basement offices set aside for union activities in the plant's main administration building. A group of Mr Jaramillo's colleagues were travelling yesterday to the VW headquarters at Wolfsburg for meetings with chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech. 'If he (Mr Piech) wants to close us down, he will be firmly told it is quite impossible. We represent a political cost that neither Volkswagen nor the Spanish government can pay for.' The quiet determination, however, masks a very real fear that the writing is indeed on the wall. The Barcelona plant was condemned just as soon as Martorell, with a labour force of 6,500, came on stream. Closure of Barcelona is such an emotional issue it can hardly be faced. The employees who crammed into the basement office have been with Seat almost from the start. At least half the Barcelona labour force is over 50 and all feel proprietorial about the company. 'If we go, it is the end of Seat as a company, as a trade mark, as an identity,' said 'Tomasn', who is a veteran, like Mr Jaramillo, of more than 20 years with the car manufacturer. 'From now on it will be just Volkwagen, perhaps that is what the Germans always intended.' Closure of the plant, which occupies a square kilometre of an industrial estate called the Zona Franca (freeport), south of the city, is also a stunning blow to Barcelona. 'We are the lungs of the Zona Franca, we keep it going,' said Mr Jaramillo. 'Some 40,000 indirect jobs will be affected by our closure.' If Seat, by far the largest employer on the estate, shuts down there will be extreme nervousness at neighbouring plants operated by Nissan and by a subsidiary of Fiat, both of which are making heavy losses. Seat's Barcelona workers promise 'strong, very strong, action', if the closure is forced through. At the very least they will bring Martorell to a 'standstill'.</p>

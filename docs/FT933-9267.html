			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Manchester Ship Canal shows 27% downturn to Pounds 5.7m MANCHESTER Ship Canal reported a 27 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 5.7m, for the half year to end-June. The result, which came from turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.5m), was struck after an exceptional credit of Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 960,000) relating to the release of a Pounds 1.58m provision for dredging the Mersey which is no longer required, less a charge of Pounds 1.1m in respect of voluntary severance costs. Last year, the directors pointed out, there was also a surplus of Pounds 2.1m from the sale of fixed assets at the Ellesmere Port container terminal. The company is 82.2 per cent-owned by Peel Holdings, the Rochdale-based property developer which is offering to buy out the minority for an eventual Pounds 33.50 per share. The offer has the support of Stancroft Trust, the largest outside shareholder. The company is expected to be absorbed into Peel and will lose its quotation. Earnings per share fell to 121.3p (182.5p).</p>

George Deukmejian's proposal to cut more than $485 million from  health and welfare services in the state's 1989-90 budget.  </P> <P> Supervisors unanimously approved the resolutions calling for the restoration of  funding that affects health-care programs for thousands of poor, disabled and  elderly Orange County residents.  </P> <P> Hardest hit by the governor's blueprint are county programs serving low-income  families and the medically indigent.  </P> <P> In recommending passage of the resolutions, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said  the county must "stand firm and fight for these programs or many county  residents will suffer."  </P></p>

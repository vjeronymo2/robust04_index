			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / ITV to pitch for lottery ratings ITV is seriously considering its own 'unofficial' National Lottery programme to counter the official live draw on BBC 1 every Saturday evening. The ITV network is saying nothing about its plans other than to insist that its viewers will be kept fully informed about the National Lottery that will start creating millionaires from November 19. ITV could simply scroll the winning numbers across the bottom of the screen while sticking to its existing schedule. But it is thought probable that ITV will put on a matching lottery-related programme. The signs that ITV intends to be competitive on what could be one of the top-rated programmes on British television came yesterday as Camelot, the National Lottery operator, and the BBC confirmed that they had signed a three-year contract. The BBC gave few details of the content of the programme but it did reveal the names of the regular presenters who will take over after the initial 'extravaganza' to be hosted by Noel Edmonds. They will be Anthea Turner, a presenter on GMTV, the commercial breakfast station, and Gordon Kennedy, the comic actor. After the opening draw the programme will be broadcast from venues all over the country. Mr Alan Yentob, controller of BBC 1, said yesterday he was not worried about a potential response from ITV. Mr Yentob said: 'This is the event, the real thing, and most people will want to watch that.' The lottery result will also be carried live on BBC Radio 1. The BBC will announce today details of a competition to find a member of the public to be the first person to press the button to start the machine that will draw the winning six numbers. The Pounds 1 tickets go on sale on November 14. If Camelot's forecasts are met, the lottery should have revenues of Pounds 32bn over seven years and raise a total of Pounds 9bn for the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport.</p>

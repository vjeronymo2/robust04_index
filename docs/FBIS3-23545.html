The Cossacks spoke with bitterness of the Russian  government's lack of effort toward reviving the Cossack society.  Far from all of the Cossack communities are being allocated land  for their yurts as called for in the ukase issued by the  President of the Russian Federation. Cossack self-government, a  unique form of true democracy and popular rights in the past,  has not been established in a single Cossack village.    The Cossacks are even more displeased by the way their  brothers are being treated in neighboring Kazakhstan. The  situation there is complex and tense. Indignation was aroused in  the Cossacks by the news that Kazakh nationalists have  desecrated the memorial to Ataman Yermak Timofeyevich, legendary  Russian explorer.    The large assembly of the Siberian Cossack Army approved a  message to the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, which  demands that they look into the situation and influence the  course of events.  <H5>  Cossacks Build Nuclear Submarines </H5>   Another Cossack company has joined the existing ones in  northern Russia. The charter of a Cossack association  established at the state center of Russian nuclear shipbuilding,  in the city of Severodvinsk, has been registered in the justice  department of the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration.    The association has a membership of around 60 Cossacks.  Their  ataman, V. Litvinov, works as a fitter/assembler in the  Sevmashpredpriyatiye production association, where Russia builds  its nuclear submarines.    The first constructive activity of the new association, with  which the Cossacks want to make themselves known to the city,  has been to help maintain public order on the streets. This  involves mounted patrols in Severodvinsk. The Pegas cooperative,  of which Cossack V. Manevskiy is chairman, presently has only  five horses which can be ridden by the Cossacks. That is true,  but as they say, where there is a Cossack, a horse will be  found. -- Vladimir Gundarov  <H5>  Where Are the Stirrups on a Tank? </H5>   A small Cossack assembly of the Yekaterinburg Division of  the  Orenburg Cossack Army discussed the establishment of a Cossack  formation out of one of the formations of the Ural Military  District.    It is planned to form the Cossack battalion in the spring of  1994 as a Guards tank formation. The battalion is being  established in accordance with the ukase issued by the President  of the Russian Federation on 15 March 1993, and members of the  Ural Cossack community will serve in it. The Sverdlovsk Oblast  Military Commissariat has confirmed that the proper orders have  been issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the  Russian Federation.    It is symbolic that the formation in which the Cossacks will  be serving traveled a glorious combat path during the Great  Patriotic War as cavalrymen, replacing their battle horses with  tanks following the war. -- Leonid Mikhaylov</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Rumors spread through  Jerusalem last night that Prime Minister Rabin had recently met  with Jordan's King Husayn. This followed a report broadcast on  Israel's second television channel that the two leaders last  week held talks in Washington. When later asked by reporters if  a meeting with King Husayn took place, Rabin responded: I did  not meet him this week. Sources close to the prime minister  refused to deny or confirm the report. The Prime Minister's  Office would not comment on the matter. Sources in Washington  said Rabin had not been in the United States since last March.    Meanwhile, the office of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has  denied claims that he met King Husayn earlier this month in  Europe. Knesset Member Ra'anan Kohen raised the question two  days ago in the Knesset.</p>

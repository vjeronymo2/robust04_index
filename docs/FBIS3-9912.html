The federal government must urgently invest  more funds in this sector, or it will be difficult for Mexico to  achieve sustained economic development.    According to the Association's study, the infrastructure in  its current state will require sufficient funds, a desire to  produce, and time to develop projects. This represents a  challenge for the public and private sectors as they must play a  more active role in this area.    The report added that despite the advancements made by the  current government, it is necessary to redouble efforts. As we  approach the 21st century, there will be approximately 100  million Mexicans whose demands for infrastructure and  communications services will rapidly grow.    "Much remains to be done to expand investments and improve  services. Federal, state, and municipal authorities,  businessmen, and workers must share the responsibility. Neither  the government nor the private sector can carry out the  modernization alone, the report noted.    In assessing the condition of the highway system, the  Canacintra document said that maintenance of that system and of  rural roads has been lagging for years. It adds that there are  not enough roads in some parts of the country, there is lack of  security in cargo and passenger transportation, and high tolls  keep traffic flow on the largest freeways below capacity.    There are plans to channel sufficient and timely fiscal  resources to the maintenance of prioritized stretches of the  federal highway system. There are also plans to improve  concession guidelines based on "realistic financial analyses,"  in addition to reinforcing the training and moralization of the  Federal Highway Police and supplying adequate equipment.    In analyzing public transportation, the report notes that  the  equipment is obsolete, the service lacks "overall quality," very  little is known about the contents of the new regulation on  weights and measures, and there is limited standardization of  cargo handling.    In view of the importance of this activity, Canacintra has  recommended that the federal government encourage equipment  upgrades and reconsider the deadlines for implementing the  regulations on weights and dimensions, which should then be  published.    The analysis also included railroads, ports,  telecommunications, and the national electricity service, areas  in which we are lagging behind and which therefore require  attention so the productivity of enterprises is not negatively  affected when they are facing international competition.    The report added that expanding the infrastructure will  encourage the proper use of competitive advantages already  enjoyed by some productive activities in the country and will  reduce inequalities in regional development.    Finally, the analysis says that focusing on areas where we  are behind, deregulating various areas, allowing private capital  to play a more active role with the public sector, improving  regulations, and expanding channeled fiscal resources are key  factors in modernizing the infrastructure to strengthen Mexico's  competitive position in the international community.</p>

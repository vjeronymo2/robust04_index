			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Listless in London Post-election euphoria in the UK seems to be wearing off. Investors may be in no mood to sell equities, but it is hard to see just what will provide the foundation for a new leg to the current bull market. A fresh cut in UK interest rates appears to be off the agenda for the moment, and as cautious statements from the likes of Guinness, Reckitt and Coleman, and Thorn EMI underlined this week signs of economic recovery are depressingly few and far between. Another reason for caution, indeed, is the fact that year on year dividend growth achieved by companies in the All Share Index has dropped below 2 per cent, rather less than expectations just a few months ago. Current forecasts for 1992 earnings growth are almost certainly pinning too much on a second-half recovery, something which could well be confirmed in the next few weeks before companies go into purdah ahead of the September reporting season. The downside to shares looks limited at current levels - but it may be that US earners and defensive stocks like utilities will swing temporarily back into fashion.</p>

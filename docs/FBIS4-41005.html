			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX a high-ranking officer  of the Russian Navy Staff commented on the proposal of the  speaker of the Ukrainian parliament Aleksandr Moroz to set up a  joint command of Russian and Ukrainian fleets in the Black Sea  and said it requires serious clarification.    If NATO is used as a model, Moscow could closely study, for  instance, the appointment of a supreme commander of naval forces  in the Black Sea who would be an operational commander of both  fleets, the officer said. He added that in this case the  supreme commander would be appointed by Russia.    In his opinion another option is also possible: the  operational subordination of the Ukrainian navy to the Black Sea  Fleet.    Earlier Ukraine had insisted on the approval of a supreme  commander by the presidents of the two countries. The commander  was supposed to have one deputy from Ukraine and another from  Russia.</p>

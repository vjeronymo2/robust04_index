			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RECESSION, MOST WOULD SAY, IS ALREADY BEING FELT;  </P> <P> IN REAL ESTATE, SELLERS TAKING BIG PRICE CUTS  </P> <P> Therese Marcus, a real estate agent with Prudential California Realty in  Sherman Oaks, was the top performer in her office last year. As recently as  June, she expected her 1990 sales volume to match that of 1989.  </P> <P> But Marcus said the economy seems to have taken a turn for the worse in the  past few months. Even though she's spending more time and money marketing  properties, she now expects to finish the year about 30% below last year's  gross.  </P> <P>  "I think it's an uncertainty and uneasiness. There's the Middle East crisis,  and people have been pounded over the head with budget problems and the idea  that we're going into a recession.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind that real estate is already in a recession. I  sense it more in the last six weeks than anything else. I have $7 million of  inventory on the market. But I'm not getting calls. I'm not having showings.  </P> <P> "I have seven houses on the market. I get offers for 15% to 30% below the  asking price. If you really want to move your property, you're taking big cuts  in what you're asking.  </P> <P> "I put a property on the market on Labor Day of last year for $509,000. From  September to December we had four offers, all between $450,000 and $485,000,  all rejected by the seller. That property is still on the market today, 13  months later, and it's down to $489,000. I can give you dozens of cases like  that.  </P> <P> "I'm probably having a very good year compared to other people." PATRICE  APODACA  </P></p>

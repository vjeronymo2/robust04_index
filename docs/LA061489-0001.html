			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ACCORD REACHED ON TEACHING TAGALOG IN SOUTHEAST  </P> <P> Filipino-American students at Bell Junior High School in Southeast San Diego  will be able to take a second-year course in the Pilipino national language,  Tagalog, this fall at nearby Morse High School, under a compromise reached  Tuesday by San Diego city schools trustees.  </P> <P> The board acted quickly to try to defuse a simmering dispute between the large  Filipino community around the two schools and Morse Principal Virginia Foster,  who had decided not to offer a continuation of the pilot first-year Tagalog  course begun this school year at Bell. Most Bell students matriculate to Morse.  </P> <P> Trustees accepted a proposal drawn up hastily Tuesday by schools Supt. Tom  Payzant after a decision by almost 100 students and parents of the Filipino  community to picket the school district's administration center and to press  for a public hearing about their concerns. Under the plan, ninth-graders from  Bell who took Tagalog this year will be eligible for a second-year course at  Morse to be given at 7 a.m., an hour before school normally starts. The Bell  teacher will head the course at Morse.  </P> <P> Payzant also said that administrators will work with Bell and Morse principals  and teachers to create a permanent Tagalog curriculum for possible  implementation in the fall of 1990. But he also scolded some Filipino speakers  for making Foster a major target of their anger, saying that she had had  legitimate questions about setting up a second-year course and that Bell  administrators shared blame for not talking earlier with their Morse  counterparts about continuing the language study.  </P> <P> Foster is black, and district administrators have acknowledged that there is  black-Filipino community tension at several Southeast schools such as Bell and  Morse, whose student populations have changed during the past decade from being  predominantly black to having a Filipino plurality.  </P> <P> Bell is 42% Filipino, 23% white, 17% Latino and 15% black. Morse is 33%  Filipino, 29% black, 16% white and 15% Latino. The high school receives  students both from Bell and from Keiller Middle School, which is 44% black.  </P> <P> Bell Principal Joene Bruhn started the pilot course after several  Filipino-American teachers and parents expressed interest in having their  children learn their cultural language. Tagalog is accepted as a foreign  language for college admission by the University of California and California  State University systems, provided two or more years are completed  satisfactorily at the secondary level.  </P> <P> Although originally intended for all students at Bell no matter their grade  level, Bruhn had to restrict enrollment to 40 ninth-graders because so many  students wanted to study Tagalog, she said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We could have filled two classes," Bruhn said. The priority for ninth-graders  also created the problem leading to the tension that culminated at Tuesday's  meeting, a point Payzant emphasized in his comments.  </P> <P> "I guess we assumed that Morse would be eager to start a (second-year) course  for the students who would be in the 10th grade next fall," Bruhn said. "Maybe  we didn't communicate as well as we should have to Morse."  </P> <P> But Filipino community leaders said Tuesday that Foster expressed little  interest in setting up such a course and raised many questions about the  curriculum and about who would teach Tagalog, concerns that they saw as  roadblocks. Foster did not return phone calls Tuesday or attend the board  meeting, and several Filipino spokesmen complained that the principal was  uncommunicative with them during the past several weeks.  </P> <P> Rolando Cruz, a school district psychologist and former counselor at Bell, said  that "the principal at Morse seems reluctant to start a course . . . she should  have known that the kids would want the course, but the needs of the community  are not being met. She is not sensitive to the needs of the Pilipino culture."  </P> <P> However, several black parents active at Morse on Tuesday complained privately  that Tagalog is not a legitimate language compared to Spanish, Japanese or  French, which they believe are more attractive to students of all ethnicities.  </P> <P> Both Payzant and school trustees disputed the assertion, saying that courses in  Pilipino language and culture should attract more than just Filipino students,  especially if they become a permanent part of the curriculum.  </P> <P> "I think there could be a strong desire for such courses in the Mira Mesa area  as well," board member Jim Roache said.  </P> <P> But trustee Shirley Weber made a clear reference to concerns of black parents,  saying, "I would hate to see us develop a curriculum that meets the needs of  only a specific group . . . any language that we put in should be a language  that everyone can learn . . . otherwise, we are being isolationist (that will)  increase ethnic tension in our schools."  </P> <P> Trustee Kay Davis spoke for a majority of the board in saying that long-range  plans will be drawn up during the upcoming year for a Tagalog curriculum. Davis  said that Bell might want to offer first- and second-year Tagalog while Morse  might offer three years of the language to strengthen student transcripts for  college.  </P> <P> Bruhn of Bell said she foresees second-year Tagalog at her school within a year  or two. Beverly Foster, area superintendent for the Bell and Morse area (and no  relation to Principal Foster), said Tuesday that Morse administrators "are  receptive" to first- and second-year Tagalog at their school starting in the  fall of 1990, which will allow more time for planning.  </P> <P> "That will allow us to have the benefits from the model and will make it easier  for non-Filipino students to have a chance to take the language as well,"  Beverly Foster said. She said also that the Morse principal probably did not  consider Tagalog a "high priority" for this fall because of the need to  implement the district's new core curriculum on a schoolwide basis next year.  </P> <P> That core curriculum will require all students to take college-preparatory  English, math/science and social studies courses to improve the overall level  of high school study. It is forcing principals at all secondary schools to be  more selective about what elective courses are offered in language and fine  arts.  </P> <P> "Also, let's face it, nobody likes to be pressured into offering a particular  course," Beverly Foster said, "and this got caught up in community tensions."  </P></p>

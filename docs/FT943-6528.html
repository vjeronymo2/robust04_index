			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Sibley - magic of Hong Kong Nicholas Sibley, the deputy chairman charged with launching the investment banking joint venture between National Westminster Bank and Wheelock, the Hong Kong trading house, makes no bones about the primary attraction of his new role: it's based in the Far East, writes Louise Lucas. Hong Kong's magic first bit him in 1972, when he became director of Jardine Fleming, the broking arm which is jointly owned by Robert Fleming - with which Sibley had spent the previous two years - and Jardine Matheson, the colony's oldest hong. Eleven years later he found himself back with parent Robert Fleming in London, but discovered the city was a very changed place: 'It was the old problem of relative decline and what happens as a result.' There was envy to contend with too: 'Everyone rather resented the fact that you had spent time overseas while they had lived through the Wilson and Callaghan socialist paradises and had just found themselves getting poorer.' So in 1986 he joined Barclays de Zoete Wedd, later becoming chairman of the group's Asia Pacific operation. He joined Wheelock as managing director of Wheelock CIC in February of this year. He retains the jovial demeanour and impeccable qualifications of a Jardine man - educated at Trinity College, Oxford, doing his national service as second lieutenant with the VIII King's Royal Irish Hussars and training as an accountant. But he is finding today's Hong Kong somewhat different from the early 1970s. There are more strange faces and not so many cocktail parties; instead, work takes up a lot of his time. He has no problem at all with 1997, viewing it even as a slight plus: 'We'll get rid of all the political nonsense that's been developed here over the past couple of years'. (A time span corresponding to Patten's tenure and introduction of an extended democracy.) His trips to China are few but illuminating: 'You don't expect to find yourself suddenly, at the age of 56, in a karaoke bar in Chengdu, but anything in the pursuit of business.' His immediate tasks are to recruit a chief executive officer for Wheelock NatWest, due to be launched around the turn of the year, and then divisional heads. After so long in the world of investment banking, he is confident he will know every name on the headhunters' shortlists.</p>

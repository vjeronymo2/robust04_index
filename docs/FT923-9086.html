			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Get rid of lower power heritage Sir, I note with something approaching delight that decision time seems to be approaching for Battersea Power Station ('View that became a valuer's nightmare', August 5). In particular, I am pleased to see that commercial reality has all but overcome English Heritage's fundamentally daft idea of preserving this industrial-age monstrosity (famous only for its appearance with flying pigs on the cover of a Pink Floyd record). It blights the tree-filled beauty of nearby Battersea Park and is a chronic waste of riverside. By all means preserve industrial architecture and technology which can teach people something of the industrial past, eg the Steam Museum opposite Kew, but Battersea Power Station a rival to Paris Euro Disney? Come off it] Mr David Mellor, the heritage minister, needs to reverse this dotty idea immediately and allow the true value of the land to be released through development for the benefit of those who truly treasure the Thames riverside.

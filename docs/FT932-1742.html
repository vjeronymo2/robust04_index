			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Why we should stop worrying and learn to love EMU - Economics ONE MONEY FOR EUROPE: THE ECONOMICS AND POLITICS OF MAASTRICHT by Malcolm Crawford Macmillan Pounds 45, 363 pages 'IN THE interests of the people of western Europe, leaving aside considerations of nostalgia or Euro-political grandiosity, economic and monetary union is to be welcomed.' That is the principal conclusion of this useful book. Malcolm Crawford concludes not merely that EMU will be beneficial, even though 'the benefits are unlikely to be huge', but also that it 'will almost certainly be implemented'. People should, in short, stop worrying and learn to love EMU. As a former economics editor of the Sunday Times, the author is just the person to unravel the complexities and calm the contention surrounding Emu. On the whole, he succeeds. The literature on EMU has become vast. But this book is a valuable addition. Busy business people will find answers within its to most of the questions about EMU they might have. Inevitably, the book has flaws. It is, for example, already out of date in some respects, since most of it was written before the ERM's recent crisis. Yet much of it stands. The author would argue, for example, that this turbulence merely reinforces his view that the ERM is best thought of as 'a transitional expedient to EMU'. Other important faults are that the book is too long and too expensive. Even though there is a good summary, a skilled journalist like Mr Crawford should have what he has to say down to some 200 pages. Despite the book's length, it has omissions: the implications of German unification are slighted, as are the workings of the sclerotic European labour market. The latter is particularly surprising, since changes in the long term competitiveness of Europe's regions would, in the absence of exchange rate adjustability, largely depend on alterations in relative nominal wages. The book is divided into two main parts. The first covers the background to EMU and includes the history of the EC's monetary arrangements, the economics of exchange rates and the workings of the ERM. The discussion of the economics of exchange rates is good, though whether the author will be able to convince British readers of the user-friendliness even of his simple mathematics must be doubtful, since many of them will not have looked at an equation since they were 15. Also commendable is the book's honesty about the alleged achievements of the ERM. Mr Crawford notes, for example, that 'the four EC countries that achieved the best economic performance (during the 1980s) displayed the least adhesion to the 'nominal anchor''. He concludes too that 'there is little evidence that the reduction of inflation, which all EC countries have achieved, has been the result of the ERM, or that if it was, the cost of reducing it has been lessened by the ERM.' The second part of the book is all about EMU. It covers the history of the Maastricht treaty, EMU's economic implications, the convergence criteria, the European System of Central Banks, EMU's implications for financial institutions and for fiscal and regional policy, the role of the UK and the question of federalism. Among EMU's benefits, the author lists greater convenience for the citizens of the EC, increased competition among EC firms, creation of an integrated EC-wide payments system, more active financial markets and elimination of German monetary hegemony. An important point he makes is the superiority of EMU to the ERM because of its greater credibility. 'The markets generally know,' he correctly insists, 'that the most devalued currency of all in economic policy is the promise of a minister that he will never devalue.' Where the author is most critical is of the convergence criteria. It is not that he doubts the need for some such criteria, but he rightly questions the relevance of the interest rate condition, the emphasis on price (rather than labour cost) inflation and the limit on budget deficits to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Probably the most justifiable of all the criteria is that on ratios of public debt to GDP, but this, it appears, is the one most likely to be ignored, largely for the political reason that it would exclude Belgium from EMU. How far the author's positive assessment of EMU is justified is debatable. It is impossible even to be confident that EMU will happen, but should it not do so the blow to the EC's credibility could well prove terminal. Unfortunately, achievement of EMU could also prove terminal, since it would, whatever Mr Crawford says, put additional strains on the political legitimacy of EC institutions. The failure to understand this point is among the book's more important weaknesses. For Mr Crawford, the division of political responsibilities is just a matter of efficiency. Things are not that simple. Efficiency is in the eye of the beholder. What matters at least as much is the legitimacy of decision-making institutions. There are sound economic and political reasons for questioning the wisdom of EMU. But their force depends on the alternatives. In the UK, it appears, the alternative is someone like the present chancellor of the exchequer, who is apparently determined to restart the British go-stop cycle. Mr Clarke is a Europhile. Perhaps his secret plan is to demonstrate to the sceptical British that EMU, for all its risks, would be far better than continued management of their monetary affairs by the wallies of Westminster.</p>

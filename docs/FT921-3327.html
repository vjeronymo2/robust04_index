			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Lloyd's in fresh drive to raise cash from members LLOYD'S of London, the insurance market, is taking special measures to raise cash from members who have been refusing to pay money, or to meet cash calls, needed to cover losses. It has served formal notice on members who have received cash calls that it will draw down on funds held on deposit or on bank guarantees and letters of credit to make up any missing money. A letter dated March 9 sent to Names, the individuals who supply the capital to the market, by Lloyd's membership department based at Chatham, Kent, says: 'You will be aware that a number of recent cash calls have met with a poor response. Accordingly it is necessary to take special measures in order to accelerate the normal process for the release of Names' deposits to syndicate funds.' It continues: 'By formal resolution, the Council of Lloyd's decided on March 4 to pursue this action on a blanket basis'. An accompanying letter warns Names that, if necessary, 'the Council may, without giving further notice to you, take steps to draw down on your deposit for the necessary amount'. Some 700 Names represented by Mr Michael Freeman, a London solicitor, are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on the deposits all Names must lodge with their agents when they join. The main letter specifically mentions this legal action as a cause of 'additional delays' in raising cash from Names. A Lloyd's official said, however, that the blanket demand for payment did not apply to those names represented by Mr Freeman, since a court undertaking has frozen their deposits until the case is heard later this month. The official accepted there was a risk that this special demand for payment could drive other Names to join Mr Freeman's action. He described the letters as 'precautionary tactics'. He did not know how many Names were affected though it is believed the number could run into thousands. Lloyd's is asking members' agents to forward the formal notice only to those Names in arrears on cash calls, or without enough cash in their special or personal reserves to meet the calls outstanding. The notice is being sent to Names who have applied to Lloyd's Hardship Committee for help, 'pending the outcome of their application'. The managers of the syndicates formerly run by Gooda Walker, which have suffered particularly bad losses, have been unable to collect Pounds 20m of a Pounds 136m cash call made last year, and have made little progress in collecting Pounds 101m called this month. A third letter to Names says: 'You are only required to pay the amount of the outstanding call(s), and accordingly the Council will only draw down on your deposit to the extent that it receives formal written notification from your underwriting agent(s) that you have failed to pay a cash call in full or part.' The cash calls are needed for the most part to meet reinsurance claims by other syndicates, not to pay the original insurance claims. Names on syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire face a bill of more than Pounds 700m, over half the market's total loss for 1989. Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's the US credit rating agency, infuriated officials at the Lloyd's Corporation by saying it was concerned that Lloyd's might face a liquidity crisis, or cash shortage. Lloyd's dismissed the fears as unfounded. It says that its assets of Pounds 18bn exceed liabilities by Pounds 6bn and that many liabilities arise from claims which may in some cases not fall due until well into the next century.</p>

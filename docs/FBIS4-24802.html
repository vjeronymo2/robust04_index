			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Glorious Obligation, A Common </F> Duty--Commemorating 10th Anniversary of Promulgation of PRC  Conscription Law"]    [Text] Today we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the  promulgation of the PRC Conscription Law with the aim of making  everyone understand that enlisting in the armed forces according  to this law is the glorious obligation of every citizen and that  showing concern for and supporting national defense construction  is the common duty of the entire society.    The Conscription Law now in force was reformulated and  promulgated in light of China's new situation of reform, opening  up, and economic construction. Practice has proved that this  military service law prominently characterized by a military  service system which takes compulsory service as the main  component while integrating compulsory and voluntary service and  militia and reserve service, corresponds with China's national  and military conditions. It bears outstanding Chinese  characteristics and is thus warmly supported by the people of  all nationalities in the country and the commanders and soldiers  of the entire armed forces. In the last 10 years, all  localities have conscientiously implemented the Conscription  Law; have made efforts for the fulfillment of enlistments in  military service, militia, and reserve forces; have done well in  providing special care for disabled soldiers and their families;  and have effectively supported national defense construction as  well as the building up of the armed forces. In particular,  with regard to work concerning military service, all localities  have strengthened their leadership, enthusiastically conducted  propagation and education on the Conscription Law, actively  formulated and improved local conscription regulations, and paid  close attention to improving the personnel contingent involved  in conscription work, thus reliably ensuring the quality of new  recruits. The saying "when a family member joins the armed  forces the whole family is honored" prevails in society.  Officers and men of the Liberation Army and the Armed Police  Force, in accordance with the provisions of the Conscription  Law, have performed their duties in a trustworthy manner and  trained hard for better military skills, thus making prominent  contributions to defending the country as well as to  safeguarding and supporting socialist modernization. The militia  and reserve forces have taken an active part in military  training, performed tactical duties, and played an important  role in maintaining social stability and carrying out the two  civilizations. These remarkable jobs have effectively promoted  national defense construction and the armed forces buildup.    In the new situation of deepening reform and establishing  the  socialist market economy structure, better implementation of the  Conscription Law has important, practical bearings on  strengthening the people's national defense awareness, on  improving their consciousness in joining the armed forces  according to the law, and on carrying forward the spirit of  patriotism and revolutionary heroism. How should we properly  implement the Conscription Law? We should first rely on the  legal system and secondly on education. At present, we should  change our concepts and work style and transform the habit of  working mainly by administrative means under the planned economy  structure into the habit of working mainly by legal means under  the socialist market economy structure. This is to ensure  national defense construction and the building up of the armed  forces. The Conscription Law is a basic law in China's military  system and serves as an important legal basis for national  defense construction and the building up of the armed forces.  In the course of establishing a socialist market economic  structure, all localities and armed forces units should continue  to propagate and implement the Conscription Law so that we can  abide by this law in national defense construction and building  up the armed forces and embark on the track of the legal system.    Strengthening national defense education and improving the  people's national defense mentality are the ideological basis  for implementing the Conscription Law properly. In recent  years, localities have introduced various methods in  strengthening national defense education and improving the  people's national defense mentality. This has played an  important role in promoting the implementation of the  Conscription Law. However, we should also understand that  because efforts are being concentrated on socialist  modernization, and because of the prolonged period of peace,  particularly in this new situation when the socialist market  economic structure is being established, some people's national  defense mentality has weakened to such an extent that they  cannot correctly handle the relationship between economic  construction and national defense construction or the  relationship between individual interests, collective interests,  and state interests. Therefore, we should, in light of specific  conditions and with the purposes in mind, conduct education on  national defense, on joining the armed forces, and on patriotism  among cadres, masses, officers, soldiers, militiamen, and  personnel of the reserve forces. This education will enable  everyone to understand the basic provisions of the Conscription  Law; understand that strengthening the building up of the armed  forces and improving national defense are important aspects of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; understand that  economic construction is the basis of national defense  construction, whereas national defense construction serves as a  guarantee for economic construction and that the two are  complementary to each other; and understand that without the  country, there would not be a home and that individual and  collective interests should be subordinated to the state's  interests. Everyone should know that national defense mentality  is an important manifestation of patriotism. In propagating  patriotism and a spirit of selfless devotion, the people should  strengthen their national defense mentality and consciously and  actively fulfill their military service obligations. In short,  if a good job is done in national defense education and  improving the people's national defense mentality, a fine  atmosphere will be created in which the entire society will care  for and support national defense construction and building up  the armed forces and all officers and soldiers will devote  themselves to national defense construction.    Let us hold high the banner of patriotism; further study,  propagate, and implement the Conscription Law; and make greater  contributions to strengthening national defense construction and  the building up of the armed forces.</p>

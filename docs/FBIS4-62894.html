			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 May, members of the official Bulgarian  delegation who are on a visit to Almaty in connection with  Bulgaria in Kazakhstan Days, were received by Deputy Prime  Minister Sergey Kulagin. Zakhariy Zakhariyev, the head of the  Bulgarian delegation, deputy of the People's Assembly of  Bulgaria, and chairman of the Federation of Friendship with the  peoples of Russia and CIS, noted that meetings held in the  previous days with representatives of the government, business  circles, and public movements of Kazakhstan allowed him to  establish contacts which will give a new impact to the relations  between the two countries. He spoke about a number of  particular projects aimed at setting up joint ventures. In  particular the Bulgarian side developed a program of cooperation  in the field of the defense industry, setting up of a large  transport enterprise, and in the manufacturing of cigarettes.  Kulagin said all the projects would be examined by specialists.  Kazakhstan in its turn also has proposals to expand business  partnership with Bulgaria and will submit these proposals for  consideration by the Bulgarian side.    On the same day the delegation was received by Foreign  Minister Kanat Saudabayev. He stressed that the visit of the  president of Bulgaria Zhelu Zhelev to Kazakhstan last year had a  powerful impact on the development of bilateral relations. Now  a possibility exists to fill with real substance all the  agreements on increasing economic contacts between our states.    Valentin Gatsinski, the Bulgarian first deputy foreign  minister, expressed hope that in the near future our countries  would exchange embassies. He recalled the words of renowned  economists of the world that the shortest way between the new  technology of the West and the richest potential of Eurasia goes  through Kazakhstan. The members of the Bulgarian delegation  passed on to the Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan a draft  intergovernmental agreement prepared by them on avoiding double  taxation.</p>

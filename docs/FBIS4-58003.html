			<p>BFN     [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National  Civilian Police (PNC), has confirmed he has received death  threats and that 15 days ago he was the target of an attempt on  his life.    "These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand  the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced  in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey  said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening  phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He  added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is  responsible.    The PNC director said that some of the threats have already  been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target  of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of  this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have  never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been  armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so  as not to ignore these threats," he added.    Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers,  drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been  illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be  responsible for the threats. Monterrey denied that the PNC is  becoming militarized, and he said the best witness of the  process is Onusal [UN Observers For El Salvador], whose members  have participated in the evaluation of the personnel joining the  PNC.    He explained that, up to the PNC's 13th graduation class,  the  PNC filled 20 percent of the openings with individuals who had  been members of the National Police, as was established in the  Peace Agreements, but that from then on, these individuals have  not joined the PNC.    Nevertheless, the director of the PNC, which was established  by the Peace Agreements, said that at this 20th recruitment call  the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] has been  unable to complete its 20 percent, although it still has time to  fill it.    According to Monterrey, the middle level ranks of the PNC  are  filled by persons who have obtained the best scores in their  evaluations, so now there can be no discrimination.    The PNC is carrying out its functions in 12 of the country's  14 departments, and it is estimated that by the end of October  it will be doing so throughout the country with 5,700 members.    President Alfredo Cristiani has rejected FMLN charges that  the government is trying to militarize the PNC and proposed the  creation of a commission to verify this.    Cristiani said the government and the FMLN agreed over the  weekend that the demobilization of the National Police will be  extended until 31 March 1995, because the PNC is still unable to  face the increase in crime.    He added that they also agreed that an additional number of  former National Police members, in excess of the 20 percent  established by the Peace Agreements, can enter the PNC following  an evaluation and training.</p>

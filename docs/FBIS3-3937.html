			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The construction of  the controversial Daliushu Hydropower Plant on the Huanghe River  in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is urged to  start as soon as possible.    More than 60 experts called for an early start of the  construction at a meeting organized by the China Association for  Science and Technology, which closed here Thursday [17 March].    The opinion of the experts agrees with that of deputies from  Ningxia, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia, who have put forward the  same suggestion to the ongoing session of the Eighth National  People's Congress.    Experts at the association's meeting, including noted  academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhang Zongyou,  Ma Zongjin and Li Tingdong, hold that the construction of a  hydropower plant at Daliushu in the Heishan Gorge, on the upper  reaches of the Huanghe River, is feasible both technologically  and economically.    The experts said that the loose rock base at the proposed  reservoir covers only part of the area and is superficial. It  poses no major difficulty for construction or safety.    In fact, the experts pointed out that loose rock has been  handled successfully at power plants both in China and abroad.    Feasibility studies of the plant in the past decades have  been accompanied by controversies over whether there should be  two lower dams at Xiaoguanyin in Gansu Province and Daliushu in  Ningxia, or only one high dam at Daliushu.    The high dam plan won the argument in November, 1991, when  an  experts group of the Ministry of Water Resources conducted  studies in geology, construction, investment and irrigation.    According to the final plan approved by the State Council,  the Daliushu plant will have a 160 meter high dam and a  reservoir containing 1.1 million cu m of water. The generating  sets will have a capacity of two million kw, generating 7.8  billion kwh of electricity a year.    The water of the reservoir will be able to irrigate 400,000  ha of farmland in the region in the short term, and more than  one million ha in the long run.    It will also supply abundant water resources to the energy  and chemical industries in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Inner  Mongolia, and cleaner water to hundreds of thousands of local  people who are suffering from a too-high fluorine content in  their drinking water.    As the construction of the plant is of great significance to  the development of western China and has been put on the agenda  by the State Council in its plan for China's agricultural  development in the 1990s, the experts urged that it should be  started as soon as possible.</p>

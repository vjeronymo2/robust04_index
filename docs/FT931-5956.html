			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic indicators push Dow up sharply Wall Street AFTER A hesitant opening, US markets posted sharp gains yesterday, aided by stronger than expected leading economic indicators, heavy demand for RJR Nabisco shares, and a surge of late program buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.12 at 3,400.53, its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 5.89 to 447.90, while the American SE composite finished 2.53 ahead at 410.07 and the Nasdaq composite 8.21 stronger at 677.72. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 270m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,268 to 635. Prices slipped initially, primarily in reaction to weak bond prices. But the bond market was responding to generally positive news for equities - an unexpected 0.1 per cent rise in January's index of leading economic indicators, which analysts said bode well for both the employment outlook and corporate earnings. Analysts also noted some technical features which revealed the underlying strength in equities, notably that in the past eight trading sessions the number of advancing stocks has totalled more than 1,000 every day. Prices were also helped later in the day by news of strong late-January stores sales, by a surge in computer-guided program buying during the final hour of business, and by heavy trading in the shares of RJR Nabisco. The food and tobacco group announced plans to create a separate group of shares targeted to performance of its worldwide food businesses through a Dollars 1.5bn initial public offering of stock. The plan was warmly greeted by investors, who bid up RJR stock Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 as nearly 13m shares changed hands in busy trading. Kmart rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 in volume of 1.9m shares after the retailing group announced record fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 535m, up from Dollars 479m a year ago. Elsewhere in the sector, Wal-Mart firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 and JC Penney rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 81 3/8 . Knight-Ridder fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 after securities house Kidder Peabody lowered its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold', citing concern about the information group's revenues and costs. On the Nasdaq market, medical related stocks, recently battered by worries about the implications for corporate earnings of planned healthcare reform, bounced back. Biogen rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 31, Chiron added Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 52, SciMed Life put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 48 and Heart Technology firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 18. Canada THE TORONTO market ended a three-day losing streak, closing higher after further heavy trading. The TSE 300 index improved 13.5 to 3,446.2, although rises led falls by only 315 to 311. Volume rose to 52.8m shares from Monday's 42.7m. Yesterday's volume included a block trade of about 2.1m Curragh shares, representing 12.9 per cent of the company's outstanding shares. The price of the block was off 80 cents from Monday's closing price. Curragh said in a press release that it knew of no reason for the decline in the stock, which lost 45 cents at 85 cents.</p>

As an observer at the  recent elections in the Republic of Moldova, the PD-FSN believes  that the opposition parties have been systematically hampered in  addressing the electorate, while the ruling party, with the  support of the presidency, benefited from unlimited access to  the television station.    The communique points out that the organization, a week  after  the election and during the absence of observers, of the  sociological poll entitled Consulting the People, is viewed as  something futile and the possible transformation of the poll  into a referendum on the basis of a presidential decree is  inacceptable.</p>

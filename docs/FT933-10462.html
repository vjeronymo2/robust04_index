			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: Ethos of vans, doors and Bosnia - Television In the second week of July, according to the BARB ratings, 'Other Viewing', which means programmes on satellite and cable, achieved its highest share ever in Britain: 6.6 per cent. So conventional terrestrial television - BBC, ITV and Channel 4 - still accounted for 93.4 per cent. Thus the notion which now appears to obsess the chattering classes within the mass media, that we are in the middle of a new age of multiple choice which is baffling and fragmenting the audience, seems a teeny bit questionable. Of course this does not stop the broadcasters behaving as though the notion is a fact, and one of their favourite ways of attempting to resist the supposed fragmentation is 'theming': dedicating a whole evening to programmes about food, flinging together two dozen programmes about dinosaurs, or, as on Channel 4 at present, devoting a whole week to programmes about 'Bloody Bosnia' - pun fully intended. At first the idea seemed admirable. Thanks to bitty and repetitive coverage of violent activity in what was Yugoslavia, television has produced a weariness in many viewers; a tendency to mutter 'a plague on all your houses and your medieval mentality'. The sight of yet another reporter in a flak jacket standing in front of yet another burned out Balkan village has become the signal to change channels. Surely this uncharitable and obscurantist reaction might be changed by a more intelligent, analytical and historical approach to the subject. 'Bloody Bosnia' could be just what was needed. Yet a combination of pre-viewing and viewing off-air at the start of this themed week leaves doubts. The whole thing could backfire and leave us more sick of the subject than ever. It seemed odd to begin with a lecture by currency manipulator George Soros, of all people, on ethics. Still, to be fair, he can claim to have spent some of the millions he made in speculating against the pound and the dollar on liberal and humane charities in the area in question. Moreover the idea underlying his Opinions programme was wholly laudable: that we need a new world order based on 'the open society where no dogma has a monopoly, where the individual is not at the mercy of the state, and where minorities and minority opinions are respected'. But as the season continues one's patience starts to thin. In some cases such as the Essential Guide series (Part 2 last night, Part 3 tomorrow) it is the style, with its flickering captions, head-and-shoulder inlays, and general tone of 'Look at me I'm in charge of graphics' which irritates and distracts from the content. In other instances it is the message: Guardian reporter Maggie O'Kane made it utterly clear in Sunday's Frontline that she sees Slobodan Milosevic in particular and the Serbs in general as the demons of the piece. But did her silence on the Moslems indicate that she thought them blameless? In other places Western liberals tend to find Moslem intolerance and totalitarianism loathesome; are they different in Bosnia? I have an ominous feeling that by the end of the week we shall be growling 'A plague on all your houses' every time another of these programmes appears. The past week has produced vivid contrasts in documentary styles. The first in the BBC2 series Architecture Of The Imagination (reviewed here at greater length by Colin Amery on Monday) was one of those portentous programmes where the commentary swings between the blindingly obvious and the embarrassingly pretentious. It was full of people keen to explain to lesser mortals the inner, and of course outer, significance and symbolism of the door. The first in ITV's Metroland series, showing work by new directors, could easily have fallen into the same trap. In his 25 minute study of the world of van drivers Henry Chancellor did have one enthusiast who sat on the step of (I think) a Dormobile and mused about what would probably, in the architecture series, have been called the 'ethos' of vans. But Chancellor's commentator was brief, ready to laugh at his own fanaticism, and amusing - virtues which describe the entire programme. We watched a hairdresser, a fishmonger and a dentist operating from vans. We met the sort of loons who customise Bedfords so that they do 150 mph and eight mpg. And we ended with a student living in a van whose simple analysis of its significance was far more effective than all the psychobabble in Architecture Of The Imagination. 'The Van' is the sort of startlingly simple but affecting programme to which juries like to give awards. Lady Elspeth Howe, wife of Conservative grandee Sir Geoffrey Howe, has succeeded Lord Rees-Mogg as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, one of the sillier quangos invented in recent years by a government supposedly keen to 'roll back the boundaries of the state'. Jobs for the girls? Perish the thought] The lady is there entirely on merit. Chief qualification for chairmanship of the BSC appears to be a very sketchy knowledge of what actually appears on television. Rees-Mogg proved by what he told interviewers to be eminently qualified, and now, in response to Christian Tyler's question 'Do you enjoy watching sex on television? Do you find it boring?' in the course of a feature in Saturday's Weekend FT, Lady Howe has said 'Up to a point. Yes I do after a while find it boring if it goes on and on and on'. So here is a challenge for the lady: name us, not 12, not six, but just two occasions in the past year - no, let's make it fair, in the past decade - when you have seen a programme in which sex went on and on and on. Those of us who would welcome a gentle spot of sex occasionally in place of some of the stabbing and shooting would be delighted to know where, outside the Adult Channel on the Astra satellite (and somehow it seems unlikely that Lady Howe is paying Pounds 50 a year for that) she claims to be finding such unremitting sex. Speaking of sex, when will television newsroom staffs get it through their thick collective heads that they have no more idea than anybody else of the rate of sexual offences in Britain (or England, or, as reported on BBC Regional News last week, London). Sex offences were almost certainly higher, proportionately, in London in 1493 than today, and probably higher in 1893, what with middle class male attitudes towards servant girls. But nobody knows. All that television news reporters know is the state of police statistics, and these vary according to the number of police collecting them, the number of computers available, and especially according to prevailing attitudes towards the reporting of crime. It is, of course, less exciting and less terrifying to announce 'The number of sexual offences reported to the police rose last year' than to scream 'There was a rise of 11 per cent in sex offences in London last year'. The difference, however, is that the former is non-fiction, which is what television news is supposed to deal in, whereas the latter is fiction. How splendid to be reminded so forcefully by the opening production in BBC2's Wexford Trilogy of what can be done with a simple single-set studio drama if you have a writer as good as Billy Roche. BBC1's two-part thriller Thicker Than Water had some of the best wet-windscreen scenes shot on any location this year, but never at any point did the dialogue or the drama achieve the same power as 'Poor Beast In The Rain'. This opening episode in the Wexford sequence told a bleak story of provincial pride and tragedy with speed, wit and economy and was consequently spellbinding. Yet it never moved beyond the confines of a small betting shop.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for UB Disappointing results from United Biscuits sent the shares into decline to close 9 down at 353p in turnover of 5.5m. Profits came in at the bottom of market expectations and the lack of increase in the dividend compounded investors' disgruntlement. UB blamed the difficulty of passing on higher raw material costs, which suppressed margins. Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull, who cut his forecast for the full year from Pounds 200m to Pounds 171m, said trading conditions in the second half would remain difficult. He added that the current uncertainties surrounding the stock demanded a yield of around 6 per cent, implying a share price of 330p.</p>

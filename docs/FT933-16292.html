			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Vietnam projects ready for funds VIETNAMESE planners have drawn up a long list of projects in great need of capital, which may be forthcoming if, as expected, the International Monetary Fund resumes lending to the country. President Bill Clinton said on Friday the US was dropping its opposition to the clearing of Vietnam's Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) arrears to the IMF. Under the fund's rules, no new loans can be made until this outstanding amount is paid off. However, France, Japan and Australia have already said they are ready to provide a bridging loan to meet this requirement. Once this is finalised, economists at the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will be ready to start implementing plans they have been drawing up to help rebuild Vietnam. For the IMF, the priority will be to keep the economy on a steady path as the once-communist government brings in more free market elements. That means providing budget support for the government to continue limited subsidies to individuals and companies until they are ready to face the harsh world of the market. At the World Bank, the priority will be project lending to start work on the country's dilapidated infrastructure. Outside the main cities, roads are narrow and potholed, bridges are falling down and ports and rivers are so badly silted up that only boats with shallow draft can use them. Power is another problem. Southern Vietnam, in particular, is very short of the electricity it badly needs to fuel its economic growth. The Asian Development Bank said on Friday it was ready to approve Dollars 250m in loans to Vietnam, as soon as the US had lifted its trade embargo. Such a move is thought more likely following Mr Clinton's announcement.</p>

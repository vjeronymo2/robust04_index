			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Twin tasks to stop the strife: The future of Bosnia must be resolved or other ethnic conflicts could erupt When Prime Minister John Major holds an emergency meeting of the British cabinet tomorrow, he will be faced with one of the most important decisions since the Tories were returned to office in April. Against a background of mounting public pressure, he will have to decide whether to commit ground troops to protect humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia-Hercegovina. And since Britain is the current president of the European Community, Mr Major will be expected by his EC colleagues to provide a sense of leadership in deciding how to deal with the war in Bosnia, and how to prevent it from spreading. Neither task is easy. British officials are hoping that the resolution passed last week by the United Nations Security Council, which stipulated that 'all necessary means' would be used to safeguard aid convoys in Bosnia, will be enough to force the Bosnian Serbs to lift their siege of several towns. For the moment, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serbs in Bosnia, appears determined to allow the aid convoys unhindered access to some towns and cities. This is understandable. The last thing Mr Karadzic wants is a large-scale military intervention. Western diplomats and academics point out that it is in Mr Karadzic's interests to comply with the UN resolution. 'Karadzic has everything going for him now,' said Mr James Gow, a specialist on Yugoslavia at the London-based centre for Defence Studies at King's College. 'He will look good if he allows the convoys through. But more importantly, he has got what he wanted. Even though the Serbs make up 33 per cent of the 4.3m population, Karadzic's men now control 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina. He is in a position to sue for peace.' The Croats, who make up 17 per cent of the population of Bosnia, are also in a position to sit down at the negotiating table. With the backing of Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, Bosnia's Croats now control a swathe of territory in western Hercegovina, in the west of the republic. Like the Serbs, Bosnia's Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban, have carried out their own form of ethnic cleansing. Their war aims - the eventual annexation of parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina to Croatia - have nearly been fulfilled. Indeed, so confident are Mr Karadzic and Mr Boban that they held their own talks in Brussels at the weekend, following the collapse of the official negotiations headed by Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on the former Yugoslavia. At the unofficial talks on Saturday both leaders agreed to a ceasefire on those frontlines in Bosnia where Serbs and Croats have been fighting. In addition, they put forward their own version of a constitutional arrangement for the future status of Bosnia. The plan - supported by the EC - will be presented to a new UN/EC-sponsored conference in London which is scheduled to start on August 26, chaired by Mr Major. It suggests that Bosnia should be partitioned between its three constituent communities. The problem with this arrangement is that it leaves the Moslems - who accounted for 43 per cent of the population before tens of thousands fled the republic - with a tiny area of territory near Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. 'The Moslems have been boxed into a corner,' a Turkish diplomat at the UN said. 'They want to defend their homeland. But if they fight, regardless of the UN resolution and regardless of the fact that Bosnian Serbs will allow the aid convoys through, they will be accused by the international community of being unco-operative and obstructive to any peace plan,' he explained. 'If the Moslems and the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, agree to the carve-up of their republic by Croatia and Serbia, they will be disowned by their own people. It is a terrible dilemma for them. In reality, the independent republic of Bosnia-Hercegovnia no longer exists. Force has destroyed it.' Thus, tomorrow's cabinet meeting, and the challenges facing the London conference, are daunting. Both meetings will have to decide whether Bosnia can exist as an independent and sovereign state. If this principle is accepted, then arrangements will have to be made to allow the mostly Moslem refugees to return to their homes. This would mean that the UN would have to set up safe havens in Bosnia for returning refugees, said western diplomats. Western governments would also have to provide substantial financial assistance to rebuild the homes destroyed in the war. However, returning to the status quo ante is acknowledged to be impossible. 'The problem with any of these options is that they are too late,' said Mr George Schopflin, an east European specialist at the London School of Economics. 'The west, particularly the UK, has responded with weakness and cowardice. The Moslems have no homes to which they can return. The international community, which has adopted the politics of appeasement, has allowed might to prevail over right. 'This will encourage potential authoritarian regimes to emerge in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and in eastern Europe,' he added. 'Who will stop them from carrying out their own forms of ethnic cleansing?' A US diplomat in Belgrade said the depth of revenge and hatred was now so great in Bosnia that it would be 'extremely difficult' for the three ethnic communities to live peacefully together again. 'The war has radicalised every ethnic community. The tragedy is that we are witnessing the establishment of ethnic ghettoes in Bosnia which will be accepted as one of the solutions towards bringing peace to the republic.' Meanwhile, as the EC and the UN ponder the fate of Bosnia, diplomats continue to urge western governments to stop the war spreading in the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo and in Macedonia. 'Macedonia will become a pawn between Serbia and Greece if we do not recognise its independence - and defend that independence,' a US diplomat said. 'If the London conference really wants to tackle the problem of the Balkans, it will have to address the whole question of minority rights.'</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                     Ratcheting up its confrontation with the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States to a brinksmanship  level, Pyongyang has announced that it has started the refueling  of its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon without an international  monitoring presence.  At the same time, North Korea hinted at the  possibility of some sort of compromise by proposing negotiations  with the IAEA on this matter.                               END SUMMARY      Apparently seeking to force the IAEA's and Washington's hand, a  14 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement announced that  replacement of fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor has begun  (Pyongyang radio, 14 May).  Reiterating Pyongyang's earlier claim  that the timing of the refueling activities is being determined  by "technical" factors, the statement sought to place the onus  for the absence of IAEA inspectors at the scene on the IAEA.  It  claimed that on 19 April Pyongyang informed the agency of its  refueling plan and requested the presence of observers, and that  Pyongyang had requested the presence of observers four more times  subsequently and had issued visas for agency inspectors.   Hints of Compromise      The statement seemed to take pains to avoid ruling out the  possibility of delaying some of the refueling activities.  It  consistently used the term "fuel rod replacement activities" to  denote its current operation, thus leaving it unclear whether the  actual unloading of spent fuel rods has begun.  In addition, the  statement said that, while the refueling activities could not be  stopped without "the possibility of raising a new danger" to  operational safety, there "still remain possibilities to resolve the  problem," since these activities have "just begun."  The statement  called on the IAEA to negotiate with Pyongyang on the "practical  matters" of defining the IAEA's role in the refueling operation.     Moreover, although the statement reiterated Pyongyang's earlier  rejection of an IAEA request to "select and preserve" spent fuel  rods for later measurement, it retained ambiguities that could  enable Pyongyang to eventually accommodate the IAEA's position.  The current statement again ruled out the "measurement" of  replaced fuel rods--an activity that could reveal any past  nuclear material diversions--but not their segregation, pending  the outcome of future high-level talks between Pyongyang and  Washington.   Rhetorical Restraint      Clearly signaling Pyongyang's continued interest in dialogue with  Washington, the statement avoided extreme anti-U.S. rhetoric.  In  the first reference to Defense Secretary Perry's remarks reported in  Western media in recent weeks about the increased gravity of the  North Korean nuclear problem, the statement criticized "some  quarters" in Washington for spreading "rumors" that Pyongyang is  bent on extracting enough plutonium for "manufacturing four or five  nuclear bombs." However, it characterized these "rumors" relatively  mildly, calling them a "sinister" attempt to intensify pressure on  North Korea.  In a more conspicuous example of rhetorical restraint,  the North Korean news agency KCNA on 7 May reported on President  Clinton's 3 May international news conference on CNN, but totally  ignored the President's remarks criticizing Pyongyang's nuclear  program.   Implications      The 14 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement illustrates  Pyongyang's ongoing desire to retain as much bargaining power on the  nuclear issue for as long as possible.  Pyongyang is clearly  signaling that while it is willing to allow international  verification of the nondiversion of nuclear materials produced by  the current refueling activities, it rejects IAEA activities that  could disclose any past diversions of such material, pending the  outcome of future U.S.-North Korea high-level talks.  The North  Korean leadership seems to be betting that there are enough  incentives in this formulation for the IAEA to be present at the  refueling and for Washington to start negotiating with Pyongyang.

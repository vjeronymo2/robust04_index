			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] A spate of articles in the Portuguese  press recently focused on the difficult cohabitation between  Socialist President Mario Soares and Social Democratic Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva.    According to Fernando Madrinha's article in the 31 December  Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 1993 failed to offer President Soares  the conditions he needed for a "settlement of accounts" with the  prime minister. The economic crisis did not cause the political  and social upheaval Soares was hoping for, and the Socialist  Party's (PS) gains in the municipal elections were not  sufficient to jeopardize the government's majority, Madrinha  notes. Similarly, internal Social Democratic Party (PSD)  differences were not of a scale to threaten party disunity.  "`Cavaco-ism' gave a little, but it did not collapse," he  comments. In his opinion, while Soares begins 1994 with a  diminished ability to influence events, he is "perhaps more  determined than ever" to harass the government. Additionally, in  the course of 1993 the prime minister and the PSD learned to  "answer in kind" and no longer hesitate to criticize a  presidential decision when it affects their interests, Madrinha  contends. The first quarter of 1994 will be the most critical  for the government, he continues. Most labor agreements are  negotiated at that time. Moreover, the commemoration of the 25  April revolution will be an opportunity for Soares to draw a  balance sheet of the situation, with negative factors to be  ascribed to "Cavaco-ism." Another area of disagreement is  foreign policy. Soares feels that Cavaco Silva governments have  lacked "daring" and failed to take a broad view of events. As  examples, Madrinha cites the differences between the president  and the prime minister on Angola, Macao, and China. In  concluding, Madrinha asserts that even if Soares does not  "dislodge" Cavaco Silva until 1995, he will certainly use his  considerable influence to make the prime minster's life  difficult before the end of his presidential term.    In Mario Mesquita's opinion, expressed in the 7 January  Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, Soares still hopes to bring  down the "imposing edifice of Cavaco-ism" before the end of his  presidential term. Betting on time as his principal ally, the  president devoted his first term to widening his base of  support. He succeeded so well that, lacking a credible  alternative, the PSD chose to support him rather than field its  own candidate. However, at the beginning of his second term,  Cavaco Silva increased his absolute majority thanks to the  stability he brought to the country and the flow of EC funds,  Mesquita continues. With Soares "isolated in the midst of  Cavaco-ism," the "institutional guerrilla" between the two men  began in earnest in 1993, against a background of national and  international economic crises, increased unemployment,  bankruptcies and student unrest. All signs indicate the struggle  will continue in 1994, Mesquita contends. Even if the countdown  for Soares' term has started, the president has not given up on  his goal, however difficult it might be, he concludes.    The institutional conflict in Portuguese political life is  underlined by the results of a poll conducted by  EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao between 21 and 27 December among a  nationally representative sample of 481 individuals. Poll  results appeared in the 31 December EXPRESSO. Respondents were  queried on the status of the Soares-Cavaco Silva conflict in  1994. Some 55 percent said it will increase, 31 percent thought  it will remain at its present level and 7 percent that it will  diminish.</p>

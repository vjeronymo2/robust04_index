			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 16 (AFP) -- Three pieces of heavy  weaponry have been sighted by UN military observers in a Serb-  controlled neighborhood overlooking Sarajevo, UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday. The location of  the weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon -- is  in violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion  zone barring heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital.    UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the two mortar guns were  spotted Sunday in Grbavica. Another UN military source who  requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft gun was also found in  the same neighborhood. Annink said negotiations were underway  to transport the weapons to a collection center. But the  military source said that the Serbs were refusing to budge by  claiming that the weapons had been neutralized. He said that  claim was baseless as the Serbs had only removed the firing pins  "which could be reinstalled in two minutes." The weekend  discovery of the weapons was the latest in a series of  violations of the exclusion zone and a ceasefire agreed in  February by Bosnia's warring factions under the threat of NATO  air strikes. [passage omitted]    UN peacekeepers have also increasingly come under fire, the  latest such incident occuring Sunday when a convoy was targeted  in the Mount Igman region, located about 15 kilometres (nine  miles) from Sarajevo. Annink said that the mostly Moslem  Bosnian Army was responsible for the attack but he did not  elaborate. He added that UNPROFOR convoys were encountering  increasing problems in southern Bosnia. He said about 50  civilians, mainly women, have blocked part of the road linking  the Croatian town of Split with the central Bosnian town of  Zenica since this weekend. The women, he said, are demanding to  know the wherabouts of their husbands who have gone missing and  want the UN to pay them a fee for the convoys.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Can an energy panel save us from more blunders?: The views of 16 experts may be too diverse to be effective When the coal crisis was raging earlier this year, the government pledged to set up a panel of experts to advise it on energy issues - the implication being that they would prevent it from making such policy blunders again. Tomorrow the 16 men and women of the newly appointed Energy Advisory Panel will hold their first meeting. Judging by their credentials, the advice they will they be giving ministers will be very mixed - perhaps too mixed to form a forceful view. They will have a crowded agenda. Apart from specific issues such as the privatisation of British Coal, the British Gas monopoly inquiry and the forthcoming review of the nuclear power industry, they will have to ask whether the UK should have a more hands-on energy policy - as many of the government's critics are arguing. In the longer term they may consider environmental questions, the structure of the electricity industry, whether Britain should have more renewable energy projects and EC policy on free trade in energy supplies. The chairman, Mr Martin Holdgate, director-general of the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature, is an expert on renewable energy. His expertise will be bolstered by Lady Mary Archer, a specialist on solar energy and chairman of the National Energy Foundation, which promotes energy efficiency. The energy industry will be represented by Mr Ron Campbell, former managing director of Babcock Energy and an expert on nuclear power; Mr Sam Laidlaw, head of UK operations of Amerada Hess, the US oil company; and Dr Anthony White, a director of National Grid Company. There is also a sprinkling of academics, consultants, representatives of union and consumer interests, industrialists - and an electricity privatisation expert from the City, Ms Lynda Rouse of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. She is also on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Many participants have a high profile in the energy debate and have argued for a more active national energy policy. Mr Tony Cooper, general secretary of the Engineers and Managers' Association, is one of them. He has called on the government to set up a framework for the market to operate in, warning that otherwise short-termism would destroy longer term objectives. Another is Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, which lobbies for energy-efficient power generation. Several other members have spoken out against aspects of the government's policy. Mr Mike Parker, former director of economics at British Coal, has just published a book in which he describes the government's coal review as 'more form than substance'. Mr Dieter Helm of Oxford Economic Research Associates has attacked the wide discretion given to energy industry regulators, and thinks they should be brought under tighter government control. Dr White at National Grid had actually dismissed the panel as a bad idea before he was appointed to it. On the other hand, Mr Nigel Evans, managing director of Caminus Energy, a Cambridge-based energy consultancy which advised the government on the coal issue, is more sympathetic to a pro-competition policy. 'The limitations of past energy policies are strongly apparent - particularly with hindsight,' he says. 'There are so many uncertainties I would not have the confidence to say what that policy should be.' Ms Ann Scully, vice-chairman of the National Consumers Council, says she is less concerned with who owns the energy industry than with the quality of service people get. Mr Peter Ibbotson, director of construction and engineering at the J. Sainsbury supermarket group, who takes a strong interest in reducing energy costs, said: 'I would like to think that investment in conservation and efficiency should rank equally with investment in energy producing industries. We would be better investing the nation's resources in conserving energy rather than just in producing it.' Some observers believe the panel's membership is too diverse to influence government policy, and that it would have difficulty forging a common position. But Mr Ibbotson said: 'I will certainly do my best to make the Department of Trade and Industry sit up and take notice of the panel. I hope it won't just be a talking shop.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the Russian </F> Federation Government apparatus, by Ruslan Ignatyev "in a White  House reception room"; date not given: "Russian Government  Moves to White House. Yesterday the Russian Federation  Government Moved from Staraya Ploshchad to the  Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment Building. Today Work Has Begun in  the New Residence"]    [Text] ...Trucks are driving up to the entrances of the  White House regularly, according to a timetable. Boxes and paper  sacks are being unloaded. These contain books, documents,  office equipment, computers -- in a word, everything that is  needed for work. And it is not only the loaders who are heaving  the sacks about. It is unusual to see government apparatus  staff, including high-ranking officials, in jeans and sweaters  rather than ties. But moving is moving.    Following the latest batch of packages, I go up to the fifth  floor, the "premier's" floor. Some people are moving tables,  others are already working almost normally. After all, there is  no time to waste making it habitable. That is why the move was  scheduled for a holiday -- 3 January.    Something else is also unusual -- the complete absence of  the  1940's and 1950's style, which perhaps could not be transferred  from the corridors of Staraya Ploshchad. Here the furniture  provides a modern business style. With the possible exception  of the premier's office, where the furniture is imitation  antique -- refined and at the same time sturdy. By and large it  is not without its splendor, which I believe the head of  government of a great power can afford to indulge in.    The reception room is several times larger than the one on  Staraya Ploshchad. This is not just for the representatives.  There are tables and chairs for visitors. In the old building  they had to wait in the corridor.    It was here that I met Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the  Russian  Federation Government apparatus.    [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, the mass media has reported  that the Russian government is apparently not all that keen to  move to the White House and that the Federal Assembly wants to  get hold of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  apartments for itself. But you are moving.    [Kvasov] Yes, the new parliament did appeal to the president  about this. However, the president stated unequivocally that he  would not change his decision. The point is that the Federal  Assembly is not the successor of the former parliament (by the  president's edict, the government is). This is a completely new  state formation, and so its claims to the property,  organizations, and publications of the former Russian Supreme  Soviet are not legitimate. If you remember, back on 5 October  of this year the president signed Edict No. 1586, which says:  "The buildings at No. 2 Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment and No. 2  Rochdelskaya Ulitsa in the city of Moscow city are designated  the official residence of the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government." Incidentally, this complex was originally  built for the RSFSR Council of Ministers. It provided for  literally everything in respect of government activity. Today  an enormous amount of work has been carried out to restore the  buildings, and the necessary conditions have been created for  the functioning of the new residence. So the Russian Government  has had no doubts in connection with the move to  Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment.    [Ignatyev] What has been done in the White House in the  past three months?    [Kvasov] Following the well-known events, as you know, the  complex suffered a great deal of damage. The builders were  faced with a complex task: They had not only to carry out major  repairs to the structure, they had to modernize it. The  buildings were constructed a long time ago, so many  communications systems had fallen into disrepair. Furthermore,  the former Supreme Soviet had partially changed the internal  layout. Many areas had been partitioned off and turned into  tiny rooms. In a word, the entire complex had to be returned to  its original form, as the architect conceived it, and the  builders dealt with this very well.    [Ignatyev] Were there any changes made during the present  reconstruction?    [Kvasov] First and foremost the ordinary windows and stained  glass windows were replaced by sun protection glass. Because of  poor ventilation it used to be very hot in the premises,  particularly in the summer. A new air conditioning system has  now been installed. All stories are equipped with state of the  art fire extinguishing equipment. Extra telephone lines have  been laid and the old ones have been repaired. Two large  canteens have been built. These are on the sixth and seventh  floors. Three snack bars have been opened. Several other  eating areas are planned. The interiors have been completely  renewed. The inside of the building has become smarter and more  modern.    [Ignatyev] How did the builders manage to cope with such a  large amount of work in such a short space of time?    [Kvasov] The restoration work went on day and night. Over  5,000 people took part in it. These included 2,000 specialists  representing two Turkish firms. First-class builders were  employed. Not all of the work has been finished, however. The  complex has been divided into two parts: The six-story building  and the high-rise 20-story one. The first has already been  fully commissioned, and the second will be finished within the  next two weeks. At the moment 12 stories are in use. The  others still have to be brought up to the mark, so to speak.    [Ignatyev] Has the government moved fully into the new  building?    [Kvasov] No, the prime minister and all of his deputies have  moved in first and foremost. The government services are also  installed at the new address. But it only proved possible to  locate some of the apparatus. Ten departments are still in  their old locations at the moment. They will move gradually, as  soon as the restoration work is completed. I think that the  entire government apparatus will move to Krasnopresnenskaya  Embankment in January.    [Ignatyev] Who has moved into the former speaker's office?    [Kvasov] We know that Khasbulatov resided in the office of  the former RSFSR Council of Ministers chairman. All the  government leaders worked in it in their time -- Vorotnikov,  Silayev. Now Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin has now occupied  it by right.    [Ignatyev] So where are the prime minister's apartments  located?    [Kvasov] They are on the fifth floor. The government  Presidium conference hall is there too. There are also several  small halls for holding conferences and for meetings with all  kinds of delegations and foreign visitors. The chairman's  apparatus services are next to them.    [Ignatyev] Who has moved into Rutskoy's old office?    [Kvasov] An ordinary department. I would like to note that  a number of government subdepartments have moved into the  six-story building, while the main services are in the high-rise  block.    [Ignatyev] Are any premises envisaged for the Russian  president?    [Kvasov] Yes, on the third story of the 20-story block a  complex has been set up for the Russian president and his  services. This is vital so that the president can work in  closer contact with the government. He frequently has to attend  government sittings and resolve operational questions.    [Ignatyev] Are there any plans for a reduction in the  government apparatus?    [Kvasov] It is planned that the apparatus will be reduced by  20 percent. Certain ministries and subdepartments will be  completely abolished. I cannot name them specifically at the  moment. Work is going on in this sphere. But it can already be  said for certain today that the departments which are obsolete  in the present economic conditions will specifically be subject  to reduction.    [Ignatyev] And the last question. Where will the Federal  Assembly be located?    [Ignatyev] Evidently a special building will be erected for  the new parliament. A piece of land will be designated and a  competition for the best design will be announced. And the  Federal Assembly will get its own complex within a few years.  But for the time being it will work in the location already  determined by the president's edict.    ...Overnight the communications workers connected the  government and special communications telephones in the new  official residence. The government has begun its work.</p>

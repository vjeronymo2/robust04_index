			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: Morgan's upgrade The reshuffle at the top of the M&amp;G Group has not resolved the long-term management succession issue at one of Britain's biggest independent fund managers. David Morgan, who will take over from Paddy Linaker as group managing director in the summer of 1994, is of a similar age to Linaker. Morgan, 59, does not view himself as a caretaker chief executive. But it still looks like a relatively temporary appointment whilst the next generation of M&amp;G's management is tested out. On present form finance director Tony Shearer, 44, seems most likely to end up running the show, especially since he has been upgraded to chief operating officer. But if he does, then M&amp;G may have to ditch its rather out-dated prejudice that only fund managers can manage fund management firms.</p>

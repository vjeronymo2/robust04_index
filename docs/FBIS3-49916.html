I am the representative of the smallest  country in the region, which, like others, continues in its  successful political and economic transformation process, and  which, as a new country, has recently established its principal  democratic institutions. We neighbor with all of the Visegrad  Group countries, and we are good neighbors not only around this  table. We endeavor to cooperate in all important areas. Issues  of security, which we have today discussed with our  distinguished host President Clinton, are among the most  important.    The Slovak Republic accept the Partnership For Peace project  as an expression of a qualitative change, and at the same time  an evolutionary process on the road to a full membership in the  North Atlantic Alliance. The Slovak Republic understands its  wish to be part of NATO and its system of values as an act of  utmost political importance, which has the support of our entire  democratic political spectrum. We wish to create conditions, as  soon as possible, for the signing of the agreement within the  framework of the Partnership For Peace initiative, which will  put a definite end to our efforts to confirm our orientation.  We strongly believe that it will be understood the same way by  the member states of the Alliance. We wish not only to confirm  our aspirations, but also to prove our preparedness to  participate actively in its projects and missions through our  concrete cooperation within the Partnership For Peace initiative.    I wish to emphasize that the Slovak Republic is not aspiring  to be a part of the Alliance because it feels militarily  threatened. We have no enemies in today's Europe. We simply  have negative historical experiences. We don't want to see  history repeat itself in any manner. For this reason we  endeavor to anchor ourselves firmly within the structure of  democratic states, which is capable of effectively defending  democratic values, shared also by our citizens. This endeavor  and the commitments stemming from it will also facilitate the  complex transformational process that our society is carrying  out at the moment.    The North Atlantic Alliance carried out the fateful struggle  for democracy in a bi-polar world with success and honor. We  have no doubts that it will confront the present challenges in  the same way. One of these challenges is to find a partnership  relation with the changing Russia and Ukraine in a manner that  would strengthen not only European, but also global security.  The specifics of the European power coordinates and their  relation with the global processes require, in our opinion, an  active presence of the United States of America in our  continent. We are pleased that the United states is confirming  its commitments to Europe.    We are aware that the Partnership For Peace project, in its  implementation stage, will create models for cooperation between  the Alliance and the individual countries which will probably  not be identical. The partial differences should not, however,  become an impulse for the creation of a competitive environment,  which we consider natural in economics, but risky in security  issues. The Alliance should, in our opinion, approach the  principle security issues systematically and through bold  decisions that take into account a broader geopolitical area.    We know that the creation of stable, democratic relations on  the international scene and the strengthening of security  require an active contribution of all, not only the most  influential participants. The Slovak Republic, too, wants to  contribute to the European stability, mainly through good  relations with its neighbors. The Slovak Republic takes this  opportunity to stress once again its preparedness to further the  cooperation with its neighbors on this basis.    Once again, I want to express our appreciation of President  Clinton's initiative, which made this meeting possible, and at  the same time express hope that it will become a strong impulse  for us in further coordination and mutual cooperation.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Trade explosion propels Mercosur towards reality POLITICAL and economic instability in Brazil may yet scuttle attempts to form a common market in South America, or at least delay the January 1 1995 deadline for implanting a single market, to be known as Mercosur and made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. None the less, an explosion in trade, cross-border business links, falling trade barriers and continuous advance in dull, but vital, regulatory harmonisation is giving integration a dynamic of its own. Companies ranging from multinationals to small local companies are assuming sooner or later Mercosur will become a reality. This perception is in turn accelerating integration. Mr Jorge Bustamante, director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos Aires investment bank, says: 'The impact of Mercosur here will be dramatic. (Brazil) may postpone matters, but people are taking Mercosur into account.' The car industry began integrating operations in Brazil and Argentina in 1985. It is unlikely that Argentina's car industry could have survived without access to Brazil's market. All big car and component industries in the two countries are now integrating operations and sharing capacity. Integration is becoming a question of life or death for smaller players. In Argentina's industrial city of Cordoba, most companies have links with Brazil. Georgalos, a chocolate maker, has linked with Brazil's Lacta to exchange products and technology. Links between the two countries' service industry, farmers and financial systems are also growing stronger. These trends are reflected in the trade figures. In 1985, trade between the four Mercosur countries added up to Dollars 3.82bn (Pounds 199m). By 1991, trade was Dollars 10.60bn, accounting for 13 per cent of their total trade, even though huge obstacles to trade still exist.</p>

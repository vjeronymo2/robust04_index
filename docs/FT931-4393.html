			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The scent of things to come - Commercial interest in the use of aromas is growing The idea that different smells produce different behavioural moods is hardly new. But the commercial application of aromatics, or Musak of the Nose as some marketeers have dubbed it, looks to be growing. Fragrance strips in magazines are already familiar - December's edition of Vanity Fair had five of them. But other examples - some quite bizarre - are increasingly found. A Seattle bank, for instance, is planning to scent the money in its automated teller machines. A Marriott hotel in Miami has installed a Dollars 12,000 (Pounds 8,333) machine that releases floral and citrus 'natural plant abstracts' into the atmosphere in its lobby (apparently to reduce stress in its guests). While several Japanese companies use aromas introduced via their air conditioners to improve staff motivation and raise productivity. Mitsubishi's researchers have projected that office demand for smells could reach Y10bn (Pounds 59m) by the year 2000. Not everyone approves of olfactory marketing, especially when it is employed to woo shoppers. US consumer groups have criticised the growing use of fragrances by retailers, accusing them of subliminal advertising. Apologists say there is nothing sinister, that the nice pongs can be compared with background music, fancy lighting or plush carpeting. Recent commercial interest - including the establishment last year in London of a specialist consultancy Marketing Aromatics - can be linked to the results of an expanding body of research into human behaviour. A US study researched the effect of odours on product perception by getting individuals to examine Nike sneakers in two rooms: one fitted with purified air, the other scented with a floral smell. Eighty four per cent of participants said they were more likely to buy the shoes, or liked the shoes more, in the scented room and many said they would pay Dollars 10 more for them in that environment. In another exercise keyboard workers reduced their errors by 50 per cent when exposed to a citrus-scented atmosphere. As for the specific ingredients, Japanese research claims lemon and peppermint have a stimulating effect; nutmeg and lavender reduce stress and a mix of rosemary and lemon will improve concentration. David Fellowes, commercial director of Marketing Aromatics, is naturally an enthusiast: 'Smell is the most powerful and evocative trigger we know. Yet commercially smell has been the most under-used of the senses.' Fellows says smells can be used in three broad ways: to provoke physiological responses (such as animating people or reducing stress), to bring back memories or associations (such as a Caribbean holiday), and to encourage different attitudes (essentially what the manufacturers of most cosmetic perfumes are aiming to achieve). Marketing Aromatics lists a wide range of potential applications - from developing corporate aromas as a sort of company logo and increasing browsing time in shops to impregnating a product or packaging and improving accuracy in repetitive manual tasks. It is reluctant to talk about clients - except to point out it helped a bookshop which wanted to smell more like a library - but says it has a growing number of inquiries. Marketing Aromatics works with the perfume companies to develop the right smells and is working with other companies on dispersal technology systems. These are claimed to be capable of broadcasting different aromas into several parts of a building at varying times of day. In the US AromaSys of Minneapolis has researched the psychology, physiology and technology of environmental fragrancing for three years. It is developing systems for several Fortune 500 companies. Says Allyson Stewart, of AAI Consultants: 'I think this whole subject is particularly interesting from a corporate identity point of view. I believe the fragrance houses are going to get more involved.'</p>

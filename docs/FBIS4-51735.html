			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Prompt Halt to Anti-Chongnyon Moves Urged" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today say the  recent grave hostile acts against organizations of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans  in Japan are unprecedented since the formation of Chongnyon and  they are premeditated and organized provocations of the Japanese  reactionaries who have resorted to anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon  moves, motivated by a sinister political aim.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    Very ill-boding is the situation today when the Japanese  reactionaries are intensifying crackdown on and persecution of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.    Koreans in Japan are those who were forcibly taken to Japan  by the Japanese imperialists during their colonial rule, and  their descendents, and Chongnyon is a patriotic and democratic  organization of citizens overseas of the DPRK.    It is a legal and moral obligation of the Japanese  authorities to guarantee legitimate activities of Chongnyon and  the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan.    Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities forcibly searched  Chongnyon organizations by invoking government power on charges  of "forcible obstruction of business" which had nothing to do  with Chongnyon and goaded a rightwing gangsters' group on to  undisguised suppression and provocations against Chongnyon and  Koreans in Japan. This is an unjustifiable, rude behavior.    We who regard the dignity of our country and nation as our  life and soul will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon and its  affiliated organizations and Koreans in Japan an encroachment on  the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively  counter it.    The Japanese authorities should ponder over unpredictable  grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless behavior and  immediately renounce their policy hostile to the DPRK and  anti-Chongnyon moves.</p>

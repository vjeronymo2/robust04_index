			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 2 GIRLS WHO DISAPPEARED WITH NEIGHBOR FOUND ALIVE IN DESERT  </P> <P> Two little girls from a tiny Mojave Desert town who disappeared with a neighbor  a week ago were found alive today at a remote desert rest stop, authorities  said.  </P> <P> An abandoned truck belonging to the neighbor, 36-year-old Alan Erickson, was  found, but he was still being sought.  </P> <P> Silver Putnam, 6, of Pioneertown was in the pit area of a mine when she was  found by a passer-by about 8:30 a.m. The Rheox Inc. mines are near a rest stop  on Interstate 40 near Newberry Springs. Temperatures in the area have been well  above 100 degrees.  </P> <P> The girl's bare feet were badly injured by walking in the scorched, rocky  desert area, a San Bernardino County sheriff's report said.  </P> <P> She told the passer-by that her 3-year-old half-sister, Kristina Johnson, had  fallen into a hole and she was unable to awaken her. Kristina was found a short  time later by searchers. There was no immediate confirmation that she had  suffered a fall.  </P> <P> Both girls were dressed only in their underpants.  </P> <P> Erickson took the two girls Friday on what was supposed to be a short trip to  buy a motorcycle part.  </P></p>

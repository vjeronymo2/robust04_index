			<p>BFN     [Text] An official Foreign Ministry source has issued the  following reaction to Iranian Foreign Ministry contentions on 16  April about the treatment of some Iranians who are residing in  Iraq:    The Iranian regime's claim that Iranian clerics who have  been  residing in Iraq for the past 20 months are now in detention is  baseless. It is an attempt by the Iranian regime to mislead and  conceal facts from the Iranian public opinion through false  allegations.    The source said that talk about Iraqi citizens is ridiculous  and illustrates the Iranian regime's insistence on meddling in  Iraq's internal affairs that runs counter to a sincere desire on  the part of Iraq to settle pending issues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150): "The Qiandao </F> Hu Murder Case Provides Food for Thought for the Two Sides of  the Strait"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  mainland employed 4,000 people in the investigation into the  Qiandao Lake murder case, which has attracted attention at home  and abroad, and the whole truth of the case has come out. The  Zhejiang local procuratorial organs intend to conduct a public  trial of the three suspects in the near future. To dispel  doubts and misgivings, and to enable the people concerned to  understand the details of the case, the mainland has sincerely  asked Taiwan to send specialists and has invited relatives of  the murdered to attend the trial as observers. The mainland has  made utmost efforts to handle the Qiandao Lake murder case, and  has made public the details of the case. This probably will be  helpful in dispelling various doubts and reactions. However, in  handling the Qiandao Lake murder case, differences and  misunderstandings occurred as a result of differences in ideas  and approach. This has provided people food for thought and  examination.    The Qiandao Lake murder case was originally a chance  occurrence and an accident in tourism. Had the mainland side  followed more appropriate procedures in investigation, gathering  evidence, and solving the case, or had each side understood and  respected the different approaches of the other, public feeling  on the island would not have been aroused, and the press'  misunderstanding that the mainland "intentionally withheld the  truth" could have been avoided.    As a matter of fact, viewed from the process of solving the  Qiandao Lake murder case, the mainland had no intention of  withholding the truth. On the contrary, it exerted its utmost  efforts to bring the whole truth of the case to light as soon as  possible. After the Qiandao Lake murder case occurred,  President Jiang Zemin immediately gave instructions on "solving  the case within a time limit," and "absolutely not withholding  the truth." This was something rare in handing cases of chance  occurrence on the mainland, was enough to show the extreme  concern and attention at the high level over this serious murder  case, which involved the lives of 32 compatriots of Taiwan and  the mainland. Throughout the course of solving the case, 4,000  people from the central and local governments carried out  investigations and gathered evidence, day and night, and  succeeded in solving this complicated and confusing case within  the short span of 17 days. The details then were made public in  good time. It should be said that the mainland took an active  and responsible attitude in handling the Qiandao Lake murder  case, so why have there been queries overseas, despite the  efforts exerted?    Perhaps this is because the idea and approach in handling  cases of chance occurrence of the mainland are different from  those of the other side of the strait, thus making people feel  at a loss as to what to do. Generally speaking, in handling  similar cases on the mainland, especially the rare Qiandao Lake  murder case -- a case of robbery, murder, and arson -- a case is  made public usually on the basis of having a clear and  unambiguous grasp of the whole story, testimonies of witnesses,  and material evidence. In the course of solving a case, the  press usually treats the case carefully and does not report  anything about it so as to avoid leaking the details of the case  and to prevent the criminals and suspects from taking advantage  of such leaks to create difficulties for solving the case. On  the contrary, the Taiwan side will make a case of chance  occurrence widely known as soon as it happens. Any clue, be it  useless or important, will be reported in full detail. The  people on the island seem to be quite accustomed to this  practice, and because of this, they could not understand, were  resentful about, and raised questions on the mainland's entirely  different way of dealing with the Qiandao Lake murder case.    In fact, as for dealing with a case of chance occurrence,  the  mainland's way of handing a case carefully and of not rashly  making it public should give no cause for much criticism. On  the contrary, immediately making public whatever is discovered,  before the details of a case are clear, may not be conducive to  the investigation and solution of a case. Last year, the Yin  Ching-feng ammunitions purchase-homicide case occurred in  Taiwan. The prosecution was greatly troubled in the course of  solving the case because the mass media competed with one  another to report whatever traces and clues were discovered.  The authorities concerned on the island did not agree twith  such so-called "complete transparency" of news reporting, either.    However, since the Qiandao Lake murder case involved the  lives of compatriots on both sides of the strait, it attracted  great attention, both at home and abroad. We should show  understanding and sympathy for the relatives of the murdered,  who were anxious to learn the details of the case. Had the  mainland allowed people to report on details that would not have  affected the solution of the case and on the progress in solving  the case, unnecessary misunderstandings might have been reduced  or even avoided.    Now that the whole truth of the Qiandao Lake murder case has  come out, the knot in the hearts of the people on both sides of  the strait should be untied. However, in handling special cases  similar to the Qiandao Lake murder case in the future, how both  sides of the strait should readjust their respective ways of  handling matters so as to avoid misunderstandings. This is a  question both sides of the strait should think about and to  which they should give an answer.</p>

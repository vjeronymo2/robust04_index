			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / S Korea to reform oil sector South Korea's trade, industry and energy ministry unveiled a draft plan to reform its heavily controlled oil industry by liberalising prices, distribution and both export and imports of oil products. Under the plan, oil refiners, distributors and petrol stations would be allowed to set their own prices for oil products including petrol, paraffin, gas oil and diesel oil. 'The timing has not yet been decided. Talks are still under way with related government offices,' a ministry official said. But Seoul media predicted prices of oil products would be deregulated from the second half of next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Forceful measures  have been taken in central and south China to expand the  rice-growing area this spring.    Nine rice-growing provinces reported a combined increase of  rice cultivation area of over 66,000 ha this year although the  labor force has been reduced gradually due to the relatively low  profits from rice-growing.    In central China's Hunan Province, the total rice-growing  land remained at over 1.66 million ha, and that for early-season  rice expanded to more than 730,000 ha, a sturdy 10 percent rise  from last year.    In Guangdong, a booming coastal province in South China,  over  50 grain-producing counties have been set up and a series of  preferential policies enacted to encourage farmers to grow more  rice.    Thanks to the steps taken by the local government and the  rise of rice prices, the province has cultivated about 670,000  ha of fine- breed rice, an increase of over 130,000 ha from the  same period of last year.    The provincial government in Zhejiang, in East China, has  assured farmers that early rice will be purchased at a price of  96 yuan per 100 kg this year. In addition, the contracted price  will be adjusted according to any new price rate.    The early-rice land in the province has reached about  870,000  ha this year, 60,000 ha more than last year.    Great efforts have also been made to expand the rice-growing  areas in other provinces and regions throughout the country,  including Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan and Anhui Provinces.    The local governments have decided to offer more loans to  back grain production this year and help farmers to overcome any  kind of problem likely to hinder the increase of the grain  output.</p>

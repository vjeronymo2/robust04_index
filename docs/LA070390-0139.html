			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACTION ON WETLANDS URGED  </P> <P> Residents are calling for the city to take a stand on protection of local  wetlands after the city ordered a halt to construction work on the new Hoag  Hospital Child Care Center because of a possible threat to the marshy area.  </P> <P> Unless the city officially recognizes what are commonly known as the Hoag  wetlands as environmentally sensitive, the area will remain in danger of being  damaged by the construction, said Jan Vandersloot, a Newport Beach resident and  board member of the environmental group Amigos de Bolsa Chica.  </P> <P> Vandersloot and Bill Jennings, the president of the West Newport Beach  Community Assn., approached City Atty. Robert Burnham last Thursday about the  legality of grading work on the east side of the wetlands. The area of concern  is about 1,500 square feet of marsh north of Coast Highway and east of Superior  Street.  </P> <P> The city had approved Hoag's grading plans, but the hospital's permit did not  show that grading work would infringe upon the wetlands area, city planner  Patricia Temple said.  </P></p>

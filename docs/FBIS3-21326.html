			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan 11 (PTI)--Dissatisfied with Assam  Government's performance, the Election Commission on Tuesday  night ordered a special revision of electoral rolls in 40  Assembly constituencies in Assam with some conditions and a  summary revision in the remaining 86 constituencies with January  1 this year as the qualifying date.    The Commission directed once again that status quo  ante should be restored in respect of those officers  working as Electoral Registration Officers [ERO] and Assistant  EROs in the 40 Assembly constituencies, who were transferred  without prior approval of the Commission.    "The Commission holds these transfers as gross violation of  its orders and will consider the work of revision of rolls  vitiated unless status quo ante is restored," a  communication issued by its Secretary, Mr Ram Kishan said.    In another directive, the Commission directed the Central  Government to indicate by month end the maximum availability of  Central police forces at a time for deployment in 10 States  during Assembly elections due from this year-end to March next  year making it "unequivocally" clear that it will not bunch  several general elections.    The Centre should also indicate the time that would be  required for the movement of these forces from one place to  another.    "If the reply from government is not received by the  stipulated date, the Commission will proceed to take decisions  at the appropriate time on the basis of its own information and  appreciation of these factors," it said.</p>

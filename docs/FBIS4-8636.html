			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- A group of 17  opposition deputies to the Federal Assembly's Chamber of  Citizens today called on Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic to  dismiss Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic in connection  with the withdrawal of accreditation from AFP and CNN.    The signatories of this initiative are from the Serbian  Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party [of Serbia], the Social  Democratic Party of Montenegro, and the People's Party of  Montenegro. They maintain that the ban on AFP and CNN causes  inestimable damage to the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]  and its citizens, and ask that this decision be revoked.    Explaining their proposal, the deputies say that the FRY is  in this way coming into direct confrontation with the most  powerful information media and indirectly with the United States  and France.</p>

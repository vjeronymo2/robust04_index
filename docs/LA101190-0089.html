			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENTATIVE CLEAN AIR BILL ACCORD REACHED  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators, apparently breaking a deadlock that had  threatened passage of a new Clean Air Act, tentatively agreed Wednesday on  far-reaching measures to reduce smog-causing car emissions over the next 10  years.  </P> <P> The agreement extends automobile emission standards adopted by California to  the rest of the nation and establishes an innovative pilot program in which  "clean fuel" vehicles -- cars running on fuels that release only a fraction of  the pollution caused by conventional gasoline -- will be sold in California  starting in 1996. The plan is expected to receive formal approval when House  and Senate conferees meet later this week.  </P> <P> "California is going to lead the way for the nation in putting alternatively  fueled vehicles on the road," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a  clean air advocate and one of the chief architects of the compromise reached  early Wednesday after an all-night negotiating session.  </P> <P> "For the first time, we are going to have a strong federal law, one with real  teeth in it, to force a major reduction of smog in this country," Waxman said.  </P> <P> The issue was resolved through a complex compromise negotiated by House and  Senate staff aides, although members of Congress were involved throughout and  are expected to adopt the measures.  </P> <P> However, the agreement was quickly criticized by environmentalists and  California air quality officials for conceding too much to the automobile and  oil industries.  </P> <P> State officials were especially upset with a provision that, if retained in the  final bill, would prevent them from regulating smog-causing emissions from  several classes of "off-road" vehicles, such as tractors, compressors and other  farm or construction equipment powered by engines of less than 175 horsepower.  </P> <P> "Off-road vehicles in this category account for nearly 10% of California's smog  problem. We are in the process of developing regulations for these pollution  sources, but if this deal goes through it will stop us in midstream," said Bill  Sessa, a spokesman for the state's Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> While the air board and other state officials vowed to fight the off-road  vehicles provision, the dispute that had threatened the negotiations with  collapse concerned the right of other states to adopt and enforce a clean fuels  program established under the legislation for California.  </P> <P> Under both the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill, other states  could "opt in" to the program that begins in California in 1996, with the  federally mandated production of 150,000 clean fuel vehicles. However, under  the terms of a controversial proposal pushed by auto industry supporters, the  authority to enforce the program outside of California would have been  entrusted to the Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Environmentalists argued that the states should retain the right to administer  the program because of EPA's long record of failure in enforcing strong clean  air regulations.  </P> <P> The issue was finally resolved through a complex compromise negotiated by House  and Senate staff aides.  </P> <P> States that adopt the California program will retain the right to enforce it  but, in return, deadlines for some other regulations will be relaxed,  conference sources said.  </P> <P> "The agreement does a lot of things to make cars cleaner, but the price that is  being paid for this is delay," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist with the Sierra  Club.  </P> <P> "Most of the reductions (in polluting emissions) are now not going to begin to  take effect until the late 1990s, which gives the auto and oil industries more  time than they actually need to meet many of these requirements," he said.  </P> <P> Environmentalists also criticized a compromise that would push back the  deadline for oil companies to sell cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline in the  nation's nine smoggiest cities. Instead of 1992, they will have until 1995.  </P> <P> The Administration has threatened to veto any bill that costs substantially  more than $20 billion per year but is expected to be generally pleased by the  compromises struck Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Parallel Census?"] </F>   [Text] The Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia [Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] expressed bitterness and public  protest against the structure of the State Census Committee,  appointed by the government. The Turk member of the Committee  has been appointed without consulting the party, which is for  them unacceptable. The party is confirmed the census will be  conducted in a manner same as all previous censuses, i.e., it  will be partial and doubtful. If this party is neglected in the  future, it will announce a parallel census for Turks in  Macedonia to be conducted by Turks, the party threatened in its  public announcement.</p>

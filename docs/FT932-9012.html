			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Getting a fix on your income - An unsettled sector GILTS had an unsettled time in the UK last month, with prices generally weakening. Economic news suggested that the recovery could have started at last, bringing reduced hopes of an interest rate cut. Jim Dunsford, director of fixed income at James Capel Fund Managers (which runs Midland's Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest unit trust; see table), believes interest rates will fall to 5 per cent by the end of the year; this would tend to push up the price of short-dated gilts with a corresponding drop in yields. However, the government's need to find buyers for new gilts issues would conspire to push up yields and so make prices of long-dated gilts fall. Because of this mixed outlook, Dunsford believes private investors should still invest part of their assets in a bond fund - unit trusts which invest in a portfolio of bonds to provide both income and capital growth. The initial charge on the Midland fund is 4 per cent, the annual fee is 0.5 per cent and the minimum lump sum investment is Pounds 1,000. There is a monthly savings plan for a minimum of Pounds 50 a month. David Dyer, fund manager of Axa Equity &amp; Law's Gilt and Fixed Interest unit trust, says investors have had two or three years of strong performance from gilts as UK interest rates have fallen. He thinks further rate cuts are unlikely but, with the average yield of a 10-year gilt at 8 per cent and the headline rate of inflation at 1.9 per cent in the year to March, 'investors are still enjoying a very attractive real return.' The Axa fund has a 5.5 per cent initial charge, a 1 per cent annual charge, and a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000. The market for permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) - fixed-interest shares issued by building societies to raise capital - was broadened this month with a new issue by First National, Ireland's second-largest building society. The shares are not classified as qualifying corporate bonds under UK law and, unlike other Pibs, are liable to capital gains tax. Hoare Govett, which helped launch the issue, says: 'The Irish housing market did not suffer a price boom in the 1980s and so there are very low rates of repossession and arrears, resulting in a building society that is much more stable than its UK counterpart. Even so, when assessing this stock to a comparable UK building society Pibs' issue - for example, Newcastle - there is still a yield pick-up of more than 1 per cent.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Largest 10 UK bond funds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                          Size (Pounds m)   Yield (%)     Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Uni Gilt &amp; Fxd           129.7           8.7         50.0 Axa Equity Gilt &amp; Fixed            74.6           6.3         50.2 Midland Gilt &amp; Fixed               62.1           6.9         44.6 Whittingdale Sht Dated             44.9           0.0         38.2 TSB Premier Income                 43.4           6.7         47.0 CU Preference Share                38.0           7.4         39.9 Kleinwort Benson Gilt              36.1           7.5         43.3 M&amp;G Gilt Income                    34.5           8.1         42.0 ManuLife Gilt &amp; Fixed              31.3           7.7         51.9 Fidelity Gilt &amp; Fixed              25.0           7.8         48.3 Sector average                     15.7           6.7         40.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. ** As of May . * Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over three years to May 1.

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Engineers warn on A-level courses SIXTH-form technology course in England and Wales are seriously inadequate and needs to be reformed if the numbers of those proceeding to university technology-based courses are not to continue declining, the Engineering Council warns in a report published today. It calls for technology A-level courses to be consistent with existing maths and physics courses, and for a greater emphasis on practical application. The report, written by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University, a government curriculum adviser, says: 'The great difficulty with technology at A-level is that hardly anyone seems to know what it is or how it is expected to fit into the curriculum.' It adds: 'It lacks any clear identity. Tortuous labels like Design and Technology (Technology) and Design and Technology (Communication) not only tend to get stuck on the tongue but leave the subjects largely unrecognised in higher education.' The council sets out an eight-point plan for reform. Technology at A-level. Engineering Council, 10 Maltravers Street, London WC 2R 3ER. Free Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (6): Partnership the watchword - Few companies in Italy are escaping the shake-out THE 15th Automotor international motor components, spares and accessories fair opened at Turin's Lingotto site at the beginning of June with a significant increase in the number of exhibitors. More than 600 companies were looking to boost their business by being in Turin, compared to 544 last year. Among the exhibitors were 90 from abroad, who considered the commercial benefits of the week-long fair would outweigh the costs. The growing popularity of the fair is evidence of the increasing pressures on the industry. The problems were underlined by Aldo Malandra, of Associazione Nazionale fra Industrie Automobilistiche (ANFIA, the Italian automobile industries association): 'These are difficult times for the whole automobile industry. The components industry is having to tackle the simultaneous challenges of a contracting market for new cars and weak demand in the spares after-market.' Original equipment makers in Italy have been unable to avoid being affected by the drop of 10 percentage points in the share held by Turin automobile group Fiat in its home market, from around 55 per cent to about 45 per cent over the past two years. 'Companies dependent on Fiat have been badly hit,' says Roberto Olivero, sales manager of Automotive Products Lockheed brake plant at Cairo Montenotte, south of the Piedmont capital. Fiat suppliers had to reduce their production levels in 1991, and the situation will probably worsen this year. 'Much was expected from the Tipo, but its sales have disappointed. Fiat's prospects will not get brighter until its ageing model line gets new models.' Moreover, Fiat is reducing the number of companies from which it purchases components. 'Partnership is becoming the watchword in the changing relationship between automobile maker and supplier,' says Mr Olivero. Partnership is also the word that ANFIA's Mr Malandra uses to describe the increasingly tighter relationship in which front-rank Italian components firms are being called on to boost in-house capability for research. 'Automobile makers are delegating as they de-verticalise, and this requires that components makers should be financially strong. The weakest are being sorted out.' As companies address a changing and challenging situation, they have had to increase their use of the state Cassa Integrazione Guadagni (CIG) fund for laying off surplus labour. Mr Malandra says that precise figures are not available, but ANFIA estimates that about 10 per cent of the component industry's total workforce of 140,000 is being paid by CIG. Lay-offs at Automotive Products' plant have paralleled those at Fiat. Few companies are unaffected by the present industry-wide shake-out, and Italy's biggest components group, Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli, is undergoing a big re-organisation. Last year this led to a reduction of 4,000 workers from a workforce that totalled about 30,000 at year-end 1990. Magneti Marelli's 1991 accounts included expenditure of L255bn on restructuring that has involved the closure of eight plants and rationalisation of production aimed at cost containment. The group says there is a 9 per cent improvement in productivity. It notes that turnover rose 4 per cent in the first four months of this year, and that operating margins have improved, confirming the validity of the re-organisation. (Consolidated accounts recorded a loss of L144bn on L3,287bn turnover in 1991, but the group expects a return to profit in the medium term.) In focusing on strategic businesses, Magneti Marelli has disposed of those that do not fit into its newly-defined portfolio. Its cable activities have gone to France's Labinal, seals to Britain's TI and horns to Fiamm, while batteries production has passed elsewhere in the Fiat Group. With more stringent environmental laws causing a significant drop in carburettor production, Magneti Marelli's efforts are increasing in the engine control sector which includes injectors and fuel pumps. The group's other key sectors are cooling, heating and air-conditioning systems, instrumentation, lighting and electro-mechanical equipment. The main outlet for Magneti Marelli's production is its domestic original equipment market, with Fiat Group's Italian operations taking 29 per cent of the total. Automobile makers in France and Germany take 19 and 14 per cent respectively, and Magneti Marelli points to its Q1 status as a Ford supplier, Class A with Peugeot and Renault and Supplier of the Year with General Motors. But Magneti Marelli's horizons extend to the emerging markets in Turkey and Poland. Foreign markets are important to a large part of the Italian automotive components industry. Mr Malandra says that between 20 and 25 per cent of the industry's total sales of L18,000bn last year were from exports. Italian makers of brake components rely heavily on sales abroad, with these accounting for more than half of aggregate turnover. 'Brake pads and linings are subject to wear, thus creating demand for spares. The relative lack of product and production sophistication makes market entry easy for small business,' says Mr Olivero at Automotive Products. Fragmentation between many small- and medium-sized companies is a characteristic of production of brake parts in Italy. But, in spite of the trend towards concentration, it continues to be a feature of the Italian automotive components industry as a whole. 'Few of the 1,000 companies in the industry are large. But fragmentation is not necessarily a weakness. The industry has the strength of flexibility. And in terms of technology and innovation it does not lag behind other countries,' says Mr Malandra. Reviewing the bleak situation, in which volumes of original equipment have been eroded by the fall in new car registrations and sales of spares adversely affected by improved component reliability, Mr Malandra sees a shaft of light ahead. 'At present cars in Italy are subject to their first official safety check 10 years after registration. A new highway code should reach the statute book in January 1993 which will make the first check obligatory after four years, with subsequent checks every two years. This ought to stimulate the spares market,' he says.</p>

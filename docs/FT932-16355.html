			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: James Capel directors quit over losses on venture fund THREE SENIOR directors of James Capel, the UK-based stockbroker owned by HSBC, resigned yesterday over losses of up to Pounds 16m on an eastern European venture capital fund. The three were Mr James Fergusson, the broker's managing director, Mr Peter Green, head of international operations, and Mr John Webster, head of Capel's New York office. Capel did not announce the reasons for the resignations, but all are believed to have been linked to the failure of New Europe Hotels, a company launched at the end of 1990 to raise money for hotel developments in eastern Europe. The company's shares were sold mainly through James Capel's New York office, and two Capel executives joined the New Europe board. The company collapsed last year, leaving investors with what is thought to have been almost a total write-off. Capel is believed to have compensated investors who bought shares through its New York office, at a cost to the broker of as much as Pounds 16m. Capel's Pounds 7.5m operating profit for last year, after restructuring and after charges, was struck after the compensation costs, the company said. At the time New Europe was launched, Mr Fergusson was head of Capel's international operations and Mr Green ran the New York office. Capel moved quickly yesterday to announce replacements for the three departing executives. Mr Bob Benton, head of the UK institutional equities division, was named as managing director; Mr Peter Maynard, former head of compliance, is to become president of James Capel in New York; and Mr Duncan Agar, an institutional equities salesman, has become head of the non-European international desks in London. After the announcement of a new deputy chairman last Friday, the appointments amount to a substantial overhaul of the senior management of the UK broker. Mr Peter Letley, who joined Capel as finance director in 1988, was named deputy chairman under Mr Bernard Asher, the HSBC director who took over the Capel chairmanship two years ago. Mr Benton said yesterday that the management upheaval did not imply any change of direction at Capel. The broker would continue its efforts to build trading and corporate finance operations on the back of its established international equity distribution business, he said.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Bonn throws full weight behind EMS - Group of seven and IMF meetings in Washington GERMANY said at the weekend it would do everything to maintain the European Monetary System in spite of last week's monetary chaos which left sterling and the lira suspended from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, told a press conference after Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington that the EMS was a 'central component' for achieving price stability in Europe and moving towards economic and monetary union. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said it was open to question whether the rules of the ERM had been properly observed in the light of last week's massive intervention. Mr Schlesinger disclosed that Germany bought DM60bn (Pounds 22.7bn) worth of foreign currencies during the crisis in the EMS, with intervention during one day amounting to DM35bn - mainly in support of the lira. He was critical of the way in which ERM parities had been realigned and the way participation of the pound and lira had been suspended. Realignments were supposed to be carried out early and without a great public debate, he said. This was clearly not the case with last week's events. Tensions in the system had been allowed to build up since the last significant realignment in 1987. For many of the other EMS countries realignment seemed to be a 'dirty word', Mr Schlesinger added. It remained to be seen what the effects of intervention would be on Germany's money supply. Some funds could flow back across the foreign exchanges, easing pressure. While he said the Bundesbank's goal of maintaining price stability would be easier to achieve after the EMS changes, Mr Schlesinger - and Mr Waigel - made clear there would be no early cuts in German interest rates. He said the discussion on German rates had one-sidedly focused on money market rates. Germany's long-term rates, which were crucial for investment decisions, were, at about 7.5 per cent, lower than elsewhere in Europe.</p>

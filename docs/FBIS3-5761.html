			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Japan's KYODO news agency reports from Beijing on 9  March that in the upcoming Chinese People's National Congress  meeting, the government action report that Premier Li Peng will  present is supposed to mention China's friendly relations with  North Korea first in its foreign policy division, thereby  stressing the complete restoration of North Korea-China  relations.    KYODO reported this citing Chinese sources, and said that  while China's top priority last year was on the development of  Sino- Japanese relations, the order of priority has changed this  year.    KYODO said that China will list North Korea-China friendly  relations first on China's priority list in Premier Li Peng's  foreign policy action report apparently to proclaim the complete  restoration of Sino-North Korean relations which have cooled off  since the establishment of Sino-ROK relations in August 1992.</p>

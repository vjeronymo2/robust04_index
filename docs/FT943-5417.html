			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Travel: Flowers in a harsh land It is spring in South Africa, and not just politically. So I ought not to have been surprised when I ran into one of the country's most notorious former terrorists, Ronnie Kasrils of the African National Congress (now deputy minister of defence), wandering among the spring wild flowers in a nature reserve far up the west coast of Cape Province. He was only doing what comes naturally to South Africans (and what the ANC was prevented from doing during 30 years of exile): savouring the beauty of a harsh and savage landscape that becomes a wild-flower wilderness for a few short weeks each spring. It is South Africa's equivalent of New England's annual display of autumn colour. Every year, during a few weekends in late August and September, thousands drive the wide straight roads north from Cape Town to visit the flower fields of the Cape West Coast, and the rugged gorges and arid valleys of the South West Cape interior. The local tourist board, Captour, runs a seven-days-a- week 'flower hotline' to tell tourists where to find the best blooms. The answer is in a number of 'flower reserves', where the displays are perhaps most striking, but also along a host of anonymous dirt roads, which run for miles between wild-flower meadows where white Namaqualand daisies dust the fields like snow, and banks of brilliant orange, pink and yellow blooms line the verges and adorn the rocky hillsides of this harsh and isolated land. I ran into Kasrils on a sun-filled Saturday afternoon at the Ramskop flower reserve outside Clanwilliam, an Afrikaans town which, like so many in the Cape, bears a deceptively Scottish name. I found him among the rich golden boterblomme, or butterflowers (no relation to the buttercup, which is far smaller and more delicate), the deep red gousblomme (a kind of aster), and shocking pink vygies, or 'little figs' - flowering succulents whose extravagant large blooms adorn even the most arid soil. The Latin name of the vygies - mesembryanthemaceae - says it all. They open only toward mid-day in warm sunny weather. The trick to seeing them is always to travel with the sun at your back, for the blooms face the sun; approached from behind they can be almost invisible. When you tire of flower-spotting from car windows, get out and wander (with the farmer's permission) in fields of heliophila (sun-lover) or blue flax, wild arum lilies (known as 'pig lilies' in Afrikaans), tall yellow daisy bushes and wild Cape honeysuckle and nemesia. I had a lovely wander up a secluded gorge near the 1831 homestead called Kapteinskloof, where I stayed. It is a pioneer home with thick white-washed walls, thatched roofs and a profusion of antiques which make it a stunning monument to Cape Dutch architecture (the food is a testament to modern Cape cookery). Best of all, perhaps, are the wild-flower meadows which run down to the Atlantic in West Coast national park, less than an hour up the coast from Cape Town (in Langebaan, stay at the Farmhouse, with splendid views of Langebaan lagoon and a wood fire in every room for cold spring nights). In Postburg nature reserve, within the park, zebras and wildebeest, wild ostriches and gemsbok graze in the wild-flower fields. Only time will tell whether South Africa's political spring lasts very long. But the wild-flowers will be there again next year, and the year after that.

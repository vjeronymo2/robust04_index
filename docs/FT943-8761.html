			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / IMF mission in Ukraine An International Monetary Fund mission arrived in Ukraine yesterday to help the government work out a programme to stabilise the economy. The Ukrainian government pledged last month to work with the IMF over the next two months to clear the way for Kiev to receive a Dollars 700m systemic transformation facility, part of a special fund designed to speed the transition to capitalism for the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The mission is the first to visit Ukraine with a mandate to negotiate a programme. The Group of Seven industrialised nations last month promised Ukraine Dollars 4bn in economic assistance - mostly from international financial institutions  - if the country pushes ahead with serious reforms.</p>

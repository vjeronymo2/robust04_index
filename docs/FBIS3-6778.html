			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas says  Indonesia's candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the UN  Security Council [UNSC] will face no obstacles as in previous  years. Ali Alatas told reporters in Jakarta that there has been  no opposition to Indonesia's current candidacy. Thus, Indonesia  is not expected to withdraw its candidacy. There has also been  no other candidate from the Asian group. He said Indonesia had  the intention of becoming a UNSC non- permanent member since  assuming the chairmanship of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] in  1992, as a NAM chairman is traditionally an UNSC non-permanent  member for a two-year term. Indonesia failed in its bid in 1992  because Oman representing the Arab countries asked Indonesia to  withdraw its candidacy. Oman said it had been prepared for the  post for a long time. Pakistan, which made its bid for a UNSC  non-permanent seat, asked Indonesia to reconsider its candidacy  in 1993. Indonesia is now confident that there will be no  obstacles in its bid for the 1995-1997 term in 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [TEXT] Costs are rising in research and development. Many  companies fear that know-how will move over to the competition.    In-house work or outsourcing -- this is no longer just a  question in production but also in research and development. For  costs are rising there as well, because the product and  innovation cycles are getting shorter and shorter. For example,  while the costs of research and development in the large  electronics companies were in 1980 still at about the level of  net profit, they have since increased by more than a factor of  two. By allocating research tasks to third parties, the costs  can be reduced.    "The possibilities of outsourcing are, however, only being  used by a few companies," Michael Eyett, of the renowned  advisory institute Prognos AG in Basel, observes. Eyett also  knows the reason for the reticence: Companies are too afraid  that through outsourcing, the competition will gain possession  of know-how belonging to the companies themselves.    At the same time, investigations carried out by Prognos AG  show that companies which cooperate with other manufactures in  research and development are more successful: As a rule, they  demonstrate a greater share of new products, and obtain an above  average growth in turnover as well as a higher export quota than  do companies which are less amenable to cooperation. In  addition, personnel costs for research and development are  plainly lower.    Still, the decision for or against outsourcing of research  and development capacities should be well considered. In-house  research and development does offer the company some advantages:     -  Control over research and development remains with the  company;    -  Acquired know-how can be used on an exclusive basis;    -  The company preserves its technological independence;    -  The success of its own in-house research bestows on the  company  a positive image among the public;    -  Internal cooperation among the various departments functions  better.       But some disadvantages of in-house R&amp;D activities must  not be  concealed:     -  High fixed and lead costs accumulate;    -  In-house research requires a lot of time;    -  And, in addition, there is still always the risk of not  succeeding technically and economically.       Prognos advisor Michael Eyett is not pleading the case that  each research and development project should be given over to a  third party. Eyett proposes that those areas which will in the  future be a part of the core know-how for the company should  remain in-house. Also, activities in which the company has  developed technological know-how or which promise synergistic  effects with available technological know-how should remain with  the company.    Eyett is certain that such observations will be made with  greater frequency in the future: "The trend towards increasing  outsourcing of research and development will strengthen in the  future."    The series "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st Century"  will be continued in coming weeks. Planned for the next edition:  Digital Television.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Profits at Federated reach Dollars 113m for year FEDERATED Department Stores, which emerged from bankruptcy last year and includes large department store chains such as Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche and Jordan Marsh, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 113m for the 12 months to January 30. The figure was reached on sales up to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.93bn, and compared with a net profits figure of Dollars 836.4m in the previous year. However, the 1991-92 result was struck after various one-time items, including a Dollars 2.1bn extraordinary gain and a Dollars 1.68bn reorganisation charge. In the final quarter of 1992-93, Federated made an after-tax profit of Dollars 99m, on sales up from Dollars 2.13bn to Dollars 2.26bn. Yesterday, Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman, said the group was very pleased with the year's performance, and 'well-positioned for sustained earnings growth'. "We are encouraged by the increase in consumer spending and its positive impact on the economy in the fourth quarter,' Mr Questrom added, though he said he thought it prudent to remain cautious about the economic outlook.</p>

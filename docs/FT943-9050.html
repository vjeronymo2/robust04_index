			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cost savings behind Haden's 22% advance Haden MacLellan Holdings, the diversified engineering group, yesterday announced a 22 per cent increase in interim profits as its wide-ranging restructuring and cost-saving programme began to pay off. Despite intense competition in several markets, pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover of Pounds 171.8m (Pounds 152.7m). Operating profits increased 33 per cent to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.1m). The shares closed up 5p at 84p. The improvement was fuelled mainly by the process engineering and services operation in North America, where profits rose to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 500,000) following record orders from the automotive industry and a two-year drive to reduce costs. Mr Richard Taylor, group managing director, welcomed the results but warned that the group would have to focus on its core interests - including industrial fasteners, machine tools and paint finishing systems - if it was to achieve significant earnings growth. 'We've cut costs, but there's more to be done and we're looking at divesting non-core activities,' he said. The disposal plan is likely to focus on the manufacturing and distribution division, where profits rose only marginally to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000) on turnover of Pounds 44.2m (Pounds 40.9m). Although margins had improved, Mr Taylor said the market for the machine tool business 'remained pretty dismal'. Its sluggish performance was offset partially by profits of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.2m) in the fasteners business, which benefited from increased investment in new plant and facilities. The Pounds 13m rights issue in March helped reduce net borrowings from Pounds 11.6m at the year end to Pounds 2.5m - equivalent to gearing of 14 per cent. 'We've strengthened the balance sheet and restored our credibility as a global player,' said Mr Taylor. Earnings per share rose to 1.7p (1.3p); the interim dividend is held at 1p.</p>

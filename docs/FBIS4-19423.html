			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision has therefore been made, and a  timetable more or less set. The Belgian blue helmets will leave  Rwanda, but not before Tuesday [19 April], to give Ghana time to  relieve them. Earlier this morning, Jacqueline Pollack spoke to  Colonel Gilbert Hertog, spokesman of the Defense Information  Service:    [Begin recording] [Hertog] The Belgian unit which is  currently at the airport is preparing its final return to  Belgium.    [Pollack] You said yesterday that the blue helmets would  leave Kigali at the beginning of the week. What day does this  mean?    [Hertog] It is difficult to say exactly when they will  leave. They will leave as soon as possible, but without undue  haste. In the context of the UN peacekeeping operation in  Rwanda, the unit will be relieved tomorrow by the Ghanaians. In  principle, they will begin their withdrawal on Tuesday at the  earliest.    [Pollack] Once they have begun to leave how long will it  take  them to pull out of Rwanda?    [Hertog] We expect it will take about 12 hours to leave  Rwandan territory. [end recording]    The blue helmets will be evacuated overland toward Tanzania.  They will leave by road because this enables the whole  contingent to depart together, and at less expense, the Defense  Information Service explained yesterday. About 100 refugees  will be accompanying the Belgian blue helmets, mostly Europeans.  The Belgians and the United Nations have therefore come to an  agreement. The political decision to pull out comes from  Brussels, but the military order comes from New York. We spoke  to Foreign Minister Willy Claes:    [Begin Claes recording] The general in charge of military  operations at the United Nations in New York has asked Canadian  General Dallaire, the UN commander in Kigali, to give the  Belgian blue helmets the military order to evacuate Rwandan  territory. In other words, it is not our Belgian Lieutenant  General Charlier who is giving the blue helmets the order, but  the UN command ordering the blue helmets, who happen to be  Belgian, to pull out.

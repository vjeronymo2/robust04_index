			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Cookery: The Italian way with noodles Watching flakes swirl past the kitchen window the other day, I remembered my last real encounter with snow - in alpine Italy one June. Yes, June. The silent, white slopes of Lo Stelvio in Alta Valtellina are packed so deep with snow that skiers go there when the season in other resorts has ended. Not being much of a skier myself I toured the pistes on the back of a snow plough. Next day, in a sheltered valley near Sondrio, I visited the farm of a couple whose riding stables provide ideal transport for touring the lower slopes of the region. There, Laura Bonat gave me my first lesson in pasta-making. Last week, I tried my hand at making pizzoccheri again, with Anna Del Conte as my mentor, and this week I embarked on solo efforts. Pizzoccheri is a speciality of Valtellina: broad-ribboned noodles with a distinctive character provided by buckwheat flour. This is the speckled, toasty, nutty-tasting ingredient we associate more readily with blinis and galettes. Some health food stores sell it, as do Italian specialist shops. Pizzoccheri can be dressed simply with sizzling garlic and sage-scented butter and sprinkled with cheese. Strictly speaking, the cheese should be a mixture of Parmigiano-Reggiano and bitto, which is a Valtellinese cheese that melts well and is marvellously rich and complex in flavour when made properly. Fontina is the best substitute in Britain although, at a pinch, you can use St Paulin or Port Salut if you are prepared to accept a lack of north Italian authenticity. Traditionally, pizzoccheri is dressed not only with flavoured butter and cheese but also with cabbage and potatoes. In fact, so popular is this combination in its homeland that the word pizzoccheri is used not just for the pasta itself but also for the dish that includes the buckwheat noodles, potatoes and cabbage. PIZZOCCHERI (serves 6) While pasta is high-profile food in Britain and a fashionable choice for informal entertaining, pizzoccheri is relatively unknown. To make and serve your own could be one way to steal a march on all but a few foodie cognoscenti. For the pasta: 8oz buckwheat flour; 4oz plain white household flour, preferably Italian 00; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 large egg; about  1/4 pt warm semi-skimmed milk and water mixed. For the dressing: 6oz potato, peeled and cut into  1/2 oz chunks; 12oz Savoy cabbage sliced into  1/2 in-wide ribbons; 2 1/2 oz butter; 1 small onion chopped very finely; 1 large garlic clove chopped very finely; 6-7 finely-shredded sage leaves; 2 1/2 oz freshly-grated Parmesan cheese; 5oz fontina cheese (or St Paulin or Port Salut) cut into flakes. Method: Sift both flours and salt into a ring on a work surface. Crack the egg into the well and break it up with a fork. Gradually, draw the flour into the egg and work in the tepid milky water by slow degrees. (Depending on the quality of the flours and on humidity, you might not need all the liquid or you could need a drop more). Mix with a fork at first, then with your fingers, and knead gently for about five minutes to make an elastic dough. Wrap the dough and let it rest at room temperature for at least an hour (or refrigerate it if preparing a day ahead). Slice the dough like a loaf and flour each slice lightly. Either roll out each one by hand until about  1/8 in thick, or pass them through the rollers of a hand-cranked machine, tightening the rollers gradually up to the last but two notches. Cut the pasta into ribbons about 4in long by nearly  3/4 in wide. Lay them, close but not touching, on clean cloths and leave to dry slightly before cooking. The knack of cooking pizzoccheri lies in using a really large pan (to prevent over-crowding and sticking) and in getting the ingredients to complete cooking simultaneously. The following are guidelines rather than gospel; exact timing will depend, of course, on the thickness and elasticity of the pasta, on the variety of potato, the size of the chunks, and so on. Drop the potatoes into plenty of well-salted boiling water and cook for 10 minutes. Throw in the cabbage. As soon as the water comes back to the boil, start adding the noodles, bit by bit and mixing them in well. Within five minutes of the liquid returning to the boil, all three ingredients probably will be ready. While all this is happening, soften the onion thoroughly in the butter in a separate small pan, together with the garlic and sage. Drain the cooked pasta, potatoes and cabbage and return them to the pan. Pour on the flavoured butter and toss to mix. Pile the mixture into a well-heated, shallow dish, scattering the grated Parmesan and flakes of cheese between layers. Cover the dish with a dome of foil and slip it into a moderate oven for, say, five minutes until the cheeses soften and melt. Serve quickly on hot plates.</p>

			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (3): Spearheading the transition - David Waller discusses the financial services sector in the east PRIOR to monetary union in the summer of 1990, there was no private sector financial services industry in the eastern part of Germany. Since then, banks and insurance companies have been at the cutting edge of the transition to a market economy. Drawn by the prospect of early responsibilities, young bankers and insurance executives have flocked to the new Lander in their thousands, while middle-aged executives and their families have moved eastwards in the hope of adventure. East Germans have travelled in the other direction, the willing recipients of a massive private-sector education programme, the aim of which is to turn those brought up under communism into fully-functioning capitalists. The first graduates of these training schemes are returning to take up management positions in the east. The biggest investment in the east has come from those institutions which bought the old state banking and insurance monopolies. Others have been building their businesses from scratch. In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two largest banks in Germany, bought the Staatsbank, the old state sector bank, from the Treuhand privatisation agency, parcelling out the branch network between them. Allianz, the Munich-based insurance giant which ranks as one of the biggest financial institutions in Europe, bought Deutsche Versicherungs (DVAG), the former East German state insurance monopoly. There are 35,000 employed in the insurance industry in the east - 14,000 at the Allianz operation - and this is expected to rise to 50,000 by 1996. Information from the Cologne-based German Banks' Association shows that by May this year, 47 banks were active in the east, with around 750 branches, likely to increase to 1,000 by the end of next year. The total invested in buildings, fittings and information technology amounted to DM2.7bn by May, with another DM2.3bn earmarked for spending by the end of 1993. At the beginning of May, the banks employed around 19,000 people in the east, of whom 4,600 were from the west. Total lending amounted to DM50.5bn, of which 83 per cent is lent to corporate clients rather than private investors. Nevertheless, the volume of lending to individuals has risen from DM1.8bn at the end of 1990 to DM8.5bn. As Professor Otmar Issing, Bundesbank director, observed last month, one ninth of all bank lending in Germany is now done directly in the east, and further large sums are lent in connection with west German firms' investment in the east. Many of the banks claim to have made a quick return from their business in the east, heavy investment notwithstanding. This is less due to their entrepreneurial skills or the burgeoning demand for credit, than the fact that the state has indirectly given them a helping hand. Until the beginning of this year, the banks were shielded from the real risks of doing business in the east. Guarantees from the Treuhand ensured that the bulk of the lending done in the east was risk-free: if the borrower went under, the debt would be repaid by the Treuhand. The interest rate charged for such loans was lower than would be charged for normal commercial business, but it was still comfortably higher than the banks' cost of funds. Critics have complained that the banks charged too much for a risk-free loan, while the banks have defended themselves by saying that the margin was deserved given the amount of time they spent with their new customers, helping them to get to grips with the basics of business in a free-market economy. Even now, several months after the Treuhand said it would put a stop to new guarantees, more than two thirds of the total loans outstanding in the east are protected. Business done at the banks' own risk has risen from DM4.8bn at the end of 1990 to DM15.3bn at the end of March this year. In future, it will be harder for the banks to find opportunities to lend according to normal commercial criteria. Given the lack of basic business skills in the east and the absence of anything amounting to credit history, it is inevitable that bad debts - and provisioning against them - will increase. Even now, the costs of investments are beginning to tell, most notably at Deutsche Bank. Even though the bank's activities in the east account for a relatively small part of total business, its investment there meant that staff and operating costs rose by DM1.5bn to DM10bn last year, disappointing analysts when the bank announced its figures in April. The question of costs is much more pronounced at Allianz, which laid out DM711m in two stages to buy DVAG. On top of that it seems likely that the eastern operations will lose more than DM1.5bn in operating losses before it starts to make an operating profit, perhaps in 1996. It will go into cumulative profit at some stage in the early part of the next century. If the cost of funds is taken into account, the payback will come even later. While Anglo-Saxon analysts scratch their heads and observe that the deal does not make sense according to normal commercial criteria, Allianz is convinced it has made the correct strategic decision. It was based in Berlin before the Second World War and feels that it is returning home by buying DVAG. It also belives that the prospects for the market in the east are excellent - before reunification East Germans spent on insurance about one tenth of their West German neighbours and there is thus lots of catching up to do. Allianz also belives that rival insurers will have to spend even more money to build their businesses from scratch. The long-term prospects for the financial services sector in the east depend, of course, on the development of the east German economy overall. Sadly, not all industries have invested as vigorously and as early as the banks and insurance companies.</p>

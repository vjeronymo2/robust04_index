			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (11): Quebec seeks to restore its vitality  -Robert Gibbens on prospects for the country's only French-speaking province WITH the constitutional referendum behind it, Quebec is marshalling all its energies in the hope of restoring the economic vitality of the 1980s. Most voters in Canada's only French-speaking province are well satisfied that Quebec was among six provinces which voted No in the October referendum. But now they want the constitutional issue shelved, pending next year's federal election. 'I was very disappointed Canada did not grasp the opportunity to accept the Charlottetown package,' says Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier. 'But Quebec's 56 per cent No clearly was not a vote for independence - that's crucial. Everybody now agrees we must move on to other urgent matters and try to spur our lagging economy.' Quebec and Ontario, with two-thirds of Canada's 26.5m population and most of its manufacturing base, have been most severely affected by the recession. Sagging primary product prices, especially for forest products and metals, declining construction and lower protective tariffs have sharpened the pain for Quebec. Only recently have lower interest rates and a lower Canadian dollar brought relief. Quebec's unemployment persists at an average 12.5 per cent, with pockets of 20 per cent in some areas. The property crisis rivals Ontario's and retailing has been decimated. Provincial and municipal deficits have swollen in the past two years, taxes are up and services are down. Signs of US recovery are encouraging, says Mr Bourassa, but he feels that any stimulus from the Clinton administration's economic policies will not be felt in Quebec before 1994. The pace of recovery may be slow. Quebec urgently needs a stable dollar and lower interest rates to revive profits, encourage investment and create jobs, he says. It remains fully open to North America and the world for trade and investment. The government is trying to forge a new partnership with business to meet the challenge of market globalisation, mobility of production and growing competition. 'Restructuring of Quebec's economy is in full swing and we must create the new jobs in the high value-added sectors,' says Mr Pierre Pettigrew, a management consultant helping companies to cope with the challenges of the 1990s. 'Government must become more competitive and entrepreneurial and help to find partners for Quebec's growth sectors in other provinces and abroad. Montreal must become a great North American city again. We have a chance to break with the past.' The government wants to use the Dollars 42bn Caisse de Depot, the investment arm for the Quebec Pension Plan, to speed the transition and foster growth. Other business groups, from the Desjardins financial services giant, the commercial banks and industry associations to Reseau du Capital de Risque, a group formed to expand channels for venture capital, are joining in. The private sector is confident that many companies can compete globally, especially in the US. More than 70 per cent of Quebec's exports go to the US. Quebec's comparative advantage in some sectors can be used to foster foreign investment and exports, says Mr Charles Perrault, president of Schroder Investments Canada and a director of Northern Telecom. A German-led consortium brought the US Dollars 1bn Alouette aluminium smelter on stream at Sept Iles this summer on time and on budget. According to Mr Perrault, 'the economics may rest on power and a year-round port, but it was the young and well-educated workforce that made the smooth start-up possible. Quebec has come a long way in 30 years and education has dramatically changed the outlying regions.' The government plans improvements to industrial training, with the help of a new agreement with Ottawa. In the longer term, secondary education is to be revamped to adapt the workforce to the 1990s. Mr Bourassa has promised a more competitive corporate tax burden, but business wants heavy cutbacks in the civil service to lower the high cost of government. Public sector pay, long a strong inflationary factor, has been capped, but business complains that the government has lost control of costs in the industrial health and safety system. These are borne mainly by employers. Quebec has five or six competitive sectors with good growth prospects: aerospace and transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and information technology, power generation equipment, metals and food processing. The province is promoting these with research and development programmes, tax credits, loans and infrastructure projects. All draw heavily on greater Montreal's skilled manpower - the region contains half of Quebec's total population of 6.5m and has a full range of financial and legal services in French, English and several other languages. The leaders include Bombardier, BCE, Merck Frosst Canada, CAE Industries, Alsthom, Alcan Aluminium and Noranda, all international companies. Mr Gerard Tremblay, the industry minister, is also focusing on petrochemicals, textiles and clothing, pulp and paper, environmental products and some cultural industries, encouraging initiative from the regions. Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, has attacked the government's ability to shape effective policies for recovery. Mr Parizeau, whose party is trying to capitalise on the No vote in the referendum, argues that the federal government retains too many levers. He has promised a referendum on sovereignty if he can win the next provincial election, which is likely to be held in 1994. On the other hand, even the PQ knows that Quebec cannot isolate itself. The language issue is confined to Montreal because of its pluralistic make-up. The government would like to ease a contentious ban on English-language exterior commercial signs late in 1993. But this will be done only if francophones, accounting for 75 per cent of the city's 3m population, feel secure that they will be able to continue to live and work in a French environment.</p>

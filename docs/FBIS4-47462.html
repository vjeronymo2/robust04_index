Avseyev, Chemical Reactor  and Ultrapure Chemical SRI (State); UDC681.322:54-41]    [Abstract] Effective development of science and technology  requires wide range information on research and experimental  design works. Lack of such information is especially acute when  priority objectives are concerned. Since progress in these areas  is largely determined by the production of chemical reagents and  ultra-pure substances, this requires a stream of the most  diversified information. Information systems in chemistry occupy  a special place within automated information systems due to the  need for handling huge volumes of highly complex information.  One of the major problems of chemists working on chemical  reagents and ultra-pure substances is optimization in selecting  a method for purification and the equipment design needed to  provide a given degree of purity. Resolution of these problems  within the framework of a developing expert system (scheme) was  facilitated by the following: a) classification and  systematization of existing information; b) development of an  interface with the user, and development of program shell for  the expert system; c) development of a system for comprehending  the subject matter and the multiplicity of rules describing it;  d) filling out a data base. In the present work some results are  presented on the development of an expert system for analyzing  methods of preparation and equipment design for  ultra-purification that takes into account the physical chemical  properties of the product and a required level of impurities. A  multi-level systematization of the literature and an expert  evaluation of purification methods was developed and a universal  shell based on the FoxPro data base system was worked out. This  enables development of expert systems in the technology of  chemical reagents and ultra-pure substances that also provides  the user with the opportunity to supplement and modify the data  base if needed.

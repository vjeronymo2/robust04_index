			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT: FULLERTON ARBORETUM  </P> <P> Location: Northeast corner, Cal State Fullerton campus.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 773-3579.  </P> <P> Description: Gardens and a historical area are featured on the arboretum's 26  acres. A waterfall, stream and ponds along the western side provide a moist  environment for plants as well as a sanctuary for native birds, fish and pond  turtles. There is also a small library of books and periodicals on botanical,  horticultural and ecological subjects.  </P> <P> Botanical collection: Unlike many other botanical gardens and arboreta, which  group their plants by geographic origin, the Fullerton Arboretum has arranged  its plantings by moisture requirements. Major areas include temperate,  subtropical, desert, desert woodland and Mediterranean-type habitats. Other  garden areas include the palm garden, the subtropical fruit grove, the conifer  area, community gardens, a cactus and succulent garden, a carnivorous plant bog  and a working apiary.  </P> <P> Historical area: Heritage House, an example of Eastlake Victorian architecture,  was built in 1894 for one of Fullerton's first physicians and was moved to the  arboretum in 1972. It now serves as a museum of medical practice and family  life at the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Programs: Guided tours, workshops, demonstrations, displays and seminars are  planned throughout the year. Weekday group tours of the grounds or Heritage  House canbe arranged by calling the arboretum. Fullerton Arboretum is open  daily, except major holidays, from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Heritage House is open  for guided tours without reservations each Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m., except  </P> <P> during August. The library is open for public use by appointment weekdays 8  a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. The arboretum gift and garden shop near the  entrance is open mid-day Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Mass transit: OCTD routes 43, 49, 49a.  </P></p>

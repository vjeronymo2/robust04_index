			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's message by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev; from </F> the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense Ministry --  recorded]    [Text] I would like to pass on my New Year's greetings to  all the servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces. They are  carrying out their military service today under very difficult  conditions. Let all the hopes of the people in epaulettes for  an improved, calmer, dignified, and happier life come true. I  sincerely wish all the families of servicemen and veterans of  the armed forces confidence in tomorrow in the New Year. I  extend special gratitude to all the servicemen who are at  present courageously, I may say, selflessly carrying out their  duties in the hot spots.    May 1994 bring peace, quiet, and confidence in the future  into each home. May all the bitterness with which the departing  year was filled remain in the past, and may shots never ring out  in our towns. I wish all citizens of Russia good health,  happiness, love of life, and optimism in the New Year.</p>

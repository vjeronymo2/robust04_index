			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Atomic Electric Power Plants [AES] </F> Are Coming to Our Help"]    [Text] As reported by Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic  Energy, last year, Ukrainian nuclear plants produced 75,238,900  kilowatt/hours of electricity. This is 111 percent of what was  planned. The energy output of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power  station accounted for 42.76 percent of the total amount of  electricity produced by all the nuclear power stations.    At the same time, the extension of the period of maintenance  work at the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power station and individual  faults in the operation of all of the nuclear power stations led  to the failure to produce 8,071,110 kilowatt/hours more. Last  year, a total of 239 accidents were recorded at nuclear power  stations. As a result of 62 of them, power units were halted,  and 109 led to power reductions. None of the accidents involved  an increase in the radioactive background at the stations or  around them.    In 1993, the share of the energy produced by Ukrainian  nuclear power stations increased again. While in 1990, it  amounted to 25.7 percent; in 1991 -- 27.1 percent; and in 1992  -- 29.4 percent; in 1993, it reached 32.9 percent. Since 18  January 1994, five Ukrainian nuclear power stations have been  producing 42 percent of the total daily output of electric  energy. Problems with deliveries of organic fuel are making  themselves felt.</p>

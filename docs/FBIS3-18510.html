			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] Intense pressure was mounting on the Government  tonight to send extra forces to Bosnia in response to an urgent  United Nations plea. But the Government made clear it was  awaiting a commitment from the United States and other countries  before agreeing.    The Prime Minister said the Government would consider  providing more troops, but only as part of a wider international  effort.    And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind emphasised the  Government's concern that it is already doing its fair share in  Bosnia, with 2,500 troops on the ground.    He was replying to the appeal for 10,650 more soldiers by  Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for former Yugoslavia, who  warned that fragile ceasefires would otherwise collapse.    Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in  Bosnia, warned his troops were operating "on a wing and a  prayer," well outside normal sensible limits.    "If I can give an example -- a week ago there were only four  Warrior vehicles left to try and control one of the most  hotly-contested crossing points across the line of conflict in  central Bosnia and that was in Gorni Vakuf," he said.    Mr Rifkind, in a clear reference to the United States, said  the Government had always said its view would be influenced by  whether other UN members, including those with "highly-trained,  highly-professional forces," were ready to contribute.    "Britain is already the second largest contributor and  therefore it is not unreasonable to say that if there was a  burden to be met, it should be spread properly and widely  amongst the relevant countries," he said.    But he insisted: "We have not ruled out the question of more  troops."    Government sources said ministers were "not reluctant" to do  more but felt strongly that pressure must now be placed on other  nations, notably the United States, which has only 15 troops in  Bosnia, to play a much bigger role.    General Jean Cot, UN commander in former Yugoslavia, stepped  up pressure on Washington saying the American refusal to send  troops until an enforceable peace treaty is signed was "a  strange and not very courageous idea."    "The better idea is to send troops when they're needed -- to  enforce the coming of a peace," added. "I would be very keen for  U.S. troops to be on the ground tomorrow."    And in an unusually blunt news conference with Gen Cot, Mr  Akashi hit out: "We are profoundly disturbed by the lukewarm and  negative response to date."    There was anger in the British military that deployment of  extra troops to Bosnia could be jeopardised by reports of a  looming clash with the Cabinet.    As rapidly developing peace initiatives give a glimmer of  hope that an end to the bitter ethnic fighting could be in  sight, the Government faces tough decisions.    The Cabinet rejected the view by the four Service chiefs  last  month that Britain should send a second infantry battalion,  after the urgent request from General Rose for up to 3,000  reinforcements when the Serbs agreed to pull back their heavy  weapons around Sarajevo or place them in UN control.    The Service chiefs argued it was crucial to be seen to back  the British general and to support the peace process boosted by  Nato's tough new approach.    But they were overruled by the Cabinet as ministers again  stressed Britain was already doing its bit.    "Emotionally the people in uniform inevitably feel we should  have done more," said a MoD source. "But the chiefs know they  are in a political arena and are quite content with the  decision. There is no split."    There are fears that reports -- fiercely denied by MoD and  military sources -- that the chiefs are squaring up for a major  row with Cabinet ministers over new deployments could put plans  at risk.    The Army is adamant that nothing smaller than a  self-sufficient battalion group could be sent.    "Anything smaller would be disastrous," said one officer.    But a military source said: "These reports have made it more  difficult to send. Senior ministers could well dig in their  heels."    UN troops are already stretched far and thin across Bosnia  and there are growing risks that they could be isolated and  attacked.    Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff, urged the  Government to send a battalion of troops.    "Quite frankly, a British battalion -- expert in this sort  of  thing -- is worth two or three of some others from other  places," he added.    A company of about 150 Coldstream Guards sent to help to  police the peace in Sarajevo are living in the back of their  Warrior armoured fighting vehicles on the side of a mountain in  heavy snow.    "You can only maintain that sort of existence for a short  period before morale begins to fall," said another officer.    There are contingency plans to send a further 2,000 troops  to  Bosnia in a crisis to support the force already there.    The Army has two infantry battalions equipped with Saxon  lightly-armoured personnel carriers already painted in UN white  colours, which would be ideal for peacekeeping operations.    Either the Green Howards or the Duke of Wellington's  Regiment  could be sent quickly to Bosnia with their 64 Saxons and  logistics back-up by sea and air.    As the RAF's C-130 Hercules transport aircraft can each  carry  two Saxons together with men and logistics support, lead  elements could be in Bosnia within days.</p>

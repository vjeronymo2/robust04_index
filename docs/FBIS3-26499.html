It was reported that  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have told  various important sectors, including the important ministries  and commissions under the State Council, the Association of  Industry and Commerce, relevant public security and military  departments, the Guangdong and Fujian Governments, and the  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering Hong Kong to do all  supportive work well and to exert their utmost to achieve  unification and to materialize the principle of "one country,  two systems." Jiang Zemin said: "We must recover Hong Kong in  1997. We must have this mettle."    Sino-British talks have broken down and China now cherishes  no illusions about British cooperation in the run-up to 1997 and  beyond. Just as Zhou Nan put it: "They can do whatever they  like." To successfully carry out the principle of "one country,  two systems" in Hong Kong in 1997 and to maintain Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity, China has to successfully carry out  several tasks, including choosing qualified administrators,  especially the chief executive of the Special Administrative  Region (SAR); strive to obtain sufficient financial reserves;  unite with the Hong Kong people; retain qualified people; and  avoid the possibility of shouldering various burdens.  <H3>  Deng Xiaoping Said: The Future Hong Kong Government Should  Be Stable and Powerful </H3>   There are only three years left.    Deng Xiaoping said: Who is to be appointed the future SAR  chief is a key issue. In the "second half" of the transitional  period or after the change-over of sovereignty, the most  important things to do are to maintain stability and prevent  political, economic, monetary, and financial chaos. The SAR  government must be stable and powerful. This is the key issue  and the most important job is to choose the right men and use  them properly.    It has been learned that Beijing has studied and looked at  candidates for the SAR chief, and people outside the CPC  hierarchy have also guessed as to who will be appointed SAR  chief. According to a source, scores of Hong Kong people,  including Leung Chun-ying, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, Peter Woo,  Vincent Lo Hong-sui, and Tsang Yuk-sing are potential candidates  who are under consideration.    The SAR chief is a key position. Apart from "loving the  country and Hong Kong," having a great intellect, and being  eloquent, the ideal SAR chief must seemingly have the following  qualifications.    1. He must be acceptable to the Beijing central government  and familiar with Chinese operations and will not do anything  detrimental to the central government.    2. He must be acceptable to all quarters in Hong Kong and  able to take into account the interests of all quarters.    3. He must be capable of administrating and dealing with and  having various complicated situations well in hand.  <H3>  The SAR Chief Executive Must Handle Affairs in a Decisive  and Effective Way and Take Into Account the Interests of Various  Quarters </H3>   What merits attention is: The statement "the future Hong  Kong government must be stable and powerful" made by Deng  Xiaoping means that, apart from being capable of administration,  the SAR chief must be able to stand the test. Especially when  confronted with a major challenge or turmoil, he is expected to  stand firm, to handle affairs in a decisive manner, and, in  particular, to boldly take "effective measures." In the  meantime, the SAR chief must be able to further promote Hong  Kong's prosperity and development, thus proving "Chinese are  more resourceful than Britons and can exercise better  leadership." He must also discharge his official duties by  impartially refusing to side with vested interests, take into  account the interests of various sectors, listen to the voices  of various sectors in running the government properly, and  adeptly solve problems according to the principle of "one  country, two systems."    Beijing and Hong Kong are seeking such a person. Let us wait  and see who will fill the post of SAR executive chief.    Naturally, apart from a good executive chief, qualified  people in all fields and the continued display of high  efficiency by the 200,000 government workers are also  indispensable to a well-administered Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping  said: "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. It is  essential to have confidence in ourselves." When China takes  over Hong Kong, it will allow Hong Kong people to administer it.  Whether Hong Kong will perform miracles again will become the  criterion for appraising Hong Kong people's wisdom.

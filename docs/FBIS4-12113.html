			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By AL-MUHARRIR correspondent in Amman] </F>   [Text] AL-MUHARRIR has learned from well-informed political  sources in Amman that the Jordanian-Palestinian talks held  between King Husayn and Hakam Bal'awi, special envoy of the  Palestinian president to Amman, have not achieved their  objectives.    The sources said that the Jordanian monarch expressed to the  Palestinian official his deep resentment of the PLO's policy of  ignoring Jordan and excluding it from any coordination although  what is being discussed between the Palestinian and Israeli  sides affects the internal situation in Jordan, in fact -- as  the king said -- it is the crux of the Jordanian internal  situation.    The sources disclosed that Jordan informed Bal'awi of its  resentment over two press statements made by the PLO official  spokesman: The first statement deals with Security Council  Resolution 904 and includes "unjustified indications that would  lead to an unnecessary dispute with Jordan;" and the second  statement openly accuses the Jordanian press of being "a paid  agent."    It is noted that while in Amman Bal'awi refused to make any  statement or grant any interview to a Jordanian newspaper in an  expression of the PLO's resentment of the unofficial Jordanian  media.    AL-MUHARRIR learned that Jordanian officials indirectly  expressed to the Palestinian envoy their dissatisfaction with  the level of the delegation represented by Bal'awi himself.  They told him that he is "from the people of this country,"  indicating the Jordanian diplomatic passport held by Bal'awi.    On the other hand, Bal'awi explained to King Husayn and to  the Jordanian delegation whom he met the conditions surrounding  Resolution 904, noting that the PLO is very much preoccupied and  that most of the time it briefs the Palestinian ambassador in  Tunisia on what takes place on the negotiations front. Bal'awi  also said that the PLO's internal situation has brought the  issue of coordination and dealing between Jordan and the PLO to  the present situation.    Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's dissatisfaction with  Jordan's decision to open a branch of the Bank of Jordan in  Ramallah. He said that Jordan should have waited for the  convening of the Jordanian-Palestinian financial committee to  endorse such a decision. Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's  annoyance at failing to hold the meeting for the foreign  ministers of the cordon states scheduled to take place following  the Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week. Bal'awi  accused Jordan of playing a role in this to exclude the PLO with  the aim of forming a Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese axis. The  Palestinian envoy also discussed the Jordanian measures related  to the movement of Palestinians in the occupied territory via  the King Husayn and Prince Muhammad bridges.    The Jordanian side categorically denied that it worked  toward  the formation of a tripartite axis in order to exclude the PLO  from any coordination, and stressed that what took place in  connection with the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers is a  declared Syrian stand.</p>

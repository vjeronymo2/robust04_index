			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Crunch brings Lymeswold cheese to a sticky end LYMESWOLD, the soft natural cheese once billed as Britain's answer to the likes of Brie and Camembert, has been consigned to the history books 10 years after it was launched to nationwide publicity. Dairy Crest, the commercial arm of the Milk Marketing Board, which developed Lymeswold at a cost of several million pounds, said yesterday that it stopped making the cheese last week. The plant that produced it will close next month with the loss of 38 jobs. Dairy Crest is seeking a buyer for the plant, in Aston, Birmingham, but it intends to retain the Lymeswold brand and the equipment to produce it. The company said it had lost money for several years on the cheese, which had been selling poorly. When Dairy Crest introduced Lymeswold in 1982, it expected the cheese eventually to capture a quarter of the UK market, then worth Pounds 800m a year. At first, consumer enthusiasm for the first new British cheese for 200 years suggested the optimism was justified. The launch received a big boost from Mr Peter Walker, then minister of agriculture, who endorsed the cheese on television. Viewers were also shown Bomba, Mr Walker's Old English sheepdog, tucking into chunks of Lymeswold. However, from then on, troubles set in. Unable to meet initial demand, Dairy Crest released Lymeswold stocks before they were properly matured. Instead of being soft and creamy, much of the early cheese on sale was hard and chalky in the middle. Dairy Crest responded by building the Aston plant and fitting it out with special equipment imported from the Continent that could turn out 4,000 tons of Lymeswold a year - several times the original capacity. Soon after the plant came on stream, though, the Lymeswold market went into inexorable decline and annual production never exceeded 2,000 tons a year. A promotion campaign in France flopped, and after a re-launch of the product failed in February, Dairy Crest decided to cut its losses. The company declined to give recent sales figures, saying its marketing staff 'would not want to confess to the low levels they had reached'. However, according to market research company AGB, barely a third of UK supermarkets stocked Lymeswold last year. Mr Walker believes poor quality control was also to blame. 'Several times, I've bought Lymeswold which should never have been on the supermarket shelf,' he said yesterday. 'In recent times, there have been some rather better German equivalents available.' What Bomba, Mr Walker's sheepdog and Lymeswold's best-remembered fan, would have made of it all will never be known. He died several years ago.</p>

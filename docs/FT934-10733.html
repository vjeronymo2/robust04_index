			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: France plans crackdown on counterfeiting FRANCE'S government yesterday took steps to crack down on the booming trade in counterfeit goods, many of them fakes of French fashion designs or luxury products. It has proposed a new law, virtually assured of parliamentary approval, which would increase sharply the penalties for manufacture, sale or import of counterfeits and give customs and police officers scope to take quicker action. The maximum fine for counterfeiting would be increased from FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,300) to FFr500,000 (Pounds 57,000), with a possible two years in jail. Companies convicted of producing fakes could have their factories closed indefinitely and be fined FFr2.5m. Customs officers and the police would also be given stronger powers to seize suspect goods. According to the French government, counterfeit products account for some 5 per cent of world trade. Turkey, North Africa and, increasingly, Southeast Asia are the main sources, but some originate in other European Community countries, such as Italy. An EC regulation to crack down on the counterfeit trade within the Community has been drafted by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, France's commissioner responsible for customs matters. It is due to come into force early next year The French luxury goods industry claims that 70 per cent of such faked products are based on their designs, for instance: Hermes scarves and Chanel T-shirts. Mr Christian Blanckaert, chairman designate of Comite Colbert, the industry body, told a Paris conference yesterday that counterfeiting was one of the industry's main problems. He also signalled that the French luxury industry was coming out of recession. He estimated that the combined sales of Comite Colbert member companies would total FFr30.5bn (Pounds 3.48bn) this year, against FFr30bn in 1992. The industry has benefited from strong growth in Asia - now accounting for 26 per cent of sales against 18 per cent in 1986 - and the fledgling recovery in the US.</p>

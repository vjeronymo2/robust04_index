			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Inveresk pays off all Pounds 25m of debt INVERESK, the Scottish-based fine paper manufacturer, has paid off all Pounds 25m of its senior and mezzanine debt only 15 months after its management bought it out for Pounds 31m from US paper group Georgia-Pacific. The company is considering a stock exchange flotation but said it would not necessarily happen this year. Although it is now free of debt it is taking on a Pounds 20m revolving credit facility. Inveresk, which makes products for specialised markets such as coated board and artists' watercolour paper at three mills in Scotland and one in Somerset, was the subject of a management buy-out in October 1990 involving funds totalling Pounds 40m. It was arranged by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital and Morgan Grenfell was the lead provider of finance. Mr Stefan Kay, managing director, said Inveresk had repaid the debt from cash flow. It had not needed the Pounds 3.3m of mezzanine finance, he said, and Pounds 22m of senior debt was repaid. Morgan Grenfell is lead merchant bank in the Pounds 20m revolving facility, supported by Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. There is an interest rate of 1 per cent over Libor and includes the option to draw down a further Pounds 5m. Dr Ingram Lenton, Inveresk's chairman, said the facility was 'a prudent measure to allow ourselves a considerable degree of protection against exigencies of current economic conditions'. The company expected medium-term growth principally from increased profit margins and to a lesser extent increased volume. Inveresk expects next month to announce pre-tax profits for 1991 of nearly Pounds 6m. It made Pounds 3.55m on sales of Pounds 48m in the six months to June 1. Inveresk has invested Pounds 6m in upgrading its plants since the buy-out and plans to invest Pounds 7m this year. Mr Kay said that a stock exchange flotation was one options available to the company to provide an exit route for equity shareholders. 'I wouldn't like to put a deadline of this year on it,' he said. 'It depends on the stock exchange climate, the business climate and the political climate.' He was not interested in a trade sale of the company. Inveresk has equity of Pounds 10.25m of which 20 per cent is owned by its management. The remaining 80 per cent is held by Morgan Grenfell, County Natwest, 3i and Prudential Venture Managers.</p>

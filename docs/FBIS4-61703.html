			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 5 May -- RUKH-PRESS reports that the Kherson  regional Rukh and "Ukraine" democratic associations have sent a  statement to Ukraine's president demanding that an end be put to  the political terror the document's authors say is being  perpetrated in the oblast. The statement talks of threats  addressed to Mykola Seredenyk, head of the Borislavskiy rayon  Rukh and editor of the NARODNYY VISNYK BORYSLAVSHCHYNY.  (Incidentally, the investigation into the murder of Ivan  Seredenyk, his brother, which was committed a year ago, has not  yet been completed.)    The statement's authors drew Leonid Kravchuk's attention to  the fact that the terror, which gained momentum during the  election campaign, has not stopped, even though the election  campaign has finished. Svyatoslav Mohylivskyy, a former  candidate for people's deputy, and Hryhoriy Tkachenko, a member  of the regional Rukh leadership, were recently attacked.    The regional Rukh has warned the president, Oleksandr  Melnykov, his representative in the oblast, and Vyacheslav  Chornovil, head of Rukh: "If an end is not put to the political  gangsterism, then we reserve the right to take resolute measures  to defend our members and supporters."</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Danes aim for new referendum in May DENMARK aims to hold a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty next May, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister said yesterday. Mr Ellemann-Jensen warned fellow European Community foreign ministers, however, that the timing depended on the EC reaching agreement on Denmark's demands for 'legally binding' exemptions from Maastricht by the time of the EC summit in December. Danish demands, which include a UK-style opt out on a common European currency and a putative defence force, received a cool reception from EC foreign ministers in Brussels. Several EC members suggested that Denmark's demands amounted to reopening Maastricht and could require an unacceptable reratification of the treaty. Uncertainty about the Danish question - coupled with the UK's decision to delay final ratification until after May - is causing concern over the timing of enlargement negotiations with Finland, Sweden and Austria next year. All 12 member states are required to ratify Maastricht before it can be enforced. Under a compromise agreed at the EC summit in Lisbon in June, enlargement talks are linked to ratification and settlement of the Delors II budget package, including extra funds for poorer EC members. Belgium, which holds the rotating presidency from July 1993, said the UK postponement threatened to upset its two priorities: enlargement and implementation of Maastricht. Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted he did not love the language of the Danish demands - largely dictated to the minority government by opposition parties. But 'this is the only possibility of establishing a situation in which the Maastricht treaty. . . .can come into force'.</p>

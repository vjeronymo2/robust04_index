			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mexican Government Secretary Jorge </F> Carpizo by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the "24 Hours" newscast --  live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zabludovsky: A few  moments ago this program reported that the Spanish justice  minister, Juan Alberto Belloch, suspects that there are ETA  [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] people in Mexico. A deputy of  the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who says he has clues  regarding the presence of ETA members in Mexico, also has this  suspicion. Would you tell us about that?    Carpizo: Of course, several Spanish media have  reported this for several months, and some Mexican media have  echoed the story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country  who come from Spain, who come from that part of the Basque  region, but we do not have any evidence that there are any  guerrillas. If we had proof -- this is being investigated and  we will continue to investigate it -- Mexico would act according  to the law.    Zabludovsky: Thank you very much Dr. Carpizo.    Carpizo: Thank you very much for giving me this  opportunity to be with you again.</p>

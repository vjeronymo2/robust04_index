The slammer is being built inside a prison here and will  consist of 12 cells, each with a minimal floor space of seven  square metres (74 square feet).    Suspects will appear before the International Court on  Crimes  in the Former Yugoslavia, the court's president Antonio Cassese  said.    "The new cells should be handed over to us at the end of  June," Cassese said, adding that a new international penal code  would have to be drawn up to regulate the prison.    Dutch police will be responsible for transferring the  prisoners to and from the jail but, once inside, their security  and that of the court's judges will fall to armed UN guards.    Sentences handed down by the court will be served in the  prisons of UN member states. France and Italy have already  offered to take in some of those convicted. [passage omitted]</p>

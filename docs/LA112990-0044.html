			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROGER BINGHAM PROBES THE SCIENCE OF THE BRAIN ON 'INSIDE INFORMATION'  </P> <P> Jerry Mander once wrote a wonderfully incendiary book titled "Four Arguments  for the Elimination of Television." But even Mander might have second thoughts  after seeing a piece of television like "Inside Information" (tonight at 8 on  Channel 28).  </P> <P> Once again, KCET's Mr. Wizard, Roger Bingham, has made science -- in this case,  the science of the brain -- knowable, tangible, appealing. Perhaps television  can do this better than any other medium: reason enough not to eliminate it.  </P> <P> That's especially the case with this probing, engaging look at how the brain  works. Bingham begins with crude models, like the loom or needlepoint, to  suggest brain function, and then works up to more involved ones -- bird flocks,  beehives -- as the report tracks how neurological research is now suggesting a  brain of great subtlety and sophistication. Throughout "Inside Information,"  the viewer is given a lively visual sense of this intensely complicated story.  </P> <P> Medium becomes message: The act of watching this program and absorbing its  information becomes a replication of the kind of brain process described by  researchers such as Caltech's Carver Mead. If you're stumped by sections like  the one explaining the latest research into "parallel computation" (in which  individual brain sections work separately and together as a network), then  that's just an example of how the brain isn't a perfect machine. It's a  survival mechanism borne out of evolution.  </P> <P> It is also offering us, as UC San Diego's V.S. Ramachandran puts it, "a  convenient fiction, a tentative reality" -- a conclusion arrived at by both  advanced science and post-modern art. This is worth thinking about, while  wondering if biologist Richard Dawkins' obvious love for a post-human  cybernetic "civilization" isn't pushing things too far. TV can provide brain  food.

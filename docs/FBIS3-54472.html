			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz] </F>   [Text] It is clear from the outward manifestations that the  supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization's heresy in his  special way of answering the report from the Majles Inquiry and  Investigation Group was a beginning for greater heresy! Why was  the answer from the Voice and Vision organization heresy? There  are two main reasons: 1) The repeated interruption of national  radio network programming to answer the Majles; 2) Clear insults  and accusations against the Majles deputies and the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, and consequently the Majles, as the  nation's most important body.    Of course, the precedent for this was the insult against Mr.  Yahyavi, deputy from Tehran. Mr. Yahyavi spent 10 years of his  life in the black pits of the Iraqi Ba'thist regime, and the  people of Tehran appreciated him greatly. However, the  supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization dealt with him  in this way, and used the tools of the Voice and Vision  organization as a personal tool.    The preliminary step for all votes taken in the Majles is  the  expression of views by supporters and opponents, and the Voice  and Vision organization does not have the right to broadcast a  statement supporting one against the other. The things the Voice  and Vision organization did during the vote of confidence for  the government were done in the interest of one government  minister, and after a long time it broadcast an answer.    But what is the greater heresy?    In its last answer to the Majles public relations office the  Voice and Vision organization laid the groundwork for these  instances: 1) Preventing the direct broadcast of Majles  proceedings; 2) Preventing the publication of pre-agenda  speeches, research and investigation reports and anything that  has to do with Majles supervisory responsibilities.    In his answer, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization mentioned Article 69 of the  Constitution[.sup]1[/], and he emphasized the broadcast of  Majles proceedings. "If the Constitution had intended the  broadcast of proceedings and sessions, it would not have used  the term `report,' and instead of that, for example, it would  have been written that `proceedings should be broadcast by radio  without alteration for public information.'"    Now there is the supposition that the broadcast of a  "report"  on Majles proceedings by a radio announcer during the "direct  broadcast" of Majles proceedings could prepare the way for not  broadcasting the proceedings directly. Are such masterpieces  really the work of one person, or is something afoot to bring  despotism back by putting pressure on the Majles and limiting  its legal prerogatives?    Of course, one person or even a movement are too small to  destroy the fruits of 15 years of freedom for the aware nation  of Iran. All the nation's forces are under the supervision of  the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the way to  dictatorship and despotism is closed. The firm principles of the  Constitution bespeak this important truth. However, with regard  to the latest answer from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization, one must note the following points:    A. In this answer the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization sees himself as being much larger than his true  size. Playing the role of the Guardian Council, he has set out  to interpret Article 69 of the Constitution, he does not  consider the full publication of Majles proceedings to include  the pre-agenda speeches and other things, and he wants to stop  the direct broadcast of the proceedings.    In his answer to the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and  Vision organization also plays the role of the judiciary,  saying: "The Voice and Vision organization is legally required  to stop the broadcast of accusations and incorrect statements by  the Inquiry and Investigation Commission during the direct  broadcast by the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic."    Then he adds, "since the research and investigation report  was broadcast directly on the radio, the possibility for us to  monitor it, obey the law and do our job was taken away from us."    That is, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization  must determine where there is a problem in the research and  investigation report and prevent its broadcast!    In his prior answer, he also interfered in the work of the  Majles. He asked the Inquiry and Investigation Group to dismiss  some of its members. He implied that those who oppose him would  be accused of being members of minigroups and being opposed to  the Imam!    B. Instead of apologizing to the Majles, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group and the deputies, against whom he made heavy  accusations, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization  continued with his illegal and religiously unlawful activities  by trying to make justifications and interpretations.    It would be better if he would explain which of the above  authorities prevented the radio broadcast of the answers from  the Voice and Vision organization in order to make these kinds  of obstinate activities clear to everyone. It must be noted that  Iran's Islamic government rests firmly on the basis of the  vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the firm principles  of the Constitution. The vice-regent has the last word in all  affairs. No person or organization can interfere in the work of  the government organizations and create confusion.    C. In the Constitution the Majles has such a high position  that anyone who has a complaint about the work of the Majles,  the executive power or the judiciary can submit his complaint in  writing to the Majles and the Majles is required to investigate  these complaints and to announce the result.    Therefore,the Voice and Vision organization does not have  the  responsibility to investigate the oppression of individuals and  it cannot act in accordance with a measure enacted by the  Supervisory Council of the Voice and Vision organization, which  has been eliminated in the revised version of the Constitution.  Footnote    [.sup]1.[/] Article 61 of the Constitution: "Majles  proceedings must be public and a complete report of them must be  published via official radio and newspapers for public  information..."</p>

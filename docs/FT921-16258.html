			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Italian inflation misses target ITALY ended 1991 with an annualised inflation rate of 6.4 per cent, against original government projections of 6.2 per cent, according to figures published yesterday by the national statistics institute, Istat. This was nearly double the European Community average and compares with the 1990 rate of 6.1 per cent. However, the monthly increase in December of 0.3 per cent was the lowest for the whole year. The government hopes to bring the level below 5 per cent for the current year. Last year the biggest increases were in housing, leisure and food items. Housing recorded the steepest rise, of 7.3 per cent; the smallest increases were in energy prices (5 per cent) and transport and communications (5.6 per cent). Energy prices reflected cheaper heating oil, while foodstuffs increases were in part accounted for by higher cigarette prices.</p>

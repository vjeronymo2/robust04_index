			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / PIA may register individuals The Personal Investment Authority said yesterday that it would consider whether a system of registering individuals as well as the firms they work for would be practical. The move by the new watchdog seems to be an attempt to pre-empt a likely recommendation from the Commons Treasury committee, which is examining financial regulation. Individual registration would enable the authority to discipline specific sales agents as well as their companies. While the statement may reassure the committee - which holds its second session with Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, and Ms Colette Bowe, its chief executive, next week - it is likely to cause dismay in the industry. There will be concern over the possible costs of individually registering all the direct sales forces of life companies. More immediately, some of the PIA's 6,000 potential members, who have not yet decided to join, will be worried that the new regulator's goalposts may be moving when there are already uncertainties about how it will approach its task. The regulators which the authority is due to succeed in July differ in registration practice. Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers, does register individual members but Lautro, for the life insurance industry, does not. Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro's chief executive who will be in charge of the PIA's relations with its members, this week said Lautro had found it better not to undermine companies' responsibility for their employees.</p>

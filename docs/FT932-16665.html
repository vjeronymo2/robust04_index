			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Ministers to discuss EC free trade pact EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers are today expected to agree to widen negotiations with Russia on setting up an EC-Russian free trade zone during the coming decade. The principle of a free trade accord with Russia has been agreed by EC ambassadors, but there is still some argument over conditions, and about the financial and technical assistance needed to make a free trade zone possible. Some member states, particularly the UK, want a stronger human rights clause in the agreement. On the main free trade issue, it is still not clear whether the 'evolutionary clause' sought by the Commission will be replaced by an agreement to open up EC markets only after Russia reaches a certain level of reform and development. 'An evolutionary clause should be just that - filling it up until you've got a free trade zone - not deciding (on free trade) later,' argues one ambassador from the liberal EC camp. Equally, the 'safeguard clause' against any surges of competitive Russian goods may be strengthened, and made conditional on Russia joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Commission had drafted a generous clause, to be invoked only 'in the event of a serious injury, or threat of a serious injury, to domestic (EC) producers of like or direct competitive products.' The free trade zone is now likely to be on offer only to Russia, rather than all former Soviet republics.</p>

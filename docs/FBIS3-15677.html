			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A military and technical concept for developing  weapons and military equipment until the year 2000, as well as a  state armaments program, have been discussed at a meeting of the  Defense Ministry Collegium. Participants in the meeting stated  that the second stage in scaling down and restructuring the  Belarusian Army was completed in 1992 to 1993, which brought the  size of the Belarusian Armed Forces down to nearly the levels  specified by international agreements. Again noted were  difficulties with recruiting enough troops, caused by the  specific demographic situation in Belarus, the Chernobyl  aftermath, and the anti-Army campaign launched by some media.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Management: Hard news behind the headlines - ITN has revolutionised its staffing policies without industrial action In just seven years the resonant tones of Big Ben that start News at Ten have tolled for half the jobs at ITN, the independent television network's flagship news organisation. Behind the headlines there has been a quiet and sometimes painful revolution in the way that its news gatherers work. The role of Mike Morris, its departing director of personnel and industrial relations, has been central to the achievement of often radical changes without industrial action. When he took over the job in October 1987, ITN had 1,200 specialist staff, many earning City dealing room salaries. While the pressures of change were building up, ITN was protected by statute from competition and seemed to enjoy a secure position within the ITV network. Now, as Morris starts a new career as director of personnel at the Royal Opera, he leaves a network broadcasting more - but not necessarily better - news coverage from fewer than 600 staff with a broad range of skills. Demarcation lines are fading as journalists learn technical skills and technicians learn journalism. Neutral job titles such as 'news assistants' and 'journo-techs' have been introduced to promote multi-skilling, and the numbers and influence of technicians and engineers have dwindled. Traditional pay bargaining has barely survived  - last month a number of staff agreed to a pay cut in a ground-breaking deal which saved further redundancies. The company's pay and staff-cutting polices have reduced ITN's annual pay bill from Pounds 42m in 1991 to Pounds 26m today. 'That doesn't happen by accident. The potential for getting it wrong in a highly unionised atmosphere with a perishable product is pretty high,' says Morris. Achieving the transformation without the confrontation that accompanied innovation in the newspaper industry relied on a combination of shrewd management, good fortune, technological change and new labour laws. Morris looked first at new ways of making programmes in the US and East Asia before confronting technicians with multi-skilling, a term then unknown in the industry. The trade unions called it 'cross-jobbing'. 'It was not on the agenda as far as they were concerned,' says Morris. Today, technological innovations, such as lighter, automated cameras mean that the normal crew can be just two - one with editorial background and one with technical. Journalists know how to operate cameras and technicians learn editing and writing skills. Management plans in 1988 to change terms and conditions coincided with a TV-am dispute when technicians walked out on a one-day strike and were never allowed back. It was a sobering lesson for the unions at ITN. National agreements had already been abandoned by the ITV network. 'We started with a blank sheet of paper and tried by careful preparation to draw the trade unions into a dialogue with us. By the end of the negotiations they felt as much owners of the plan as we were,' said Morris. The 'total pay plan' negotiated that year abolished overtime, perks and old working practices and introduced annualised hours into employment contracts. Negotiators had no scope to buy off the old terms, but they did have the advantage of dealing with people who could not get the same terms and conditions anywhere else. Until his appointment, Morris says, ITN management had believed programmes could not be broadcast without union co-operation. There was also concern that a confrontation could escalate across the network. During the negotiations ITN made no secret of contingency plans to maintain the service in the event of a strike, which it also made clear would lead to a TV-am-style lockout. The proposals were only narrowly sold to the three main unions. 'What they were voting for was a reduction in terms and conditions. There was no disguising this. They recognised we were very determined,' said Morris. The total pay plan has not gone completely smoothly. The problem of staff finishing their work allocations well before the year end has sometimes needed imaginative reward ideas. The impetus of change was maintained by the Broadcasting Act of 1990 which introduced greater competition to the industry. Under a new form of ownership, ITN changed from a cost centre to a profit centre exposed to the threat of competition. As the pressure on costs continued, an across the board pay freeze was imposed in 1991. This year there has been scope for some discretionary pay rises. While overheads have been pared to the bone, the business is beginning to grow, with additional services such as provision of news coverage for Channel 4's Big Breakfast and the negotiation of a contract with NBC Superchannel.</p>

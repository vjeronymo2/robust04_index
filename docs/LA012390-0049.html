			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LESABRE'S SUCCESS PROVED POINT FOR GM: QUALITY SELLS  </P> <P> This may be the most improbable place in America for the domestic auto industry  to make a stand against the Japanese.  </P> <P> After all, Flint -- the aging birthplace of General Motors -- is a town that  has come to symbolize everything that went wrong with the U.S. auto industry in  the 1980s.  </P> <P> Devastated by plant closings and layoffs that cut GM's Flint payroll nearly in  half during the decade, the city is now most famous as the setting for "Roger  and Me," a savagely funny new movie about filmmaker Michael Moore's attempts to  take GM Chairman Roger B. Smith on a tour of the desolate landscape left behind  by GM's virtual collapse here.  </P> <P> Yet amid Flint's industrial rubble, one GM factory has been transformed into a  showcase of American quality, building cars that are nearly as trouble-free as  the best from Japan.  </P> <P> For here at its "Buick City" assembly plant, GM produces the Buick LeSabre,  which received the highest quality ranking of any American car in 1989 from J.  D. Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills research firm that is considered the  last word on automotive quality in Japan and the United States.  </P> <P> In fact, after years of languishing near the bottom in the annual rankings, the  1989 LeSabre turned in the highest quality score ever posted by a domestic car  under J. D. Power's rating system.  </P> <P> Remarkably, the LeSabre also came in with higher quality scores than almost  every Japanese car on the market and was rated the second-most trouble-free car  sold in the United States, trailing only the Nissan Maxima.  </P> <P> The LeSabre's success in the J. D. Power ratings -- usually dominated by the  Japanese -- has acted as something of a tonic for Detroit's auto makers.  </P> <P> After a decade in which the Big Three were never able to become fully  competitive with the Japanese, the LeSabre has provided a glimmer of hope that  Japan's quality advantage can finally be erased in the 1990s.  </P> <P> "This is a great American success story," Buick General Manager Edward Mertz  said. "It tells the world that the American worker can do the job on a  world-class level."  </P> <P> And, for GM in particular -- now amid its worst sales slump since the early  1980s -- the LeSabre's surprising success comes at just the right time, when  the organization is so badly in need of a win.  </P> <P> "I really get encouraged when I look at the LeSabre," said J. T. Battenberg,  vice president and group executive of GM's Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac  Group. "Our dealers tell me that as the recognition grows that we are building  cars of comparable quality to the Japanese -- that sells."  </P> <P> Indeed, the LeSabre has proven once and for all to GM executives that if they  build quality cars, people will respond; the LeSabre took off like a rocket on  the sales charts after last June's release of the Power survey.  </P> <P> In July, LeSabre sales rose more than 91% compared to those of the July, 1988;  in August, nearly 99%.  </P> <P> The public perception of quality made the LeSabre the hottest domestic car on  the market.  </P> <P> "The dealers told us that people started coming in with newspaper clippings  about the quality ranking and would say, 'I want one of these cars,' without  even knowing what a LeSabre was," said George Gurnsey, Buick's product  satisfaction manager.  </P> <P> For managers at the plant here, the LeSabre's success has been all the more  rewarding because they remember too well just how bad the quality was when  LeSabre production began at the renovated Buick City complex in September,  1985.  </P> <P> Buick City, conceived as a model plant where GM would introduce the latest in  robotics and innovative manufacturing processes, along with a fresh approach to  labor policies, instead quickly became one of GM's biggest headaches.  </P> <P> Today, even top GM executives admit that the quality of the early LeSabres from  Buick City was terrible.  </P> <P> Quality suffered, they acknowledge, because the company tried to introduce too  many new elements into the production system all at once.  </P> <P> Not only did the LeSabre have a new design, but the Buick City plant itself was  essentially new as well. GM had gutted a 75-year-old Buick plant and stuffed it  with the most advanced robotics available.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the plant's workers were unaccustomed to each other, having been  brought in from different plants in the Flint area. And, as production began in  the fall of 1985, even the management in Flint was being restructured as part  of GM's corporate-wide reorganization.  </P> <P> "An upheaval that massive is more than anyone needs," Buick City plant manager  Nelson Gonzalez said with a sigh.  </P> <P> The result was chaos on the line at Buick City, and some of the worst quality  anywhere inside GM.  </P> <P> "We were unhappy with the start-up and the quality of the plant, no question  about it," recalled Battenberg, who from 1986 to 1988 was in charge of GM's  Flint Automotive Group, which runs Buick City.  </P> <P> Stories abound of how Buick City's robots went haywire, militant workers  silently stared down managers, absenteeism went sky high and the assembly line  was repeatedly shut down because of parts shortages -- even as trucks carrying  auto parts backed up outside the plant.  </P> <P> By the time Battenberg took over in Flint in 1986 after spending six years in  Europe with GM, Buick City seemed destined to go down as yet another failure in  GM's decade-long campaign to catch up with the Japanese.  </P> <P> When he arrived, Battenberg was horrified to find out just how messed up Buick  City really was. "I had just been trying to sell cars against the Europeans, so  I knew how important quality was," he recalled.  </P> <P> Quickly, Battenberg tried to pour a cold dose of reality on Buick City.  </P> <P> Robots that weren't working were pulled out, and the level of automation in the  plant was drastically reduced.  </P> <P> Outside suppliers were ordered onto the shop floor at Buick City until problems  with the machinery they had sold to GM were corrected. Materials that were  defective were returned to their suppliers, and Buick City imposed a new rule  that it would not perform repairs on materials coming from outside.  </P> <P> Soon, GM engineers came in from around the corporation to simplify both the  LeSabre's design and the layout of the plant to make it easier for workers on  the assembly line to consistently build quality cars.  </P> <P> "That plant had been over-engineered," Battenberg said. "There were too many  robots and too much automation. There were just too many variables in a  brand-new plant, so we tried to minimize the variables by taking out  automation."  </P> <P> Management also proved willing to scale back on some of its overly ambitious  attempts to copy Japanese labor policies. An early, unsuccessful attempt to  introduce the Japanese practice of andon -- allowing workers to pull a cord at  their workstation to shut down the line when things went wrong -- was modified.  At first, workers unaccustomed to such power had pulled the cord constantly,  leading to repeated stops and starts; later, a yellow warning cord was added,  so that workers could call for help without shutting down the line because of  minor glitches.  </P> <P> But the turnaround at Buick City did not really begin until management and  labor started to share a new sense of urgency about their plight.  </P> <P> To foster that sense of urgency and to make it clear to the work force that GM  was serious about quality, Battenberg started shutting down the plant -- and  sending its workers home -- whenever quality sagged. In addition, all outside  visitors were barred from the plant for a year to "refocus people on quality,"  Battenberg said.  </P> <P> "We had to stress to the organization that their future depended on selling  world-class quality," he added. "So we set some demanding standards for  quality."  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers and local community leaders were brought in to try to  boost the spirit of teamwork and to deal with absenteeism, and drug and alcohol  abuse at the plant; absenteeism dropped by 40%. A new problem-solving method  helped speed the process of turning management and labor into more of a team.  </P> <P> The full-court press at Buick City quickly started to show results. Quality  turned around, and by late 1988 GM's own internal quality surveys showed the  plant was one of its best. Now, GM says its warranty costs on the LeSabre have  dropped 59% since 1986, while the number of defects per car has fallen 77%.  </P> <P> By the time the J. D. Power survey was released, quality levels at Buick City  had surpassed those of GM's joint venture with Toyota in Fremont, Calif., which  had previously produced the highest-quality cars inside GM.  </P> <P> "The (Buick City) plant was really running rough in 1986, but now it is one of  the smoothest-running plants in the industry," Battenberg said proudly.  </P> <P> GM hopes to transfer what it has learned at Buick City to its other assembly  plants, but some outside analysts are still not convinced that GM has made the  fundamental changes in its system needed to maintain high levels of quality.  </P> <P> Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst at J. D. Power, says he won't be sure  that the Buick LeSabre has really changed until he sees where the LeSabre ranks  in Power's 1990 quality survey.  </P> <P> He remains cautious because the other two GM cars that share the LeSabre's  basic design -- the Pontiac Bonneville and the Oldsmobile Delta 88 -- have not  fared as well as the LeSabre in independent quality surveys. If basic changes  in the car's design were made to improve the LeSabre's quality, Cedergren  argues, such alterations should also have benefited the Bonneville and Delta  88, which were being built at plants in Willow Run, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo.  </P> <P> But the Delta 88 came in 58th and the Bonneville 82nd in the same survey of 154  models that ranked the LeSabre second.  </P> <P> Thus, it seems that the improved quality of the LeSabre came instead from a  gritty determination on the assembly line -- which is more difficult to sustain  than a good design, Cedergren observed.  </P> <P> Japanese theories about quality would tend to support Cedergren's concerns;  engineers in Japan constantly talk of "building in" quality early in the design  process to minimize the chances that problems will crop up later on the  assembly line.  </P> <P> The LeSabre's high ranking "could be just a fluke," Cedergren warned. "If these  products all had a high level of quality engineered into their 'basic design'  platform, then they should all have been relatively close in the rankings.  Instead, these quality levels are based just on the assembly plant, which is  hard to maintain if quality isn't built in."  </P> <P> In fact, the improved labor climate on the assembly line, which played such a  big role in helping Buick City to better its quality, may suffer a setback this  year. Dave Yettaw, president of UAW Local 599, which represents Buick City  workers, says he will campaign for reelection this spring on a platform calling  for the local to disengage from the plant's joint union-management programs.  </P> <P> He charges that management is using the team concept approach to run roughshod  over the union. "The teamwork concept is becoming quite shaky at Buick City,"  Yettaw complained.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the LeSabre's high ranking came at a time when it was the only car  that Buick City was producing. But since then, Delta 88 production has been  shifted to Buick City, further complicating the plant's production process.  </P> <P> "I want to see how the LeSabre comes out this year," a skeptical Cedergren  added. "Then I will be more confident."  </P></p>

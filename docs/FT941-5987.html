			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Ontario Hydro prices CDollars 1bn global floating-rate note issue The volatile conditions in many government bond markets yesterday kept borrowers away from the international bond market, with only a handful of new issues launched amid the general turmoil. Ontario Hydro, the largest electricity utility in Canada, went ahead with the pricing of its already-publicised issue - a CDollars 1bn global floating-rate note with a five-year maturity. The coupon will be set at the same rate as that available on three-month Canadian dollar bankers acceptances (which are currently trading at around 4.15 per cent). The notes were priced at 99.64 to give a yield of 8 basis points above the rate on bankers acceptances. The joint book runners have heralded the deal as the first substantial FRN offering in Canadian dollars. They said the pricing was based on 'general market perceptions,' as well as by looking at the recent US dollar FRN issue which was launched by the Province of Ontario at the end of January. That deal, which had a 5 1/2 -year maturity, was launched with a yield of three-month Libor plus 8 basis points and tightened to a yield of Libor plus 7 basis points. Ontario Hydro has an Aa2/AA - credit rating and has an expected borrowing requirement of between CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3.8bn per annum over the next three years. Syndicate officials said that demand came mainly from North America, continental Europe, and to a lesser extent from the Middle East. They said that investors in the issue were looking for exposure to the Canadian dollar and were expecting to see Canadian interest rates to move in tandem with those in the US. Burns Philp, the Australian food group, yesterday tapped the equity-linked sector with the launch of a Dollars 125m convertible bond issue. The deal has a 10-year maturity with an indicated coupon of between 5 and 5.5 per cent. The bond proceeds will be used to help finance the recent DM182m acquisition by the company of Karl Ostmann, the German herbs and spices producer, and for general corporate purposes. Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered the senior debt rating of Lasmo to triple-B from A - , and Enterprise Oil to A - from A, writes Tracy Corrigan. Both companies were placed on CreditWatch with negative implications in January. The moves reflect the companies' exposure to weakening oil prices, the rating agency said, as their cashflows are very sensitive to crude oil prices.</p>

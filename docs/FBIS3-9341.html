In view of the defective Gabcikovo sluice chambers, the  Hungarian Government has called on countries which insist on the  principle of free navigation on the Danube, which conduct  shipping traffic on the river, and which signed the 1948  Belgrade Convention on the Order of Navigation, to warn the  Slovak Government to immediately stop the law-breaking action  and ensure free passage, Herman said. He drew attention to the  Slovak Government's responsibility for the cessation of shipping  on the Danube due to a technical and professional error.    After the first sluice chamber accident, the Hungarian  Government warned the Slovak Government of the possibility of  the second chamber going wrong, and asked it to do its best to  make the given river section navigable. There was no Slovak  response to this request, Herman said.    Answering a question, the spokesman said that the building  of  version "C," and thus the recent accident, was to be blamed on  former Slovak Governments, while Hungary would welcome possible  negotiations with the new Slovak cabinet on boosting bilateral  links.    Herman reported fair progress in preparations for a  "supervisory" conference of the 1992 Helsinki Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Budapest's  Convention Center from October 10 to December 2, and subsequent  summit meetings from December 5-6.    He finally announced the March 24 visit to Hungary of Peter  Tarnoff, deputy undersecretary of state in charge of East  European affairs at the U.S. State Department, who will study  the region's situation and discuss NATO's Partnership for Peace.</p>

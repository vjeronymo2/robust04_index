The proposed rule contained provisions that would establish a new flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR, for areas designated as flood control restoration zones on National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps. It would also establish minimum floodplain management requirements and would provide regulatory guidance for implementing statutory requirements of &sect;928 of Public Law 102&hyph;550, 42 USC 4014(f), including procedures to identify and map areas as flood control restoration zones. Public Law 102&hyph;550 also requires FEMA to promulgate regulations no later than October 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following publication of the proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , copies were mailed to approximately 60 individuals and organizations that had previously expressed an interest in the issues that the rule addresses. In addition, copies of the proposed rule were sent to communities in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas of California that had applied for designation as having flood control restoration zones and were sent to the Congressional delegations representing those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 45-day public comment period provided for the proposed rule, FEMA received a total of twelve letters. All but one of the letters contained multiple comments about different issues addressed in the proposed rule. Two letters were submitted by members of the U. S. House of Representatives who represent areas of Sacramento and Los Angeles, California. One of the letters, submitted by three sponsors of the legislation, was received after the close of the formal comment period, but the issues raised are addressed in the supplementary language to these final regulations. Other letters were submitted by representatives of seven local government agencies, legal representatives of two local property owners associations, and one private citizen. In addition, comments received from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers immediately after the close of the formal comment period have been considered as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With one exception, the letters received were from those who support the concept of the flood control restoration zone. One letter urged FEMA to include a requirement in the regulations that prohibits the restoration from causing an increase in flood hazards elsewhere. All letters were submitted from the Los Angeles and Sacramento, California areas, including three Congressional representatives of those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

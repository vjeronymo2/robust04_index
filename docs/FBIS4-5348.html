			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Information No. 648 issued by the Secretariat of the </F> Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland on 11  April in Pyongyang]    [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland [CPRF] Secretariat issued the following information  exposing and denouncing the South Korean puppet authorities'  maneuvers for nuclear weapons development.  <H5>  CPRF Secretariat Information No. 648 </H5>   Data concerning the South Korean puppets' maneuvers for  nuclear weapons development are exposed one after another these  days, arousing deep concern and indignation at home and abroad.    The South Korean National Democratic Front Central Committee  in a white paper dated 30 March disclosed that the South Korean  heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and its multipurpose research  reactor in the Taedok complex were intended to develop nuclear  weapons. South Korean publications and foreign media also  continue to report scientific analytical data and testimony from  relevant people that confirm this.    The South Korean puppets' maneuvers for nuclear weapons  development are an outright betrayal to the joint declaration on  denuclearization on which the North and the South have agreed,  and a vicious challenge to the aspiration of all the fellow  countrymen who yearn for peace and peaceful reunification of the  country.    The South Korean puppets had already established a policy of  developing nuclear weapons by the early 1970's, and brought a  Candu-type [Canadian Deuterium-Uranium] heavy-water reactor from  Canada and installed it in Wolsong in order to secure  fissionable material. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is a  nuclear reactor for the development of nuclear weapons disguised  for commercial use. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON  exposed, through the testimony of the specialists who were  directly involved in the nuclear weapons development, that the  heavy-water reactor in Wolsong brought from Canada was aimed at  producing nuclear weapons.    The heavy-water reactor--the main purpose of which is to  produce plutonium, different from the light-water reactor for  commercial use which is supposed to replace fuel all at the same  time, suspending operations after filling it with nuclear fuel  every year or year and a half--is designed so that part of the  fuel is replaced every day. Therefore, it is easy to secretly  hoard the plutonium. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON  No. 4, 1992 issue referred to the remark of a researcher from  the South Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute who said that  hoarding can be done by making a double ledger and recording in  it that 10 kg of nuclear fuel is processed even if 1,000 kg of  nuclear fuel is actually processed. This means that the puppets  are hoarding plutonium even under surveillance by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is extracting an enormous  quantity of used nuclear fuel containing highly pure plutonium  from natural uranium. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong, which  began operation in April 1983, has produced an enormous quantity  of plutonium, from which some 370 nuclear bombs can be made.    Newspapers of many countries, including the United States  and  Britain, have reported data exposing the status of nuclear  weapons development in South Korea and that South Korea has  already stockpiled 10 tons of plutonium, which will increase to  24 tons by the year 2000.    The multipurpose research reactor in the Taedok complex is  also intended solely for the development of nuclear weapons.  The South Korean puppets, carrying on a joint design project  with Canada for the multipurpose research reactor beginning in  1985, obtained not only the technology necessary for designing  and manufacturing a nuclear bomb but the computer software  [chonsan koud], the key element thereof, as well.    The Japanese magazine SEKAI No. 12, 1992 issue reported that  the multipurpose research reactor can produce a nuclear bomb if  South Korea purchases enriched uranium from another country  quite legally and highly enrich it by using the 20 percent  enriched uranium, which is the highest limit of the lowly  enriched [chonongchuk] uranium and the lowest limit of the  highly enriched uranium. The SEKAI magazine also noted that the  reactor can be remade quickly into a reactor to produce  plutonium and that it is a reactor for military use, which can  produce highly pure plutonium as well.    The South Korean puppets have accelerated the development  of nuclear weapons in an integrated plutonium generating and  extracting system by adding a research retest facility--a  semi-reprocessing facility--when they built the multipurpose  research reactor so that the used nuclear fuel from the  multipurpose reactor can be directly reprocessed in the research  retest facility.    On 29 March, Japanese NHK exposed that the South Korean  puppets have activated its own nuclear weapons development by a  group of specialists in the nuclear research facility in Taedok  since 1991, a year before the multipurpose research reactor was  completed.    The Kim Yong-sam group is today further accelerating its  nuclear weapons development on a full scale by openly denying  the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and going in the direction of invalidating it.    On 1 April 1993, the former South Korean minister of the  National Unification Board said that the joint declaration on  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was originally  invalidated, that it was time for them to possess nuclear  capacity, and that the National Assembly should raise its voice  for possessing nuclear weapons.    On 9 October, Kim Yong-sam the traitor presided over a  so-called security-related ministers' meeting with the presence  of the minister of Science and Technology to conspire on the  issues of securing a nuclear fuel reprocessing reactor and  reviewing the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula. Regarding these South Korean puppet's  suspicious moves, NEW KOREA TIMES, an overseas Koreans'  newspaper, exposed in its 23 October 1993 issue that the  independent right for nuclear development had become a frequent  subject at the National Assembly.    Facts clearly prove that the Wolsong heavy-water reactor and  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok complex were built for  nuclear weapons development and that the puppets have been  secretly prompting the development of nuclear weapons.    The Kim Yong-sam group is groundlessly taking issue over our  nuclear issue talking about the urgency of the resolution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is intended to draw  domestic and international attention to the North, while  accelerating its own nuclear weapons development behind the  scenes and justifying it.    Our so-called nuclear issue is a product of the  antisocialist  and anti-Republic plot of the United States and its followers.  Under the special circumstances of unilaterally withholding the  effect of the announcement of withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily in concurrence with the  announcement of the DPRK- U.S. joint statement, we suspended all  transportation of nuclear materials within the Republic to prove  the transparency of nuclear activities, and allowed inspections  to assure the continuity of safeguards.    In particular, to root out the so-called suspicion, we even  made a bold decision to transform the existing graphite  moderated reactor system to a light-water reactor system knowing  that this would sacrifice the independence of the nuclear energy  industry, thus displaying the innocence of our nuclear policy at  home and abroad. The South Korean top leader also confessed in a  recent news conference that we do not have nuclear weapons and  admitted that the nuclear development commotion was to frame  fellow countrymen and was a deliberate scheme to conceal the  truth of their nuclear weapons development.    Even while developing nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam  ring is irrationally kicking up reckless confrontational  commotions against the North. Instead, it must eliminate  [pyegi] its heavy-water reactor and multipurpose research  reactor, which is clearly for developing nuclear weapons and  immediately stop maneuvering to develop nuclear weapons.    It is the United States that blocks resolution of the  nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula. Instead of fulfilling its  obligation under the DPRK-U.S. agreement, the United States  deliberately avoids fulfilling it and uses the so-called nuclear  issue of the North as a means to fulfill its insidious  [pulsunhan] purpose of crushing [apsal] our republic.    The United States must stop kicking up unjust commotions to  pressure us and deploying Patriot missiles and other equipment  for a nuclear war and must not resume the provocative Team  Spirit nuclear war exercise.    The IAEA Secretariat is also responsible for the fact that  the issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula has not been  resolved. The IAEA Secretariat pointlessly [kongyonhui] found  fault with our experimental reactor for generating electricity,  whose irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] has already been proven  and which has no problem at all, and takes issue with the  reactor under unjustifiable pretexts. Rather, it turns a blind  eye to [mugin] the military-purpose heavy-water reactor and  multipurpose research reactor in South Korea, which have grave  problems [omjunghan munje] and turned a blind eye to  [kkaraborida] even those reactors which came into question  [munjesidoeotton] during inspections.    The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for widening the scope  of  its partiality [pulgongjongsongui pomwi hwaktae] by following  the United States in its antirepublic maneuvers and must  strictly keep to the principle of impartiality in nuclear  inspections.    We take this opportunity to express our belief that  governments, political parties, public organizations, individual  personages, and progressive people of various countries of the  world that love justice and peace will further raise their  voices of solidarity with the Korean people's just struggle to  check and frustrate [choji patan] the Kim Yong-sam ring's  nuclear weapons development maneuvers and denuclearize the  Korean peninsula.

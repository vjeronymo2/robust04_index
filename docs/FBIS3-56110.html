State Duma Ruled by Elders"]    [Text] Yesterday's Federation Council sitting can rightly  be called a deciding one. The deputies were electing the  chairman of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly.    When discussion of the candidacies started it showed the  deputies in the upper chamber so far unable to express their  sympathy in favor of one particular contender in a clear-cut  way. Their main task, however, was to elect a "silent speaker,"  that is, one who could take the interests of all the  representatives of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly  into consideration to the utmost degree and would be able to  lead it skillfully along the path of unity and constructive  work. As Boris Nemtsov, head of the Nizhnyy Novgorod  administration, emphasized in an exclusive interview with a  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, it is not mandatory to elect a  representative of the regions; the main task is to get work  under way with maximum efficiency. Ramazan Abdulatipov also  adheres to this opinion. He notably considers it most important  to establish a link between the upper chamber of the parliament  and the president. In his opinion, Vladimir Shumeyko possesses  all the necessary qualities, and, most importantly, experience.    By 1400 the results of the secret ballot became known (it  was  conducted in booths). None of the contenders had gained the  necessary number of votes. Vladimir Shumeyko with 85 votes and  Petr Romanov with 56 went through to a second round. Shumeyko  was left one vote short of victory.    The first day of the State Duma sitting was marked by two  noteworthy episodes, which could be called a test of strength.    As evening was approaching Georgiy Lukava, who was chairing  the sitting and who anyway has no experience as a speaker,  clearly started to descend into improvisation and reacted to  virtually every exclamation from the hall. The simplest  questions took 20-30 minutes to discuss. Suffice it to say  that, one hour after the beginning of the afternoon sitting, the  registration had not yet been done. That is, it had not been  established whether there was a quorum in the hall and whether  the Duma had the power to adopt any decisions or not.    Then Vladimir Zhirinovskiy came to the microphone, and, in  the "Sturm und Drang" style, instructed his party comrade to  switch off the microphones, not allow anyone to speak, and  remove anyone who disobeyed with the help of the militia. Then  the first episode, which could be called a test of strength,  occurred: Twice Georgiy Lukava announced the registration, and  twice the board lit up the words: "No quorum." Later, Mikhail  Poltoranin commented on this episode as follows: "We landed one  on Zhirinovskiy." And Zhirinovskiy backed off. Lukava was  replaced by his colleague from the Council of Elders. The work  of the session continued.    But the second episode -- the vote on the question of the  size of deputies' groups -- showed around 200 deputies  gravitating toward the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  stance, while somewhere between 140 and 180 votes supported the  Russia's Choice proposals. In the end, the figure named by  Gennadiy Zyuganov -- 35 -- went through. That is how many  deputies must be registered in a deputies' group for it to  obtain the same rights as a faction. The votes came out 256 for  and 146 against. And although Gennadiy Burbulis does not  consider the outcome of the vote a defeat for the democrats (who  sought a figure of 12-14), the disposition of votes clearly  promises a hard life for them in the State Duma. As for the  "nonregistration" ploy, it must be assumed that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy will not always help his opponents to set all and  sundry against him with unsubtle tricks. The democrats should  not forget that this man knows not only how to "take a punch"  but also how to learn lessons from doing so.    On Wednesday, following its turbulent start, the State Duma  worked in factions. Deputies' groups were being formed. There  will be a joint sitting on Thursday.</p>

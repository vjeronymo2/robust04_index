			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) If you have a non-U.S. Government record, coordinate with the record's originator before releasing it (see &sect;806.10(e)(1). This includes records created by foreign governments and organizations like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD). Coordinate release of foreign government records with the U.S. Department of State through the MAJCOM FOIA office. Coordinate release or denial of Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) and SAF/IA through SAF/AAIS (FOIA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> FOIA exemptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Denial authorities may withhold records or information when an identifiable harm would result by disclosure, and the records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Exemption 1_Classified Records. Records properly and currently classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, as authorized by executive order and implementing instructions. Apply this exemption when disclosing information by itself or in the context of other information that could reasonably be expected to damage national security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To make a sound decision, review the record paragraph by paragraph for releasable information. Review all unclassified parts before release to see if they are exempt. Before releasing a reviewed and declassified document, draw a single black line through all the classification markings, so they are still legible and stamp the document ``Unclassified.'' Review material, if appropriate, to determine if it should be classified, even though it was not classified when requested. AFI 31&hyph;401, Information Security Program Management (formerly AFRs 205&hyph;1 and 205&hyph;43), tells how to classify and declassify records. Check to see if information from foreign sources is classified. Delete exempt parts of records and disclose the rest if it does not distort meaning and you can reasonably assume that a skillful, knowledgeable person could not reconstruct the information deleted. Denial letters must say that unauthorized disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security and cite the appropriate executive order paragraph(s) as authority for classification. When denying a whole classified record, release all unclassified parts that would cause no identifiable harm. Coordinate with the local information security specialist when invoking this exemption for consistency of classification policy and procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When simply knowing whether a record exists or not reveals classified information, use the ``Glomar'' (refusal to confirm or deny) response. Apply it consistently, not only when a record exists but also when a record does not exist. Otherwise, the pattern of using a ``no record'' response when a record does not exist, and a ``refusal to confirm or deny'' when a record does exist will disclose exempt information. Cite the FOIA exemption when you use the ``Glomar'' response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Exemption 2_Internal Personnel Rules and Practices. Exempt information falls in two categories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) ``High'' 2 protects records which, if disclosed, would substantially hinder the effective performance of a significant function of the DoD by risking circumvention of a statute or Air Force instruction or policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``Low'' 2 is for trivial internal administrative matters of no genuine public interest and the process of releasing such records would constitute an unwarranted administrative burden. You can only use the ``low'' 2 exemption before fully processing the requested records. Otherwise, you may eliminate the administrative burden justification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Exemption 3_Other Statutes. Records of matters that a statute specifically exempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion on the issue of withholding or according to defined standards for withholding or referring to particular types of matters we must withhold. When using this exemption, cite both exemption 3 and the specific statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Exemption 4_Confidential Commercial Information. Records with trade secrets and commercial or financial information submitted by a person or entity outside the Federal Government on a privileged or confidential basis that, if released, is likely to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter of the information or impair the government's future ability to obtain necessary information. Examples of exempt information follow: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Trade secrets that are commercially valuable plans, formulas, processes, or devices used for making, preparing, compounding, or processing trade commodities and are the product of innovation or substantial effort and were given in confidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Commercial or financial information given in confidence, in connection with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals; or privileged information, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, offered and given in confidence by a contractor or potential contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Personal statements made during inspections, investigations, or audits, if such statements are given in confidence by the individual and kept confidential, because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information normally considered confidential or privileged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Financial data private employers provide in confidence for local wage surveys, used to set and adjust pay schedules for prevailing wage rate employees of the DoD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning technical or scientific data or other information submitted with a research grant application or with a report during research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part that is copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely affect its market value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor developed entirely with private funds and technical or scientific data developed with both Federal and private funds, which the contractor or subcontractor legally owns per 10 U.S.C. 2320&hyph;2321 and DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), chapter 2 of 48 CFR 227.4. You may withhold technical data developed entirely with Federal funds under Exemption 3 if the data meets the criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Before releasing information submitted from outside the Air Force: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

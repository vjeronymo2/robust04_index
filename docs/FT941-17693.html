			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Resort accounts delayed by valuation difficulties Difficulties in finalising property valuations for Resort Hotels, the company which called in independent accountants to investigate financing issues last July, are behind the long delay in publishing its accounts for the year to end-April. 'Because it has not been possible to determine the finalised valuation of our properties as yet, the accounts of the company for the year ended April 30 1993 are not complete and cannot be laid before you today,' Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, told shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting. Property valuations have become a vexed issue since two firms of chartered surveyors offered widely divergent valuations of the assets of Queens Moat Houses, the troubled hotels company. There has been speculation that Resort could be suffering similar problems to those at Queens Moat Houses of high debt and falling asset value. Mr Tonkinson said stock exchange rules prevented him from giving shareholders at the meeting any more information about the affairs of the company, whose shares were suspended last July at 45p, without issuing a circular to all shareholders. That had not been possible. Mr Tonkinson denied that the company had selected the date and venue for its annual meeting to cause shareholders inconvenience. He said the meeting was timed for the last day of the calendar year 'to leave, until the last possible moment, the opportunity of sending a detailed circular to shareholders, if that had been possible.' He added that the meeting was not taking place in one of the company's hotels as these were all 'very busy preparing for tonight's festivities with a view to earning profit'. He said the trade and industry department had granted a new deadline of February 28 for publication of the accounts. Mr Tonkinson added: 'The most rigorous investigations have been carried out, both by Ernst &amp; Young as external independent accountants and by our own auditors and solicitors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Gouldens respectively.' In early December the company's deputy chairman, Mr Tim Barker, and its financial adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, resigned.</p>

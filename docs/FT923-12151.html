			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi agrees Pounds 5m payment to settle US class legal action SAATCHI and Saatchi, the international advertising services group, said yesterday it had agreed to pay more than Pounds 5m to settle a class legal action brought against it in the US district court of Los Angeles in February 1990. The legal suit was lodged against directors of Saatchi at the time who remain company directors today - Mr Charles Saatchi, Mr Maurice Saatchi and Mr Jeremy Sinclair - by an American shareholder, Ms Margaret Yingling, after the company's share price fell from about 200p at the beginning of 1990 to less than 100p within two months. The plaintiff claimed that the directors failed to disclose negative information about the company. As a result the price of its shares were artificially inflated and members of the class suffered a financial loss when the share price fell. Saatchi said its agreement to settle the dispute - by paying Pounds 4.9m with interest backdated to May 7 1992, calculated at an annual 8 per cent - implied no admission of wrongdoing. A Saatchi official said the cost of defending such actions in the US could be up to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.54m) annually and it could have taken three years for the case to go through the courts. The decision to settle was cheaper in the long run. At least 60 such class actions have been brought in the US in the past five years, with settlements as high as Dollars 300m. James Capel estimates Saatchi's pre-tax profits for 1992 at Pounds 18m, against reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m for the 12 months ended December 31 1991.</p>

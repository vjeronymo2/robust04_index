			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Labor Party Leader Kok Ahead in </F> Poll"]    [Text] At this moment, PvdA [Labor Party] leader Wim Kok is  the most popular choice for prime minister. Of the Netherlands  voters, 29 percent would vote for Kok as prime minister, against  22.5 for D66 [Democrats 66] leader Hans Van Mierlo and 18.5  percent for CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Elco  Brinkman. This was revealed in a survey conducted by Interview  Office on behalf of the ANP Press Agency and Nova, a TV current  affairs program.    Compared to four weeks ago, Kok took a remarkable step  forward. At that time, 26.0 percent voted for Van Mierlo, 24.3  percent for Brinkman, and only 19.5 percent for Kok. Just like  four weeks ago, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  leader Bolkestein is lagging far behind the three others. He is  now the most popular choice for prime minister for 11.4 percent  of the voters, against 10.1 percent four weeks ago.    Kok's progress is mainly due to an increasing popularity  among voters from his own PvdA and from GroenLinks [Green Left].  Four weeks ago, hardly 70 percent of PvdA voters and only 20  percent of GroenLinks voters wanted Kok as prime minister.  These percentages have now risen to 88 and 52 percent,  respectively.</p>

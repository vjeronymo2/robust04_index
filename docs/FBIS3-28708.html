Akitane Kiuchi, who has served as ambassador to Malaysia,  Thailand and France, is visiting Washington as a special envoy  of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, they said.    Kiuchi conveyed to Clinton a message from Hosokawa pledging  he will try to solve issues with sincerity, the sources said.  Clinton was quoted as saying it is time for the two sides to  upgrade negotiations to the cabinet-minister level.    Hosokawa told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that the trade  negotiations have been deadlocked over U.S. demands for  "objective criteria" for measuring the degree of foreign access  to the Japanese market.    Hosokawa is due to leave Tokyo for Washington on Thursday to  hold talks with Clinton on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SPRING AWAKENING' PORTRAYS SEXUAL TERROR OF ADOLESCENCE  </P> <P> A brief description of the play "Spring Awakening" makes it sound like a teen  exploitation movie.  </P> <P> "Spring Awakening" examines teen-agers, young teen-agers, as they discover sex.  The characters masturbate and copulate. They try it with members of the same  sex and of the opposite sex.  </P> <P> They also experiment with sado-masochism, get pregnant, get expelled from  school, try to abort, die in the attempt, commit suicide, talk to headless  ghosts. Not all of their problems are related to sex -- they're also depicted  as victims of a rigid academic system that will make them slaves and give them  nervous breakdowns.  </P> <P> But this isn't a previously undiscovered first film of James Dean's -- or Molly  Ringwald's. It's a century-old play by the German writer Frank Wedekind, and  director Michael Arabian gives it a lively, imaginative staging at the Odyssey.  </P> <P> Arabian makes the theatrical nature of the event clear from the beginning.  Before the play begins, the cast goes through warm-up exercises in front of the  audience. Then they gather in a circle and chant. When they finally break for  the first scene, the cast members who aren't involved in it remain on stage and  watch.  </P> <P> Later, in a scene that's a monologue in the text, these extra actors virtually  serve as a chorus line. They maneuver giant posts (part of a highly mobile set  by Don Llewelyn and Saeed Hedjazi) in intricately choreographed patterns. This  is all done to the accompaniment of Nathan Wang's big, brooding score -- which  outgrows the term incidental music, though technically that's what it is.  </P> <P> Some of the extra-textual trappings are excessive. It's distracting when the  on-stage onlookers laugh at lines that don't elicit the same response from the  real audience. And why do the girls in these scenes (but not the boys) wear  black choir robes?  </P> <P> The length of the production, nearly three hours, is also excessive. Some of  this is Wedekind's responsibility -- he included two scenes that haven't  anything to do with the central story. One of these scenes appears to exist  simply so that homosexuality will be included among the catalogue of sexual  variations on display, and Wedekind placed this scene at the one point in the  play -- just before the ending -- where it does the most damage to the momentum  of the story.  </P> <P> Still, we wouldn't want Arabian to start deleting; this play was censored  enough, thank you, in its early years. Furthermore, the communal rituals that  Arabian added do convey a sense of the universality and timelessness of the  adolescent Angst that we're watching. They take "Spring Awakening" into the  territory covered by "The Rite of Spring."  </P> <P> Lest the production get carried away by all the artiness, Rick Foster's  translation -- commissioned for this production -- brings it back into the  present day, using rough American teen vernacular. And Arabian supplements the  contemporaneity -- at least for the boys in the story -- by letting them read  skin magazines, listen to Led Zeppelin on a big portable radio and pass around  a basketball.  </P> <P> In short, it's a production about 19th-Century Germans and 20th-Century  Americans at the same time (and therefore an apt choice for inclusion in the  "Jugendstil Fest: Young Moderns of 1900," of which this production is a part).  Although Betty Berberian's costumes remain more in the former era than the  latter, everything else about the play jumps out of the last century and into  our own.  </P> <P> The cast is generally able. As best friends Melchior and Moritz, Sean Six and  Jon Mathews connect with each other yet also make it apparent why the boys'  roads diverged so radically -- one toward death, one toward life. Mathews  occasionally seems too mature and too mannered, but Lycia Naff is a breath of  fresh air as the 14-year-old who learns too late of the inadequacy of the stork  story.  </P> <P> One casting decision breeds some slight confusion: A Masked Man is played by a  woman (Jillian McWhirter) who, behind her mask, looks too much like the loose  girl Ilse (Lara Lyon). Generally, though, Lisa Cooperman's masks sharpen the  play's satirical edge to just the right proportions, and Marianne Schneller's  lights add a touch of grandeur.  </P> <P>  At 12111 Ohio Ave., Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m.,  Jan. 29 and Feb. 12 matinees at 3 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $14.50-$18.50;  (213) 826-1626.  </P> <P> </P></p>

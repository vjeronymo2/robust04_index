			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 26 (AFP) -- Talks between nuclear  inspectors and North Korea on the monitoring of fuel rods and  regular inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor resumed here  Thursday [26 May], a spokesman for the International Atomic  Energy Agnecy (IAEA) said. He said the talks, which began  Wednesday, were expected to continue through Friday.    The North Korean Government has so far refused to allow IAEA  inspectors to monitor the refueling of its five-megawatt reactor  at Yongbyon, the country's only nuclear power plant located 90  kilometres (55 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang.    IAEA inspectors on Wednesday completed maintenance work on  surveillance equipment installed at the plant and were allowed  to take samples from a nuclear reprocessing plant, also at  Yongbyon. The samples should allow the Agency to determine  whether plutonium could have been manufactured or diverted,  possibly for use in making nuclear bombs.    The inspectors, however, arrived after North Korea had begun  refueling its Yongbyong reactor and some of the 8,000 fuel rods  had already been removed. The IAEA charged that by starting the  refueling before the arrival of the inspectors, North Korea was  in violation of IAEA inspection terms and that the Agency would  inform the UN Security Council for possible punitive sanctions.    The Agency added, however, that it was still possible to  take  samples from the spent fuel rods to determine whether plutonium  was diverted for military purposes.</p>

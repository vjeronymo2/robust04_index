			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ex-Kelt chief launches hostile bid for Blystad THE FORMER chief executive of Kelt Energy, architect of one of the 1980s more audacious but ultimately disastrous oil sector mergers, has launched a bid to take over Blystad, owner of KCA Drilling, the much thumbed-over UK independent offshore oil service company. The hostile paper bid from Abbot Holdings, a private company set up by Mr Alistair Locke, values the loss-making Blystad at Pounds 7.5m, or 5.4p a share - a 20 per cent premium over the Blystad price before the bid. The offer has the irrevocable support of three directors of the Norwegian Blystad family who bought a 65 per cent stake in 1989. However, the independent board, including the managing director, finance director and Henry Ansbacher, the independent advisers, yesterday said they would not be recommending the offer to shareholders. Ansbacher said they were looking at a potential conflict of interest arising from a Pounds 3.6m loan from Blystad to a company controlled by the Blystad family. Friendly negotiations with the independent directors broke down recently. In order for Mr Locke to make his offer he required the Blystad board's waiver of clauses in a confidentiality agreement he had signed precluding hostile bids. Blystad must repay a Dollars 5m loan in December, a payment which the Bank of Ireland, making the offer on behalf of Abbot, says Blystad may not be able to meet from its cash resources. Mr Locke says his offer provides the best opportunity for minority shareholders to retrieve something from a group that has paid no dividend for seven years, has lost money in the last three years and has a deficit on profit and loss account. KCA - a profitable north sea operator with a number of platforms on charter to oil majors - has passed through a number of hands and was once owned by Bristol Oil and Minerals. Mr Locke left Kelt after its highly leveraged bid for Carless in 1988 which drove the company into the hands of its bankers and led to the forced sale of its Wytch Farm stake.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Management: Knives are out in the boardroom - Christopher Lorenz welcomes evidence that non-executive directors are at last flexing their muscles Seldom can company chairmen and chief executives have been more nervous than they are this spring. Not only are bosses on both sides of the Atlantic facing the renewed threat of corporate takeover, but they are also suffering a much more personal fear - of being knifed by their own board colleagues. General Motors set the trend last month when its outside directors took action after years of intense frustration at the leviathan's poor performance. They demoted the company's chairman by ousting him from his post as head of GM's top strategic forum. This sent tremors throughout corporate America: if it could happen at GM, it could happen anywhere. Now the chairman of Britain's Barclays Bank, Sir John Quinton, seems to have suffered an even worse fate by being asked to give up his executive duties earlier than he had intended. His sin was not only to preside over Barclays' sliding performance through the recession. He also made several odd decisions, such as somehow finding the time to become chairman of England's controversial new Premier soccer division. To many people, moves like those at GM and Barclays represent a new and welcome era in better corporate governance: the overdue flexing of muscles by non-executive directors, often in concert with institutional shareholders, when a company fails to deal promptly with its problems. But how new is the trend? And how much does it really promise for better governance? The Quinton affair will send as many shock waves through British boardrooms as has GM's in the US. But it is not a new development: back in late 1990 and 1991, as the recession tightened its grip, the non-executive directors and institutional shareholders of a number of over-extended, medium-sized companies dispatched the offending bosses summarily. These events could just spell a new era in governance, but there is a host of reasons why they do not necessarily do so. For one thing, such cases are still the minority, and still generally occur too late to avoid the company being damaged in the meantime. The last chairman of British Aerospace was allowed to hang on far too long before being deposed. In many cases, as the labyrinthine Maxwell scandal demonstrated only too graphically, non-execs remain supine or powerless in the face of a chairman's neglect of the business, or even his suspected misuse of it. This may be because he has used his old boy network to appoint a bunch of cronies - as is the case far too often - but this is not necessarily the reason. Just as debilitating to the potential power of quite respectable non-execs may be any of the following: The paucity of their number relative to that of the executive directors. There is still no minimum requirement for the number of non-executive directors (some boards have none at all), and very few British companies have a majority of non-executives on their board, unlike their US counterparts. Their inadequate representation on audit, nomination and remuneration committees, not all of which exist in many companies in any case. Insufficient mechanisms to ensure that they have access to the same information, formal and otherwise, as the executive directors. Even when they do possess such information, they may not have time to digest it and organise the necessary political consensus in support of their point of view. Even if they are capable of acting independently, non-execs who are full-time managers of one company may pull their punches when acting in a non-executive capacity elsewhere, out of an innate fear of encouraging non-execs on their own boards to rock the boat too often. The list could be lengthened still further. Most fundamental of all, in the words of John Scott-Oldfield, a management consultant who has helped construct a number of very effective UK boards, 'the capability of non-executives is only as good as the chairman allows the board process to be. He must be both enlightened and open'. In principle (though once again, not necessarily), this is more likely to be the case if the chairman's role is split from that of the chief executive. Theoretically, non-execs should be able to exert most influence when the chairman is also non-executive, and therefore identifies his interest closely with theirs. But plenty non-executive chairmen are merely figureheads who are given the run-around by a powerful chief executive or managing director. One well-known MD used to snigger whenever his non-exec chairman's name was mentioned. It may be pure coincidence that at two of the UK companies where non-execs have most clout, B0C and Grand Metropolitan, the jobs of chairman and chief executive have not been separated. What this does suggest is that the degree of enlightenment of the person in the top post can be more important than the formal structure of his or her job. That said, such best practice is rare, and enlightenment is a less common and reliable commodity than are formal safeguards. So the new UK Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, was right in principle at this week's Institute of Directors' annual convention to advocate separation of the top two roles. This can also be done by adopting the American habit of splitting the post of 'chief operating officer' from that of the executive chairman. As well as advocating 'active and effective' non-executive directors, Mills called for the creation of audit, nomination and remuneration committees. There is certainly a need for either regulation or legislation to guarantee non-executives exclusive membership of audit and remuneration committees. Instead of relying on 'recommendations', like so many half-hearted past efforts at corporate governance in Britain, the Cadbury Committee on the subject should advocate that these moves, and others, be enforced. Only then will all Britain's public companies, rather than just a few, start to be governed properly. In the meantime, directors of most large enterprises will continue to harm employee motivation, and their companies' reputations, by paying themselves too much, and by clutching at corporate power long after they should have quit.</p>

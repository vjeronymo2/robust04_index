			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures continued to decline, with premiums to the cash market narrowing through most of the session, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,070 at the official 4.10pm close, down 40 points for a two-day decline of 70. The cash market premium at this level was 13 points, broadly in line with fair value premium. Although the premium to cash equities was slim, narrowing to around 8 points at times, traders said there was very little downward pressure on the cash market. The quality business remained poor, with little liquidity to be found in either the morning or afternoon session. Traders said it was hard to deal in sizes of more than 15 to 20 contracts. Institutional investors, after their brief reappearance on Tuesday, stayed on the sidelines. The atmosphere was gloomy, and most traders thought the contract would go lower before it recovered. Activity was again dull, with contract numbers easing to 12,822, from 13,429 in the previous session. Stock options turnover totalled 39,813 lots, against 26,685 on Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for 28,500 lots. Guinness was far and away the most active individual option, trading 2,060 lots. Glaxo, HSBC and British Steel were also busy options.</p>

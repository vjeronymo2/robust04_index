			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (9): More than whisky galore - Food exporters demand a national trade mark Wild heather moors. Clear mountain streams. Deer and cattle roaming freely in hills and glens. Such are the images mentioned when foreigners are asked what Scotland means to them. Harnessing these visions of unbridled nature into something commercial might seem like trying to sell Scotch mist in a bottle, but the leaders of Scotland's food and farming industry are intent on doing just that. They want to create a trade mark to promote food and drink products for their purity and quality. The National Farmers' Union of Scotland, which has initiated quality marketing schemes for several agricultural sectors, says the Scottish Quality Mark would emulate the Appellation Controlee system for French wine or the Woolmark for knitwear. In January the government gave the go-ahead for a business plan showing how the quality mark would operate. The plan, which should be ready by the summer, follows a report by the government-appointed Scottish Food Strategy Group. Mr James Millar, chairman of the group and of the Dundee-based supermarket chain, Wm Low, says the mark would probably first be used for sales in the UK and selective continental markets where Scottish produce has a particularly good image. These include Paris and other big French cities, southern Germany and northern Italy. The report says that, while Scottish salmon and whisky are well-known, 'the level of perception of the general range of Scottish food products remains low throughout Europe'. Farming experts say the country needs aggressive marketing because of the drawbacks associated with its natural advantages. If it is remote from pollution, it is also remote from the cities where most of its potential customers live. Targeting markets will be all the more important as the Gatt deal and Common Agricultural Policy reforms prepare hitherto protected European farmers for exposure to world market forces. Livestock products account for 45 per cent of Scotland's agricultural output. But competition for outlets will probably increase as CAP reform reduces the amount of beef being accepted into intervention stores and forces more on to the open market. Fortunately for Scottish producers, animals reared using non-intensive farming methods - the only way to farm much of the country's hilly terrain - not only receive extra subsidies from Brussels but appear to be what consumers want. Exporters such as ANM Group, Scotland's biggest farmer co-operative, are finding a ready market on the continent. Like overall food output, beef production is 1 per cent or less of the EU total. Scottish producers need to do more to help themselves, for example by ceasing to export live animals and whole carcasses to France, says Mr Donald MacRae, TSB Bank's agricultural specialist. 'It seems quite wrong to give all the 'value added' to the French,' he said. 'It would make a lot more sense for us to do the processing here.' About 15 per cent of Scottish beef is already being sold through a scheme guaranteeing its quality. The Farm Assured Scotch Livestock scheme, promoted by the NFU, puts 500,000 lambs and 76,000 cattle to market each year. Quality assurance schemes provide codes of practice for farmers and standards for processors on, for example, animal welfare, feeding, chemical inputs, hygiene and slaughter. The product's history is traceable back from the supermarket shelf through processing to the production stage. 'Consumers want to be assured that farming is environmentally-friendly,' says Alastair Alexander, NFU marketing director. Scotland already has schemes for pork, salmon, trout, cheese and venison and others are planned for cereals and soft fruit. The financial advantages can be considerable. Consumer research showed that 76 per cent of consumers were prepared to pay more for Scottish salmon with the 'Tartan Mark' guarantee of quality. This salmon was the first foreign product to be awarded the 'Label Rouge' - a French mark of superior quality - in 1991 and commands a premium of 10 to 12 per cent above other Scottish salmon sold there. But introduction of a single Scottish quality mark faces potential obstacles. It must be accepted by leading retailers, who may be sceptical about its usefulness, said Mr MacRae. 'I can see some retailers saying: what is the quality mark doing for us? It needs to have a decent amount of money so it becomes established in people's minds and the big retailers can't ignore it.' The food strategy group called for Pounds 450,000 a year for the body operating the mark, Pounds 2m for a launch campaign in the UK, and an annual promotion budget for all its markets of at least Pounds 5m. The government and private sector will need to be persuaded of its worth. Scottish food manufacturers already well-established in foreign markets may be reluctant to share a common quality mark that could be more useful to smaller competitors than to them. Winning over farmers may prove difficult, too. Some farmers - such as hill farmers who sell their sheep to be fattened on richer lowland pastures - are a long way from the final consumer, and marketing may seem irrelevant. The food strategy group admits there is some reluctance to join quality assurance schemes. Mr MacRae goes further, accusing some farmers of a lack of vision. A survey of farmers by the TSB and the NFU found concern that membership of a scheme would involve hefty costs and much record-keeping - both misconceptions, according to proponents of the schemes. 'It's not the cheapest that wins,' says Mr MacRae. 'Farmers have to buy the quality argument, and in many cases they don't'</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: PolyGram climbs 24.8% to Fl 446m in tough year POLYGRAM, the music company which is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, shrugged off the economic downturn in several of its markets to record a 24.8 per cent increase in net income last year to Fl 446m (Dollars 237m). The company, which has 20 per cent of its shares listed on the Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges, benefited from an improved performance in North America and several popular and classical hits. North American operating income was Fl 13m last year, compared to a loss of Fl 48m in 1990. Six of the company's popular albums sold over 3m units each worldwide last year, compared to two albums in 1990. Top-selling artists in 1991 included Sting, Dire Straits, U2 and Bryan Adams. Best-selling classical albums included 'Carreras, Domingo, Pavarotti in Concert' which was recorded in 1990 during the football World Cup in Rome and has now sold 7m units. PolyGram has also sold 1m copies of the concert video. Worldwide sales were up 20.5 per cent to Fl 6.3bn. Net income per share rose 24.8 per cent to Fl 2.62. The full year dividend is Fl 0.60 (Fl 0.50). Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said the company last year increased its share of the worldwide recorded music market from 17.5 to 18.5 per cent. Sales of compact discs continued to grow at the expense of other music formats such as cassettes and long-playing records. CDs accounted for 58 per cent of PolyGram unit sales last year, compared to 48 per cent in 1990. Cassettes made up 35 per cent of unit sales last year, with vinyl records accounting for only 7 per cent. The higher price of compact discs meant that CD sales were 71 per cent of album sales by value, compared to 62 per cent in 1990. Cassettes made up 23 per cent of sales and vinyl records 6 per cent. Mr Levy said, however, that with the increasing number of households owning compact disc players, CD sales growth would probably begin to slow. But he added that the introduction of the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) this year would provide a boost to the music market. DCC tapes look similar to conventional cassettes but have a sound quality similar to that of CDs. Mr Jan Cook, chief financial officer, said Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Holdings had made a positive contribution to PolyGram's profits. Lex, Page 20</p>

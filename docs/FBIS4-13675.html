			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "With the Events" program] </F>   [Text] Representatives of families of Israeli Defense  Force's POW's and MIA's met with Faysal al-Husayni at the  headquarters of the Palestinian delegation in east Jerusalem  today. They handed him a letter to be delivered to the  Palestinian leadership in Tunis.    Ahmad 'Ubaydat attended the meeting. Here are more details  on this story:    [Begin recording] ['Ubaydat] A delegation representing the  families of Israeli MIA's met with Faysal al-Husani at the  headquarters of the Palestinian delegation in east Jerusalem  this afternoon. The delegation was headed by (Yona Bawmel),  father of MIA soldier (Zakharia).    [Bawmel, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into  Arabic] The meeting was cordial. I proposed to al-Husayni that  we embark on joint cooperation in the interests of both sides.  We hope that there will be joint cooperation between both sides.    ['Ubaydat] (Bawmel) handed al-Husayni a memorandum to be  delivered to the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian leadership.  The memorandum explains the agonies of the families of MIA's.    With regard to al-Husayni, he commented at the end of the  meeting, saying:    [Al-Husayni] Indeed, at this point in time, there is no  doubt  that the two peoples are suffering. There are Israeli MIA's,  whose families are suffering. Likewise, there are Palestinian  MIA's, whose families are also experiencing agony. This meeting  was held at the request of the Israelis. A representative of  the Society in Charge of Locating Palestinian MIA's attended  this meeting. During this meeting, the Israelis asked us to  obtain from the PLO the information it could have on Israeli  MIA's. As far as we are concerned, we appreciate this position.  We can understand the Israelis' suffering. But, we also  discussed with the Israeli delegation the fate of the  Palestinian MIA's, particularly since both sides must work to  resolve the problem of Israeli and Palestinian MIA's regardless  of the political problems that could face them.    ['Ubaydat] In reply to a question on the meetings held  between Peres and 'Arafat in Bucharest, al-Husayni said:    [Al-Husayni] I hope they will manage to resolve some of the  problems still obstructing the Cairo talks during these meetings.    ['Ubaydat] Several children of Israeli MIA's staged a  demonstration before the headquarters of the Palestinian  delegation. They raised placards demanding the release of the  Israeli MIA's.

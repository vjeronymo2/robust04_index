			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aside from the local/distant status of broadcast signals, &sect;76.51 also serves a purpose in determining the applicable royalty rate for distant signals to be paid by cable systems. The earlier FCC must-carry rules determined when a broadcast signal was distant, and in turn the Commission's distant signal carriage rules in effect in 1976 determined how many distant signals a cable operator in a top 100 television market could carry. 47 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;76.61 and 76.63 (1976). Cable systems operating in the top 50 markets listed in &sect;76.51 were generally allowed to carry three distant signals, while systems in the second 50 markets could generally carry only two. When the distant signal carriage rules were eliminated in 1981,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Malrite T.V. of New York, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FCC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 652 F.2d 1140 (2d Cir. 1981),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied sub. nom., National Football League, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FCC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 454 U.S. 1143 (1982), the Copyright Royalty Tribunal adjusted the royalty rates under the Copyright Code provision permitting adjustment ``[i]n the event that the rules and regulations of the [FCC] are amended .&blank;.&blank;. to permit the carriage of additional television broadcast signals beyond the local service area of such signals. .&blank;.&blank;.'' 17 U.S.C. 801(b)(2)(B). The result was that cable carriage of formerly non-permitted distant signals triggered a substantially higher copyright royalty rate (3.75% of gross receipts per signal) than that applicable to carriage of formerly permitted signals (less than 1% of gross receipts per signal).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Adjustment of the Royalty Rates for Cable Systems,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47 FR 52146 (Nov. 19, 1982). Cable systems in the top fifty &sect;76.51 markets, therefore, can generally carry one more non-3.75% distant signal than cable systems located in the second 50 markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for redesignation of the scope of a particular market, the markets listed in &sect;76.51 and their ranking have remained unchanged since the section's inception in 1972. In 1985, the FCC amended the list to include Melbourne and Cocoa, Florida in the Orlando-Daytona Beach, Florida hyphenated market, and added Visalia, Hanford, and Clovis, California to the Fresno, California market.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;11 RM 4557, 102 FCC2d 1062 (1985)(Florida);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;439, FCC&hyph;85&hyph;59 (1985)(California).

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: Desktop jungle grows more dense - Technically Speaking It may be a strange thing to complain about, but arguably to day's PC buyer is spoilt for choice. In the early 1980s, with desktop computing in its infancy, the serious PC buyer had a straightforward choice: an Apple II driven by a Motorola 6502 chip; an IBM PC with an Intel 8088 chip inside; or one of the machines with a Zilog Z-80 central processor unit. Today there are hundreds of computer manufacturers, many little more than garage assembly lines, putting their names on boxes of components and calling them computers. Most manufacturers offer at least half-a-dozen varieties of desktop PC built around different microprocessors. The proliferation of models reflects two factors. Firstly, the rapid advance of chip technology means the time gap between successive generations of microprocessor is shrinking. Secondly, growing competition in the microprocessor market, from companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix and Chips and Technologies, has prompted Intel, the dominant manufacturer, to retaliate. Until recently, the microprocessor market was a sedate business. Ever few years Intel introduced a new, faster chip which gave PC buyers a relatively easy upgrade path. Within each generation, the faster the cpu 'clock' speed (indicated by the Mhz number), the faster the processor and usually the computer. For example, a 386 chip running at 33MHz was faster than a 386 running at 25Mhz, but both were slower than any 486. Things began to get complicated when Intel launched stripped down and cheaper (SX) versions of its 80386 and 80486 (DX) chips. Then its arch rival, AMD, launched a 40Mhz version of a 80386 chip which was faster than Intel's 20Mhz 80486SX chips and stole a sizable chunk of the PC market. Intel's response has been to launch wave after wave of new 486 processors in an apparent attempt to plug every conceivable marketing gap. Early this year it went on record saying it would launch 30 of these new 'second generation' products in 1992. To date it has unveiled 16, 20 and 25MHz 486SX chips, a low power 486SL designed for portable computers, 25, 33 and 50MHz 486DX chips and two 'speed doubler' 486 DX2 chips which, by using some clever technology, run twice as fast internally as the rest of the computer. As if that wasn't enough, it is also launching a set of 'OverDrive' chips which effectively double the speed of existing 20MHz and 25MHz 486SX machines. Intel argues that the new chips are in response to customer needs, and that the user-installable 'Overdrive' chips, in particular, allow customers to upgrade their existing machines rather than forcing them to buy new computers in order to get better performance. However, more cynical commentators suggest that Intel is simply attempting to ensure that its chip-making rivals are locked out of the market. Whatever the motive, the proliferation of chip types is confusing for the end-user, particularly because there is no agreed way of measuring performance. PC manufacturers will often quote a machine's 'Landmark' speed as an indication of performance. Although a large number of performance benchmarking tests exist, the results can be misleading. Even two machines built around the same chip running at the same speed can deliver dramatically different performances. That is because performance also depends on a wide range of other factors including what software is being run, the speed of peripherals such as hard disks, and the speed of the random access memory and other chips and components in the machine. Confused yet? Even if you are not, the chances are you soon will be. Intel will shortly be launching a brand new, high-end microprocessor, code-named P5, and we can only guess how many flavours that will come in.</p>

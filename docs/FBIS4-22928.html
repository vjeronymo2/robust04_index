Monich, I.V. Krivosheina, S.L. </F> Malinovskaya, K.N. Kontorshchikova, Nizhniy Novgorod Medical  Institute; UDC 615.849.19.03]    [Abstract] The emergence of low-power medical lasers and  the resulting uses of such lasers on biological tissues as well  reports that the use of noncoherent light sources and lasers in  clinical practices leads to virtually indistinguishable results  prompted renewed interest in developing light treatment devices  using polymer optical fibers, especially since in most cases,  the clinics do not have the facilities for retuning the laser  radiation wavelength to match its spectrum with the resonant  absorption lines of biologically significant molecules. The  optical fiber will be able not only to transmit radiation  bounded by the fiber end aperture but also the light generated  by photoluminescence of the impurities. The structure of a  two-layer optical fiber containing luminescing impurities and a  block diagram of the fiber optic luminescent device are cited,  and the design and operating principles of this low-intensity  fiber optic luminescent device designed on the basis of the  above characteristics are described in detail. The operating  principle makes it possible to combine the function of injecting  light into thin fibers and isolating spectral radiation bands  which are most effective in given procedures. The device's  ability to generate pulse radiation greatly increases the  strength of the postoperative sutures; a 40 Hz frequency is  optimal, and red light (600-680 nm) is the most efficient.  Experiments with animals and donor blood demonstrates that  monochromated light has a favorable effect on skin tissue  regeneration. Figures 3; references 9.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Iraqi Kurds attack PKK camps RIVAL Kurdish factions in northern Iraq were reported yesterday to be engaged in a major clash, as Iraqi peshmerga fighters attempted to expel rebel Turkish Kurds from their bases near the border. The incident provides the first indication of the tacit co-operation of the Iraqi Kurds in Turkey's conflict with the PKK, the Marxist guerrillas waging an increasingly violent separatist campaign. The attack follows warnings from the Iraq Kurdish Front to the PKK, which has stepped up attacks on Turkish government positions since the Gulf war. The presence of PKK forces in northern Iraq has threatened relations between Turkey and the newly established Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. Iraqi Kurds depend on aid supplied via Turkey. Details of the fighting remain sketchy but one Turkish official confirmed a 'major clash' was happening Kurdish officials said their forces were attacking three PKK camps near the town of Zakho. Aid workers in the area said there were heavy casualties with local hospitals said to be overflowing. Around 6,000 peshmergas were engaging 3,000 PKK guerrillas near the villages of Shirwan and Hakuk. Ankara remains anxious that the evolution of a de facto Kurdish state in northern Iraq will encourage Turkey's Kurds to step up demands for independence. Meanwhile Iraqi Kurds fear Turkey's struggle with the PKK could imperil allied air protection, which remains dependent on Turkish approval.</p>

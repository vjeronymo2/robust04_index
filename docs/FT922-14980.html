			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African farms face drought costs SOUTH AFRICA faces the prospect of a drop of up to 50 per cent in agricultural output for the 1991-92 season as farmers experience perhaps the worst drought this century. Particularly affected are grain producers in summer rainfall areas, with the maize crop, the country's largest, already devastated. The official estimate, released in mid-March, is for a crop of 2.1m tonnes and some economists believe this figure could still drop to 1.8m tonnes. This compares to a crop last year of 7.8m tonnes. Mr Peter Cownie, general manager of the maize board, which sets maize prices in the country, says: 'This is undoubtedly one of the worst two droughts this century. The farmers are not going to be able to get back on their feet again without state intervention'. To meet the country's needs, up to 5.5m tonnes of maize, at a cost of about R580-R600 (Pounds 95-Pounds 98) a tonne once transport costs are taken into account, will have to be imported. Thus, apart from the estimated R2bn-3bn in lost earnings that farmers will suffer, there will probably be a cash outflow from the country of R2bn-3bn to pay for the imports. Maize prices will also rise. Mr Cownie says: 'The aim would be to keep the price rise within range of the general inflation rate'. The price will rise because of the added cost of transporting a large portion of the maize from coastal ports to inland silos. The board, says Mr Cownie, also has to try and pay for its infrastructural capacity, including 40m tonnes of silo capacity, on a crop effectively only 25 per cent of normal volumes. Mr Fanie Brink, economist at the National Association of Maize Producers (Nampo), says the average national yield for this year's maize crop is 600 kg a hectare. The previous worst yield was 1 tonne a hectare in 1982-83. He says none of the 8,000 to 10,000 maize farmers in the country will break even. Depending on the geographical area in which they farm, they require yields of 2.5 to 3.5 tonnes a hectare to do so. The government set aside R1bn in the budget, delivered two weeks ago, for drought relief. Committees are currently at work trying to decide how best this money should be spent. Officials of agricultural organisations have already said the money is insufficient. Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, described this sum in his budget address as a 'ceiling', so it must be doubtful whether more will be spent, especially given that the state is already budgeting for a 4.5 per cent budget deficit. And many economists think it has been over-generous in its revenue estimates. Preliminary indications from the government suggest the aid will be distributed on a merit basis - to farmers who appear to have the potential to survive. The knock-on effect of the drought will also be considerable. Most economists believe that it will cut the country's growth rate by about 0.5 per cent, with the result that few expect the economy to record real growth of more than 1 per cent this year. The cumulative farming debt - currently about R17bn - will grow further, in the process driving many farmers, who were under immense financial strain before the drought, off the land. Some observers welcome this, saying it is time the state started encouraging farmers in high-risk areas to face the consequences. They argue that these farmers should be forced to take out more crop insurance, weighing this cost against the possibility of a premium crop. Such farmers should not be able to rely on automatic state aid when the elements turn against them.</p>

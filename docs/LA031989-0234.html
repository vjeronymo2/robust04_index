			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: DRAIN PLAN ADVANCES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which agreed to a $35-million  settlement to Big Rock Mesa homeowners in January, has tentatively approved an  elaborate storm drain project designed to prevent a repeat of the landslide  that damaged or destroyed 250 houses in 1983.  </P> <P> The board's approval of the environmental study for the storm drain project  prompted an angry reaction from homeowners in the exclusive Malibu community  who objected to paying for a project with no cost estimate.  </P> <P> Ken Chiate, attorney for the homeowners in the recently settled lawsuit against  the county and a Big Rock resident himself, said: "We don't know if it will  cost $1,000 per home or $50,000."

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Bosnian Serbs again talk peace The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday signalled he was ready to rejoin international talks to end the war in Bosnia. Mr Karadzic 'welcomed the new interpretation' of the five-nation contact group plan, whereby further work on the map is possible. In another placatory gesture Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday gave the go-ahead for the despatch of an emergency relief convoy to desperate Moslems in Bihac, the UN safe area, for the first time in two months. The UN yesterday was putting the finishing touches on a plan to evacuate up to one-third of the 1,200 UN soldiers billeted in the north-western Moslem enclave. Meanwhile, the German government yesterday postponed making any decision on providing Nato with Tornado fighter bombers for use over Bosnia because the western alliance had not formally requested the aircraft, Mr Friedrich Bohl, a chancellery minister said. However, western diplomats said Bonn declined to make any decision because the circumstances, scope, and objectives of providing the Tornados was unclear.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Welsh export growth slows THE GROWTH in Welsh exports has slowed sharply, the latest quarterly survey by the Wales Chamber of Commerce showed yesterday. The number of manufacturers showing an increase in export sales dropped from 42 per cent in the previous quarter to 32 per cent, while the number seeing a decline increased from 19 per cent to 27 per cent. The service sector reported a similar reversal.

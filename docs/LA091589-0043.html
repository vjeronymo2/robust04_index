			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHRISTMAS TREE' LEGISLATION APPROVED  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders have agreed to "Christmas tree"  legislation loaded with $48.2 million for 115 pet projects, ranging from a Los  Angeles area Latino history museum to a Huntington Beach Pier restoration and  parkland acquisition in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The proposal is the product of two months of negotiations between Democratic  and Republican leaders and the governor's staff. It was amended into a bill on  the Assembly floor Thursday night after similar amendments were tucked into  another bill on the Senate floor Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, confirmed Thursday that "there is  a basic agreement between the governor's office and the legislative leadership"  to set aside funds for the projects, many of which Deukmejian had vetoed from  the state budget in July.  </P> <P> In his budget veto message, the governor complained that many of the projects  "were inserted into the budget at the last minute and hadn't been reviewed by  the state Department of Parks and Recreation."  </P> <P> Brett said the review is now taking place and cautioned that some of the  projects could still be deleted from the proposal, which is expected to be  acted upon before the Legislature adjourns for the year tonight.  </P> <P> In recent years, it has become a tradition of sorts for similar "pork-barrel"  legislation to be cobbled together in the final weeks of the session. Such  bills allow the state's 120 lawmakers to obtain specific projects for their  constituents back home.  </P> <P> "This has something for all our political districts," Sen. James Nielsen  (R-Rohnert Park) told his colleagues before the Senate vote.  </P> <P> Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who inserted the amendments in the Senate,  said the goal of the negotiators was "to do something reasonable" and to  partially restore Deukmejian's budget cuts.  </P> <P> The $48.2 million was split four ways among the Democratic and Republican  caucuses of each house, according to legislative staffers close to the  negotiations. The funds are from a variety of sources, including the new  Proposition 99 cigarette tax revenues, highway funds, the Proposition 70 park  bond issue of 1988 and park bonds from earlier years.  </P> <P> One potentially controversial provision in the bill amended in the Senate  addresses the dispute over how to preserve the rare spotted owl and other  wildlife without putting loggers out of business. The proposal provides about  $400,000 for a task force to study the impact of cutting timber on the habitat  of wildlife, including the spotted owl.  </P> <P> Supporters anticipate that the funds will be repaid, partly by timber  companies, which will use the data to develop plans for logging operations.  </P> <P> Among the big winners are three museum projects.  </P> <P> The proposal earmarks $300,000 in seed money for a proposed Latino History  Museum, which would serve as a showcase for the history, culture and  contributions of Latinos in California. A spokesman for Assemblyman Charles  Calderon (D-Whittier), who has been pushing for the museum, said the funds will  go to a nonprofit group seeking to establish the facility in the Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> The legislation also sets aside $200,000 for a Northern California  Afro-American Museum and $1 million for an agriculture museum at Cal State  Fresno. Another $1.1 million is earmarked for preliminary plans for the  California Citrus State Historic Park in the Riverside area.  </P> <P> The lion's share of the money in the legislation is for public works projects,  including grants to cities for parks.  </P> <P> The proposal also boosts efforts to repair piers, with $1 million going to the  Ventura Beach Pier, $500,000 for reconstruction of the Manhattan Beach Pier and  $1.5 million for the Huntington Beach Pier.  </P> <P> Among other items in the proposal are:  </P> <P> * $1.7 million for parkland acquisition for Malibu State Park.  </P> <P> * $1.7 million for a variety of Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy open-space  acquisitions.  </P> <P> * $2.7 million to buy land for an entrance way at San Diego's Old Town State  Historic Park.  </P></p>

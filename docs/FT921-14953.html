			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / EC seeks better deal at Gatt trade talks in Geneva THE EUROPEAN Community will seek 'substantial improvements and essential modifications' in the draft conclusions to the Uruguay Round of international trade talks at a key meeting in Geneva today, after EC ministers rejected plans to limit food subsidies. Following a seven-hour meeting at the weekend, EC trade and farm ministers agreed that the draft put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), was a 'reference document for the final phase of negotiations', now due to conclude by Easter. Rather than single out the 18-month-old farm subsidy impasse, the ministers reiterated the 'general considerations' they agreed on December 23. But they said that 'insofar as the 'Dunkel paper' calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy, the paper is not acceptable and therefore has to be modified'. At the meeting Germany and Britain sought to gain more enthusiastic support for the trade liberalisation proposals. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, had said on Friday that the Dunkel paper 'has to be the basis for an agreement'. Britain had wanted 'a crisp and clear decision instructing the Commission to proceed on the basis that Dunkel is a good starting point', according to a senior UK diplomat. Yet these two countries, backed by the Dutch and Danes, rejected Gatt plans to limit the volume of subsidised food exports, as well as the amount by which they are subsidised. France, the EC's main agricultural exporter - which had been nearly isolated within the 12 before the Gatt paper reopened the subsidy classification dispute - found itself at the head of a majority and sought to press home its advantage. A re-classification of the direct payments paid by the EC in compensation to farmers for big price cuts is still 'among the most important changes' the Community will seek, according to Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade minister of Portugal, the current EC president. The Gatt paper categorises this key point of EC farm reform as a production support, and therefore not eligible for the so-called 'green box' in which certain subsidies would be sanctioned as they did not distort trade. Senior Commission officials, however, said the potential disaster of being handed individual 'shopping lists' of demands for the Geneva meeting had been averted, although the final communique underlined the need for satisfactory agreements on market access and services. One official said US problems with the draft in areas such as textiles 'means we are no longer the only demandeur' in seeking to renegotiate aspects of it. According to one Commission official, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, is likely to restart talks soon on the farm chapter with Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, possibly on Thursday.

In  the course of an interview for our reporter, His Excellency  confirmed that the rebel movement had detained five UN employees  of Operation Lifeline in the Upper Nile area, saying that the  rebel movement habitually violated its covenants and agreements.  He said detaining UN employees while they were doing their  humanitarian work was aggressive and barbarous. His Excellency  condemned the movement for releasing the British UN employee and  transporting him to Nairobi through the United Nations without  saying what had happened to the remaining employees who are  Sudanese.</p>

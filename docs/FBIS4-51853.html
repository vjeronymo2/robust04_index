			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Arms Buildup Maneuvers Aimed at an </F> Northward Invasion"]    [Text] The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor, who is maneuvering,  together with foreign forces, to inflict by any means [kioi]  nuclear disasters on the heads of the nation has recently been  running amok to introduce numerous modern weapons from the  United States.    At the talks held between U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry,  who visited Seoul not long ago, and the puppet military leaders,  the issue of purchasing U.S. military equipment was emphasized,  and, in particular, the South Korean puppets begged the United  States to deploy ultramodern military equipment at an early  date. This is a well-known fact to the world.    The Kim Yong-sam ring, the U.S. war servant who dons a  civilian cloak, has recently been doing the dirtiest and most  vicious acts, in an indiscreet way, to ignite the fuse of war  aimed at annihilating [myolsal] its compatriots, talking about  the introduction of Patriot missiles, artillery pieces, and  tanks and the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise.    As it has also been reported recently, the Kim Yong-sam  nation- selling, treacherous clique has agreed with the United  States to purchase more ultramodern weapons, including Apache  assault helicopters and anti-tank missiles which it has already  introduced from the United States. In this connection, the  puppets will soon begin to purchase weapons. If such weapons are  introduced into South Korea, the puppet Army's arms buildup  plan, which is now being materialized, will reportedly be  finalized ahead of schedule.    This is an extremely dangerous military act. As is known,  the United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique have not  long ago introduced Patriot missiles--weapons of mass  destruction--and deployed them in a central area of the  frontline.    What is ridiculous is the fact that the U.S. imperialists  and  the South Korean warlovers are babbling that the deployment of  Patriot missiles is for shoring up anti-air defense capability  and this serves as an effective defense means against someone's  surprise attack. But, this is nothing but a poor excuse aimed at  covering up their aggressive attempt.    According to what they have owned up themselves, the  missiles, which have been deployed in South Korea recently, are  the ones for which the Patriot missiles--used during the last  Persian Gulf war-- have been improved and their capacity has  been upgraded to a higher level. The Patriot missiles are not  interceptor missiles used simply for defense, but ultramodern  war means which can be used also as attack weapons aimed at  striking the other side.    There is no need for a long-winded explanation as to the  fact  that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  trying to attack us with the Patriot missiles, while igniting  the fuse of war. Not satisfied with the introduction and  deployment of lethal equipment, including Patriot missiles and  Apache assault helicopters, in the areas of the Military  Demarcation Line, they are trying to introduce more ultramodern  war means. This suggests that the maneuvers of provoking a  northward war of aggression by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique are reaching an extreme.    The Kim Yong-sam ring has unilaterally ruptured the hard-won  contacts of working-level delegates for the preparation of  exchange of North-South special envoys. Following this, it is  openly inciting a war fever while spreading a rumor of someone's  provocation of a southward invasion. In the meantime, it has  made public even the plan for a northward war of invasion called  "New Operational Plan 5027," which it has thus far kept as a  secret, and it is introducing U.S.-made lethal weapons on a  large scale into South Korea. This can never be overlooked.    As long as the traitor like the nation-seller Kim Yong-sam  remains in power in South Korea, it is now clear to everyone  that disasters of a nuclear war cannot be avoided.    History has shown how miserable the end of traitors running  counter to the current of the times has been.    If the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  should ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula by all means  [kutnae], turning their faces away from the aspirations of the  times and the demands of the nation and continuing to build up  aggressive armed forces, the provokers will surely be burned to  death by the fire they have ignited.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Interior Minister Mauri Pekkarinen,  Finland's EU [European Union] negotiation result is getting  worse and worse while the contents are becoming more exact.  According to Pekkarinen, who spoke in Marttila, the result is  clearly worse than expected both in regional policy and in the  food industry. According to Pekkarinen, membership of the EU  would create extra costs of nearly 10 billion Finnish markkas  for next year's state budget. According to him, what is now  fundamental is which national measures are to be taken.  According to the minister of the interior, the national  referendum should be arranged only after the Swedish national  referendum.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> 'Independence' Goes to Court: The battle over competing productions of Lee  Blessing's "Independence" will go to Los Angeles County Superior Court today.  An attorney for the producers of the authorized Burbank Theatre Guild  production, scheduled to open Friday, will ask for a temporary restraining  order against the Gnu Theatre production, scheduled to open Thursday without  the rights to the play. Gnu artistic director Jeff Seymour rejected a proposal  by the Burbank producers to delay his production three weeks in exchange for  staying out of court. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

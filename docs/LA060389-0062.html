			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALLEGED 'SKINHEADS' DENIED LOWER BAIL  </P> <P> A court commissioner Friday refused to reduce the $50,000 bail set for each of  four reputed neo-Nazi "skinheads" charged with attacking a Middle Eastern  couple in the mistaken belief that they were Jewish.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys argued that the bail was excessive, but Pomona Municipal  Court Commissioner Joel Hoffman disagreed. The lawyers told the judge that  their clients had strong community ties, little or no prior criminal records  and were not likely to flee prosecution.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Hyatt Seligman argued that, because the defendants  apparently "prey on anyone different from them, they represent a grave danger  to the community."  </P> <P> The commissioner ordered Scott R. Wilson, 28, of West Covina; Timothy Robert  Zaal, 25, of Glendora; William Killackey, 21, of Yorba Linda, and his sister,  Amy Killackey, 19, of West Covina, to remain in custody in lieu of $50,000 bail  each.  </P> <P> The four face charges in connection with the alleged attack and beating of a  Middle Eastern couple in a La Verne grocery store parking lot May 28.  </P></p>

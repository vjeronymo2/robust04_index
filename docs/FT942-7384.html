			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / German retail revival halts: Poor April figures end consumer spending surge It was good while it lasted, but the unexpected surge in west German consumer spending which gave the economy a forceful boost in the first quarter came to a sudden stop last month. The HDE retailers' association yesterday tempered a report of a real 2 per cent rise in sales during March with a warning that 'deep red' results for April - not yet ready for release - would squash any hopes that springtime had arrived in the shops sector. Department stores have calculated that real sales tumbled 12 per cent last month. The respected Ifo economics institute reported on Tuesday that its survey of expectations showed a sharp change of mood among retailers in April after several months of rising optimism. Order plans were being revised downwards as prospects for the next six months dimmed and unsold stocks mounted. On the same day, the federal authorities announced that new road vehicle registrations in April crashed 24 per cent below March levels and were 16 per cent lower than in the same month last year after three months of growth. The effects of the winter buying spree are expected significantly to bolster official first-quarter growth figures for west Germany, due in the next two weeks. In the interim, the Berlin-based DIW institute this week issued an estimate that gross domestic product rose 1.9 per cent in the year to the end of March. The forecast is only marginally higher than that of most private economists. But DIW's analysis that domestic factors alone  - including heavy private spending - were responsible for the growth is at odds with the more general view that increasing exports are pulling the economy out of recession. Although DIW has developed a reputation for its individualistic views - improving foreign trade remains the main hope of recovery in most analysts' eyes - it was not alone in being caught off guard by the early surge in private demand. The effects on economic performance will provide unexpected and welcome underpinning for the government's forecast of 1.5 per cent growth for the full year which has lately won increasing support from initially sceptical independent economists. However, events have not gone down so well in the Bundesbank. The monetary disciplinarians in Frankfurt have been displeased by the sight of people spending so freely while the economy - by their reckoning - has a long way to go to overcome its structural problems. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank council, warned yesterday that the vaunted 'special factors' were not the only explanation for continuing rapid growth in money supply. Potential inflation was lurking behind the distortions, he said, in an apparent reference to continued heavy bank lending. 'It is reasonable to assume that a significant amount of spending has been fuelled by borrowing,' says Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. Saving has also dwindled. According to DIW, spending on private consumption in the first quarter rose twice as fast as disposable incomes. Mr Reid estimates the average proportion of disposable income saved fell from 13.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1993 to 11.5 per cent in the first three months of this year.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Lloyd's faces claim on Jackson tour Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, is facing a Dollars 20m claim arising from the cancellation of pop star Michael Jackson's world tour, after the singer admitted an addiction to painkillers and was accused of child sex abuse. The claim is from the tour's promoters for loss of profits, but further claims may come from Jackson himself - for loss of earnings - and from tour sponsor PepsiCo, the US soft drinks manufacturer.</p>

In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Tuesday, she said: As a  sign of goodwill, we gave Egypt a map with details of the huge  resources that are hidden under the Sinai sands, but we found  out that Egypt has a similar map and knows everything about the  Sinai's resources.    She expressed pleasure at the telephone links between Israel  and all the Arab countries and noted that any citizen in any  Arab country can talk directly to anyone in Israel.    On the failure of starting the planned Israeli withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho, she said: We are actually ready to  implement our obligations in the Gaza-Jericho Accord and for the  Palestinians to begin to handle their affairs in the self-rule  areas by themselves. But she noted differences in views on this  issue between the government, which wants peace, and others who  do not want peace, as she put it.    She said she accepts giving up all the territories occupied  after the 1967 war and that the Palestinians have the right to  establish their state in the West Bank and Gaza. However, she  remarked that this is not the government's view.    Replying to a question on reports that Israel and Jordan  have  reached an unannounced peace agreement, she said that an  agreement in principle has actually been reached with Jordan and  that King Husayn is awaiting developments in the negotiations  with Syria before announcing the agreement.    The Israeli minister said negotiations with Syria will begin  very soon. She affirmed Israel's readiness to give up the Golan  if President Hafiz al-Asad is willing to establish a genuine  peace.</p>

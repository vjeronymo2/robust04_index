			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: The double life of Will Shakespeare - Who was the Bard? SHAKESPEARE: A DRAMATIC LIFE by Stanley Wells Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 403 pages THE SHAKESPEARE CONSPIRACY by Graham Philips &amp; Martin Keatman Century Pounds 15.99, 230 pages Was Shakespeare a government spy? Certainly he seemed to know something about surveillance on the evidence of Hamlet. The audience is not only shown two alleged students, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, as Claudius's spies, but also sees Polonius sending agents to Paris to spy on his son. Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman in The Shakespeare Conspiracy argue that the playwright, born on April 23, 430 years ago, was part of an Elizabethan and Jacobean spy network. They explore the curious double life of William Shakespeare Esquire of Stratford, land-owner and grain-dealer, and Will Shakespeare of Blackfriars, the writer. Their conclusions will raise eminent hackles in places like the Shakespeare Institute but the whole thing makes an exciting bedtime read, an Elizabethan gumshoe fantasy, fleshed out with much authentic period detail, which kept me eagerly turning the pages in spite of the writers' tedious habit of saying everything twice over. The point of entry into their argument is that none of Shakespeare's Stratford contemporaries realised that he was a writer. To them he was a local business man. A 17th century engraving of the monument beside the tomb of Shakespeare in Stratford's Holy Trinity Church shows a mercenary looking gentleman with a sack of grain. There is no quill pen or writing material visible - as in the monument we know. But there is the Latin inscription comparing him to Nestor, Socrates and Virgil. Phillips and Martin have a hard time explaining that away. More plausibly they argue that by the end of his life Shakespeare was severely disabled. They believe Shakespeare kept his writing career secret because it was a cover for his spy work. Marlowe was a spy, so why not Shakespeare? The trouble is you can argue the toss from the given data that Shakespeare in his other career was in almost any profession you like, and get away with it. Surely the only thing that greatly matters now is that he  -whoever 'he' was - wrote the plays. We know many facts about the life of Shakespeare but, as Stanley Wells, director of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, says in his new book, 'what we know includes very little of what we should like to know'. We know nothing of his private life, nor do we know how an obscure provincial teenager, with a background in the glove and wool business, got from Statford-upon-Avon to London to become the famous actor-director-poet-playwright. Wells is not in the business of speculating. He does not mention AE Honigmann's view - in Shakespeare: the lost years (Manchester, 1985) - that the transition was via the Catholic Hoghton family at their stately home in Lancashire, where one Will Shakeshafte was engaged for a time as a tutor and player. Wells, a sound, sensitive Shakespeare scholar, co-edited The Complete Works in 1986 for the Oxford Press. The volume caused a storm in the Shakespeare teacup by its tinkerings with the texts; for example, putting back Sir John Oldfield's name - the original of the fat knight - for that of Sir John Falstaff. This book is likely to prove less controversial and more rewarding. Wells begins, asking 'Who is Shakespeare?', with the bare biographical bones. They are the evidence for Shakespeare's marriage by special licence at 18, to Anne Hathaway, of nearby Shottery, aged 26. Anne gave birth to a child, Susanna, after six months of wedlock. Two years later came the birth of the Shakespeare twins Judith and Hamnet, girl and boy, baptised in 1585. Hamnet died aged 11 in 1596. Having lost a son called Hamnet, Shakespeare wrote a play about a man called Hamlet who lost his father. A section follows on the extent of Shakespeare's reading. Even here we are not on completely firm ground. It cannot even be proved that Shakespeare attended Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School. Wells, like most commentators, assumes he did. If a Shakespeare library were to be restricted to one essential work of reference it would have to be Geoffrey Bullough's edition of the Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (1957-75); but that is a hefty, expensive eight volumes and difficult to acquire (let us hope they may come up soon on a CD-Rom). Meanwhile Wells provides a useful overview of Shakespeare's bookish knowledge. Anyone who buys Stanley Wells' book on the strength of the sub-title, 'A Dramatic Life', is likely to be disappointed. After a useful survey of the theatre at this time, all the rest is a critical commentary on the plays and poems codified by place-names. One typically over-loaded chapter is headed 'Comedies of Verona, Padua, Ephesus, France and Athens'. But it is a refreshing change from normal scholarly practise to discover Wells citing individual performances by the RSC and other companies in support of his perceptions. Should children be made to read at least one Shakespeare play while they are at school? From 1992 Shakespeare became a compulsory part of the National Curriculum but there are some teachers who resist the requirement. The Arts Advisory Group of the Royal Society of Arts, chaired by Andrew Fairbairn, set out to investigate the matter. It took a wide variety of schools in Leicestershire as sample. The results, given in Shakespeare in Schools Project 1992-94 (RSA Pounds 5.00, 8 John Adam Street, London, WC2N 6EZ), are encouraging. The report concludes that Shakespeare can be made accessible to children regardless of their ability and that to study him 'can be an enriching experience for all pupils aged 5-18 years'. It is good to have that obvious fact spelt out at last with many appreciative comments from the children.</p>

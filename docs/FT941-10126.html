			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / General Motors returns to profit in North America General Motors' core North American automotive business returned to profit in the final months of last year, producing its first quarterly after-tax profit for four years. The Dollars 427m (Pounds 292m) net income in North America, with a solid performance in Europe in the face of a weak car market, helped the US's biggest car manufacturer to match the most optimistic stock market expectations. It reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 1.2bn, or Dollars 1.28 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 652m or Dollars 1.25 a share in the comparable period a year before. GM continued to predict a return to net profits for this year as a whole in its North American operations, although it said the need to adapt manufacturing facilities for new models would lead to the loss of some production capacity during the year. GM's net income for 1993 as a whole was Dollars 2.5bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 2.7bn for 1992. Sales increased to Dollars 125bn from Dollars 119bn and gross profit margin to 15 per cent from 11.1 per cent. The improvement stemmed from a mix of cost-cutting and higher vehicle sales. Much of the benefit came from closing plants and lower materials costs, said Mr Rick Wagoner, chief financial officer. GM's results are comparable with those of its big US rivals, Chrysler and Ford, both of which have also reported a marked improvement in 1993 as the US market has expanded. The car companies have noted, though, that they need to generate enough cash while the market is strong to strengthen their balance sheets before the next cyclical downturn. With an unfunded pension liability of Dollars 22.3bn at the end of 1993 (up from Dollars 14bn a year before), GM has more ground to make up in that regard than the others. Productivity gains had reduced the time it took to manufacture each vehicle by more than 10 per cent last year, the company said. It added that further double-digit gains would need to be made if the company were to rebuild its finances. GM's share of total vehicle sales in the US fell slightly to 33.2 per cent last year as it dropped less profitable sales to car rental companies. However, its vehicle sales in North America were up 6.6 per cent from the year before. The rise more than offset a 7.9 per cent decline in sales overseas as the European car market weakened, and there was an increase of 1.3 per cent in the number of cars sold worldwide to 7.9m. After-tax profits in Europe last year fell to Dollars 605m from Dollars 1.3bn the year before, holding down GM's overseas profits to Dollars 1.2bn, compared with Dollars 1.5bn the year before. GM's shares fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on profit-taking, much as those of the other big US carmakers. Europe's car sales end year-long decline, Page 3 World stocks, Page 37</p>

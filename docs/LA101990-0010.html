			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> GLENN NOT EXPECTED TO PLAY SUNDAY  </P> <P> Starting free safety Vencie Glenn did not participate in practice Thursday, and  Coach Dan Henning said he does not expect him to play on Sunday against the  Raiders.  </P> <P> Glenn pulled a hamstring in last week's 39-3 victory over the New York Jets.  </P> <P> "Yes, I'll play Sunday," Glenn said, and then he jumped into the air to  demonstrate how healthy he feels. "See?"  </P> <P> The Chargers continue to list Glenn, tight end Arthur Cox (large toe),  cornerback Donald Frank (fingers), guard David Richards (large toe) and  cornerback Sam Seale (fingers) as questionable.  </P> <P> With the exception of Glenn, the other players all practiced.  </P> <P> The Raiders downgraded defensive end Mike Wise from probable to questionable  with an ankle injury, and continued to list linebacker Art Jimerson (neck) as  doubtful, and running back Greg Bell (ankle) as questionable.  </P> <P> Henning, while aware of strained feelings between Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers'  former director of football operations, and the media corps, said with tongue  planted firmly in cheek: "Just don't be calling Ort and telling him what we're  doing now."  </P> <P> "I couldn't resist that," Henning said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Ortmayer is now working as special teams coach for the Raiders.  </P> <P> Kicker John Carney went to work Thursday inside San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium  in preparation for the Raiders.  </P> <P> "They have new sod on the infield, and some of our return guys haven't had a  chance to work in the stadium," Carney said. "This is our home stadium, so it  makes sense to know it, and use it as an advantage."  </P> <P> Linebacker Cedric Figaro aggravated a hip injury in practice when he collided  with linebacker Gary Plummer. Plummer, however, was working at fullback at the  time, and was assigned blocking duties on Figaro.  </P> <P> "When you hit a running back, at least they fall down," Figaro said.  </P> <P> Free agent linebacker Richard Brown, who played collegiately at San Diego  State, has been overwhelmed by his selection as team captain for the special  teams.  </P> <P> "I'm real honored and surprised," Brown said. "I didn't know these guys cared  about me that much. I didn't know they acknowledged my performance out there as  a special teams player. I'm real happy; I feel like I'm at home now."  </P> <P> Tackle Broderick Thompson and safety Martin Bayless will also serve as team  captains this season based on a vote of teammates. T.J.

Streets  and main highways of the city were deserted by its inhabitants  who respected the government instructions. The curfew decreed  yesterday evening is still in force from 1800 to 0600 and the  land borders remain closed. The operation carried out by  unidentified elements was preceded by an attempted attack on  Head of State General Gnassingbe Eyadema.</p>

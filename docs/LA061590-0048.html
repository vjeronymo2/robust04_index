			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN DEFENDS BUILDUP OF PRISON SYSTEM  </P> <P> Standing outside the state's newest penitentiary, Gov. George Deukmejian on  Thursday defended his unprecedented prison building program, saying  Californians are safer today than they were a decade ago because he has doubled  the size of the state prison system.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, speaking at the dedication of Pelican Bay State Prison on the north  coast near Crescent City, also criticized Los Angeles-area officials for  seeking to block the construction of lock-ups planned for downtown Los Angeles  and Lancaster.  </P> <P> Officials here in Del Norte County, he noted, requested that a prison be built  in their community because the sagging timber and fishing industries had left  the local economy in shambles. But 50% of the inmates currently housed at the  new facility come from Los Angeles County, which has no state prison,  Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles, rather than throwing up barriers to us, should be cooperative in  supporting our effort," Deukmejian told reporters after the ceremony.  </P> <P> In his speech, Deukmejian mocked those who have suggested that the state should  seek less costly, and less restrictive, alternatives to prison. He said that  approach was tried in the 1960s and 1970s but failed.  </P> <P> "While we were trying to 'understand' these criminals, California's crime rate  soared,"he said. "The number of major crimes quadrupled. By 1980, one in every  25 Californians was robbed or beaten, raped or murdered, their homes  burglarized or their car stolen."  </P> <P> During his term, Deukmejian has presided over the construction of 10 new prison  projects, and four more lock-ups are under construction. The number of prison  beds has climbed from about 24,000 when Deukmejian took office to nearly 51,000  today.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said it was "no coincidence" that during his tenure the state's  violent crime rate dropped and cited a decline between 20% and 35% in various  types in the last decade.  </P> <P> "The message has been clear," he said. "Commit these crimes and you will go to  prison."  </P> <P> Deukmejian also took the opportunity to fire the first salvo in a fight he will  carry into the November elections, making a pitch for a proposed amendment to  the state Constitution that would allow the state to force prison inmates to  work to help pay for their keep and pay restitution to their victims.  </P> <P> The Republican chief executive used the initiative process to qualify the  measure for the ballot after the Democratic-controlled Legislature killed a  more modest compromise proposal last year.  </P> <P> Labor leaders have complained that the proposal would exploit prisoners and  deprive law-abiding citizens of jobs. But Deukmejian said the impact on the  private labor market would be minuscule. He said that if half of the 92,000  inmates now imprisoned got jobs under the program, they would represent less  than one-half of 1% of the state's total work force.  </P> <P> "It is not going to have any significant impact at all on the work force,"  Deukmejiansaid.  </P></p>

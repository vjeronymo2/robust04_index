			<p>BFN     [Text] St. Petersburg, June 8, RIA -- The latest session of  the Council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly started with  the raising of the flag of a new, 10th assembly member --  Moldova.    The participants in the session extensively discuss the  question of the assembly's peace-making efforts. Information on  this issue has been provided by the head of the assembly's  peace-keeping group, the speaker of the parliament of Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan], Medetkan Sheremkulov. The delegates have also  been briefed by the Russian president's special envoy for  Nagorno-Karabakh, Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov.  According to him, "peace that has been achieved is still very  fragile and maximalism in the settlement of this 6- year-old  conflict is hardly a good idea."    It is expected that in the course of the day the parliament  leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan will discuss the prospects for  the settlement of the Karabakh conflict.</p>

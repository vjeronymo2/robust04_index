			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Report highlights inequalities in education The US federal government needs to take on more of a role in compelling individual states to iron out the inequalities in the US education system, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its annual survey of the country's economy. Primary and secondary education are 'mediocre at best', the report says, and inadequate funding for education in economically deprived areas has contributed to social problems requiring costly intervention in areas such as welfare and law enforcement. 'The states have imposed significant costs on society through their decades-long neglect of the education of children from less-advantaged communities. US society now finds itself in a situation where whole communities experience massive educational failure at a time when the economic penalties for such failure are growing,' the OECD says. International comparisons show US school students' performance is generally lower than other countries, especially in mathematics, where the average US student at 13 lags an average French student of the same age by about 18 months of schooling. But the disparities within the US are much wider than the gaps between the US and other countries. Children in Iowa and North Dakota rank second and third to Taiwan in international comparisons of mathematics skills, with Minnesota, Maine and New Hampshire not far behind. But Mississippi ranks at the bottom of the OECD's listings, behind Jordan; and Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas fared only a little better. The OECD suggests the US is looking in the right direction with recent attempts to define national educational standards in the Goals 2000 programme first agreed between the state governors and former President George Bush and turned into legislation under President Bill Clinton. Such standards are important, although 'little can be taken for granted in the debate on curriculum content in the United States', the OECD says, noting in a quizzical footnote the continued efforts of Christian fundamentalists to block the teaching of the theory of human evolution. It is, however, sceptical of how good the results will be. Goal 5, the OECD notes, calls for US students to be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement by the year 2000 - which would require them to make up a lag equivalent to two years of schooling in just six years. More particularly, the OECD notes that there will be virtually no change in the amount of money spent on education under the Goals 2000 law, and little difference in its targeting.</p>

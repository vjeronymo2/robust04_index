			<p>BFN     [Text] The first round of Russian-Ukrainian talks on the  Black Sea Fleet [BSF] issue on the level of defense ministers  was held in the fleet headquarters in Sevastopol Thursday [21  April].    The Black Sea Fleet press office told INTERFAX that the two  sides discussed the future locations of the Russian Black Sea  Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, proportions for the fleet's  division and social guarantees for the two countries' navy  servicemen.    The two sides agreed that the issue should be solved in a  civilized political way taking into account good-neighborly  relations between Russia and Ukraine and the existing realities.    The two delegations recognized the fact that the Black Sea  Fleet should not be a cause of discord between friendly states.    At the same time, the press office said that Ukraine's  stance  at the talks did not correspond to the constructive spirit which  was characteristic of the Russian delegation's approach.    "An impression is being created that the representatives of  the Ukrainian navy are trying to denounce the Moscow agreement  of 15 April," the press office pointed out.    "The Ukrainian side is allowing itself dual interpretation  of  the Moscow agreement on separate locations for the two fleets  and the proportions of its division. Ukraine still insists on  placing the main bases of both fleets in Sevastopol, which runs  counter not only to logic but also to the will of the two  presidents and the latest decisions by the Sevastopol city  council," said the press office.    "Nevertheless, the Russian delegation hopes for a triumph of  common sense over political ambitions and is ready for further  negotiations. Russia does not take responsibility for a  possible disruption in the constructive dialog," the press  office said.</p>

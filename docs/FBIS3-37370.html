			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "`Russia's Choice' Holds </F> Secret Council on the Banks of the Pakhra"]    [Text] Around 100 representatives of "Russia's Choice"  spent Saturday and Sunday in Krasnaya Pakhra, where, hidden from  the prying eyes of the press, they immediately got down to  building the party they had announced the day before.    The foundation of this new party edifice, which is being  erected in accordance with a radical plan, was laid by a program  statement declaring that the "corrupt bureaucracy is  increasingly taking the center stage of political life, together  with right- and left-wing radical (fascist and communist)  antireformist forces." According to the authors of the  statement, the "executive branch, instead of countering  reaction, is getting further and further away from the course of  reforms, accompanying the revision of their basic principles  with declarations of loyalty to them." Therefore, the "Russia's  Choice" party (the name is still being worked on) intends to  unite "all those for whom freedom, human dignity, and the  prosperity of the Fatherland and its citizens are not empty  words and who are prepared inside and outside parliament, in  individual and mass actions, to act as guarantors of reforms,  guarantors of Russia's renewal."    Predictably, the ideological declaration did not meet with  any objections on the part of those attending the political  weekend. After all, the Russian radical democrats exchange oaths  of loyalty to liberalism as regularly as they do vehemently,  which does not prevent them in any way from multiplying the  splits and discord in their ranks and piling up mutual  grievances and criticism. But what guarantees are there that  the new political alliance of radical reformers will be viable  and effective?    "Russian democracy is terrible at times of victory," Yegor  Gaydar, the chief instigator of the future party, said in an  exclusive interview for IZVESTIYA (the conversation took place  in a luxury suite in the leisure complex near Moscow where the  conference participants spent the two days). "When they win the  democrats immediately start having deep and meaningful  discussions, deciding who should do what, and arguing over  trivia. But at moments of danger Russian democracy is capable  of united, organized action. We are going through just such a  time at the moment."    "What was the main source of disagreement during the two-day  talks?"    "Organizational matters, as ever. The principle underlying  the structure of the party. The founder-membership. The norms  of representation on leading bodies."    One of the cofounders of the party, together with "Russia's  Choice," is the "Democratic Russia" movement. Its regional  structures, amorphous though they may be at present, will find a  new use. But an argument has already developed between the  leaders of the future alliance in the capital and in the  provinces over the principle whereby the leasding body is to be  formed, how many seats Moscow will get and how many the  provinces will get. The allocation of party portfolios has  begun.    Yegor Gaydar's intention is that the new party should not be  a rehash of existing movements and organizations. A  fundamentally new alliance of reformists is being created. It  is clear from the program statement that it intends to pursue a  "line of constructive dialogue with the federal government and  local administrations, taking issue with them on vital matters."  It was stipulated that "if the intention to curtail the reforms  is put into practice, the party is prepared to oppose the  present cabinet." The latter statement has considerable  piquancy, given that Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who also  participated in the talks near Moscow, will be one of the  party's leaders.    Making it known that the party is not responsible for the  government's activites and their results, the conference  participants, in their program statement, skillfully delineated  their attitude toward Boris Yeltsin: "We draw a clear line  between the president and all the other structures of executive  power. `Russia's Choice' will give social and political support  to the course of reforms President Yeltsin has been conducting  since 1991. We support a president who is conducting this  course. We criticize the president insofar as he himself is  deviating from this course under pressure from various  circumstances."    Yegor Gaydar announced that the party's founding congress  will take place at the end of May at the earliest. The former  vice premier said that the delayed birth of the new political  alliance is due to a multitude of organizational problems. But  that is probably not the reason. The initiators and creators of  the party probably want the founding forum to take place against  a particular political and economic background. It is hard to  predict what this background will be like by the beginning of  the summer. The leaders of the new political alliance are  intending to bring into their ranks small and medium-size  entrepreneurs, skilled workers, and the intelligentsia and are  hoping that a wave of social discontent in the spring and the  summer will wash many more supporters to their party shore than  they have at the moment.</p>

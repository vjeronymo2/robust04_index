			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: BT tempts customers British Telecom is offering customers a new discount service. 'With 15 per cent off, our best customers now make the biggest savings' is the headline on a BT letter mailed out with the booklet 'Introducing BT PremierLine'. But, as the detailed conditions explain, the 15 per cent discount does not come off the bottom line of the telephone bill. It reduces the basic unit rate for local, long-distance and international calls dialled direct. For calls to mobiles and information or entertainment lines, the discount is 10 per cent. PremierLine costs Pounds 24 a year, which has to be paid in advance and also covers various minor extras such as 'talking points', with each Pounds 1 of the (ex-VAT) telephone bill gaining points towards gifts or air miles. All PremierLine customers start with 500 free talking points, so they could be reasonably sure of securing the minimum gift of a weed-grubber worth 510 points. PremierLine is not the only BT discount scheme. There is also Option 15, offering a 10 per cent discount for a Pounds 16 annual fee, paid quarterly. A friends and family scheme gives 5 per cent discount on calls to five selected numbers (one can be overseas) for a one-off fee of Pounds 4.99. Combined with Option 15 or PremierLine, this can raise the discount on the chosen numbers to 15 per cent or 20 per cent. Are the discounts worth it? A quick look at your last telephone bill will supply most of the answers. BT bills show a total for direct-dialled calls at the basic rate. If this is consistently at least Pounds 40 for the quarter, you could be close to break-even point for both Option 15 and PremierLine. Obviously, a 10 per cent discount on Pounds 40 covers the Pounds 4 quartely fee for Option 15. And a 15 per cent discount on basic-rate call charges of Pounds 160 for the year meets the Pounds 24 PremierLine fee. But the break-even point will be higher for people making frequent calls to mobile 'phones or other lines where the discount is lower. BT's automatic discounts begin once call charges exceed roughly Pounds 50 at the basic 4.2p per unit rate. The exact amount varies, depending on the number of days in the quarter. The next Pounds 200 worth are at 3.99p (5 per cent off), and units past Pounds 250 are at 3.86p (8 per cent off). So, the range of discounts passed up by people joining PremierLine is from zero on Pounds 50 to an average of around 6 per cent on Pounds 500 worth of calls. To get a rough idea of the real saving likely with PremierLine, knock 15 per cent off the last bill's quarterly total of direct-dialled calls at basic rate, add line rental (Pounds 20.16) and VAT. Then add Pounds 6 for a quarter of the Pounds 24 fee and compare the result with the final total from the last bill. As the table shows, real savings are likely to be about half the 15 per cent publicised rate.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      How much do you save?

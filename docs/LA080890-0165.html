			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: TRUMP'S 'CRYPTO-NAZI' CONNECTION STIRS GOSSIP  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S TALKING about Marie Brenner's interview in Vanity Fair, especially  that concerning Donald Trump's manner of having glided over his German  ancestors. (It's true that reporter James Revson laid all this out in his  Newsday column months ago, but Marie has revived it with an added dash of  spice.) To wit, that Donald appears to take aspects of his German background  seriously.  </P> <P> John Walter works for the Trump organization and when he visits Donald in his  office, Ivana told a family friend, he clicks his heels and says, "Heil  Hitler," possibly as a family joke.  </P> <P> Reporter Brenner lays out the details of a somewhat amazing story that has been  making the rounds but, to my knowledge, was never nailed down before; a story  to the effect that Trump reads from a book of Hitler's collected speeches,  having kept the work "My New Order" in a cabinet by his bed. (A copy of this is  also now in the office of Ivana's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, "as if it were a  grenade.") Brenner notes that Hitler was a master propagandist and that Trump  has followed in his footsteps, at least in this regard. She calls his habit of  exaggeration and prevarication "the big lie," and notes that if one keeps  reiterating something, then some people will finally come to believe it.  </P> <P> WHEN MARIE bearded Trump in his den on this issue, he said that it was his  friend Marty Davis of Paramount Pictures who'd given him a copy of "Mein Kampf"  and he's a Jew. Davis says he didn't give Trump "Mein Kampf," but the aforesaid  "My New Order." "I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but  I'm not Jewish."  </P> <P> Trump told Brenner, "If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I  would never read them." It is left for Brenner to ask if perhaps Ivana is  hoping to convince her friends and her lawyers that her husband "is a  crypto-Nazi."  </P> <P> Brenner describes Ivana as having become something like her husband -- "a  double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence." And she quotes  Kennedy, describing his beautiful client as suffering from the "Stockholm  syndrome" -- meaning that "she had the mentality of a captive. After a while  she couldn't fight her captor anymore and began to identify with him. Ivana is  deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to Donald."  </P> <P> ONE THING you'll be able to pick up from this magazine story is Trump's  attitude today.  </P> <P> Brenner quotes a Trump attorney as saying: "Donald's very up. This is the kind  of challenge Donald likes. It's weird. You would never know anything is wrong."  </P></p>

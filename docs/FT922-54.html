			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Transport minister triesto safeguard rail deal MR Roger Freeman, transport minister, offered last night to meet private-sector financiers personally in an effort to ensure that an innovative deal to finance new railway rolling stock did not fall through. NWS Corporate Finance - part of Bank of Scotland - has offered to provide West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority with a 21-year operating lease covering 14 Class 323 trains for the Leeds-to-Bradford railway line. The proposed Pounds 30m transaction was described by Mr Freeman last night as the first 'true' operating lease to have been written in the rail industry for 70 years. But the deal has been at risk since the government declined to meet assurances sought by NWS, formerly IBOS Finance, in order to safeguard its flow of lease payments. Concerned that government plans to denationalise British Rail might lead to the privatisation of local transport authorities, NWS asked the government either to guarantee that there would be no such change of ownership or to give it an option to demand repayment of the lease in full in advance of such a change. The government - which has come under pressure from Yorkshire MPs on both sides of the Commons - said that no change in transport authorities' status was planned, but that a guarantee would amount to an unacceptable liability. Mr Freeman stuck to his position last night, saying the government had no intention of privatising transport authorities or of changing the method of their funding. He admitted that the deal had taken 'much longer than we would have liked' to finalise. The British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill received its third reading last night with a government majority of 62 (278-216).</p>

			<p>940428 FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G blocks questions on Lloyd's Pounds 1.8bn bid Members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society were yesterday barred from asking its directors questions about LLoyds Bank's proposed Pounds 1.8bn cash bid to take over the society at its annual general meeting. The 200 members attending the society's annual meeting in Barnwood, near Gloucester, were told that it was against building societies regulations to be give additional information before all members were informed. Mr John Bays, the chairman, told members who attempted to raise questions about the Lloyds bid that the society intended to hold a special meeting in November after full details were published, at which all issues could be discussed. Mr Peter Nicholson, a member, asked Mr Andrew Longhurst, the society's chief executive, why the society could not convert to a limited company and offer members the chance of equity stakes rather than being wholly acquired. However, Mr Longhurst was advised by Mr Chris Jones, the society's secretary, not to answer the question. Mr Longhurst told the meeting that the proposals were 'not a fait accompli' and members would be able to vote freely on them.</p>

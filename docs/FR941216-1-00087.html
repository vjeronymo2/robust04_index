Additional information may be available from the procuring activity in the form of Hazardous Component Safety Data Statements (HCSDS) for intermediate materials and items. When the solicitation or contract lacks such information, it may be requested through contract channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Compatibility and hazard classification information relating to other hazardous materials, including A&amp;E, not contained within the JHCS, can be derived from references such as those cited below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Transportation, Parts 100&hyph;199. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) National Fire Protection Association, Manual 491M. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies may be obtained from the National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch Park, Attn: National Fire Codes Subscription_Service Department, Quincy, MA 02269. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Data sheets developed by the National Safety Council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Data sheets developed by the Manufacturing Chemists Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Manuals and books providing information on the properties of hazardous materials. There are a number of competent guides to the safety precautions required when handling potentially hazardous materials. These guides typically provide basic precautions, specific hazardous reactions, and industrial hygiene information. Additional guidance for industrial hygiene and industrial medicine is available from the American Council of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists and OSHA/NIOSH. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The previous guidance is applicable for storage and transportation only and is not intended for in-process applications. For in-process application, refer to Subpart F of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.48 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Storage compatibility grouping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All A&amp;E are assigned one of thirteen compatibility groups (SCG). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Storage principles. (1) The highest degree of safety in A&amp;E storage could be assured if each item or division were stored separately. However, such ideal storage is not generally feasible. A proper balance of safety and other factors frequently requires mixing of several types of ammunition and explosives in storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A&amp;E shall not be stored with dissimilar materials or items that present hazards to the munitions. Examples are mixed storage of A&amp;E with flammable or combustible materials, acids, or corrosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Different types of A&amp;E may be mixed in storage, by item and division, provided they are compatible. A&amp;E are assigned to a SCG when they can be stored together without significantly increasing either the probability of an accident or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of the effects of such an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A&amp;E should be mixed in storage only when such mixing will facilitate safe operations and promote overall storage efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) As used in these requirements, the term ``with its own means of initiation'' indicates that the ammunition has its normal initiating device assembled to it and this device is considered to present a significant risk during storage. However, the term does not apply when the initiating device is packaged in a manner that eliminates the risk of detonating the ammunition if the initiating device should accidentally function, or when fuzed end items are configured and packaged to prevent their inadvertent arming. The initiating device may even be assembled to the ammunition, provided its safety features preclude initiation or detonation of the explosives filler of the end item if the initiating device should accidentally function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Compatible ammunition and explosives. (1) Different kinds of A&amp;E within one compatibility group are compatible and may be stored together, except for some items in SCG K and L (see Appendix A to this subpart). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Ammunition and explosives in substandard or damaged packaging, in a suspect condition, or with characteristics that increase the risk in storage are not compatible with other A&amp;E and shall be stored separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Storage compatibility group. A&amp;E are assigned to one of thirteen storage compatibility groups (A through H, J, K, L, N, and S): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Group A_initiating explosives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bulk initiating explosives that have the sensitivity to heat, friction, or percussion necessary for use as initiating elements in an explosive train. Examples are wet lead azide, wet lead styphnate, wet mercury fulminate, wet tetracene, and dry PETN. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Group B. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Detonators and similar initiating devices not containing two or more independent safety features.

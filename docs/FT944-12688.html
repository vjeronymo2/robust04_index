			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Energy prices hit Oslo's surplus Norway's current account surplus for the first eight months of 1994 fell to NKr13.853bn (Pounds 1.3bn) from NKr16.757bn in the same 1993 period, according to the country's national statistics agency. The 17 per cent fall reflected a drop in the value of oil and gas exports, to NKr68.6bn from NKr70.1bn, as well as lower net exports of ships and oil platforms. Imports have also risen strongly on the back of the recovery in the Norwegian economy, which will grow by around 4 per cent this year. In August, the current account swung to a deficit of NKr570m, compared with a July surplus of NKr1.833bn. The turnaround was due to oilfield maintenance work which pushed down the value of Norway's August oil exports to NKr6.6bn from NKr8.5bn in the same 1993 period. Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm Wholesale sales in Germany in September dropped a real 1 per cent year-on-year and fell a calendar and seasonally-adjusted real 1 per cent from August.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by General Mirza Aslam Beg, former Chief of the </F> Army Staff: "Nuclear Programme and Political Ramblings"]    [Text] Our atomic programme, once again is deeply enmeshed  in rumours. The political higher-ups are incessantly issuing  statements which are only accentuating the agony of our people  and adding to their confusion. Apprehensions are mounting as  mutual accusations are clouding the reality. Besides pointing  fingers at each other, the politicians are contributing to the  image tarnishing of the Army. The severity of blames being  tossed lead to an inevitable impression as if the decision to  continue with the atomic programme or to strangulate it rests  entirely with the Army and that the politicians are utterly  helpless. The present writer is the perpetual scapegoat, and  many `wondrous' acts are being dumped into his `accomplishment  baggage,' of which he is not even aware of. "Strange are the  doings of beauty" goes an Urdu adage. The singular motive of  this drive seems to be to extricate the politicians from their  responsibility, and to insinuate as if the Army was the sole  arbiter of the decision either to pursue the atomic plan or to  nail it down. The recent verdict of the out-going caretaker  Prime Minister, Mr. Moin Qureshi, that the Army has the final  say in the political dynamics of the country is an explicit  assertion to this effect.    The present climate of stressful uncertainty with respect to  the nuclear issue is an awful load on the nerves of the nation.  It seems, therefore, necessary to lift the mask to unravel the  reality.    It must be mentioned here that it was Richard Barlow -- an  American, placed in Islamabad to monitor Pakistan's nuclear  programme, who had unequivocally asserted that Pakistan had  acquired the nuclear capability in 1987, and this very year his  `report' had come into wide circulation, but the people at the  helm of affairs in the USA did not pay any heed to it. Far from  taking notice, a process of enquiry was initiated against him.  (Reference to Seymore Hersh report entitled "On the Nuclear  Edge") Why did it so happen? The most vital reason was that at  that time, the gravest battle against the Soviet Union was being  waged in Afghanistan, and the US had put all its weight on the  scale in favour of the Mojahedin. Using Pakistan as a conduit,  it was lending all support to the Afghan freedom-fighters, and  it did not deem it expedient at that critical and delicate  moment that it should risk spoiling relations with Pakistan.  Oblivious of the restraints of principles, the Bush  administration, from 1987 to 1989, continued for three years to  certifying that Pakistan did not possess any nuclear capability.  [sentence as published] (Refer to Seymore Hersh report: "On the  Nuclear Edge.") No sooner did the Soviet forces step out of  Afghanistan in 1989, it suddenly dawned upon the US that  Pakistan had succeeded in its nuclear capability acquisition,  and Mr Richard Barlow's report was used as a testimony and  Pakistan was accused crossing the "Red Light." There was thus no  respite in the vicious propaganda onslaught against Pakistan,  and the US pressure kept on accelerating. Its military aid was  suspended, and the economic aid substantially curtailed. The  pressure tactic was employed to have Pakistan abandon its  nuclear mission so as to regress it back to a harmless threshold.    Pakistan, to tell the truth, had embarked upon all the  nuclear steps simultaneously, and these stages are no secret to  anyone. In all the reference books these are explicitly  mentioned. For the benefit of the readers, these are spelt out  as follows: -- The enrichment of the Uranium up to 95 percent  and above.    -- Preparation of the device by integrating all its  elements.    -- The laboratory test of the different elements of the  device.    -- The final test of the integrated system. This can be  accomplished either by detonation, which is termed `Hot Test' or  through a `Cold Test,' without it.    -- Developing the delivery system -- through special  aeroplane or missile technology.    As stated earlier, Pakistan had developed this capability in  1987, but the `slings' and "arrows" against it were triggered in  1990 for the ostensible reason that the Soviet forces had left  the Afghan soil. The US security scenario had metamorphosed and  Pakistan was the chosen target for the strangulation of its  `nuclear' neck.    It would be in the fitness of thing to say that the process  of freezing the first stage of atomic programme had actually  started in January 1989, i.e. after the decision taken in a  conference,co- chaired by the then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq  Khan and the then Prime Minster Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. It was  a deliberate and consensus decision, about which the Prime  Minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was fully aware of her  allegation that she was kept in the dark about the nuclear  programme contains no substance.    To set the record right,it is appropriate to state the fact  that in 1988, after Mohtarma Benazir's government had assumed  power after the elections,a meeting was held in the Presidency  during January of 1989, to deliberate on the nuclear issue. The  then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Mohtarma Bhutto the Prime  Minister - the then Chief of the Army Staff (this writer) and  three other very responsible persons had attended this meeting.  A detailed discussion took place and all the crucial aspects of  the issue were evaluated. Taking the overall situational  imperatives and the national interest into perspective, all the  members unanimously reached the assessment that Pakistan had  acquired the requisite nuclear capability, vitally needed for  its security and that it has significantly added to its  defensive strength by achieving a "credible deterrence."    After recognising this reality, a consensus based decision  was reached in which there was no overt or covert pressure from  the Army at all. In view of the global scenario,the regional  security, and the pressing needs of economic aid, it was decided  that only in the first phase, i.e., the stage of Uranium  enrichment, Pakistan should temporarily put a "restraint on its  efforts" or so to say, a "policy of restraints" was adopted. In  other words,there was to be only a lull period so far as the  first stage was concerned. The research activities however, were  to continue in all the remaining stages so that at the time of  an emergency, the nation would be able to cope up with the  situation. This decision was taken after thorough and indepth  deliberations. As the then Chief of the Army Staff, this writer  would like to remind that no pressure of any kind was exerted by  him. Whatever is now being attributed to this scribe has no  bearing on reality. In the wake of the consensus decision, there  was `No freeze' and `No capping' whatsoever.    As a result of "freezing" of phase 1 of the programme, i.e.  enrichment only up to 3 per cent, subsequently, phase 2 got  automatically frozen, because of lack of the "basic material,"  i.e., enriched weapon grade uranium. This process of "freezing"  continued during the tenure of Mian Nawaz Sharif's prime  ministership as well. Voices of "freeze" and "roll-back" are  being heard now, and the political figures have transformed this  sensitive issue into an `infantile playground,' merely for  political ends while the nation is gasping into the whirlpool of  hope and despair with dazed amazement.    The situation has now come where the US is intensifying its  pressure on Pakistan to roll back the programme. It is their  avowed demand that Pakistan should exterminate the capability  which it has acquired after years of toil and enormous  sacrifice. This was not acceptable to Pakistan. After Mohtarma  Benazir Bhutto's ouster from the government, when Mian Nawaz  Sharif was saddled into power, he also pursued the same policy,  despite the magnitude of the mounting pressure from the US. The  magnitude of the problem and the recalcitrant approach of the US  can be assessed from the fact that to cripple us militarily and  economically, the Pressler Amendment was fully imposed upon us.  The military aid was totally stopped and the economic assistance  was only negligible. This state of affairs continued till the  tenure of this writer, which expired in August 1991. Whatever  has happened since then is outside the scope of his knowledge.  The irony is that without knowing full facts, the character  assassination of the writer is being done since long and that  this is by a deliberate design. To say that the writer was  instrumental in the nuclear freezing or that it was imposed on  the government, is totally outside the pale of reality.    Based on his conscientiously determined vision, the writer  still maintains that to give up the nuclear capability would be  tantamount to committing a national suicide. To acquire this  capability is totally in congruence with our defence  requirements. The nation is unnecessarily being subjected to  doubts and apprehensions, which is not right. Without mincing  words, the writer would emphatically reassert: The atomic plan  was not frozen. OnIy the enrichment of uranium was temporaily  delayed through a well deliberated decision. If any government  has subsequently "frozen" it, this should be subjected to  enquiry by the present regime and the nation must be taken into  confidence. If at all it has really been "frozen" it is in our  supreme interest that the programme be reactivated from where it  was broken.    Pakistan is presently placed at a difficult choice point. It  can continue with the animated suspense-neither "yes" nor "no"  stand-and keep on accusing each other, while the nation remains  in a stateof perpetual quandary. The other alternative could be  to concede to the pressure and either "freeze" or "cap" our  nuclear programme and later on by rolling it back,extract, in  exchange, all the favours from the US. There is yet a third  possibility. We learn to live with the style and grace of a  sovereign nation and make no compromises on vital national  issues. This indeed is a difficult decision but to circumvent  it, in the opinion of this writer, is nothing short of high  treason.    This writer once again would like to reiterate his  submission  that the issue of "freezing" of the plan be thoroughly  investigated, mere mudslinging is no solution to the problem. To  camouflage it in the veil of "Secrecy" is no longer possible.  The nation is very impatient to know, under what compulsions was  Pakistan's atomic programme `frozen' and why is the US so  adamant to inspect our nuclear installations?    Notwithstanding the Government and the Opposition's stand on  this issue, this writer is fully convinced that the people and  those deeply interested in the security of the country, must in  unison accept the reality that our defence requirements could  only be met if we link our nuclear programme with that of India.  We must unequivocally tell the US that any unilateral or  partisan approach would not be acceptable to Pakistan.</p>

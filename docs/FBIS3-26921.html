			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F> 1627): China Has Decided That the Authorities Will Purchase  Grain to Control Grain Sources and Guarantee Stable Grain  Prices"]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--An authoritative  source here has leaked word that the central authorities have  decided that from now on grain can only be purchased by state  grain departments, that grain purchasing prices can only be  fixed by the state, and that no businessman is allowed to  purchase grain in order to guarantee that the price of grain --  a special, fundamental commodity -- will remain stable.    The authoritative source quoted the central policy  decisionmaking body as saying that the central authorities,  which have drawn a lesson from last November's sharp increase in  grain prices, maintained that the retail prices of grain can be  freed in the future. The grain sources, however, must be  controlled by the state rather than by small tradespeople and  peddlers, because China's is a big socialist market, and the  normal market order will be easily jeopardized by small  tradespeople and peddlers if they are allowed to purchase grain.    The central authorities made it clear that, in order to  carry  out the state policy for keeping grain prices stable, the state  grain departments will in the future be in charge of  policy-related grain purchases while joining businessmen in  selling grain at retail prices.    To carry out the above policy, the State Council called a  national conference on matters related to the "shopping basket"  and grain, cotton, and oil. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided  over the conference.    Premier Li Peng said at the meeting: The present situation  with agricultural production and market supply is good in  general. There have been bumper harvests for years running, and  the "shopping basket" project has achieved remarkable results.  The total supply of farm produce -- foodstuffs in particular --  which had fallen short for quite some time, is comparatively  ample now. Under such a good situation, however, fluctuations  in the prices of grain, oil, and non-staple foods were seen in  certain regions for a period following last November. The  fluctuations were caused by many factors. But the most  important factor, in my view, was that we lacked an adequate  understanding of the need to exercise macrocontrol over the  market under the new situation of lifting price controls. The  current meeting is designed to seek unity in thinking, sum up  positive and negative experiences, and find ways for our work on  the "shopping basket" project and on grain, cotton, and oil to  meet the demands of the socialist market economy.    He pointed out: China will make major strides in reform by  introducing important reform measures this year. Whether we can  smoothly carry out these major reform measures will have a  bearing on the success or failure of the reform and a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. To  carry out reform successfully, it is necessary to maintain  social stability and reassure the people. We must make great  efforts to keep prices relatively stable, especially the prices  of grain, oil, meat, vegetables, and eggs.    He continued: We must take into account the interests of  people of all social strata in deepening reform. China's reform  accords with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming  majority of the people. In the course of reform, however, it is  unlikely that each stratum or each person will gain the same  interests and same substantial profits at the same time.  Therefore, in doing our work we must take special care of the  people who are not well off for the time being, especially those  who are still leading a rather difficult life.    Li Peng said: At present, to control the farm produce  market, we should do a good job in three respects. First, we  should be careful to establish a system of reserves to regulate  the prices of staple agricultural products, including grain,  cotton, oil, meat, vegetables, and sugar; second, we should  establish a system of market risk funds for grain and non-staple  foods; and third, we should establish a system for supervising  and controlling farm produce markets and strengthen the  construction of a network providing information on farm produce.    Li Peng added: I have repeatedly stressed that governments  in various localities, especially governments of large and  medium cities, must be put in charge of the "shopping basket"  project and that a responsibility system should be introduced  under which mayors are held responsible for the project. The  mayor must regard making adequate arrangements for the people's  daily life his priority task, because this is a matter of prime  importance for maintaining overall stability. This should be  made a requirement of the mayors' responsibility system. The  mayors' performance should be appraised every year, and the  results should be reported to the relevant city people's  congresses and all citizens.</p>

Two Ghana Airways employees were slightly  injured by the demonstrators who damaged the airline's computer  before dispersing. According to a Ghana Embassy official, the  repatriation by boat of Ghanaians living in Guinea, which was  scheduled for yesterday, had to be canceled at the last minute  by the ambassador because the government had not given its  approval.</p>

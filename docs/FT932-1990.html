			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: NedCar turns in loss of Fl 243m for the year NETHERLANDS Car (NedCar), the Dutch carmaker owned jointly by Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, Volvo of Sweden and the Dutch government, suffered a net loss of Fl 243.6m (Dollars 133.9m) last year, its third year of rising losses. Last year's financial performance, burdened by restructuring costs of Fl 117m, was a further sharp deterioration from a net loss of Fl 74.1m in 1991 and Fl 76.1m in 1990. NedCar was formed in 1991 when Mitsubishi Motors acquired a one third equity stake in Volvo Car BV, which had been controlled 70/30 by Dutch state interests and Volvo respectively. The company, which makes the Volvo 400 series, was hit last year by the continuing weakness of demand in its main markets and by significant currency losses after the European exchange rate fluctuations last autumn. Car production rose last year to 94,019 from 84,507 in 1991, but output remained well below the break-even level of more than 100,000 cars a year. Turnover rose to Fl 1.98bn from Fl 1.74bn in 1991. Further losses are expected this year. Production is running at 430 a day, or 95,000 a year, but has already been hit by more than two weeks of down-days, and more short-time working is expected in the second half of the year. The NedCar workforce fell to 6,109 people at the end of 1992 from 6,521 a year earlier and is expected to fall sharply to around 4,500 by the end of 1993. Mitsubishi and Volvo are investing around Fl 3bn in NedCar for the development of a new range of cars to be launched in 1995-1996 and the doubling of capacity to 200,000 cars. The training of several hundred NedCar employees at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Japan will begin later this year.</p>

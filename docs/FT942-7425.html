			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities mixed as bond rally subsides Wall Street US stocks finished at mixed levels yesterday after a rally in the bond market lost steam in the late afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.76 higher at 3,745.17 after climbing by as much as 24 points by midday. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.61 at 454.81 on moderate NYSE volume of 280m shares. In the secondary markets, an unturn by technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq composite 6.52 higher to 731.47. Early in the session, the knock-on effect which has been sweeping through the US financial markets in recent days was working in favour of stocks. The previous day, a sharp rise in commodity prices and a softer dollar had triggered a big sell-off in bonds and a subsequent downturn in stocks. Yesterday commodity prices eased while the dollar gained ground against the yen on news that Washington and Tokyo had agreed to resume framework talks on trade. In response, the benchmark 30-year government bond was posting solid gains and stocks followed them higher. But when an afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn two-year notes proved to be a mild disappointment, the long bond slipped well below its session highs. Stocks mostly finished near their opening levels. Equity investors had a smattering of quarterly results to consider but the outcome was not uniformly favourable. On the positive side, Dell Computer posted quarterly earnings of 42 cents a share, against 25 cents a year ago, and its share price jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 29 on the news. The computer sector was generally stronger. IBM advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/4 and Storage Technology was Dollars 3 1/8 better at Dollars 32. Lotus Development led the Nasdaq technology sector, climbing Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 65 1/2 . On the negative side, Deere, the US farm machinery maker, posted record net income of Dollars 2.20 in its second quarter, against a restated Dollars 1.30 a year earlier, but the improvement failed to feed through to its share price. The stock slipped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 5/8 after an initial jump of Dollars 1 1/2 . The decline was partly because the company warned its production would likely slow in the second half. The pessimism carried over in other cyclical stocks. Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 and Alcoa lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 69 5/8 . Philip Morris gave back Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 after outperforming the market during the previous session. With a board meeting scheduled for today, the company has come under mounting pressure by institutional investors to spin off its non-tobacco businesses. In healthcare, Medical Care America jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 27 3/8 . The company, the largest operator of out-patient clinics in the US, agreed to be acquired by Columbia HCA Healthcare in a deal valued at Dollars 858m. Columbia HCA, a leading hospital group, dropped Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 . Early on, Merck improved Dollars 1 1/2 amid speculation that Lawrence Bossidy, Allied Signal's chief executive, would take over as the pharmaceutical group's chairman. Later, after Mr Bossidy issued a denial, the share price ended up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 30 7/8 . Canada Toronto's TSE 300 composite fell 11.40 to 4286.98 in volume of 44.4m. shares. Trading value declined to CDollars 523.1m from CDollars 644.5m. All but two of the 14 stock groups ended in negative territory. Golds were off 1.24 per cent, banks and industrial products fell slightly and mining and energy were flat. Consumer products rose 1.43 per cent on index. Northern Telecom fell  5/8 to 42 7/8 . Motorola's Land Mobile Products Sector extended by two years the pact under which Northern Telecom supplies it with specialised mobile switching systems. The deal is worth USDollars 100m to Northern Telecom over four years. Brazil A mild buying spree sparked by bullish comments from the chairman of Brazil's debt steering committee spurred stocks to close 1.5 per cent higher in quiet trading on the Sao Paulo bourse. The Bovespa index rose 315 to 21,278 in turnover of Cr291.3bn. Mexico Equities rose on the back of Telmex ADRs. Investors on the Mexican Stock Exchange kept a close eye on Telmex's movement in New York and shadowed its gains. The company's local stocks matched ADR advances and constituted well over 50 per cent of transactions, traders said. The IPC index closed up 37.09, or 1.53 per cent, at 2,468.52 in moderately heavy volume of 175.2m shares.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec under pressure to drive up oil prices PRESSURE was growing from some members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday for action to drive oil prices up to their Dollars 21 a barrel target. Prices have fallen by 15 per cent in real terms in the last two years, Dr Subroto, secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, told the opening meeting of its Ministerial Monitoring Committee yesterday. The weakness of the dollar had pushed real oil prices down by more than 6 percentage points since the last Opec meeting in May, Dr Subroto said in his report to delegates. A composite price index taking into account inflation and exchange rate changes had fallen from a base of 100 in July 1990 to 90.8 in May this year, and to 84.47 in August. His comments prompted Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, to insist that Opec should 'seriously consider' taking action to raise prices towards the target set in 1990 of Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes (equivalent to about Dollars 23 a barrel for Brent crude). The price stood at Dollars 19.64 as the meeting began yesterday. Delegates said Mr Aghazadeh was strongly supported by other members, including Libya, Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela. They said there was widespread agreement among members that prices had to rise, in spite of indications from the Saudi Arabian and United Arab Emirates' oil ministers, as they arrived at the meeting, that they were happy with present prices. Most analysts, however, were still expecting Opec to reach an agreement that would allow its members, except Kuwait, to continue pumping at present levels. Kuwait would be allowed to continue to raise production during the rebuilding of its oil industry after the Gulf war. Such an agreement would imply total Opec production in the fourth quarter of between 24.5m and 24.7m barrels a day. With demand for Opec oil - including production and stocks - forecast at about 25.7m b/d by the International Energy Agency, Opec believed supply would be sufficiently tight to push prices up to Dollars 21 by the end of the year - or higher if the winter is unusually cold. Opec is thought likely to roll over its third-quarter production ceiling of 22.98m with special dispensation for Kuwait, or to adopt a more 'meaningful' quota of around 24.5m b/d. Dr Subroto said Opec's estimate of demand for its oil was slightly lower than the IEA's, at 25.1m b/d. 'It is up to the ministers to decide what the production level should be,' he added. Ministers met for about three hours yesterday morning before spending the afternoon in bilateral meetings. They are to meet again this morning for what some delegates suggested could be the final session.</p>

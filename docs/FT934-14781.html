			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Senior defence posts face Treasury threat THE TREASURY is targeting senior Ministry of Defence staff and officers in the armed forces as part of the drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years. Ministers believe planned cuts at this level are not proceeding quickly enough. They are understood to be taking a tough line in the face of MoD arguments that a root and branch management reform has made it necessary to retain a high proportion of senior staff while cutting junior ranks. According to official figures, the number of officers employed by the MoD fell by just 1.6 per cent between 1980 and 1992, while the number of army privates and those of equivalent rank dropped by more than a quarter. Talks aimed at setting departmental budgets until 1996-97 continued yesterday morning in the cabinet's so-called EDX committee, with ministers confident a settlement will be reached, as planned, by the end of this month. Some relatively low-spending departments, including the Foreign Office, are understood to be close to settling. The tightest squeeze is being imposed in the later years. The focus on MoD staffing comes as senior Tory backbenchers are preparing to use next week's two-day defence debate in the Commons to mount a rearguard action against the threat of further defence cuts. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has demanded a full-scale review of Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for further cuts. But a former armed forces minister last night called for a reduction in troop levels in Northern Ireland, saying the deployment of British soldiers in other countries had been limited because of the commitment to the province. The MoD argues that if the number of senior staff had been trimmed more quickly, it would have been harder to implement its New Management Strategy  -introduced in 1991 - under which responsibility for many functions is being delegated away from the centre. It says that if agreed targets for efficiency improvements are met, its mix of staff should be for it to decide and not the Treasury. In 1991/92, the last year for which figures are available, the department exceeded its target by Pounds 44m or 22 per cent. Some MoD advisers acknowledge that significant cuts at senior and middle-management level should be feasible within a few years, once the reforms implemented under NMS have bedded down. While a drive to encourage early retirement in senior MoD ranks could help the government achieve the control totals under negotiation, it will be of less assistance in reducing the proportion of Britain's gross domestic product accounted for by public spending. This is because the pensions of former MoD employees no longer count towards the control total but are part of general government expenditure.</p>

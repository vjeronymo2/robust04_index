			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VANISHED' DENVER POLICEMAN TURNS UP -- CONTRITE -- IN UTAH  </P> <P> A Denver police officer turned up in Utah after his mysterious disappearance  prompted a weeklong manhunt, and he told investigators Friday that financial  and personal problems compelled him to abandon his patrol car and head west on  a motorcycle.  </P> <P> David Hayhurst, 39, who had gotten a new apartment and a job at an auto-body  shop in Reno, Nev., said he decided to return home after reading a newspaper  account of the manhunt and deciding: "I couldn't do this to all those good  people in Denver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Took Off'  </P> <P> "I just took off. I'm just sorry that I did it," he told KMGH-TV while en route  to Denver, escorted by two police detectives. "I should have got some help  somewhere. I didn't know where else to turn."  </P> <P> Hayhurst was in uniform when he phoned authorities and his family Thursday  night from a convenience store in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Capt. Jim Fitzpatrick and Lt. Tom Haney, who were sent to Utah to retrieve  Hayhurst, said the officer was using the name Daniel Groves and was posing as  an out-of-work auto mechanic.  </P> <P> Hayhurst's abandoned patrol car was found in southwest Denver early Aug. 18,  its motor running, lights on and driver's door open. Police at first feared  that Hayhurst had been abducted, but investigators suspected he may have walked  away on his own after they learned his Lakewood home was under foreclosure.  </P> <P> Hayhurst also was scheduled for a court appearance on charges that he had  failed to make monthly payments on a motorcycle.  </P> <P> At a news conference Friday, Denver Police Chief Ari Zavaras said of Hayhurst:  "He . . . said he was under such pressure that he just couldn't handle it  anymore."  </P> <P> Zavaras said he has placed Hayhurst on paid administrative leave and ordered  him to undergo psychological and physical examinations. He said Hayhurst could  be reprimanded or fired after the tests. Hayhurst said he hoped to remain on  the force.  </P></p>

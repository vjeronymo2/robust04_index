			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GREEN SEES RED BEFORE YANKEES' WIN OVER TWINS  </P> <P> Manager Dallas Green of the New York Yankees, responding to a published report,  defended himself and his coaches against criticism from owner George  Steinbrenner Thursday in New York before the Yankees defeated the Minnesota  Twins, 8-1.  </P> <P> "My boss chooses to use the newspapers instead of a face-to-face confrontation,  and I don't think that's fair," Green said in a news conference.  </P> <P> "But he's the owner and he can say whatever he wants. I may not like it. But I  don't have to like it. I just have to do the best that I can as long as I can."  </P> <P> In Thursday's editions of the New York Daily News, a day after the Yankees  split a doubleheader with the Twins, Steinbrenner was quoted as saying, "From  what I saw tonight, the managers and coaches are going to have to do a better  job for us to win."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner criticized Green's placement of Yankee outfielders and offensive  strategy in the team's 4-3 loss in the second game.  </P> <P> "What manager George made was a logical second guess," Green said. "But  hindsight is always 20-20, and is also what gives managers gray hair. I guess  you could say, 'Consider the source,' and take it from there. If he's using  this as a motivational tool, he's wasting his time. No one on this team can  work any harder."  </P> <P> Thursday, Chuck Cary pitched a five-hitter for his second consecutive complete  game, and the Yankees hammered Rick Aguilera in his debut with the Twins.  </P> <P> Aguilera, acquired from the New York Mets in the Frank Viola trade Monday, gave  up 10 hits and six runs in four-plus innings. It was his first start since July  9, 1988.  </P> <P> Cary, who pitched 16 consecutive scoreless innings before Greg Gagne homered in  the ninth, struck out five and walked none.  </P> <P> Luis Polonia drove in three runs and Mel Hall had three of the Yankees' 15  hits. Hall hit an RBI single in the first inning and made it 2-0 in third when  he and Jesse Barfield hit consecutive doubles.  </P> <P> Chicago 6, Oakland 4 -- Ron Karkovice's first triple in 418 career at-bats  broke a sixth-inning tie, and the Chicago White Sox ended Oakland's four-game  winning streak at Oakland.  </P> <P> With two outs in the sixth, Karkovice's drive off the fence in right-center  scored Dan Pasqua to give the White Sox a 5-4 lead. Pasqua started the inning  with a walk off Bob Welch.  </P> <P> The White Sox scored in the seventh when Ivan Calderon singled, stole second  and scored as Greg Walker beat out an infield hit. He knocked the ball out of  catcher Terry Steinbach's glove for an error.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Toronto 0 -- Tom Gordon pitched a three-hitter for his first  career shutout and complete game, and Danny Tartabull went 3 for 4 with an RBI  single at Toronto.  </P> <P> Gordon (12-5), a rookie, struck out eight and walked two.  </P> <P> Fred McGriff singled in the second and doubled in the eighth, and Kelly Gruber  singled in the seventh for the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Jimmy Key (7-13) lost his seventh consecutive decision, giving up three runs,  three hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Cleveland 4, Boston 2 -- Rod Nichols beat the Red Sox for the second time in a  week, and Cory Snyder drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single at Boston.  </P> <P> Nichols, who edged the Red Sox, 2-1, in Cleveland Friday, gave up 10 hits in  seven-plus innings, including Nick Esasky's two-run homer in the eighth.  Nichols earned his third major league victory when Doug Jones got the last six  outs for his 25th save.  </P> <P> Detroit 9, Texas 6 -- Alan Trammell's second RBI single broke a tie in the  eighth inning, and the Tigers won at Detroit in a game with 16 walks.  </P> <P> Mike Henneman (8-4) worked the last 2 2/3 innings to win. Cecilio Guante, the  fourth of five Texas pitchers, lost.  </P> <P> Mike Heath opened the eighth with a single and Gary Pettis walked. After Kenny  Rogers relieved Guante with a 2-0 count on Trammell, the count went to 3-2  before Trammell singled, scoring Heath with the go-ahead run.  </P></p>

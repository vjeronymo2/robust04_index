			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> The arms that the Saudis have been buying for many years proved to be worthless  when they had to defend themselves against threatened aggression from Iraq.  Will additional arms enable them to provide for their own defense?  </P> <P> We should only supply arms when we get a commitment that their new ordnance  will be manned by their own people and will then be used to replace our men and  weapons.  </P> <P> JOSEPH GRODSKY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / PRI agrees to share air time: The efforts by the Mexican opposition to gain equal media exposure When Mexico's governing party persuaded the main opposition to sign an electoral pact earlier this year, it promised to promote a balanced coverage by the media of the presidential campaign. With less than two weeks to go before the election, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) contends the pledge has been kept. For the first time in a Mexican presidential campaign, opposition figures appear regularly on the TV news, are interviewed almost daily on radio, and have their meetings reported at length by almost all national newspapers. While acknowledging the media opening, critics contend the changes have not gone far enough, and have been made too late. Television, radio and newspapers, many complain, still dedicate considerably more time or space to the PRI's Mr Ernesto Zedillo than to his rivals, and treat him in a generally more favourable way. 'Quantitatively and qualitatively the changes have been enormous,' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist with Reforma newspaper and a frequent critic of the government, 'but there is still far from being a desirable level of objectivity.' With the election race more competitive than any other in Mexican history, the debate over the role of the media has become a central issue. The governing party has been caught between wanting to push for balanced coverage as a way of winning credibility for the result and needing as much exposure as possible to bolster the uninspiring candidacy of Mr Zedillo. Most criticisms have been levelled at television, the principle source of news for Mexicans. The controlling shareholders of Mexico's two private television networks, Mr Emilio Azcarraga of Televisa and Mr Ricardo Salinas of Azteca, are declared supporters of the PRI. Their networks have devoted more than twice as much news time to the governing party candidate as they have to any opposition figure, according to independent monitoring. Responding to criticisms, Televisa, by far the largest of the two private networks, has recently made concessions. After a highly public meeting with the minister of the interior, Mr Azcarraga agreed to give all political parties three hours of free 15-minute slots. Since the federal electoral institute began to monitor its news programmes, Televisa's coverage of the candidates in the main news programmes has become more balanced. Critics point out that the 15-minute slots are generally not at prime time and have low ratings. Moreover, the greater news time opposition candidates have recently received does not, say many observers, balance the more subtle ways the networks have of influencing opinion in favour of Mr Zedillo. 'With Zedillo they are always showing him kissing babies, smiling, with happy people, in any kind of situation that shows him in a good light,' says Mr Miguel Acosta, who studies Televisa's campaign coverage. The other candidates are often shown criticising each other or their speeches are paraphrased, reducing their impact. Although the government maintains that it cannot force private television networks to be more objective in their coverage, state-granted television concessions awarded to Mr Azcarraga are partly why he is reported to be Mexico's second richest man, worth Dollars 5.1bn. Newspapers have much less political impact than television and are generally more diverse in their views. And in this election even the most pro-government newspapers regularly put stories about opposition candidates on their front page, a break from past tradition.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 2: 'Against all the odds, we're still on track' - Profile of the prime minister CARL BILDT, Sweden's 43-year-old prime minister, is thriving under the pressures of office. He towers over his coalition party colleagues despite a crushing workload. No nook or cranny of government activity seems free from his close interest. So far, his government has held together with few public differences. That is quite an achievement. Mr Bildt's Moderate party may provide most of the ideological dynamic but it must compromise with its Liberal, Centre party and Christian Democratic partners. At moments during the September crisis strains did emerge between them at least temporarily, but no minister has so far had to resign. Public opinion surveys suggest all the coalition parties have lost ground electorally but Mr Bildt says he expected to be in a much worst position after 12 months in office. 'Against all the odds, we are still on track,' he told the Financial Times in an interview. He feels 'more comfortable in a funny sort of way' as prime minister than he believes Britain's John Major does at the moment even though his government lacks an overall parliamentary majority. Mr Bildt is more than just a domestic-oriented politician. Perhaps only the late Olof Palme among post-war Swedish leaders has had such a consuming interest in international affairs. Today Mr Bildt has become a familiar figure on the circuit of western European capitals as he prepares the way for Sweden's entry into the European Community. It is Mr Bildt's German connection in particular that could prove the most important for the success of his country's forthcoming EC entry negotiations. The Swedish prime minister was the only foreign guest at Helmut Kohl's 10th anniversary in power party in Bonn in September. The German Chancellor is said to treat Mr Bildt like a son and at the event described him as a major European statesman. Certainly Mr Bildt's unequivocal enthusiasm for the Maastricht concept of European monetary and political union must be music to Mr Kohl's ears. He wants to ensure Sweden becomes a full member of the European Community. Making up for 35 years' absence from the EC, the country must be ready to join its 'inner core'. 'Our European policy aims to give Sweden a place at the heart of European co-operation,' Mr Bildt told parliament last month. 'It is of vital interest for us that current European co-operation is intensified. 'The EC needs to regain momentum and enlargement next year is one of the best ways of doing this,' he argues. Enlargement - in his opinion - is necessary as an important signal to central and eastern Europe that the EC is not going to be 'a closed shop' but 'open to all the democracies of Europe as envisaged in the Treaty of Rome'. Using the idealistic language that most European prime ministers rarely employ, Mr Bildt still speaks about the EC with the eloquence and the passion of a first love affair. What particularly concerns him is the need for the EC to face up to the challenge of the turmoil in the eastern Europe. He believes there is 'no other institution or mechanism' than the 'emerging European union' that can ensure 'stability and prosperity to all of Europe'. 'We cannot live in a Europe that is half stable, secure and prosperous and half unstable, conflict-ridden and increasingly economically desperate,' he argues. If the ideal of the European Union fails, then Mr Bildt believes this would 'play into the hands of those increasingly strong red-brown forces of aggressive nationalism and surviving communism'. Mr Bildt is taking his campaign every Monday to Sweden's small towns and villages, explaining the merits of EC entry to the doubters. He remains confident there will be a Yes vote in the country's national referendum in 1994 on the entry terms. He is also optimistic that the four-party coalition will survive at least until the September 1994 general election. He believes the turbulent events of this September have not blown his government off course but reinforced its general sense of direction through co-operation with the Social Democrats. But he is worried about the predicted size of the budget deficit by 1993-94 when it looks set to make up as much as 10 per cent of Sweden's gross national product. 'The planned levels of spending and taxation are unsustainable,' he admits. This means Sweden is only at the start not the end of painful public expenditure cuts. Over the coming years Mr Bildt sees Sweden's famous 'welfare state' being transformed in phases into a 'welfare market'. Registered unemployment will rise to levels not seen in the country since the early 1930s but he does not believe that his political opponents will be able to exploit this as an electoral advantage. 'One of the merits of our agreements with the Social Democrats is that we have tied them into the consequences as well,' he explains. Cool under pressure, Mr Bildt continues to be a man with few self-doubts. He believes the current of history in Sweden is moving in his party's direction after more than half a century of Social Democratic hegemony. In the shift of systems Sweden will grow more individualistic, dynamic, pluralist and open. He believes the objective of a high growth-low inflation country is realisable over the next few years. A believer in the 'strong state' and 'political leader- ship', Mr Bildt wants to make Sweden a more vigorous market economy. That means taking 'more, not fewer' political decisions.</p>

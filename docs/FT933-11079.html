			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: UK harks back to warning of 'fault lines' - Grim satisfaction in London THE BRITISH government last night found it hard to disguise a mood of grim satisfaction, as its European partners struggled to preserve the European exchange rate mechanism. Humiliated by sterling's departure last autumn from the currency grid, Whitehall officials and their political masters could at last claim vindication. The system, as Mr John Major declared at the time, had indeed developed serious fault lines. The prime minister had been right also to declare European monetary union a distant dream, not a short-term reality. But the inevitable self-justification disguised a less sanguine assessment of the prospects for the European - and British - economies if the present era of managed exchange rates were to end in the ERM's disintegration. The Whitehall judgment was that decoupling of the French franc and other ERM currencies from the D-Mark could support Britain's fledgling economic recovery. Lower interest rates and stronger growth in the rest of the Community would provide expanding markets for the exports on which the UK upturn depends. Senior Conservative Euro-sceptics were quick also to point out the potential political gains for the UK government. A dramatic failure of Franco-German monetary co-operation would impose severe strains on the core alliance which has so often consigned Britain to the European sidelines. Mr Major's hopes of a more symmetrical relationship between London, Bonn and Paris would be greatly strengthened. So, too, would Mr Major's voice in decisions over the next few years on the Community's future. But the more cautious British ministers - Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, among them - see countervailing disadvantages. Mr Clarke, long an advocate of managed, stable exchange rates, sees no advantage in competitive devaluations across the EC. The benefits of lower interest rates might be offset in the short term by the damaging blow delivered to business confidence by a collapse of the exchange rate grid. Even though sterling's exit from the ERM led to sharply lower borrowing costs, the immediate effect was to damage the recovery prospects. The advantages Britain secured following sterling's devaluation last autumn have already been eroded by the recent rise in the pound's value. Exporters are warning that weakening exports threaten the pace of growth. Nor does the government see any medium-term gain for industry from a return to the era of free floating. The single market was designed to create a level, stable playing field for European business. Britain would lose as much as anyone if that were undermined by unpredictable gyrations in exchange rates.</p>

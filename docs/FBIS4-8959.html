			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [J.M. report: "Macedonia Should Remain Independent"] </F>   [Excerpt] "To have stability in the region, it is best if  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  remains an independent state without joining any federation,"  Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of Macedonia, said  yesterday to the 15-member group of the New York nongovernmental  Council for International Relations. President Gligorov  explained that otherwise a conflict would immediately occur  because the question would arise of who Macedonia should join  with, which, as a matter of fact, has been the cause for the  previous Balkan wars, the First World War also having started  over the division of Macedonia. He said: "It does not mean  that we want to remain isolated. Our firm commitment is to join  the European associations and establish good relations with all  our neighbors."    The U.S. delegation, composed of top journalists engaged in  international policy, was very interested in the  Greek-Macedonian dispute and U.S. mediation. President Gligorov  assessed positively the upcoming meeting of Prime Minister  Papandreou and U.S. President Clinton, and he pointed out the  following: "Until now the United States has conducted an  impartial policy concerning relations between Macedonia and  Greece, showing an interest in maintaining peace and security in  the Balkans. I hope that position will also prevail during the  discussions between Papandreou and Clinton in Washington."    Speaking about the U.S. efforts for giving assistance to the  finding of a just and acceptable solution for both sides, the  Macedonian president said: "It is important that goodwill and  desire for discussion win, and let us not use threats and  embargoes, because reasonable people can always reach a solution  through discussion."    Asked about the part of the [Macedonian] Constitution that  Greece is calling upon Macedonia to change, Gligorov replied  that even before the Badinter Commission came out with its  assessments in favor of the recognition of Macedonia, some of  the Constitution's regulations had been changed: "We wrote down  we had no territorial pretensions and that we are not going to  interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. At the  same time, we proposed an agreement to Greece on the  inviolability of the present border under the guarantee of the  United Nations and the European Union." Gligorov pointed out the  example of Article 108 of the Greek Constitution, where it is  written that the Greek state will take care of all Greeks,  whichever part of the world they live in.    "The moment the dispute between Macedonia and Greece is  settled, there will be long-term good relations ahead of us,  first of all because of the common economic interest and also  because both peoples are very close, share the same religion and  have similar customs," Gligorov said    Concerning the latest federation between the Muslims and the  Croats on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gligorov  emphasized: "I think it is positive, although the war between  the Muslims and the Croats was absolutely unnecessary. However,  there still remains the problem with the Serbs. In my opinion,  it would be a good thing if Bosnia and Herzegovina could  reunite, because its division on ethnic principles could have a  bad effect not only on the Balkans, but also on some other  Eastern European countries. It violates many international  regulations and represents a bad precedent for changing the  borders and for violent ethnic cleansing."    This is how President Gligorov responded to the question of  what would happen if Serbia started ethnic cleansing in Kosovo:  "That would be tragic; it is necessary to solve the Kosovo  problem through negotiations between the Serbian authority and  the legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosovo. If  that does not happen, and if ethnic cleansing takes place in  Kosovo, there is a danger of a Balkan war with sizable negative  consequences, in which two NATO members -- Greece and Turkey --  would be involved."

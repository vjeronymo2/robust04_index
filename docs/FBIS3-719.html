			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Nigerian military government of General Sani  Abacha is apparently taking a tougher line with the opposition.  Overt criticism of the government is already banned, but the  Campaign for Democracy [CD], a leading opponent of former  President Babangida and advocate of the implementation of the  June 12 election results, has continued its campaigns,  especially over the proposed national conference. Well, now,  according to the Campaign for Democracy, a number of its  officials have been arrested. Josephine Hazely asked our Lagos  correspondent, Janet Anderson, who the arrested people were.    [Begin recording] [Anderson] The statement says that Femi  Falana has been arrested -- he is a very prominent member of the  Campaign for Democracy and a human rights lawyer -- along with  two other members of the Campaign for Democracy. They are Fatai  Jubril and Ladi Adebayo. They were both arrested in Ketu, the  statement says, on Wednesday [9 March].    [Hazely] Now, what about the Campaign's chairman? Is he also  being sought after, I understand?    [Anderson] The statement says also today, some plainclothes  policemen went to the headquarters of the Campaign for Democracy  to ask for Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, but he is actually out of the  country at the moment on an official visit abroad, so they  weren't able to find him.    [Hazely] Did the Campaign for Democracy's statement say why  three of their members have been arrested?    [Anderson] The statement suggests that the two members who  were arrested originally on Wednesday were arrested for being in  possession of posters and leaflets, which had captions like: A  Dictator Cannot Give Democracy and Abacha Cannot Deliver. It  separately says that Femi Falana was arrested today when he had  been told that these two members of the CD were arrested, he  went along to the police station where they were being held at  [name indistinct] and there, he was arrested as well himself.    [Hazely] The authorities themselves haven't come up with any  word yet on the arrest of these men, have they?    [Anderson] No, there hasn't been any official response yet,  but the press statement only came out within the last hour.    [Hazely] And you don't want guess at how people will react  to  this, once news gets round that these men have been arrested?    [Anderson] I think that there will be some surprise that  this  has happened. This is the first time that members of the  Campaign for Democracy or the other groups who are part of the  Campaign for Democracy have been arrested since the new  leadership of Gen. Sani Abacha came in. There was an incident  earlier this year, when a particular magazine had all of its  copies seized and the press came down very heavily on Gen.  Abacha's government as a result of that. So I wouldn't be  surprised to see some quite heavy headlines over the next few  days about this. [end recording]</p>

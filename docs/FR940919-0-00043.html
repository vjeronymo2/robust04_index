			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment is effective immediately upon final publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here because this amendment reduces the existing requirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective date six months after publication and the fact that a six-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes that this amendment should be effective immediately upon final publication. These reasons also provide a basis for making this amendment effective immediately, upon final publication, under the Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must conduct an ``assessment of the potential costs and benefits'' for all ``significant'' regulatory actions. This amendment is not significant, since its effect reduces the overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding an additional amount of waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional economic impact due to today's rule. Therefore, this rule is not a significant regulation, and no cost/benefit assessment is required. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has also exempted this rule from the requirement for OMB review under section (6) of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however, if the Administrator or delegated representative certifies that the rule will not have an impact on any small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment will not have any adverse economic impact on small entities because its effect will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardous waste regulations and will be limited to one facility. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This amendment therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with this final amendment have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050&hyph;0053.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hazardous Waste, Recycling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Elizabeth A.

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Mysteriously Becalmed: Two out of three recent works by California-born Gerald  Kamitaki -- who seems to be showing mostly in Japan these days -- are becalmed  in the waters of Zen-like mystery. "Untitled Enclosure" consists of long  canvas-covered lengths of wood forming a huge, concentric, roughly diamond  shape on the wall.  </P> <P> They are all painted black, with a few stray blank areas, and are studded with  nails that poke out of oversized holes in the canvas. Varying degrees of care  are given to the cleanness of the transition between abutting lengths of wood.  What this is all meant to signify is anyone's guess.  </P> <P> "Skyscraper" consists of a grid of 25 double-paned white lacquer frames holding  faintly shiny pieces of blue cloth. Each "pane" is pierced by Kamitaki's pet  motif of nails protruding from oversized holes. But here this gesture suggests  a kind of frightfully dogged yet random violence, a will toward completeness  that is as cleanly planned and blandly executed as the perfect architecture of  the frames themselves. (Hoffman Gallery, 912 Colorado Ave., to March 31.) CATHY  CURTIS  </P></p>

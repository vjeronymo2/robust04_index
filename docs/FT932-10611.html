			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Mark staunches its losses THE D-MARK yesterday staunched some of the losses it has sustained against other European currencies in recent days after the Bundesbank caused slight disappointment by leaving its official interest rates unchanged, writes James Blitz. Earlier this week, dealers reported that investors had been switching funds out of the D-Mark and into other European currencies amid signs that the Bundesbank was easing monetary policy at a faster pace. However, the Bundesbank's decision to leave both its Lombard and discount rates unchanged coincided with a slight weakening of the Swiss franc. After closing at SFr0.897 to the D-Mark on Wednesday night, the 'Swissie' fell back to the SFr0.90 level yesterday. But the Swiss currency still closed slightly stronger on the day at SFr0.895. The Bank of France's decision to cut its two main interest rates by 25 basis points also weakened the French franc slightly. The reduction of the intervention and 5-10 day lending rates to 8.0 per cent and 9.0 per cent respectively was rather greater than the Bundesbank's cut in its repo rate earlier this week. Despite falling back earlier in the day, the French franc still closed at FFr3.370 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.372. The dollar was confined to tight ranges against the D-Mark as the market awaited today's non-farm payroll figure for April. Following the poorer-than-expected figure from the National Association of Purchasing Managers earlier this week, the market has revised down its expectations for today's headline figure from +160,000 to +130,000. The dollar yesterday closed more or less unchanged at DM1.5790. Sterling slipped against the D-Mark following news that the Bundesbank had left policy unchanged and that money supply growth in April had been lower than expected. However, the pound was generally stronger on the day as a technical rebound followed the selling of Tuesday and Wednesday. The currency closed at DM2.4800 from a previous DM2.4750. There are differing views over whether the pound will head up or down from here, partly because of uncertainty over the direction of UK base rates. Mr Gavyn Davies, Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International, said yesterday that the UK authorities could raise interest rates if the sterling exchange rate index, which measures the pound against a basket of currencies, dropped to around 75.0 or 77.0 from last night's close of 80.7. However, he said that the sterling exchange rate would have to move even more substantially in an upward direction to warrant a cut in UK rates. In his view the ERI would have to register around 87.0 to 89.0 for this to be possible.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Shokarev, VTsIOM [All-Union Center for </F> the Study of Public Opinion]: "If We Were To Elect the President  Tomorrow, It Would Be Yeltsin; Yavlinskiy and Zhirinovskiy Are  Breathing Down His Neck"]    [Text] According to the data of VTsIOM [All-Union Center  for the Study of Public Opinion0, obtained in the course of a  survey of the urban population of Russia at the request of the  newspaper SEGODNYA, if the early presidential elections were to  be held next Sunday, approximately one-fourth of the votes would  be distributed as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yeltsin                               |14|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yavlinskiy                            |8|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zhirinovskiy                          |7|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rutskoy                               |5|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gaydar                                |3|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The list given to the respondents also contained the names  of  other political leaders, which may be united into three groups:    First--the populist-democrats: Mikhail Gorbachev, Gavriil  Popov, Nikolay Travkin, Anatoliy Sobchak and Svyatoslav Fedorov.  7 percent of the respondents were ready to vote for them.    Second--the pro-government leaders: Viktor Chernomyrdin,  Sergey Shakhray and others. They collected 5 percent.    Last--the leaders of the irreconcilable opposition: Sergey  Baburin, Gennadiy Zyuganov and Aman Tuleyev. Their supporters  numbered 3 percent.    The other politicians collected an insignificant number of  votes.    Around 15 percent of the respondents declined to answer the  question.    Boris Yeltsin leads in practically all the socio-demographic  groups. The only exception is managers, specialists, students  and the unemployed. In the first group, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in  first place, and in the next two Grigoriy Yavlinskiy is the  leader, while unemployed persons give preference to Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. This represents an alarming symptom, considering  the possible sharp increase in unemployment already this year.    Among several of the groups, the leader of the LDPR  [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] edges out Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy from second into third place. Thus, he is preferred  by men as a whole, blue-collar workers, persons with little  education, as well as those with per capita monthly income below  50,000 rubles (R).    The former vice president is in stable fourth position, but  among white-collar workers and students he is more popular than  Zhirinovskiy. They place him in the third position, as do  persons with per capita monthly income of from R100,000 to  R149,000. We must add also that in such an important region as  Moscow, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in second place, attracting the  sympathies of 7 percent of Moscow residents. However, the  positions of Boris Yeltsin are strongest in the capital--here 22  percent of the respondents are ready to vote for him.    Yegor Gaydar makes it into the top three only in groups of  entrepreneurs and among persons with income above R150,000.    Table 1 presents the results in greater detail.    For the present day, the president maintains the leading  positions among urban residents, yielding them in groups with  low level of adaptation. Moreover, the democratically oriented  "unadapted" persons choose Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, while Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy wins out among those who have found themselves in  the worst situation. These two politicians aspire to second  place in the presidential race. Their chances of winding up in a  hypothetical run-off are equal. Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was right  behind the leader, i.e., the president, up until September of  last year, has fallen behind and has been unable to regain the  second position in the months following the day of dismissal.  Yegor Gaydar has practically no chance to enter the finals. Even  among those who voted for the "Choice of Russia" block in  December of 1993, 40 percent gave their sympathies to Boris  Yeltsin, and only 11 percent would vote for the leader of the  block.

The  first column presents the responses of all the population, the  second gives the responses of those who at the hypothetical  elections would vote for Boris Yeltsin, and so forth (see  table). As we can see, the overwhelming majority of the  respondents consider the most important thing to be "law and  order and legality." This demand unites all the groups, with the  exception of the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. If we  consider that the latter put the need for a "strong leader" in  first place, evidently they believe that if there will be such a  leader (Zhirinovskiy), he will bring about order. Ranking second  is the "social protection of the population," whose importance  evokes practically no doubt in anyone. Here again, the  supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy comprise the exception.    The demand for "strong authority, a real leader," which is  ranked third in importance, fully reflects the paternalistic  tendencies retained in society. Then again, no one wants to  reject such a concept as "adherence to human rights and  freedoms," which 10 years earlier was no more than a "figure of  speech."    We must remember that the proposed responses represent a  certain stamp, but their meanings vary depending on the values  of the respondent. The most obvious example of this is the  attitude of supporters of Boris Yeltsin and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy,  on one hand, and those of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr  Rutskoy on the other to the concept of a "hard, freely  convertible ruble." While the former believe that a convertible  ruble may be achieved only under a "free market economy" (for  them it is always more important than the "ruble"), the latter  understand the "convertible ruble" as a ruble which is ordered  to be convertible--a set ruble exchange rate and fixed prices.  The concept of a "free market economy" does not even enter into  the top ten priorities for supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  and Aleksandr Rutskoy.    Behind the concept of "good neighborly relations with other  countries and peoples," there is hidden the well-known  expression, "just so there is no war." It is interesting that  the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and especially  Aleksandr Rutskoy, are ready to part with such relations for  purposes of "restoring the USSR and Soviet power."    One thing that draws attention to itself is the fact that  the  supporters of the leader of the LDPR--the only ones out of all  the groups--believe such a concept as a "Russian national state"  to be important. They have ranked it in fourth place, while for  the others it is not even in the top ten priorities.    Summarizing all of the above, we may say that the proponents  of one or another political leader are quite similar to their  chosen candidate. Their collective portraits appear  approximately as follows:    The "Yeltsinists"--compared with the population as a whole  or  with the proponents of other leaders--are more pro-market and  pro-democratically oriented. The "Yavlinists" are rather similar  to the proponents of Yeltsin, although for them "social  fairness" is more important than "social protection of the  population." In other words, they are populists to a greater  degree than are the "Yeltsinists." the "Zhirinovtsy" are  supporters of a firm hand and a Russian national state. However,  they cannot be considered "red" in the same degree as the  supporters of the former vice-president. On the other hand,  Aleksandr Rutskoy is specifically the leader of the "reds," at  least for the present moment.    The survey was conducted at the request of the newspaper  SEGODNYA from 14 through 18 May, using a representative sampling  of the urban population of Russia. A total of 1,620 persons were  polled.    Table 2.

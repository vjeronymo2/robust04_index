Korean businesses  reported nine damage claims against foreign companies worth 2.41  million U.S. dollars last month, up 225 percent in number and  296.1 percent in value from January last year.    In contrast, foreign companies demanded damages in 26 Korean  cases, off 33.3 percent from a year earlier, worth 1.26 million  dollars. As trade volume grows and export lines diversify,  Korean businesses are suffering more damage, a KCAB official  observed.    Another reason for the increase in claims by Korean  companies  is their change of attitude in reacting aggressively to  cut-throat world competition following the conclusion of the  Uruguay Round pact, the official said. Their trade claims  reported to the KCAB totaled 106 last year, up 65.6 percent from  1992, and foreign claims against Korean companies dropped from  395 to 387.    Trade friction with the United States overshadowed that with  other countries as cases hit 28 last year and nine last month,  followed by China with 13 last year and four in January.    Although China is Korea's third biggest trading partner  after  the United States and Japan, Korean companies claim many damages  because of China's inconsistent trade practices, the official  said.</p>

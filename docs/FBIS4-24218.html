			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Faria Horacio in Kuito] </F>   [Text] Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] has finally launched its attack  against the defenseless residents of Kunje Commune after  deploying a large number of men and war materiel around it. The  rebel attack, which is supported by intense heavy artillery  fire, began at about 0500 today and has continued unabated.  Fire is so intense that clouds of smoke and flames can be seen  from the city of Kuito, suggesting that houses are on fire.  Clashes are in progress right now. Shots fired by light [words  indistinct] weapons can be heard very close to the city. There  are no reports about the outcome of the ongoing clashes.</p>

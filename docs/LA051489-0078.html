			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE FIRMS SHIELDING DIRECTORS FROM SUITS  </P> <P> A growing number of California and U.S. companies, finding it harder to attract  directors, are continuing this year to seek permission to shield those officers  from liability in certain types of shareholder lawsuits, a survey of this  year's proxy statements reveals.  </P> <P> The result is that many shareholders may no longer be able to sue and collect  damages in cases where they lost money following a company board's rejection of  a hostile takeover offer.  </P> <P> Dozens of companies this year are joining the list of firms that last year  began seeking shareholder approvals for provisions that indemnify directors and  possibly other employees from monetary damages where judgment errors may have  led to a loss of shareholder value, according to William M. Mercer Meidinger  Hansen. The human resources consulting firm surveyed proxy statements of 260  California-based publicly held companies.  </P> <P> "They are called raincoat provisions because for protected officers, they  insulate them from the rain of litigation," said Richard D. Greenfield, a  Haverford, Pa., attorney who represents shareholders in numerous lawsuits  against companies.  </P> <P> The provisions are intended primarily to discourage lawsuits in instances where  directors may reject hostile takeover bids and then see the stock price drop,  said Roger Lustberg, an attorney at the Los Angeles law firm of Riordan &amp;  McKinzie. The firm has written indemnification provisions for such California  firms as Comarco, Foothill Group and Transtechnology Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Covers Judgment Errors  </P> <P> Major shareholder actions seeking damages for fraud or misrepresentation can  still go forward, Lustberg said. Also, shareholders can still sue for  violations of federal securities laws, such as for failure to disclose or  insider trading.  </P> <P> "This will assure that directors are not liable for acts that are not wrongful  but merely judgment errors," Lustberg said.  </P> <P> "It is meant to cut down on suits from shareholders angry just because they  lost some money," said Michael O. McCullough, principal at Mercer Meidinger  Hansen.  </P> <P> "We haven't found it to be any significant impediment" to serious actions,  shareholder attorney Greenfield admitted.  </P> <P> The moves to install these provisions started following Delaware's action in  1986 to amend its corporate law to allow such measures. The action was  triggered in part by the high cost of directors liability insurance and the  difficulty many firms have in attracting directors.  </P> <P> Larger California-based companies incorporated in Delaware, such as Columbia  Savings, Great Western Financial, Hewlett-Packard and Transamerica, sought and  won shareholder approvals of such provisions in 1988, according to Mercer  Meidinger Hansen. Others, such as Gap Inc. and Intel, reincorporated in  Delaware to allow themselves to use the provision.  </P> <P> Since the Delaware action, however, numerous other states, including  California, amended corporate laws in similar fashion, in part to stem an  outflow of companies to reincorporate in Delaware.  </P> <P> That has led a number of other firms incorporated in California, including  Price Co., Teledyne, Oracle Systems, Marshall Industries and Flourocarbon, to  seek approvals in this year's annual meeting season without having to  reincorporate, Mercer Meidinger Hansen said.  </P></p>

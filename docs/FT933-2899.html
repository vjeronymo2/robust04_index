			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson AGB expands 57% to Pounds 1.55m TAYLOR NELSON AGB, the largest market research group in the UK, lifted pre-tax profits by 57 per cent to Pounds 1.55m for the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 988,000. The group became market leader following Taylor Nelson's Pounds 14.5m acquisition of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private empire, in March last year. Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said the full benefits of the merger were still ahead. Further cost reductions of Pounds 400,000 are expected in the second half. Turnover for the six months rose from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 25.9m. The pre-tax figure included a Pounds 526,000 share of losses from associates while last time pre-tax profits included a Pounds 450,000 provision for property rentals - a problem that has now disappeared. The associates deficit was a one-off charge reflecting the start-up losses of the group's joint venture with Information Resources of the US and GfK of Germany. Known as InfoScan NMRA, the venture will supply market information to big grocery manufacturers. The company, which has about 17 per cent of the UK market shared by the top 30 companies, is about the sixth largest in Europe, according to Mr Cowling. Mr Cowling said that markets holding up well included the retail sector, where tough trading conditions increased the demand for research, the food and drink sector, and healthcare. Generally speaking market research was moving away from the ad hoc questioning of the past to rolling programmes of research. The company's strategy would be to build branded services to sell to growing markets. Mr Cowling cited as an example Optima, which helps clients to assess the potential for new products. This computer-based product had already doubled 1992 sales to both Europe and the UK. The company was also seeking new ways of disseminating its information. Next month it will open a publications division to issue reports based on data already gathered. With no debt and cash in hand of Pounds 7.17m, the company was on the look out for acquisitions. In May this year it paid Pounds 150,000 for Passmore Marketing Services, a telephone marketing company which would enable the group to make better use of its telephone system. Earnings per share rose to 0.47p compared with 0.28p. The interim dividend is 0.13p (0.1p).</p>

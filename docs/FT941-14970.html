			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Record damages for steel mill's move to China - Legal Briefs The former Hong Kong-based steel mill, Shun Fung Ironworks, has won a record HKDollars 700m in damages from the Hong Kong government in compensation for the compulsory purchase in 1986 of its Junk Bay site to make way for a new town. The company had originally claimed HKDollars 1bn for relocating its business to China and for loss of profits. In June last year the Hong Kong Lands Tribunal awarded Shun Fung just HKDollars 131m. But the Hong Kong Court of Appeal overturned the judgment. The court criticised the tribunal for taking 22 months to hear a case which should have lasted one month and for producing a 899-page judgment 'full of confusions'. It said Shun Fung was entitled to relocate its business and the award was too low. A delighted Mr Anthony Wood of McKenna &amp; Co, Shun Fung's solicitors, said the longest hearing and the longest judgment in Hong Kong had now produced the highest ever award.</p>

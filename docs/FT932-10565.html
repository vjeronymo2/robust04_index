			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Tory humiliation in Newbury: Big gains for Liberal Democrats in local elections as Conservative vote collapses A SENSATIONAL defeat in the Newbury by-election and a collapse in the Conservative vote in the shire counties last night dealt a humiliating blow to the authority of Mr John Major's government. In Newbury, the Liberal Democrats scored a spectacular victory in the by-election called following the death of Mrs Judith Chaplin. In a seat held by the Conservatives since 1924, Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat, overturned the government's previous 12,357 majority to win the seat by a massive 22,055 votes. Mr Julian Davidson, the Conservative candidate, saw his party's share of the vote slump from 55.9 per cent to less than 30 per cent. Mr Rendel's share jumped from 37.3 per cent to 64 per cent. As expected, Labour's vote was squeezed to a mere 1,151 votes, losing the party its deposit. The swing of 28.4 per cent recorded against the government compared to April 1992 was the largest seen in the succession of by-election defeats suffered by the Conservatives since 1979. The Newbury result cuts to 19 the government's majority in the House of Commons at a time when its authority has already been seriously undermined by the Conservative backbench battle over ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In the first serious test of public opinion since the general election, the Conservatives were routed in their traditional heartlands, losing control of all but one of the 16 county councils they held in England and Wales. During a night of unremitting gloom for the government, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats emerged as the biggest gainers, winning more than 350 extra county council seats as well as the by-election. The scale of last night's Conservative defeats will face Mr Major with renewed calls for a large-scale cabinet reshuffle. Mr Norman Lamont, whose claim that the economic recovery was under way formed the centrepiece of the Conservative campaign in Newbury, will again find a question mark over his hold on the chancellorship. Buckinghamshire is now the only county to remain under overall Conservative control. More than half the councils in England and Wales will be under no overall control. The Liberal Democrats, the biggest gainers of the night, held the Isle of Wight, and won control of Somerset and Cornwall. The party won more than 300 seats across the country. Kent was one of the first councils to slip from Tory control - the first time since the inception of the county in 1889. Essex voters also deserted the Conservatives early in the night, with the loss of 25 seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This was swiftly followed by the loss of Conservative control in Dorset, East Sussex, West Sussex, Suffolk, Hampshire and Surrey, where the party was defending a 34-seat majority. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, described the results as a 'protest vote at a time when the memory of recession is still fresh'. Provisional figures suggested that the Conservative share of the national vote had slumped to 31 per cent, Labour's had increased to 41 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' had risen to 24 per cent. Mr Ashdown said the outcome marked an 'astonishing' and 'a devastating blow to the Conservatives'. Calling for increased co-operation between the opposition parties, he added: 'It's absolutely clear that the country has no confidence in a government.' Labour gained control of Northamptonshire, and strengthened its hold over Lancashire. Although Labour's gains were more modest than those of the Liberal Democrats, a spokesman said the party would for the first time hold more county council seats than the Conservatives. A Labour spokesman said: 'It is an appalling indictment of this government. This is the end of the Tory shires.'  -------------------------------------- Newbury by-election  -------------------------------------- Candidate                       Vote  -------------------------------------- David Rendel (Lib Dem)        37,590 Julian Davidson (Con)         15,535 Steve Billcliffe (Lab)         1,151 Lib Dem gain        Majority: 22,055  -------------------------------------- General election 1992 Conservative majority:        12,357  -------------------------------------- Local election results, Page 12</p>

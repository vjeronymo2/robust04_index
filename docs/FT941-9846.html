			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / PM asks top brains to enter industry Mr John Major yesterday appealed for more of Britain's best brains to enter industry and said more should be heard of the country's 'remarkable' business successes, Andrew Baxter and David Owen write. The prime minister said there was one school of thought which regarded manufacturing as marginal, but a second saw it as fundamental. 'I take my stand with the second school,' he said. 'I don't regard manufacturing as a Cinderella industry. Making things matters.' Mr Major was speaking at a lunch in St Ives, Cambs, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Caparo Group, the steel and engineering business founded by Dr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman. His speech came as senior cabinet ministers praised the state of the economy and attacked Labour policies for business. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour's revelation that it believed Britain needed a business plan, would 'send shivers down the spine' of anyone remembering the 'corporatist' policies of the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the policies Labour had signed up to would result in a huge burden on business and an end to economic recovery.

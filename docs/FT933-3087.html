			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad and Tobago tries to gear up for oil and gas recovery - Canute James on moves to expand output, despite sagging prices IN THE face of a soft international market, Trinidad and Tobago's small hydrocarbons industry is moving to expand production of oil and natural gas, with government officials claiming that the Caribbean producer should be ready to take early advantage of any bounce in the market. The country's economy is heavily dependent on the petroleum sector, and has suffered in recent years from a decline in production because of maturation of the major fields. Crude production last year averaged 135,800 barrels a day, compared with an average of 155,000 b/d five years earlier. Production fell further to 126,000 b/d in the first quarter of this year. In an effort to rationalise the industry, the government has changed its tax legislation for oil producers, repealing an oil recovery impost that was introduced in 1987 but increasing the level of its existing petroleum profits tax from 45 per cent to 50 per cent. Government officials estimated that the new tax legislation would cost the treasury about TTDollars 150m (USDollars 26m) in the first year, but that the changes were expected to encourage more investments in the oil industry. They said the government was hoping that new investors in the oil sector would increase national production as demand for oil was not buoyant because of a sluggish world economy. The government is particularly keen to attract companies that would drill to 20,000 feet if necessary - a depth that would incur costs of USDollars 20m per well, the officials said. There is no lack of foreign investor interest in Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum sector. The industry is to benefit from a USDollars 411m investment for an off-shore and on-shore secondary oil recovery programme, and to expand refining throughput. It is being financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the country's state-owned oil company. Government officials say the oil recovery programme will start on-shore and is expected to yield 13m barrels of heavy crude. The off-shore recovery programme is expected to yield 17m barrels of lighter crude. The refinery throughput expansion will lift the processing of domestic crude from the current level of about 100,000 to 160,000 b/d. The government has projected that the oil recovery and refinery throughput expansion will earn the country about USDollars 1.3bn over the next 15 years. The industry is benefitting from two agreements with Maraven of Venezuela for processing crude. One is for 40,000 b/d day of lago treco crude and the other for processing 30,000 b/d of lago cinco. The rationalisation of the industry has seen the creation of a new company, the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago (Petrotrin), which will take over and merge the operations of two existing state-owned companies. Petrotrin's formation followed the government's conclusion that neither of the existing companies 'has the financial ability at this stage to embark on the widespread activity that is required to develop the assets they have in their possession,' say industry observers. The creation of Petrotrin is a condition for the loan for upgrading the refineries and secondary the recovery of heavy oil. 'The first project of Petrotrin will be implementation and management of this project,' one official said. 'This will coincide with Petrotrin's divestment of the government's two-thirds shareholding in the Trinidad and Tobago Marine Company, which produces from offshore wells. The money from the divestment will go towards Petrotrin's contribution to refinery improvement and heavy crude recovery project.' Among the new foreign companies that are moving into the industry is the Unocal Corporation of California, which has signed an agreement with the government to explore for oil in a block 45 miles off the east coast of Trinidad. The company will spend USDollars 22m to explore the block over three years. It is drilling three wells and acquiring seismic data,. There is also foreign interest in the country's natural gas industry. Enron Oil and Gas of Houston, Texas is investing Dollars 250m over five years to develop gas fields and produce natural gas off Trinidad's south-east coast. The project aims to develop three off-shore gas fields, with the first scheduled to start production before the end of this year at a rate of 50m cubic feet a day. The venture's production rate will reach 150m cu ft a day when all three wells are brought on stream by 1997. British Gas and Texaco Incorporated are investing USDollars 350m in a project off Trinidad's east coast to produce 275m cu ft a day. Mr Arthur Beall, president of British Gas, said Trinidad and Tobago could become one of the leading gas producers in the hemisphere. Trinidad and Tobago has 9.5 trillion (million million) cu ft of proven reserves and 17.5 trillion cu ft of probable reserves of natural gas. The country's natural averages 730m cu ft a day.</p>

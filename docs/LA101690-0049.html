			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SERIAL KILLINGS REMAIN A MYSTERY;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE LEADS CONTINUE TO POUR IN -- 2,200 AT LAST COUNT -- BUT LOCAL POLICE  SAY THEY ARE NO CLOSER TO CATCHING WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STABBING  DEATHS OF FIVE WOMEN.  </P> <P> Police have received 2,200 leads in connection with the serial stabbing deaths  of five women but are no closer to catching the killer, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> "A piece is still missing," said Police Capt. Dick Toneck. "If I had something  to bring forth in the way of an arrest, I would relish that. But as it stands,  we're sifting through all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in.  We're just hoping one will lead to an arrest."  </P> <P> The case has received widespread attention in San Diego, where Police Chief Bob  Burgreen labeled it the largest manhunt in the city's history and the  department's first priority. Toneck said the 33 investigators working the case  full time have called back virtually everyone who has phoned with information.  </P> <P> Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 have been killed inside  their homes in the middle of the day after their assailant apparently entered  through an unlocked or open door.  </P> <P> The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail Clark, was the mother of one of the  victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were stabbed inside their home in  University City on Sept. 13. The three other women lived within two blocks of  one another in a row of apartment houses in the nearby community of Clairemont.  </P> <P> The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices  at local stores.  </P> <P> On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full  time, acknowledged that investigators are uncertain whether the killer is still  in the San Diego area or has fled.  </P> <P> "We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here," the captain  said. "We don't have any leads to tell us where he may be."  </P> <P> Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects "who fit  the (suspect's) description; and yet, those are not the people. Their  backgrounds, their whereabouts, just don't fit."  </P> <P> The San Diego Police Department made a controversial arrest shortly after the  third killing in early April when a Puerto Rican-born man -- a decorated  ex-Marine -- was followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely  resembled a composite drawing of the suspect.  </P> <P> He was cleared shortly after his arrest.  </P> <P> Last week, San Diego police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and  a man arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido.  </P> <P> The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black  male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, curly hair. He  was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where  18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed on April 3.  </P> <P> It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the  suspect is based.  </P> <P> Toneck said a psychological profile prepared for the San Diego Police  Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., indicates the killer is a loner  and "disorganized" in his methods of operation.  </P> <P> Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the  scene. In every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed  to have been the killer's weapon.  </P> <P> Although he appears to be a loner, "there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved  one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy," Toneck said. "We just don't  know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping  that will happen."  </P> <P> Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled  back, from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the  slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case "may be scaled back  further at the point where the leads start to diminish."  </P> <P> Police are concerned, Toneck said, that residents may grow complacent and stop  taking precautions.  </P> <P> "This person is still around, still out and about, so please lock your doors in  the daytime, be aware of your surroundings, get to know your neighbors and have  your neighbors know you. Know the routines of one another at all times," Toneck  advised.  </P></p>

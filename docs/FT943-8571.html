			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Taiwan reserves hit Dollars 90bn peak Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a record Dollars 90.14bn (Pounds 60bn) at the end of June on an influx of foreign funds to invest in Taiwanese shares, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. The Central Bank of China also attributed the increase from Dollars 87.8bn in May to the weakness of the US dollar and the relative strength of other currencies held by the government. The previous record high was in September 1992 when the reserves reached Dollars 89.5bn.</p>

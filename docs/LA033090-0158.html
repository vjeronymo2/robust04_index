			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARDING UP;  </P> <P> NATIONAL LUMBER TO CLOSE FULLERTON AND 5 OTHER STORES, LAY OFF 165  </P> <P> In another cost-reduction move, National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. said Thursday  that it will close six of its 21 home-building centers and lay off about 165  employees working at those outlets.  </P> <P> "The move is designed to stem financial losses, reduce operating costs and  bolster inventory levels of remaining stores," the company said in a prepared  statement.  </P> <P> The announcement comes three days after the company said it was considering  closing some of its stores. The company, which is seeking new investment  capital, earlier said it was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and  the sale of some or all of its assets.  </P> <P> The six stores, including one in Fullerton, are slated to be shuttered Monday  after close-out sales to try to sell off as much merchandise as possible. The  remaining goods will be transferred to other stores in the chain, the company  said in a statement.  </P> <P> The manager at the Fullerton store said everything is being sold for 25% off.  He declined further comment. The other stores being closed are in La Mirada,  Riverside, Moreno Valley, Oceanside and Covina.  </P> <P> About two-thirds of the approximately 250 employees working at the stores will  be laid off. The remainder will be reassigned to more profitable stores in the  Fountain Valley-based chain, company officials said. The firm employs about  1,200 workers.  </P> <P> National Lumber, which was founded in 1942 by Sol Jaffee, has been struggling  with losses for several years as it faced greater competition from  home-building super-store chains, such as HomeClub and Home Depot.  </P> <P> The company said earlier this week that it expects to report a reduction in net  worth and a "significant loss" for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended  Jan. 31. National Lumber lost $4.4 million in the nine months that ended Oct.  31 on revenues of $108 million.  </P> <P> Its financial problems have made some of its suppliers skittish, and the  company has been unable to stock its stores sufficiently as a result. The store  consolidation should help by moving some merchandise to other stores.  </P> <P> On Monday, the company met with about 200 suppliers who informally agreed to  keep shipping goods on a collect-on-delivery basis. The suppliers, who also  formed a creditors committee, also agreed not to press claims for repayment of  past debts until April 6.  </P> <P> Company officials told the suppliers then that a few marginal stores would be  closed. The closings are designed to give the entire chain a quick infusion of  cash and help restock the remaining stores with much-needed merchandise.  </P> <P> In its statement Thursday, National Lumber reiterated that it was continuing to  study steps to restructure, including seeking new capital and greater credit.  The company has been negotiating for several weeks with its major secured  creditor, Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., National Lumber has been seeking to  restructure its $13-million revolving credit account with Fidelcor under a  two-year agreement.  </P> <P> The company reiterated that it is considering a Chapter 11 filing under the  Federal Bankruptcy Code. Such a petition would allow the company to reorganize  while protecting it from its creditors.  </P> <P> The company also said it is continuing to refocus its marketing strategy. It is  considering subleasing space in stores to other enterprises and trying to  implement new marketing strategies in its stores, such as creating centers for  sales of French-style doors and windows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> National Lumber, in an attempt to stem mounting losses, plans to close six  Southland stores and lay off 165 employees.  </P> <P> STORES CLOSING:  </P> <P> Riverside  </P> <P> Moreno Valley  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P> <P> Covina  </P> <P> </P> <P> PERFORMANCE:  </P> <P> Statement for National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. as of Oct. 31, 1989, most  recent available.

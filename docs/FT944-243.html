			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Zimbabwe tobacco growers diversify by choice Sir, I refer to your excellent article, 'Zimbabwe's flower exports take to the sky' (December 21). It is incorrect to say that 'the (flower) industry took off when white tobacco farmers decided to diversify, fearing the strength of the anti-smoking lobby in the west'. Traditionally, tobacco production has been the mainstay of farming in those areas of Zimbabwe suitable for this purpose. However, generations of tobacco farmers have recognised the danger of having all your eggs in one basket and have attempted different forms of diversification. I well remember the governor of the Reserve Bank, when opening the annual tobacco congress in 1961, exhorting tobacco growers to diversify and suggesting ground nuts as a possible crop. This diversification has ebbed and flowed over the years, depending on the prevailing economic return of tobacco vis a vis that of alternative crops. Horticulture is presently the most popular alternative source of income for tobacco farmers. Not because of a fear of declining tobacco fortunes due to the anti-smoking campaign but because horticulture currently enjoys a satisfactory return on each dollar invested. To achieve such a return does, however, require a massive initial capital investment. Tobacco is the only crop which can significantly carry that investment until the first return is realised.

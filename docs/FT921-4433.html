			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BBA faces another gloomy year in its main markets BBA, the maker of automotive components which yesterday reported 1991 profits down by a third to Pounds 49.4m has little to cheer about entering another gloomy year in its biggest markets. Admittedly the group has put its house in order - about 10 per cent of the workforce has been cut, the interest charge is well down as a result of last year's rights issue and the group should not face a repeat of significant exceptional costs relating to restructuring. This should lead to an increase in 1992 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 11m even without an improvement in the main markets of UK, Australia, France, Italy and Spain. At Pounds 60m of profits for the full year, and earnings per share of 9p, BBA is on a fairly heady prospective earnings multiple of over 14 times. But there is not much room for manoeuvre. The group is confident that the German market, which improved last year, is holding up this year year despite the country's growing economic problems. But any reversal there would hit the group at a time when gearing at 42 per cent is relatively high less than a year after a Pounds 79m rights issue. The group is operationally geared for recovery when it arrives. But in the automotive industry, in particular, its customers are going to be keen not to let BBA recover margin it has had to forfeit during the recession.</p>

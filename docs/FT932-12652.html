			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Italian rally greets easing of political uncertainty ITALIAN government bonds rallied yesterday as the market welcomed the appointment of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, as prime minister designate. The half-point advance - with the BTP futures contract up by 47 basis points to 97.22 - was fuelled partly by relief at the end to uncertainty after the resignation of Giuliano Amato's government last Thursday and partly by the market's approval of Mr Ciampi. He is regarded as a strong defender of the lira and as lending weight to efforts to cut the budget deficit. His lack of political experience was seen as an advantage by some. GERMAN government bond prices fell by nearly half a point on concerns over disappointing inflation figures and anxiety over the situation in Bosnia. Inflation was at the high end of expectations - in Hesse, the rate rose to 5 per cent. Last week's cuts in the Lombard and discount rates have diluted interest in today's announcement on the repo rate, expected by some dealers to fall below 8 per cent. THE PROSPECT of further interest rate cuts in France is dominating the French government bond market, helping the shorter end to hold up quite well while demand is thin for longer-dated stock. This was reflected in a widening of spreads between French and German 10-year benchmarks, while the short end - bonds due 1994, for instance - saw a narrowing in yield spreads. IN THE UK, news of a third quarter of growth in gross domestic product caused few ripples in the UK government bond market. Excluding oil and gas, a rise of 0.6 per cent, compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, was seen as confirming that economic recovery is under way. Economists have turned their attention to the associated potential drawbacks: rising inflation rates, growth in the trade deficit and the possibility that the next move in interest rates will be up rather than down. Bearish tendencies have been to the fore ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3bn of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998. But, with a pattern established of prices making up some lost ground before each day's close, there is clearly support at the cheaper levels. Both the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 and the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 ended the day less than  1/4 point down after losing nearer half a point in the morning. THE Spanish bond market's worries, centring on the continued attack on the peseta, were intensified by reports of the Bank of Spain's low reserves. This has raised the spectre of a reimposition of exchange controls which caused a flight from the bond market last autumn. US TREASURY prices eased at the long end yesterday but shorter-dated maturities mostly held their ground as dealers and investors kept a watchful eye on higher precious metals and commodity prices. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 103 13/16 , yielding 6.821 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was only slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.738 per cent. Trading was extremely quiet, said dealers. The recent rise in gold prices has unnerved the bond market, especially reports over the weekend that Mr George Soros, the billionaire money manager, was moving some of his money out of bonds and into gold interests. Investors reportedly have been moving into gold as a safe haven during uncertainty over the outcome of the referendum in Russia. The market was also worried by a small uptick in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodity prices. On the economic front, news of a 2.9 per cent decline in March existing home sales had little impact on sentiment. Once again, the weakness in the data was attributed primarily to the effect on the housing market of last month's severe winter storms. One other factor affecting prices yesterday was awareness of supply pressures, in the shape of today's auction of Dollars 15.25bn in two-year notes and tomorrow's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. THE JAPANESE government bond market remained quiet in the absence of new data and ahead of the Golden Week holidays which start on Thursday. Economists said the fundamentals remained favourable to bonds. Economic weakness, including fears that the strong yen would undermine recovery, was expected to show through in retail sales figures, out today, and in flat levels of industrial production. On Friday, inflation figures may show rates of less than 1 per cent.</p>

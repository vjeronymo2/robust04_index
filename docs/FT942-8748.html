			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Fresh calls for Scott to resign Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister for the disabled, was under pressure to resign last night after he admitted ordering 'wrecking' amendments to the disabled civil rights bill shortly before a Commons debate. Mr Scott apologised to MPs last week for misleading the Commons by denying that his department had helped draft amendments moved by Conservative MPs which effectively killed the bill. Senior ministers defended Mr Scott's continued presence in the government on the grounds that he had not intended to mislead MPs - traditionally regarded as a serious parliamentary offence. But in a written answer to a parliamentary question from Mr Alf Morris, Labour MP for Manchester Wythenshawe, Mr Scott admitted that he authorised the drafting of amendments just 16 days before the bill was debated. Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood, said the short interval showed that it was 'inconceivable that this could be an oversight'. Mr Berry said Mr John Major should sack Mr Scott if he refused to resign immediately. 'Clearly he knew what he was doing, and he lied to the House,' he said. Pressure on Mr Scott appeared to have eased last week after Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, decided not to initiate an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee. The civil rights disablement bill would have required a big increase in facilities for disabled people. Meanwhile ministers were yesterday being pressed to reconsider the disablement bill as Labour MPs pressed to bring the legislation before parliament for the second time in a fortnight. The bill, which would force companies to provide facilities for disabled employees, was again the focus of angry scenes in the Commons after Labour MPs claimed that the government was trying to ensure that it could not be debated. Ministers have opposed the private member's bill, arguing that it would cost industry around Pounds 17bn in capital expenditure, with an additional Pounds 1bn in annual running costs. Mr Chris Smith, shadow energy minister, yesterday accused the government of trying to wreck an opposition bill to improve energy conservation by tabling hundreds of amendments. He said ministers should provide government time to debate the bill, which has wide cross-party support. 'If they do not, they will have proved that they are hostile to the very idea of energy conservation,' he said.</p>

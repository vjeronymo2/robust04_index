			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr--The NATO decision on air strikes  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the very moment when ways to resolve  the Bosnian conflict have just emerged, is very unfortunate,  badly timed, and therefore causes disappointment, Vladimir  Lukin, chairman of the committee for international affairs of  the State Duma, told ITAR-TASS. He is in Strasbourg with a  Russian parliamentary delegation, which is taking part in the  regular session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe here.    First, procedural and legal aspects of these actions are  unclear, Lukin said. As we know, the UN Security Council has  decided that such actions are possible, as long as they are  sanctioned by the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  following consultations with the Security Council and are to  achieve tangible, definite goals. That is why I believe that one  should convene the Security Council and find out whether these  actions are in line with the adopted resolution. I seriously  doubt it though. Besides, they were undertaken without  preliminary consultations, including those with Russia.    Lukin also stressed the other serious aspect of this  problem.  Such actions had been attempted for the first time in Sarajevo,  but they had then been blocked--mainly because of the active  efforts of Russian diplomacy--he recalled. Following that, a  special envoy of the Russian Federation president made some  effective steps, and the crisis around Sarajevo was thus  resolved. The same happened in the Serb Krajina. One would  think that a way has been found to defuse such critical  situations that imminently occur in a civil war.    "Therefore, when the situation in Gorazde aggravated  again--and here I admit that the Serb side, some Serb  commanders, may have been at fault--it was necessary to take  additional steps in order to give an immediate boost to the  peace process. That is exactly what Russia has done," Lukin  said.    A special Russian Federation presidential envoy sent to  Belgrade held very serious and intensive conversations there.  Exactly at the same time, the blow--not agreed with anyone--was  dealt. This looks very much like a provocation. Such an air  strike will unavoidably complicate the situation and excite the  right wing of all hues--both Serb, Muslim, and foreign, Lukin  concluded.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS ASK SALE OF OFFICIAL CARS  </P> <P> Soviet lawmakers grappling for the first time with a government budget  suggested on Monday that the vast fleet of official luxury cars be auctioned to  help cut the budget deficit.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet (Parliament) also proposed hefty taxes on cigarettes and  beer to try to pare an estimated $143 billion budget deficit down to $95  billion, at the official rate of exchange.  </P> <P> Selling off the official automobiles would raise $398 million, while a 30% tax  on tobacco and a 20% tax on beer would provide $3.7 billion in revenue,  according to Finance Minister Valentin S. Pavlov.  </P></p>

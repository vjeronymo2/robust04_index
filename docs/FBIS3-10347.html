The  Canadian ministers and the Mexican secretaries and deputy  secretaries comprised four groups that analyzed the possibility  of bilateral cooperation in the transportation, agriculture,  environment, and commerce sectors.    Mexican Communications and Transportation Secretary Emilio  Gamboa and Canadian Transportation Minister Douglas Young signed  three transportation agreements that will allow reciprocal entry  to drivers who carry products; the bilateral recognition of  commercial drivers' licenses; and technical cooperation in  training programs.    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and Secretary Manuel  Tello discussed regional and global politics. The Canadian  foreign minister termed as surprising the efforts exerted to  make the process as democratic as possible and said Canada  believes in the political and social future of Mexico. Minister  Ouellet also referred to the Chiapas conflict. He said Canada  supports the actions carried out by the Mexican Government and  encourages President Salinas de Gortari to continue along the  same path. The Canadian foreign minister and Secretary Tello  supported Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy for OAS  secretary general Secretariat and they reasserted their support  for the lifting of the blockade in Cuba.    The next ministerial meeting will be held in Canada in 1995.</p>

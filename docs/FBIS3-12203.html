			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "official spokesman" -- read by </F> announcer]    [Text] The Syrian public opinion was shocked to hear the  news of the horrible massacre which was committed by armed  Israeli elements against Palestinian worshipers inside Hebron's  holy Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today in which dozens were martyred  and hundreds injured.    This outrageous act, which reminds the Arabs and Muslims of  the Dayr Yasin Massacre in 1948, emphasizes to the whole world  the extreme seriousness of the continuing Israeli occupation of  the territories and settling in it in contravention of all laws  and statutes and as a flagrant challenge to the UN resolutions  and Charter.    It has become clear to the entire international community  that Israel's intransigent stands, expansionist aims, and the  policies of evasion and procrastination which it has been  following in the peace talks for more than two years are the  primary cause of the acts of violence in the occupied Arab  territories. Israel is responsible, directly or indirectly, for  extremism in the region.    Syria, which is aware that the whole world deplores this  savage massacre, is well aware that words of denunciation and  condemnation are not enough to end the circles of violence and  terror, and that an end to the Israeli occupation without  further procrastination and stalling within the framework of the  current peace talks [fi itari muhadathat al-salam al-jariyah]  and allowing the Palestinian people to acquire their right of  self-determination will ensure ending extremism and acts of  violence and realizing just and comprehensive peace in the  region.</p>

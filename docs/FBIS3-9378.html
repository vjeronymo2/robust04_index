			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 23 Mar (TANJUG) -- A UN convoy bound for  Maglaj was stopped today near the village of Crna Rijeka west of  Novi Seher because the road was mined, we have learned from  Srpska republic army sources.    The convoy was stopped and all personnel were warned that  the  road was mined. The drivers and crew left the vehicles, and the  Srpska republic army provided safety for the convoy to avoid the  possibility of theft and plunder.    According to Serb military sources, claims published by  foreign media that the Srpska army plundered the convoy were  incorrect. This is yet another attempt at vilifying and  accusing the Serb side of a lack of cooperation, the Srpska  republic army sources say.</p>

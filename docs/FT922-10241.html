			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: US broker defends bond trades with insurer MERRILL LYNCH yesterday told a Senate subcommittee its junk bond trades with Guarantee Security Life Insurance, the insolvent Florida insurer, were proper, and did not constitute illegal 'parking' of securities, Agencies report. The broker, the biggest in the US, is defending itself before the permanent investigations subcommittee, chaired by the powerful Democrat, Nr Sam Nunn. Merrill executives said its dealings with the insurer were reported to the state insurance regulators in Florida. Parking refers to a short-term sale and repurchase of securities, with the aim of dressing-up an investment portfolio temporarily. However, Mr Nunn reportedly peppered Merrill Lynch witnesses with pointed questions suggesting the trades were not real transactions. The Florida insurance commissioner, Mr Tom Gallagher, has already told the subcommittee the trades were merely paper transactions used by the insurer to inflate its assets. Guarantee Security was seized by the regulators in August and declared insolvent. Since then, the deputy receiver for the insurer has alleged that Merrill helped to hide Guarantee's holdings of high-yield securities from regulators, by temporarily exchanging them for government securities at the end of each financial year. Merrill has denied any impropriety, but the insurance regulators have filed a civil suit against the brokerage house, along with certain former advisers to the company. The Senate hearings come at a time when insurance in the US has acquired heavy political overtones, adds Nikki Tait in New York. Some members of the Democrat-controlled Congress are attempting to introduce some form of federal supervision of the sector.</p>

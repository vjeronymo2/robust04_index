			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Money advice SOME HALF a million households in the UK are struggling with multiple debts that they cannot meet. According to a report published last week by the National Consumer Council, only one in seven can hope to receive advice on how best to deal with their difficulties. Such advice cannot solve the problem. But it would help. Unfortunately, nobody can agree on how it should be funded. The NCC's concerns over the inadequate funding of money advice parallels that of Sir George Blunden, chairman of the Money Advice Trust. Established to raise money on a voluntary basis from private business, the Trust managed to obtain only Pounds 252,000 last year. Its three-year target of Pounds 9m looks as remote as the moon. No wonder Sir George has expressed his disappointment, singling out building societies for their failure to contribute. His complaints are justified. More than three-quarters of the Pounds 417bn in personal debt outstanding at the end of 1991 was for house purchase. Yet many building societies simply blame government policy, the behaviour of other lenders, or the imprudence or ill luck of borrowers. They also argue that they are dealing with arrears satisfactorily, by providing advice directly to their customers, even though advice provided by one lender cannot be enough for people with multiple debts. The societies conclude that government should provide the funds. Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry wants funding to come from the private sector. Yet the government and the private sector do agree that a statutory levy on private industry is out of the question. All the while, money advice remains underfunded. The question then is how advice should be funded. Here three points need to be made. First, since there is a public interest in the provision of money advice, the government has a responsibility for ensuring that such advice is provided. Second, voluntary funding is always likely to be inadequate, since it is in the interest of each potential donor to be backward in coming forward. Third, lenders for home purchase bear partial responsibility for the problem, since their lax lending policies did much to entice individuals into excessive borrowing. What is needed, as the NCC argues, is mixed funding of money advice by central and local government and the private sector. The private sector is now being asked to make its contribution voluntarily. Since the total sum required is not large, perhaps the funds will be forthcoming. But this looks unlikely. The alternative is compulsion. A statutory levy on lenders would be arbitrary, but no more so than the current unequal pattern of voluntary contributions. Moreover, the disadvantages of a modest levy cannot exceed those of failure to fund advice adequately. Lenders are on trial. If they do not contribute voluntarily, they should be condemned to compulsion.</p>

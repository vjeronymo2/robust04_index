			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Silver takes lead in bullion market SILVER TOOK over the role of pace maker in the precious metals market this week. Having been towed into higher ground by gold's strength, silver prices spent the early part of the week consolidating those gains before moving ahead strongly to a six-month high on US commission house and investment fund buying. The rise took the cash price at the London bullion market through stiff resistance at at 425 cents a troy ounce on Thursday, when the market easily absorbed a bout of Middle East selling, and despite easing back by 6 cents yesterday it closed at 430 cents an ounce, a net gain of 18 cents. Traders noted that the advance was aided by improved sentiment on the outlook for the US economy. Silver's strength spilled over into the gold and platinum markets, which had earlier surrendered some of last week's gains. After dipping to Dollars 353.90 an ounce the gold price was pushed up to Dollars 357.65 an ounce before meeting stiff resistance. It closed yesterday at Dollars 356.35 an ounce, down Dollars 1.40 on the week. Meanwhile the platinum price rallied from Tuesday's low of Dollars 332 an ounce to Dollars 348 an ounce, up Dollars 6.25 on balance. At the London Metal Exchange the leading base metals contracts also built on last week's gains. The sharpest gains were for aluminium, up Dollars 51 at Dollars 1,188 a tonne in the cash position; copper, up Pounds 34 at Pounds 1,210; and nickel, up Dollars 390 at Dollars 7,710. Aluminium's rise started in mid-week after dealer purchases and option covering triggered a wave of stop-loss buying. In the absence a fundamental explanation dealers put the advance down to investment fund and speculator buying. But they noted that gains were limited by producer selling and that, suggested Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Car, Kitcat &amp; Aitken, indicated that producers felt the market would 'get worse before it gets better'. Nevertheless, as aluminium tends to lead the base metals out of recession, because of its use in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products, the market's improved sentiment was reflected in other LME contracts. Copper in particular benefited from aluminium's strength, after a threat of a temporary stoppage, because of financial difficulties, at the huge La Oroya complex in Peru, which produces about 50,000 tonnes of copper a year, failed to materialise. Yesterday the price fell back Pounds 11 in spite of news that Inco of Canada had declared force majeure on shipments from its Copper Cliff refinery because of furnace failures. According to the company, however, output losses should amount to only about 7,700 tonnes. The La Oroya fears also affected the zinc market, which already had its tail up because of Monday's announcement that Nuova Samim of Italy would be closing its 100,000 tonnes-a-year Crotone smelter in southern Italy for a refit at some time during the first half of this year. That followed the announcement of the closure of Union Miniere's 120,000-tonne Overpelt smelter in Belgium. Cash zinc closed on the LME yesterday at Dollars 1,161 a tonne, up Dollars 24.50 on the week. Concern over Russian supplies was chiefly responsible for the rise in the nickel market. President Yeltsin was quoted in a local newspaper in the town of Nikel as saying that the huge nickel complex in the area should be closed because it was uneconomic. Analysts played down the significance of this, however, pointing out that Mr Yeltsin said the closure should follow Russia's switch to a free market economy, which could take a very long time. There was also some talk circulating early yesterday of difficulties at Outokumpu's 14,000 tonnes-a-year Harjavalta plant in western Finland. But this was denied by the company. Tin and lead were again left out of the uptrend, the former dipping at one point to a fresh life-of-contract low of Dollars 5,485 a tonne in the three months position. Lead continued to be depressed by flat battery sales and the cash position closed yesterday at Pounds 287.50 a tonne, down Pounds 2.50 on the week. At the London Futures and Options Exchange, the cocoa market, after devoting a few days to consolidation, resumed its recent uptrend. Helped by sterling's decline against the dollar and news of a bigger-than-expected 10.8 per cent rise in UK fourth quarter bean grindings (compared with the same period last year) the May delivery position ended Pounds 12 up on the week at Pounds 772 a tonne. The currency factor also boosted sterling coffee futures.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium     +6,575  to  1,036,375 Copper        -3,050  to  327,850 Lead          +1,175  to  127,550 Nickel        +684    to  14,820 Zinc          +1,575  to  159,950 Tin           +275    to  14,055  ----------------------------------------</p>

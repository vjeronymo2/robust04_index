			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / 'Bored' junior auditors take short cuts JUNIOR AUDITORS take short cuts in their work while older tax accountants tend to sympathise more with the Inland Revenue than their clients, according to two academic papers circulated yesterday at the British Accounting Association annual conference in Glasgow. Only 22 per cent of a sample of 112 newly qualified accountants had not indulged in 'irregular audit practices', Ms Caroline Willett and Mr Michael Page of the University of Portsmouth said. As a result of time pressure, more than half of the respondents said they had been tempted to reject awkward-looking items from an audit sample, and a quarter were tempted to accept audit evidence about which they were doubtful. A total of 30 per cent had been tempted to hasten audit testing because they believed the work was boring and 41 per cent because they thought it was unimportant. The findings, if they are representative, may cause embarrassment to accountancy firms but some academics at the conference criticised the research methods used. The researchers were accused of asking leading questions. In a separate study, researchers from the University of Bradford said that taxpayers who were looking for a tax adviser sympathetic to their burdens should seek out someone young, professionally qualified and practising in a firm with no fewer than three partners. The study found that decisions taken by advisers depended on factors such as age and formal training, as well as technical knowledge of the tax system and interpretation of tax law. Based on a survey of 113 practitioners, the researchers concluded that most had a high standard of morality over the issue of taxpayers withholding information. A third said they would inform only the client if information had been deliberately withheld. Two thirds said they would also inform the Inland Revenue. But the proportion who would contact the Revenue rose from 31 per cent for those aged up to 35, to 83 per cent for those older than 50.</p>

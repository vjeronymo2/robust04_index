			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chugayev: "First Attempt To Keep People </F> Out of Presidential Elections Made in Duma"]    [Text] Addressing a plenary sitting of the State Duma on  11 March V. Isakov, chairman of the principal Duma committee, on  legislation and judicial and legal reform, unexpectedly proposed  a new way of electing the Russian president. Not by a  nationwide vote, but by a kind of new Assembly of the Land,  comprising the members of the Federation Council and  representatives of the territories. V. Isakov's reasoning was  that nationwide presidential elections would lead to the  destabilization of the political situation in Russia and could  split it into several warring camps. So, in his view, depriving  voters of the only check on the supreme authority they have left  following the adoption of the new Constitution -- the right to  elect the country's president once every four years -- is a  stabilizing factor.    It is worth noting that V. Isakov's proposal sounded as  though it was supposed to develop the detailed report by Duma  chairman I. Rybkin, the main theme of which was approximately as  follows: The Duma is switching from political battles to  productive lawmaking. The main grounds for this switch, it was  indicated, is the prospect of achieving civil peace and accord  in the country. In fact, support for the ideas put forward by  the president in his message to parliament on the part of very  diverse political forces represented in the Duma was all but the  leitmotiv of the 11 March debate. In particular,  representatives of the communists and the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] voiced considerable approval, noting  that B. Yeltsin's program coincided with their own party  programs. Perhaps only "Russia's Choice" was critical of the  ideas announced by the executive authority, thus ending up in a  minority. But does this mean one can say that the evolution of  the president's views, as recorded in his message to parliament  and confirmed by the draft budget message, paves the way for the  longed-for civil peace?    I. Rybkin immediately and publicly disavowed V. Isakov's  statement, saying that he did it "off his own bat." But,  knowing V. Isakov, as I do, from his activities in the old  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, it is hard to imagine that  one of the most experienced parliamentary politicians would have  gotten carried away suddenly and would have put forward for no  particular reason ideas that grossly contradict the basic  provisions of the Constitution.    The timing was very specific. The results of the vote on the  question of the 23 February political amnesty convincingly  demonstrated that the section of the Duma in opposition to the  president had managed to form an overwhelming majority by  winning over a number of centrist factions. According to the  calculations of analytical group experts A. Sobyanin, E. Gelman,  and O. Kayunov, this majority needs 20-25 votes to obtain a  two-thirds advantage and the corresponding opportunity to adopt  the constitutional decisions it needs. According to these  experts, the political temperature in the State Duma today is  similar to what it was at the seventh Congress of Russian  Federation People's Deputies. So there are grounds for saying  that the opposition has succeeded in capturing the first planned  position in its fight against the president and it is massing  for an assault on the second position. This position was very  clearly indicated by V. Isakov -- the president as the "main  source of destabilization."    Addressing his colleagues on Friday, the Duma speaker  shared with them his idea of turning every Duma committee into a  "miniparliament," in which all work on the preparation and  discussion of draft laws is to be concentrated. All the voting  on draft laws and other acts that have been prepared and agreed  in advance is to be carried out at these sittings, without any  debate.    The idea is not new and has been used with some success in  world parliamentary practice. In Japan, for instance, or the  United States, whence the Duma speaker returned on the eve of  the sitting. Certainly, the new scheme for organizing lawmaking  work, proposed by I. Rybkin, will make it possible to avoid the  various excesses taking place at plenary sittings, which  immediately become known to the general electorate and are not  nice for the Duma. Indeed, it would save considerable time.    But, at the same time, all these obvious merits are relevant  only to an established political system in which the rules of  the game are clearly defined and are strictly observed by  everyone. The gist of the rules is that the opinion of all  political factions and groups in parliament will definitely be  considered when draft laws are being devised. But in the case  of the Russian Duma there is strong reason to believe that  extensive discussion is probably being replaced by the diktat of  committees in which, as a rule, one faction or another occupies  key positions. At any rate, that was precisely the case in the  old Russian Supreme Soviet, and the same trends are apparent in  the Duma.    Among the key legislative acts in the Duma's drafting  program  three very important draft laws are to be devised (and  effectively adopted, if I. Rybkin's proposed drafting model is  introduced) by the Committee on Legislation and Judicial and  Legal Reform headed by V. Isakov. They are draft laws on the  Constitutional Court, on the elections to the State Duma, and on  Russian presidential elections. In view of the very real  possibility of the Duma democratic minority's being denied  participation in the preparation of these draft laws and the  opposition's possession of a virtual constitutional majority,  the likelihood of the adoption of a Law on the Constitutional  Court enabling the opposition to subject the president to an  impeachment procedure or of a Law on Presidential Elections  along the lines of that proposed by V. Isakov, should be  regarded as very real.    It is hard to say right now to what extent nationwide  presidential elections might destabilize the situation among  ordinary Russian voters. But they are certainly destabilizing  the situation among the central and regional bureaucracy. The  Duma politicians on whom the nomenklatura is banking are  themselves very well aware that none of them has any chance of  winning the presidential race. So it is highly likely that a  "dark horse" will breast the tape and cause really serious  trouble for the political and nomenklatura elite both in the  capital and in the provinces. It was for that very reason,  presumably, that the proposal to keep the consideration of new  presidential candidates and, accordingly, the membership of the  new government "in the family" was made. To conduct the  bargaining without witnesses and share out top state posts in  accordance with the principle: You support our candidate for  this post and we will support your candidate for that post. This  is the only way the political forces behind V. Isakov will have  a chance to get back into power in Russia. It is typical that  in the corridors of the Duma V. Isakov expressed every  confidence that his idea would meet with approval in the  Federation Council.    So V. Isakov's statement looks more than anything like a  trial balloon, launched in order to discover how far it is  possible to go at the moment in the proposed direction, along  the path leading, whether V. Isakov likes it or not, to the  establishment of nomenklatura diktat in the country and creation  of a state system over which citizens would have no control (in  this respect I. Rybkin's proposal on dispensing with debates at  Duma plenary sittings looks very logical).    As for the president's latest actions, for which he even won  praise in some communist newspapers, it appears they merely  facilitate the opposition's progress along this path, since they  cause schism and confusion in the ranks of the democrats. But  V. Isakov honestly and candidly gave to undertsand that if B.  Yeltsin were to declare himself tomorrow to be the sternest  statist and loyalest Leninist he would still be the opposition's  "number one target."</p>

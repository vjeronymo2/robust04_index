			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Friday [27 May] that no formal deadline has been  fixed for conclusion of "framework" trade negotiations with the  United States, set for resumption after a three-month deadlock.    Kakizawa, responding to questions before the House of  Representatives Budget Committee, said it is nevertheless  desirable that the talks be brought to an early conclusion.    The foreign minister said he confirmed the absence of a  deadline in a recent telephone conversation with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor.    But Kantor has reportedly suggested bilateral talks on  government procurement be wound up by the end of June, while  negotiations in other sectors should be concluded before the end  of September, when the U.S. administration is scheduled to  decide whether to invoke the Super 301 trade provision that  permits sanctions against countries allegedly practicing unfair  trade.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee that Japan  would take recourse to arbitration in the framework of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington opts  for sanctions.</p>

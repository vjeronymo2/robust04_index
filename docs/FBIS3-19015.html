			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valencian Premier Joan Lerma by Luis R. </F> Aizpeolea in Valencia; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Aizpeolea] Do you not  believe the key to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] is  the breakup of the Gonzalez-Guerra tandem?    [Lerma] It is a reductionist key. Spain has changed a great  deal, and the most important thing is that the model of  exercising power went into crisis with the Spain of the  autonomous communities. Decisions can no longer be made from a  single place. There are also new social groups involved. There  is women's participation. The problem which arises is that as  the democratization process advances, the parties are trying to  centralize it more. This is the case with the People's Party.  We are approaching more the modern model of acknowledging  diversity.    [Aizpeolea] But Guerra divides the PSOE into Socialists and  social liberals...    [Lerma] Everybody tends to classify things in terms of what  he upholds. There cannot be so much reductionism. These years  will be years of the triumph of diversity and tolerance. The  right-left division must be qualified with new elements. It is  not left-wing to believe that power must be completely  centralized or to make a nonparticipatory model. It is  left-wing to democratize power to the utmost.    [Aizpeolea] Do you not recognize Guerra as the left?    [Lerma] Many people view Alfonso Guerra as a model of the  left, but Guerra does not have a monopoly on this model. On  some things, such as his criticisms of the right, it is easy to  agree. On others, it is not easy. It is very important for the  left not to be exclusive and for nobody to have a monopoly on  the left.    [Aizpeolea] So what are the differences between renewalists  and Guerraists? Is it a power struggle?    [Lerma] It is not just a matter of a power struggle. This  is a left-wing party all in all, and if there are social  liberals, they are very few. The differences are in priorities.  The complexity in the party is that of the end of the 20th  century, when there are economic demands and others which are  not, such as women's emancipation, the environment,  self-fulfillment, and the defense of freedoms. The party cannot  uphold an economic model alone. Integration means combining the  two things.    [Aizpeolea] Are you in favor of a Gonzalez-Guerra agreement?    [Lerma] The secretary general is the man responsible for  forming the Executive Committee, and he must do so in accordance  with the aspirations of the grassroots. Nobody can dispute  this, but the congress has the responsibility of endorsing it.  It is necessary to talk to everybody and formulate a majority  program. I approve of Guerra's being on it, because the  Executive Committee should be open.    [Aizpeolea] What is your opinion of the terms of balance and  political weight set by Guerra?    [Lerma] They are not terms. They are matters of common  sense.    [Aizpeolea] But it is to be deduced from his terms that his  group of close associates should be on the Executive Committee.    [Lerma] The presence of this person or that does not shape  the Executive Committee's outlook. I have no objection to their  all staying on. I have an excellent relationship with them;  they have worked, and I approve of their being recognized.    [Aizpeolea] Could not the image of renewal be eroded by  the aforementioned group's presence?    [Lerma] A considerable amount of renewal must be introduced,  but I do not believe that the amount will be affected by four or  five people out of 33. The key to an Executive Committee is not  its specific role but it ability to formulate specific  renovating proposals. The people make the post.    [Aizpeolea] Who should predominate in the new Executive  Committee? Renewalists? Guerraists?    [Lerma] New faces in order to tackle new problems. It seems  to me very important that the new faces be in the majority.  Neither Guerraists nor old-style renewalists. We should not be  timid in this.    [Aizpeolea] What characterizes the so-called integrationists  whom you represent?    [Lerma] We wish to represent a major renewal in the left's  thinking -- a new model of social contract. Let decent  pensions, public health, and education be maintained, through an  economic policy proposal similar to the Delors plan (Jacques  Delors is the European Commission president). We will also  advocate a different way of exercising power. The freedoms  policy should have a more preponderant role in the Socialist  government's policy. We should not allow anybody to take the  flag of freedoms from us. We have placed too much emphasis on  the antiterrorist policy and the order policy, and this has been  very closely linked to a certain minister's personality.    [Aizpeolea] Alfonso Guerra says that there is no longer talk  of Spain.    [Lerma] This is a short-term and undramatic situation. We  have witnessed a process of everybody's being taken back to his  territory, in which everybody speaks of his own affairs, but  this is unreal, because we are all interconnected and linked to  Spain and the European Union. We must find a formula for  integration in order to end these strains. People will not  speak of Spain if it is an exclusive idea of its nature. In  order to integrate, it is necessary to speak of Spain as being  diverse and plural, as everybody's common heritage -- a diverse,  plural, and nonuniform Spain. [passage omitted]</p>

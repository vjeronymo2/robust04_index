			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who also heads his party group in the  State Duma, has described the coming visit of President Bill  Clinton to Moscow as unnecessary and useless. In his opinion  the visit discredits Clinton because "Russians are going to see  he has come to support a team of bankers -- the Gaydar  government."    In Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Zhirinovskiy called the  refusal of the American president to meet him a mistake. At the  same time Zhirinovskiy is grateful for the refusal because this  "gave credit to the leader of Liberal Democrats and added votes."    "Russians know that all this disarray was organized from the  West, it was mostly Americans who helped our Democratic Russia  to undermine the country," Zhirinovskiy declared. This refusal  "indicates that I am the only honest and clean politician  because the person who helps to undermine the country does not  want to meet me".    A leading figure in the Communist group in the State Duma  Victor Ilyukhin does not attach any hopes to the Clinton visit.  "America has never wanted and will never want Russia to be a  strong power, the main purpose of the United States is to split  Russia and get free access to its energy resources", he told  INTERFAX on Tuesday.    Ilyukhin feels that lately Russia "has involuntarily stopped  planning its home and foreign policies and has been living on  hints from the United States." He attributed the coming visit  to the need "to support the Russian president and government"  after the December elections that demonstrated, in his opinion,  that "the situation has notably changed to the disadvantage of  the ruling regime."    A leading figure in another parliamentary group Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy does not expect anything special and thinks the visit  will be simply a pleasant exchange of opinions between the two  presidents.    Neither does the leader of the Democratic Party Nikolay  Travkin believe that the United States can help Russia in any  way. If Russia were recognized as an equal partner in politics  and economy, this would help Russia best. "We do not need any  tips," Travkin thinks.    A member of the presidential council Andranik Migranian has  told journalists that President Clinton is going to make a  mistake if he selects the participants for his meeting with the  leaders of political parties and groups. If Clinton simply  refuses to meet Zhirinovskiy, the advisor does not see a great  problem in that. However, if he refuses to meet other opposition  groups too, this will give the opposition another pretext to  criticize democratic parties for their excessively close ties  with the United States.</p>

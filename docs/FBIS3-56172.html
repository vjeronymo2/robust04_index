He pointed out that "this is the product of work of the  Armenian propaganda machine." The Armenian party, the minister  said, strives to suppress the spirit of the Azerbaijani army  while simultaneously trying to raise the spirit of its own army.    Gasanov again accused the Armenian party of attempts to  solve  the Karabakh conflict by coercive methods.</p>

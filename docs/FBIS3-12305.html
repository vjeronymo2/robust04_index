While deploring this grotesque crime, the Royal Court  beseeches God to have mercy on the martyrs' souls and grant  their families and the Arab and Islamic nations patience and  solace. From God we came and to God we will return.    The Council of Ministers will hold a session at 2100 [1900  GMT] today to discuss the deplorable attack and crime in the  Ibrahimi Mosque, the measures to be taken by the government  toward this crime, and the continuing contacts which the  government began this morning with the ambassadors of the  members of the UN Security Council's permanent member states,  the nonaligned group, and the European Community.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has decided largely to solve the food problem in the next seven  years for the 80 million rural residents now still living in  poverty, according to the State Council.    In a state plan for poverty elimination, which is made  public  today, the State Council said that to attain that goal, it will  concentrate China's manpower, materials and funds and mobilize  all sectors of society.    "Although poor people constitute a small proportion of  China's rural population, the task for eliminating poverty is  extremely arduous," the plan said.    That is because these people are concentrated in areas with  harsh natural conditions, such as high mountainous areas, desert  areas, loess highlands and areas where much of the land has been  taken for reservoirs, it explained.    The plan outlined the following points for solving the food  problem for these 80 million people by the end of the century:    -- The overwhelming majority of poor households will score a  big increase in per-capita earnings;    -- Poor households will be assisted in creating basic  conditions for solving the food problem, such as cultivating  stable and high- yield farmland, orchards and woods, expanding  livestock breeding and sideline production;    -- The problem of insufficient drinking water will be solved  by and large;    -- Most poor townships will be linked by highways and have  electricity;    -- Primary education will be made universal and illiteracy  among adults will be eliminated;    -- Vocational education and technical training will be  promoted among adults; and    -- Endemic diseases will be prevented and brought under  control.    The plan said that officials and farmers in poor areas will  be encouraged to achieve prosperity by becoming market-oriented,  relying on the use of science and techniques, developing local  resources and expanding commodity production.    Rural residents living in areas with extremely harsh natural  conditions will be relocated, it added.    According to the plan, the State Council has decided to  increase appropriations for the poverty-elimination program from  1994.    The plan mandated local governments at all levels to  increase  funding for the program.    It also emphasized the need to promote exchanges and  cooperation with the international community in poverty  elimination.    It is imperative to try to improve the investment  environment  in poor areas and encourage overseas investors to start  productive enterprises to make full use of natural resources  there, it noted.    The plan also banned the government of any poor county from  buying cars, building luxury hotels or constructing office  buildings before the food problem is solved among local  residents.</p>

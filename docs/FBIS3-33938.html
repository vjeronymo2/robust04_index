			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by MBC </F> correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi in Washington; date not  given--recorded; Peres' remarks in English translated into  Arabic by interviewer]    [Text] [Peres] I believe that we have overcome some  important problems but we still face some dealing with substance  and wording. We will exert exceptional efforts to complete the  talks, but I do not wish to set dates because negotiations may  take a day, a week, or even a month longer than a fixed date.  This is not because of a lack of goodwill or pessimism, but  experience has taught us that some issues that we imagine to be  unimportant may emerge suddenly and cause a problem that will  need long hours of negotiations to resolve.    [Fahmi] Why does Israel insist on the need for the presence  of Israeli security officers at the crossings to search  travelers?    [Peres] There are two basic reasons. Although I believe that  'Arafat has issued orders to PLO members to halt acts of  violence and terrorism, there are other organizations that are  still carrying out such acts. Israel has to engage in  negotiations simultaneously as it faces violence and terrorism.    We told 'Arafat that as long as this situation persists we  will be strict on security issues because when a traveler  crosses to Gaza and Jericho, he enters not only these two cities  but also Israel and he has the freedom to travel in it.  Therefore, we are strict in negotiations concerning security  issues.    We suggested to 'Arafat that the security arrangements be on  a temporary basis and that if acts of violence stop, the  arrangements we have agreed upon may be revised.    [Fahmi] The Syrians still insist on your acceptance of a  complete withdrawal before they define the meaning of a complete  peace. Are we still in the same situation after the Geneva  summit?    [Peres] This does not make sense but the Syrians know our  stance on the withdrawal. They must say what they mean by a  complete peace. They must prove their willingness to accept  security arrangements that fulfill the Israeli and Syrian  security requirements.    [Fahmi] Are there secret channels for negotiations between  Syria and Israel and what are the means to achieve progress in  these negotiations?    [Peres] There are no channels for negotiations with Syria  except the Washington negotiations. However, we need to conduct  negotiations on a higher level of representation because new  proposals can be put forth. The continuation of negotiations  only at the official level means that the negotiators will keep  repeating their familiar stances.</p>

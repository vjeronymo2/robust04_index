			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Haunted by Romantics CLAIRE CLAIRMONT AND THE SHELLEYS by Robert Gittings and Jo Manton Oxford Pounds 20, 292 pages 'I WOULD willingly think that my memory may not be lost in oblivion as my life has been,' wrote Claire Clairmont in old age. As a shadowy figure on the margins of the Romantic circle that included Shelley, Byron and Mary Shelley, she has usually been presented as a brief digression in other people's lives. But, ironically, she spent much of her own life writing herself out of literary history and suppressing 'the disastrous hauntings that seemed inseparable with my name.' If Claire is remembered at all, it is as rather a pain in the neck - tagging along with Shelley and Mary when they eloped to France, or driving her beloved Byron up the wall. This sympathetic biography by the late Robert Gittings and his wife Jo Manton is designed to dig beneath the unattractive image - which was first put about by Mary Shelley's manipulative daughter-in-law - and to rehabilitate Claire as an individual in her own right. Yet despite Jo Manton's valiant attempts to give equal weight to Claire's later, rootless career as a governess, the first 24 years, narrated by Robert Gittings, remain the most compelling. Born in 1798, the illegitimate daughter of prosy, capable Mrs Clairmont, Claire's life took off at the age of three when her mother married the notorious radical William Godwin. His house was always full of books and ideas, and one of Claire's earliest memories was of listening in terror, from behind the sofa, to Coleridge reading aloud from The Ancient Mariner. It was an outwardly happy, if irregular, household, with a mixed bunch of children. Claire's closest companion was her elder step-sister, Mary. Claire's role in the triangular relationship which developed when Shelley fell for 16-year-old Mary and the three of them ran away together is hard to pin down. Though Gittings seems certain that Claire never slept with Shelley, all three were entangled in an intensely complex matrix of mixed emotions. Where Mary was depressive, Claire was volatile, sometimes to the point of hysteria. Shelley, hero-worshipped by both, was histrionic. However mutually supportive they were capable of being, Mary and Claire had a difficult relationship marked by suppressed rivalry. Though Gittings only hints at it, it seems likely that Claire's next adventure  - introducing herself into Byron's lee - was motivated in part by a sense of competitiveness with her step-sister. If Shelley was glamorous, Byron was a superstar. And, like hundreds of other teenage girls, Claire wrote him a fan letter. Unlike most, however, she was as direct as she was persistent and, booking a hotel, she invited him to spend the night with her. Byron never regarded her as much more than a one-night stand, and was only persuaded to prolong the relationship by the prospect of being introduced to Shelley, whom he found fascinating. But Byron's desertion of Claire and his insistence on having sole custody of their daughter Allegra, who died aged five in an Italian convent, shows him to have been neither true nor honourable. Allegra's death was soon followed by Shelley's. Claire was doubly traumatised. Her decision to cut herself off from her family and take up the nomadic existence of a governess, living among strangers first in Russia and then all over Europe, and religiously hiding her past from those she met, suggests someone afraid of getting too involved in relationships for fear of being hurt. However sophisticated and self-possessed she appeared in company, her inner life, though buried, seems never quite to have recovered. Perhaps because they are at pains to rescue Claire from the charge of being 'hysterical', levelled at her both by Byron and by later generations of Shelleys, Gittings and Manton stress her independent spirit and vitality of character. But though not into psychoanalysis, it is interesting how her more neurotic, vulnerable side keeps surfacing. It is easy to be tempted into lurid fantasies about the Shelley circle, and to see its members as larger-than-life actors in a tragic melodrama  - which is how Mary's daughter-in-law, guardian of the Shelley shrine, seems to have wanted to portray them when she offered a life-sized marble Mary supporting Shelley's naked corpse to the embarrassed vicar of St Peter's, Bournemouth. By allowing an undercurrent of unheroic emotional confusion to penetrate their portraits of Mary and Claire, Manton and Gittings have succeeded in humanising them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Yong-ku] </F>   [Text] In December 1993, North Korea newly formed the  South, U.S., and Japanese operation teams in the Workers' Party  of Korea [WPK] and appointed important figures to be chiefs of  the teams. This has been analyzed as a move to accelerate  opening up and actively improve relations with these countries  after the nuclear issue is resolved.    According to a Beijing source, North Korea appointed Vice  Premier Kim Tal-hyon as chief of the South operation team, party  secretary Kim Yong-sun as chief of the U.S. operation team, and  Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of  the Supreme People's Assembly, to be chief of the Japanese  operation team.    Before the three new operation teams were formed, the  central  guidance office of the three revolutions teams, which is totally  controlled by Kim Chong-il, was the only team that existed in  North Korea to carry out special missions. Thus, the  organization of the three new teams shows North Korea's great  interest in its relations with the ROK, the United States, and  Japan and is regarded as a step to prepare for improving its  relations with these countries after the nuclear issue is  resolved.    The organization of the new teams and appointments of their  chiefs were originally reported by sources in Beijing early this  year. A government official also recently said: "Special  operation teams in charge of relations with the South and the  United States have been formed in the WPK. According to  information obtained up to the present, Vice President Kim  Yong-chu and Kim Tal-hyon, who was recently discharged from the  posts of vice premier and chairman of the State Planning  Committee, take charge of the South operation team, and WPK  Secretaries Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun take charge of the  U.S. operation team." The information on Kim Yong-chu's  appointment as leader of the South operation team, however,  seems groundless because he is too old to cope with the changing  situation and because a vice president of a state would not be  appointed to lead a team with special duties.    The information on Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as leader of  the South operation team is well-grounded.    There was a rumor that Kim Tal-hyon was demoted to manager  of  the 8 February Vinalon Plant after being dismissed from the  office of vice premier of the State Administration Council at  the end of 1993. The fact is, however, that Kim is an authority  on economic affairs who is close to Kim Chong-il and that the  document on his dismissal dated 7 December 1993 reads, "..in  relation to his appointment to another position."    If he had lost power, it would have been reported that he  had been "dismissed," rather than "transferred to another post."    After being in charge of external economic affairs, he was  temporarily appointed chairman of the State Planning Committee  to deal with the Third Seven-Year Plan, which North Korea had  been expected to fail to fulfill, established a period of  adjustment, and carried out the task of coordinating economic  affairs. As shown, he is still trusted by Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il.    Considering the fact that he was once in charge of  North-South economic cooperation, he may have been transferred  to a post in charge of North-South economic cooperation, which  will be pursued when the nuclear issue is resolved, or overall  North-South relations.    Kim Yong-sun was reportedly relieved of his post of  candidate  member of the WPK Political Bureau last December, but maintains  his post of party secretary. It had been speculated that he is  no longer in charge of South Korean affairs and external  affairs. However, on 23 November 1993, he attended a Pyongyang  report meeting on the third anniversary of the founding of the  National Alliance for the Country's Reunification as an official  in charge of South Korean affairs, and last December's North  Korean Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] session confirmed that he  is still chairman of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee.    Considering North Korea's plan to promote its relations with  South Korea and Japan only after an atmosphere prevails for  improved ties with the United States, Kim Yong-sun may be  exclusively in charge of U.S. affairs.    Hwang Chang-yop, an official well versed with Japanese  affairs, who was appointed chairman of the SPA Foreign Affairs  Committee, is very likely in charge of the Japan team. Japan  has proposed resuming talks with North Korea to discuss  normalization of ties between the two countries. At such a  time, he is now visiting Beijing. This is very significant.  Still, it is very likely that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan  teams do not handle completely different jobs, that the jobs of  Kim Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon, and Hwang Chang-yop overlap, and  that Kim Chong-il personally plays a supervisory role.</p>

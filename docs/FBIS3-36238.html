			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 02, BNS -- The refusal of the Russian  negotiators to present a timetable for the withdrawal of troops  Estonian at the intergovernmental talks on Wednesday [2  Wednesday] was named as "surprising" by the Estonian Foreign  Ministry.    In its comments on the results of the negotiations released  late Wednesday, the ministry notes, that the surprise comes  since a timetable "has been repeatedly promised by Russian  spokesmen and was even mentioned in Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's recent letter to Estonian President Lennart Meri".    "Since Estonia has fundamentally accepted the August 31,  1994  final date offered by the Russians, the logical and necessary  next step was for Russia to produce a detailed timetable," -  Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik was quoted by the ministry  as saying. Luik is now in Brussels, where he is to sign the  Partnership for Peace agreement Thursday.    "Estonia still expects Russia to live up to the  international  obligations it accepted by signing the Final Document of the  Helsinki Summit in July 1992, requiring the early, orderly and  complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the  territories of the Baltic states," -- the ministry notes, --  "Although there can no longer be talk of an `early' withdrawal,  the pullout can still be completed completely, unconditionally  and in an orderly fashion."</p>

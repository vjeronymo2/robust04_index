			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Solvay warns of first-half deficit SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, warned yesterday it would record a loss for the first half of 1993, dragged down by overcapacity, recession and alleged unfair competition in the European plastics sector. Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay's chief executive, told shareholders yesterday that the group was getting 'a severe buffeting from the European storm'. He said the plastics sector in particular would suffer 'heavy losses' in the first six months, which would not be offset by earnings from the group's other activities. The outlook for the full year was 'not good', Baron Janssen added, although there were 'some small signs of improvement' in the US, Britain and Brazil. He said Solvay expected to to be able to maintain the same dividend policy for 1993, that is, 'to increase our dividend whenever possible and, if possible, not to decrease it'. Solvay directors again urged the European Commission to take action against cheap imports of soda ash and PVC from eastern Europe and the US. Solvay has lodged formal requests with Brussels for protection against unfair competition and Mr Yves Boel, the group chairman, told shareholders that Solvay was 'disturbed by the Commission's relaxed attitude in the face of such blameworthy practices'. Net profits slipped by 13.5 per cent in the first half of last year to BFr5.88bn (Dollars 176m) and in the full year profits fell from BFr11.7bn to BFr9.76bn. Shareholders yesterday voted to maintain the 1992 dividend at BFr500 a share, the same level as in 1990 and 1991. The impact of recession - particularly in the principal activities of soda ash and plastics - has forced the company to take drastic measures, including the closure of its 129-year-old Belgian soda ash plant.</p>

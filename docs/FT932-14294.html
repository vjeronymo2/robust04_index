			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Plan for Welsh local government attacked THE WALES Trades Union Congress yesterday criticised the way the government is proposing to create 21 unitary authorities for Wales to replace the eight county councils and 37 district councils. Mr Derek Gregory, chairman of the Wales TUC's social policy committee, said: 'We have been strong supporters of the creation of a unitary local authority structure in Wales for some time. Yet the manner in which the present reform is being conducted gives us some considerable cause for concern.' The Wales TUC says in its document A New Map for Local Government in Wales? published yesterday, that the timescale for the unitary authorities, due to take full responsibility in April 1995, is very tight. It says that the Welsh Office proposals would put levels and standards of service at risk and threaten to create more unemployment.</p>

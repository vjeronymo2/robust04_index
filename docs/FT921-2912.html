			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Polytechnic changes approved A NEW generation of universities was announced yesterday, after the Privy Council office gave 14 polytechnics approval to become universities under the government's higher education reforms. The Higher Education Act, which has just become law, allows polytechnics to call themselves universities. Such places as Sunderland and Huddersfield will gain universities for the first time, while Leicester, Newcastle and Liverpool all get second universities - each with a carefully chosen name. Leicester Polytechnic becomes De Montfort University, Newcastle Polytechnic will be the University of Northumbria at Newcastle and Liverpool Polytechnic, Liverpool John Moores University. The others are Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University), Polytechnic South West (University of Plymouth), Portsmouth Polytechnic (University of Portsmouth), Huddersfield Polytechnic (University of Huddersfield), Kingston Polytechnic (Kingston University), South Bank Polytechnic (South Bank University), Staffordshire Polytechnic (Staffordshire University), Teesside Polytechnic (University of Teesside) and Wolverhampton Polytechnic (University of Wolverhampton). The remaining 20 polytechnics are expected to adopt the university label soon - almost doubling the number of English universities.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Britannia to buy Dutch life arm BRITANNIA, the UK's ninth largest building society, is to buy Life Association of Scotland, the UK life-insurance subsidiary of the Dutch-based Internationale Nederlanden Group, Norma Cohen writes. The move is part of a growing trend in banks and building societies to purchase their own life-insurance subsidiaries and sell their products through their branches. Mr John Heaps, Britannia managing director, said it intends to inject about Pounds 25m into its new subsidiary over the next two years. Britannia will sell LAS products both through its 250 branches and through independent financial advisers. The direct sales operation will be integrated into Britannia's existing sales force. Britannia is the largest building society retailing its own financial-services products with Pounds 2.5bn in assets under management. LAS has Pounds 950m in assets under management.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The North side  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon) released a statement on June 12.    It warns:    "If the Japanese authorities continue their acts of  deliberately aggravating the situation, taking advantage of the  vicious pressure campaign of the United States and the South  Korean authorities against the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, in disregard of the demand of our nation, they will be  held responsible for the consequences arising therefrom."    "The raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) was  a fascist outrage against Koreans overseas and an unpardonable  political suppression," the statement says, and goes on:    "We cannot but call in question the fact that all the  hostile  acts persistently committed by the Japanese authorities against  Chongnyon are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK campaign of  the United States and the South Korean authorities.    "The Koreans residing in Japan are mostly victims who were  taken there as `labor draftees' for the Japanese imperialists'  war of aggression on the continent and forced to toils,  undergoing all manner of national humiliation and harsh  maltreatment in the past, and their descendants.    "Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, far from repenting  of this and making compensations, are repeating the past crimes  today. This naturally arouses the resentment of the whole nation.    "The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon can hardly  repress  indignation at the surprise raid on and search of Chongnyon  organisations by the Japanese police and strongly urge the  Japanese authorities to immediately stop such criminal  suppression and apologize for it and punish those responsible  for it."</p>

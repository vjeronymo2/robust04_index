			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Moody's assigns rating to issue from Sakura Moody's, the international credit rating agency, assigned a baa1 rating to Sakura Bank's proposed Y100bn (Dollars 945m) preferred stock issue, the first to be offered by a Japanese bank. The bank's capital-to-assets ratio will rise by 0.5 percentage points to 9.6 per cent as a result of the issue. The bank said the increase in capital would enable it to expand its balance sheet by increasing lending. Moody's said its rating reflected the bank's poor asset quality and low core profits. The bank plans to issue 50m shares at Y2,000 per share with an offer period between March 16 to March 22. They will be convertible into ordinary shares from July 1 this year and September 30 1997, and unconverted stocks will be changed into ordinary shares after October 1997.</p>

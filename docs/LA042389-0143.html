			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA AND RUSSIA: WHY HAVEN'T WE FOUGHT?;  </P> <P> RETREAT FROM DOOMSDAY THE OBSOLESCENCE OF MAJOR WAR BY JOHN MUELLER (BASIC  BOOKS:$20.95; 313 PP.)  </P> <P> "On May 15, 1984, the major countries of the developed world had managed to  remain at peace with each other for the longest continuous stretch of time  since the days of the Roman Empire." The achievement of this happy and steadily  extended record, writes John Mueller, was no mere matter of luck, nor was it  the product of a restraint imposed by a balance of nuclear terror. Rather it  marked another step in a historical process that began several centuries ago  when lesser European powers like Holland, Sweden and Switzerland concluded that  war was really a stupid, repulsive and futile enterprise, and determined to do  their best not to have anything more to do with it. Since then the conviction  seems to have spread among an increasing number of developed countries that,  contrary to the general view of preceding millenniums, war isn't one of life's  necessities. War certainly has not become obsolete or unthinkable. But for the  developed nations that have the most to lose from war's destructiveness it has,  argues Mueller, become "rationally unthinkable."  </P> <P> The provocative idea that major war may increasingly be regarded as no less  absurd and intolerable than dueling, slavery, bearbaiting or human sacrifice is  enormously appealing. It's also a conclusion that would seem to be supported  (if not proven) by the long peace that has prevailed among the major powers  since the end of World War II. That war, Mueller believes, may in fact come to  be seen as the war that ended wars, at least where the world's better-off  countries are concerned. Since 1945 there have been no wars among the 44  nations with the highest per capita wealth, with the single brief exception of  the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956. "Never before in history have  so many well-armed, important countries spent so much time not using their arms  against each other."  </P> <P> To be sure, the United States and the Soviet Union have gone to war since 1945,  not against each other, but with results that seem to have forced them to  reassess their ideas about expansionism and containment, and about where  national interests truly lie. The Korean War, launched nearly 40 years ago by  the Communist north with the support of the Soviet Union and China, provoked a  response that "ended any thought of flirting with . . . direct, over-the-border  war as a method for advancing the international Communist cause." The bitter  U.S. experience in Vietnam and the no less unhappy Soviet adventure in  Afghanistan seem likely to keep the superpowers from intervening in the Third  World for some time to come.  </P> <P> The central question, though, is how the the United States and the Soviet Union  have managed to steer clear of fighting each other despite the ample  opportunities and provocations that have occurred since 1945, first over broken  Soviet promises about the political future of Eastern Europe, later over  Berlin, Korea, Cuba, the Middle East. The answer, says Mueller, is that  well-publicized appearances to the contrary, the two countries have never been  remotely close to direct conflict. Earlier international wars grew out of the  conclusion of those who fought them that they were unavoidable and even  desirable as a way to settle disputes. The United States and the Soviet Union,  though, have simply never seen it in their interests to go to war. It didn't  always seem that way at various times of crisis. Yet Mueller makes a plausible  case for this conclusion.  </P> <P> First, for all of Stalin's probing for Western weak spots and dedication to  coercion and subversion, and for all of Khrushchev's bluster and  missile-rattling, Soviet policy has consistently proven to be cautious and  risk-averse. Even at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, for example, the  Soviets avoided putting their armed forces on even a demonstration alert. Like  the United States, the Soviets instead made plain they wanted to work out of  the confrontation, not intensify it. Wars, says a military historian who has  looked at every conflict since 1400, begin not by accident but because at least  one side thinks it can gain something by fighting. That conclusion has been  lacking in the U.S. -- Soviet confrontation.  </P> <P> Mueller's provocative assessment is that nuclear weapons probably have had  little to do with keeping the superpowers from direct conflict. Insofar as  military deterrence has preserved the peace, he writes, the chief constraint  has been the fear of escalation to the horribly destructive levels of World War  I or World War II. As both wars showed, it doesn't require nuclear weapons to  kill millions of people and reduce cities to rubble. The leaders of the Soviet  Union, which suffered 20 million dead in World War II, can't be accused of  always being peace-loving. But whatever the crises and bluster they have from  time to time produced, they have been careful to act ultimately with prudence  in their relations with the United States.  </P> <P> Is major war obsolescent, then? Mueller thinks the weight of evidence clearly  points that way, although he stops short of saying such wars have become  impossible. If, for example, Mikhail Gorbachev fails to get the Soviet economy  working, it is not inconceivable that growing frustration could induce him or,  more likely, his successors to turn to belligerency as a last resort. But that  seems unlikely. The chief goal of most countries today is not to grab someone  else's territory or reach for greater national glory, but to become more  prosperous and raise living standards. War is now generally recognized in the  developed world as an inefficient way to achieve prosperity. That, along with  some promising signs of greater realism and mellowing in Gorbachev's Soviet  Union, opens interesting prospects for arms control agreements and reduced  military budgets.  </P> <P> What is one to make of Mueller's analysis? It is self-evident that something  has constrained the big powers from going to war with each other since 1945,  despite plenty of chances to do so. Deducing just what considerations are  responsible for that constraint must remain a matter of informed speculation,  and all such speculation inevitably is open to argument. What can be said of  "Retreat From Doomsday" is that Mueller argues his case very well indeed.  Drawing on a vast literature, he has written a stimulating book, and a hopeful  one.  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Of rice and men; the thoughts of a mobster: John Plender is given a background briefing on Japan from an unlikely source IT SEEMED, in a well-worn phrase, to be a good idea at the time. I was making a television programme on Japan for a series on business and economics. The yakuza, Japan's notorious mobsters who sport neck-to-ankle tattoos, appeared to be cropping up in one political or financial scandal after another. Clearly, meeting a mobster was essential to a proper understanding of the financial crash that has rocked the country. Misgivings set in as we approached the Kyoto headquarters of the man who is ranked by the police as Japan's fourth-biggest gangland boss. Our charming and super-efficient Japanese fixer was becoming more nervous by the minute. Matters did not improve when we were whisked into a building by a swaggering character in a brown suit who sported a truncated little finger - a penalty the yakuza impose on themselves when they commit acts of disloyalty. Young thugs in blue uniforms watched as we lugged in our equipment. Then came the first surprise - or perhaps I should say test. The boss, Tokutaro Takayama, was not ready to be filmed. As we waited, two of the men in blue appeared with a substantial meal for us. We had finished lunch only half an hour before. No problem here for a camera crew, since the first rule of their trade is to seize every chance to eat because they never know when the next will come. For less robust seekers after truth such as reporters, producers and directors, it was another matter, especially since our Japanese colleague - now sweating profusely - was urging us to behave with all possible decorum. We prodded our noodles, wondering how the yakuza, who regard themselves as the guardians of traditional Japanese values, dealt with bad table manners. The next surprise came with the boss himself. A splendid pair of sideburns apart, there was little to distinguish him, in his spacious office, from the chairman of any large Japanese corporation. Perhaps the oversize statue of Napoleon beside his desk was a bit of a giveaway but, in most other respects, Takayama had absolutely nothing in common with Al Capone. For a start, he had written a book, full of warnings about the condition of modern Japan. Nearer to the Mafia, maybe? Absolutely and emphatically not, he insisted; the yakuza, unlike the Mafia, were patriotic and generally supportive of government. But with reservations. To my amazement, this gangland boss proceeded to harangue me about the awfulness of the politicians' failure to liberalise the rice market. The basis of Takayama's objection was that the politicians were making life needlessly expensive for the Japanese people. Perhaps, ideologically speaking, that sat neatly with the yakuza's romanticised view of themselves as latter-day Robin Hoods (no pun in Japanese). It was certainly sound economics, showing a firm grasp of the law of comparative advantage. If Takayama sounded like a free market businessman, it was because this was  -in part, at least - how he saw himself. His smart office block turned out to contain a boardroom, a lecture theatre, gym and kitchen, plus a dormitory for the blue-clad apprentices. There were some tacky features: a giant stuffed polar bear in a glass case outside the boss's office, and a battery of electronic surveillance equipment to monitor what was going on outside. But, in most other respects, Aizu Kotetsu-kai, as the outfit was called, had the trappings of a mini-Hitachi or Toyota. The reason the yakuza are able to maintain such offices openly is that the Japanese, in their bizarrely pragmatic way, have privatised much of the law and order process. Since the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the feudal period which ended with the Meiji restoration of 1868, gangsters have helped the police keep violence off the streets. In the post-war period, these outsiders were used by businessmen to intimidate unions and collect debts. Politicians used them as bodyguards and sought their organisation's votes and money. The free market ideology does not. however, extend fully to the yakuza's own activities. The trade-off with the police was that the big crime syndicates would keep non-syndicated crime under control. In other words, it operated in much the same heavily regulated way as Japan's industrial cartels. Only in the bubble economy of the late 1980s did things get out of hand as the gangs started to rig share markets, deal in property and shoot each other in the streets. In spite of their unwholesome activities in extortion, gambling and prostitution, the yakuza were tolerated as part of the system so long as the system itself appeared to deliver the goods. And that was Takayama's problem. Since the bursting of the Japanese bubble, people are disillusioned with a system that has wiped out much of their savings while the big shots - including politicians, big businessmen and yakuza - have enjoyed considerable protection from loss. The public also has been enraged to discover that unelected yakuza may have played a key role in making Noboru Takeshita prime minister in 1987; he was forced to resign later over a share scandal. So the politicians have been forced to clamp down on gangland with the 'Law to Prevent Unjust Action of Violent Organisations,' which took effect last March. The yakuza, says Takayama, have been made the scapegoats for the politicians' misdeeds. 'They've been totally disrespectful of our rights,' he complained. And he has been subjected to what, in Japan, is the most unspeakable form of ostracism: he is no longer allowed to be a member of a golf club.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Nagorno-Karabakh war pauses a few hours THE PEOPLE of Nagorno-Karabakh had only a few hours' respite from heavy fighting yesterday before both Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of breaking the latest Iranian-brokered truce with new offensives. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, arrived in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku on Monday to mediate in the conflict. But the fighting caused him to abandon plans to visit Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave inside Azerbaijani territory. Instead, he flew on to Armenia for talks with the Armenian leadership. The three-day ceasefire came into effect in the early hours. But soon afterwards the Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azerbaijani forces of attacking the predominantly Armenian region of Askeran with tanks and missiles and shelling Stepanakert, capital of the enclave. In turn, an Azerbaijani presidential spokesman accused Armenian forces of attacking Agdam, across the border in Azerbaijan, using artillery and machine-guns, and of renewing their assault on the Azerbaijani village of Khodzhaly, north of Stepanakert. Khodzhaly would be the third village the ethnic Armenian troops have targeted since the beginning of January. The other two, Kerkjan and Malibeli, were evacuated and set ablaze by the ethnic Armenians, who claimed they were the source of rocket attacks on Stepanakert. The Nagorno-Karabakh government declared the enclave an independent republic last month. Armenia is supporting it with men, food and money. Azerbaijan rejects the enclave's separatist demands and insists that it can have some form of autonomy but must stay part of Azerbaijan. Direct communications with the enclave have been severed for several weeks. There has been no electricity, heat or running water in Stepanakert since early January, when Azerbaijan imposed a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The city is living off winter food-stores expected to last another three months. Stepanakert's estimated 70,000 residents go underground into bunkers at night, when wild dogs roam the streets and many of the rocket attacks are made, so the number of fatalities has been kept relatively low. Still, there are many casualties and a grim uncertainty suffuses every conversation as no-one knows whether his home will be intact the next day or whether a friend may have died. Both sides concede there appears to be little room for manoeuvre. 'Azerbaijan is not going to recognise our independence, but we are not willing to come under their dominance again,' said Mr Artur Mkrchian, Nagorno-Karabakh's 33-year-old president, in a recent interview in Stepanakert. 'Over the past 70 years, the people of Karabakh have seen with their own eyes what the Azerbaijanis are capable of. 'Nagorno-Karabakh will become an independent state, or it will become a big Armenian graveyard.' Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

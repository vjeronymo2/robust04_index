			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DOCTOR TESTIFIES IN PERRY RAPE CASE  </P> <P> Witnesses at the sexual assault trial of Denver Bronco Gerald Perry say the  woman who accused the lineman of raping her refused to go to the hospital for  an examination when police first contacted her.  </P> <P> Dr. Clarence Blea, who examined the woman when she went to the University of  Colorado Health Sciences Center about 18 hours after the alleged assault, said  he found no visible signs of trauma or anything else to indicate that she had  been raped.  </P> <P> Blea told the court, however, that the absence of bruises and trauma, as well  as a pelvic examination showing no tearing or other signs of rape, doesn't mean  that the 26-year-old woman wasn't raped.  </P> <P> Blea was the first witness during the second day of the trial.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Gene Ciancio and Tom Tasker contend that the woman was a  willing sex partner, and prosecutors Bruce Levin and Joe Pacyga say she was  raped at gunpoint.  </P></p>

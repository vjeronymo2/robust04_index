			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Service with a snarl - Diary of a Private Investor FOR THE first time in many years, I do not own a single share of any company in the stores' sector, and my wife holds only a modest number in Burton Group. Last month, Liam Strong, the new chief executive of Sears, announced a shake-up of his stores' empire that will include closing 350 shoe shops. The company's shares rose sharply and market attention also focused on other stores' groups. I resisted the buying temptation. Why? Because of history and experience. Over the years, my wife and I have made some nice profits from the sector - partly because we like to wander around shops. In April 1985, she bought shares in Debenhams because she liked its stores and also appreciated the 12.5 per cent shareholder discount on purchases. In July that year, she accepted Burton's takeover offer and sold most of her newly-acquired holding at between 503p and 573p. This little piece of history is instructive because it shows what can happen to share prices. Even missed opportunities can provide lessons. In December 1985, I bought shares in Ernest Jones, the high street jewellery chain, at 80p. I reasoned that sales of jewellery were becoming increasingly competitive and that Ernest Jones might be a takeover target. But I became bored with the holding and, by September 1986, I was concerned that it might become difficult to sell shares in small companies like Ernest Jones. So, I disposed of mine at 78p. In 1987, Ratners bid 250p a share for the company. I was chagrined - but I felt also that Ratners paid too much and wondered what else it might buy at high prices. Would this lead to later problems (especially as jewellery is a discretionary purchase: no one has to buy it)? So, I resolved not to invest in Ratners, although many people at that time were recommending it. It was a high price/earnings ratio, and visits to the shops, that deterred me from investing in Sock Shop when it was floated in 1987. Others felt differently; the issue was 53 times subscribed and the shares went to more than 250p. To me, though, the products seemed mainly to be low-priced items that could be copied easily and bought elsewhere. Apart from small outlets at railway stations, I could not see what Sock Shop had to offer compared with other stores. It went into administration early in 1990. Visits to shops have, however, led to share purchases. In 1988, I invested in Daks Simpson because I liked its suits and overcoats and the staff at its Piccadilly store in London's West End seemed always to be helpful. The store also was popular with up-market Japanese tourists, and I thought the company might be a takeover target. My shares cost 430p. In 1991, I accepted 585.5p for them from a Japanese company, Sankyo Seiko. For similar reasons, my wife and I bought shares in another up-market London store, Liberty: the product range was good, the staff attentive, and it was liked by the Japanese. She has been in and out of Liberty shares several times since 1986, taking excellent profits each time. My personal pension scheme held on to its Liberty shares for somewhat longer. It planned to hold them for many years, but a recent visit to London depressed me so much that I decided to sell them for a useful profit. I believe the recession is now so deep that spending in stores will be depressed for quite a while. Will manufacturers and retailers take note and offer lower prices and better service? Recent experiences in London's Oxford Street make me doubt it. In two shoe shops, I found a style I liked. But neither shop had it in my size and none of the assistants was particularly helpful. Why were the shops not linked by computer to a central warehouse so they could place orders for delivery within a few days? In John Lewis, the department store, an 'all-day breakfast' was advertised. I asked if I could have two eggs and toast. 'No,' came the answer - I had to have one of the set breakfasts that included either bacon or a sausage and one egg. I could not swap a sausage for an extra egg. I feel most retailers are going to have a terrible Christmas; the uniform business rate already has crippled many stores in the south. And shoppers know from bitter experience that items for which they paid heavily as Christmas presents will be much reduced in the January sales. I think supermarket groups are likely to be affected, too, not only by the recession but also their own 'dash for growth.' Many have been paying vast sums for sites and new stores. Take the Poole and Bournemouth area, where I live. There are two Asda superstores, two Safeway, three Tesco, two Kwik Save, three Marks &amp; Spencer, five Sainsbury, two Waitrose and six Gateway supermarkets - not to mention the Co-op, Spar, and other similar shops. Tesco also has planning permission for two more large stores in the area. Can the population really support them all profitably? People will still buy food in a recession - but there is a limit to how much anyone can eat.</p>

The news analyst says:    Whenever an opportunity presents itself, high-ranking  Japanese officials do not forget to vociferate about  "international contributions" of Japan, revealing their  intention to make Japan a permanent member of the UN Security  Council.    The UN Security Council might be polluted with dirt if such  a  country as Japan with a history of abominable crimes becomes a  permanent member of the security council.    Japan has jumped to the second topmost rung of the world's  ladder in military expenditures and is proceeding with the  modernisation of navy and air force of the "Self-Defense Forces"  [SDF] and legalization of overseas military activities of the  "SDF".    It must not be overlooked that the present Japanese  authorities are trying to lay obstacles to a solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by crying over the  "nuclear issue" of the North and make it a pretext for Japan's  nuclear armament.    It is the height of sarcasm for Japan to attempt to become a  permanent member of the UN Security Council the basic mission of  which is to ensure world peace and security.    If Japan wants to win international confidence, it must  clearly liquidate its past crimes and stop its moves to become a  military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons.</p>

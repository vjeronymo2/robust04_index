			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Sweeping troubles under the rug - Carpet manufacturers are facing mounting pressure to recycle their products About 5m tonnes of old carpets are thrown out every year in Britain, more than 7 per cent of the country's industrial, commercial and construction waste. Recycling them is one of the toughest problems facing environmentally-minded companies. The difficulty is that carpets are mixtures. They might include bitumen, latex, nylon or polyester as well as natural fibres such as wool or jute. Separating these components so they can be used again is expensive. Yet a cheap solution will have to be found quickly. The supply of landfill sites, where most carpets are dumped, is limited. Government departments have a policy of encouraging recycling as an alternative. Already in Germany, carpets cannot be disposed of in landfill sites at all. Other countries and the European Commission are looking at the possibility of strengthening their rules on the use of landfill sites. The pace of change is worrying the UK carpet industry. Some European countries may be asking for a recyclable carpet to be developed by the end of the century, according to Hugh Wilson of the British Carpet Manufacturers Association. 'This would mean huge changes for the industry,' he says. He has asked the European Commission what environmental plans it has for the carpet industry and is still waiting for a reply. Some in the industry are not waiting. Companies in Germany are working hard to find a way to recycle carpets. 'It's an emotive issue,' says an executive at a German carpet manufacturer. 'If we say we are close to being able to recycle carpets we will get lorry loads at our door tomorrow.' He is cautious about the effects of possible legislation. 'The worst case is that anyone who sells a carpet has to take an old one back. The best we can hope for is that we will have to take only the carpets we knew would be coming back.' The German carpet industry is trying to pre-empt state controls and has set up an environmental group, Gemeinschaft unweltfreundlicher Teppichboden (GuT). GuT has instituted a voluntary seal of approval for carpets that are tested to be free of certain toxic materials. Its members have also set up programmes to investigate waste and recycling. Companies from Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK have also joined GuT. This embracing by manufacturers of the environmentalists' cause is not universally welcomed. 'The Germans are making crosses for their own backs,' says the British Carpet Manufacturers Association. But ICI Fibres, an associate member of GuT, says that in Germany companies must be seen to be taking a responsible attitude. The ideal technological solution would be to have a carpet made entirely from polyester or nylon. When it reached the end of its life it would simply be melted down and re-used - either made into more carpets, or into low-performance plastics such as for fencing posts. But this is several years away because it is difficult to make a carpet that uses the same material for both the pile and the backing. The Manchester-based British Textile Technology Group has another solution in mind. It wants to develop a hand-held fibre tester that will identify automatically the materials used in a carpet. It has applied for Commission funding to develop the device. The British Carpet Manufacturers Association, on the other hand, favours a return to the old days. Traditional carpets are made from wool with a jute backing. When worn out, they could be burnt in power stations to generate electricity, says the Association. Ironically, carpets have been important in recycling for many years as an end product. Parts of carpets can be made from old tyres, insulating panels and flexible foam. Now the industry is faced with the prospect of millions of tonnes of used carpets, grit and all, being dumped on its doorstep. And users of carpets, in offices, factories and homes, may have to pay more for new carpets to help pay for the cost of getting rid of old ones. In Germany, the industry is determined to take the initiative from the legislators. Any carpet manufacturer hoping to sell into Europe's biggest market will have to conform to the rules set there. Germany is setting the standards. The rest of Europe may have to follow its lead.</p>

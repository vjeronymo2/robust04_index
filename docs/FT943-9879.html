			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Consumers drawn to June sales Net lending to UK consumers hit a monthly record in June but City analysts and the Treasury held back from proclaiming a new spending boom on the grounds that the official figures from the Central Statistical Office are prone to sharp fluctuations. The unexpected strength of June's figures reflected an increase of net borrowing on credit cards. But there was widespread agreement that this reflected action by cost-conscious consumers to take advantage of heavy price discounting in the June sales. The CSO announced yesterday that net consumer lending, after repayments, jumped on a seasonally adjusted basis to a new high of Pounds 683m in June from Pounds 208m in May and was sharply higher than the Pounds 227m of net lending in June last year. The monthly statistics, which exclude mortgages but cover lending by finance houses, unsecured non-mortgage lending by building societies and loans through bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, showed only a small increase in new lending to Pounds 5.14bn in June from Pounds 5.12bn in May. Although the June net lending figure was sharply higher than the City's Pounds 375m median forecast, analysts pointed out that consumer-credit statistics are volatile and, in the case of June, followed a very low figure for May. The modest increase in new lending also suggested that the growth in net lending resulted from slower credit repayments rather than heavy new commitments. In the three months to June, however, net lending as measured for the monthly statistics rose to Pounds 1.3bn from Pounds 1.11bn in the first quarter of the year. Broader quarterly figures, published yesterday, showed that net lending to consumers was at its highest level for almost five years in the three months to June. The quarterly figures showed that net lending increased by Pounds 1.41bn in the second quarter against Pounds 905m in the first three months of the year. The quarterly figures include lending by banks on personal accounts, insurance companies, retailers and lending on all bank credit cards and charge cards as well as the components of the monthly statistics. A sharp jump in net credit-card borrowing was common to both sets of figures. Net lending on bank credit cards, as measured by the monthly statistics, increased to Pounds 267m in June following a large Pounds 99m repayment in May. The broader quarterly figures showed an increase in net credit-card borrowing to Pounds 406m from Pounds 158m in the first quarter. The monthly figures showed net lending by finance houses increased to Pounds 392m in June from Pounds 304m in May. The broader quarterly figures showed an increase in net lending by non-banks and by banks on personal accounts to Pounds 932m in the second quarter from Pounds 746m in the first three months of the year.</p>

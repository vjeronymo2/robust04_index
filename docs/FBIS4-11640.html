			<p>BFN     [Text] Judicial sources have confirmed that they will ask  the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation on 28 March to  investigate the AL-SAFIR and AL-DIYAR newspapers for publishing  on 26 and 27 March incorrect reports pertaining to a current  investigation, including AL-DIYAR writing that retired Major  Fu'ad Malik was beaten up. Investigation circles have denied  this report, noting that the judicial investigator asked Malik  at the start of his interrogation, in the presence of his lawyer  Emile Rahmah, whether he wanted to be medically examined by a  state doctor for any reason. Malik and his lawyer replied that  there was no need for that. This remark was recorded in the  official minutes of the interrogation. The judicial circles do  not conceal their extreme indignation at the attempt to focus  the spotlight on the investigation and distort the proceedings.  It has been learned that these circles will demand that the  authorities pursue all those who interfere in this case without  having official proof.</p>

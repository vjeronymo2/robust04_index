			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Economics: Input prices hang on sterling's fall THE first impact of sterling's devaluation on prices should show up in this week's input price index for materials and fuel used by UK manufacturers. In August, input prices declined by 1.9 per cent, mainly reflecting an exceptional fall in the price of food manufacturing materials and weaker petroleum products prices. However, sterling has fallen sharply against both the dollar and the D-Mark since September 16, when the UK abandoned the European exchange rate mechanism. Oil prices were higher in dollar terms anyway in September, and sterling's drop against the US currency will have compounded the effect. Other indicators on the UK economy include manufacturing output which was flat in July after a small rise in June. Recent surveys by the Confederation of British Industry suggest that output remained weak in August. This is reflected in the consensus forecast of a 0.3 per cent fall for the month. Unemployment figures are also unlikely to cheer the government. Having risen by 47,000 in August, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit is forecast to have risen another 38,000 in September.

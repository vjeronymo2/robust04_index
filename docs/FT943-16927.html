			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: RTZ gold mines may be sold to Royal Oak RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, is believed to be negotiating to sell most of its US gold mines to Royal Oak Mines, the ambitious Vancouver-based company headed by Mrs Margaret 'Peggy' Witte. Neither company would comment on market rumours about the potential deal, fuelled by Mrs Witte's comments at Royal Oak's annual meeting on June 17. She said the company was considering acquiring a large gold producing property or amalgamating with another intermediate-sized producer with the aim of doubling gold output from the 500,000 troy ounces projected for 1996. This would put Royal Oak - which was formed by Mrs Witte in 1991 from the merger of five 'penny' stocks - among the handful of world gold companies with an annual output of 1m ounces. Mrs Witte, a 41-year-old, US-born metallurgist, said the potential target was not Canadian and that she expected to release details by mid-summer. Analysts suggested that the tone of Mrs Witte's comments indicated that the deal would be friendly and the most likely candidate was Kennecott Minerals, which incorporates most of RTZ's US gold mines. Kennecott owns and operates three open pit gold mines: Ridgeway in South Carolina; Barneys Canyon in Utah and Rawhide (51 per cent-controlled) in Nevada. In addition, Kennecott has a 40 per cent partnership interest in the Cortez mine in Nevada which is managed by Placer Dome of Canada, and owns and operates the Flambeau copper and gold open pit mine in Wisconsin. Last year RTZ's share of production from these mines was 411,000 ounces. Analysts suggested that RTZ has never been particularly keen on gold, and the mines apparently for sale are not of the quality or scale it prefers. The group quickly sold three similar gold mines it acquired in the US last year with the Nerco coal business. At present investors are paying about Dollars 120 (Pounds 79) an ounce for 'gold in the ground' in the US. Reserves at the Kennecott mines total about 2m ounces, giving a theoretical market value of Dollars 240m.</p>

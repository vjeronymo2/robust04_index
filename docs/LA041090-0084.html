			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCI TO BUY TELECOM USA, CEMENTS ITS NO. 2 POSITION  </P> <P> In the biggest merger yet in the rapidly consolidating long-distance  telecommunications business, MCI Communications on Monday strengthened its  position as the nation's No. 2 carrier by agreeing to buy fourth-ranking  Telecom USA for $1.25 billion.  </P> <P> By absorbing Telecom's estimated 1.4% share of the fast-growing $60-billion  long-distance market, MCI will increase its share to nearly 15%, compared to  the 8.6% share of third-place U S Sprint but still far behind American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph's 68.7%. The deal also will open new areas of  technology and territory to MCI and could result in cost savings and improved  quality of service for customers, analysts said.  </P> <P> But the deal also may help spur additional consolidation in the long-distance  market, which could reduce competition and eventually lead to higher rates,  some analysts fear.  </P> <P> The definitive agreement, already approved by the directors of both companies,  calls for MCI to pay $42 a share for Telecom. Telecom's stock, the New York  Stock Exchange's second-most-active issue Monday, spurted $16.25 per share to  close at $38.125. MCI stock slipped $1.125 a share to end at $35.75 in  over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> Both companies have grown rapidly in the past few years by buying competitors.  Atlanta-based Telecom, formerly a regional carrier called SoutherNet, was  formed in 1988 by merging with Teleconnect, a Midwestern carrier based in Cedar  Rapids, Iowa. The merged company earned $36.9 million last year on sales of  $713 million.  </P> <P> MCI has grown by absorbing Satellite Business Systems, Western Union  International and RCA Global Communications. It had 1989 revenue of $6.5  billion and net income of $558 million.  </P> <P> In all, the number of long-distance telephone companies, many of them catering  only to specialty markets, totaled nearly 500 a few years ago but has dropped  "into the 300s," according to the Competitive Telecommunications Assn., a trade  group made up of many of AT&amp;T's competitors (including Telecom and Sprint  but not MCI).  </P> <P> Telecom serves 500,000 customers in 31 states and publishes phone books in 26  Midwestern markets. It also offers voice messaging, telemarketing and a Voice  News Network with more than 100 categories of information. Moreover, the  company owns and operates a 3,000-mile optical-fiber network radiating from its  twin hubs in Georgia and Iowa.  </P> <P> Telecom has been "very aggressive in developing new products," said Stephen J.  Shook, an industry analyst for Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. As  part of MCI, he said, "they could get much broader exposure for these  products."  </P> <P> But the resulting consolidation troubles industry experts such as Paul Daubitz,  president of ATI Telemanagement, a Newbury, Mass., consulting firm. "We're  going to end up with three or four AT&amp;Ts," Daubitz predicted.  </P> <P> "Three, four or five companies will have 90% of the market, and it will  stabilize the competition, which is absolutely fierce right now, but basically  only between AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint," Daubitz said.  </P> <P> LONG-DISTANCE MARKET SHARE  </P> <P> How the phone companies split the nation's $60-billion long-distance market  before and after the agreed merger of MCI and Telecom.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:2.22IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pre-merger  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Post-merger  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> AT&amp;T  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 68.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 68.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> MCI  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> US Sprint  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Telecom USA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  --  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Metromedia-ITT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Others*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *More than 300 companies, largest of which are ATC/Microtel, Cable &amp;  Wireless, Williams, Litel, RCI, Com Systems.  </P> <P> Source: Estimates by Dataquest as of Dec. 31, 1989  </P></p>

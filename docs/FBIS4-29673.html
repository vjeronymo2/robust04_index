			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The 30 May Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian  on page 5 reported that, according to the Indonesian Chamber of  Commerce and Industry (Kadin), Indonesia's high-cost economy and  the absence of Indonesian trading companies abroad are causing a  drop in exports. Also included in the specific problem areas  cited by Kadin's President Aburizal Bakrie were the legal and  illegal levies on investment licenses, a "weak" industrial  structure, and "less than skillful" businessmen.    One of Aburizal's suggestions was for businessmen to  establish marketing offices overseas. Kadin's president also  pointed out that it can no longer be assumed that low wages and  an abundance of natural resources are sufficient to make  Indonesia competitive against countries such as Vietnam and Sri  Lanka. Aburizal hopes that there will be "greater transparency"  on the part of the government and that it will formulate  deregulations and tariffs with a view toward competitiveness and  less government intervention.</p>

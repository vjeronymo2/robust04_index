			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / National Institute Economic Review: Productivity 22% below Germany GERMAN manufacturing productivity was about 22 per cent higher than that in the UK in 1987, considerably less than previous estimates of a 40 per cent productivity gap, according to a National Institute study of British and German productivity between 1968 and 1987. The productivity gap widened sharply in the 1970s, reaching a peak of 50 per cent in 1980, but narrowed rapidly so that by 1987 the productivity gap was slightly lower than in the late 1960s. The much greater capital intensity of German industry accounts for 'a significant proportion' of the gap. The German productivity advantage was most pronounced in non-electrical engineering, vehicles and metals, and highest in paper and board. The British performance was better in food, drink, tobacco and textiles. Productivity levels were about equal in chemicals and electrical engineering. The main cause of the UK gain in the 1980s was the shedding many jobs. 'German manufacturing increased its output by about 40 per cent but decreased its employment by 600,000 workers, or 7 per cent, between 1968 and 1987 the institute said. On the other hand, UK manufacturing output increased by a little over 10 per cent, but the reduction in employment was 3m workers, or 37 per cent, over the same period.' Restrictive practices in both the sale of goods and the labour market help explain why Britain failed to even begin gaining on German productivity levels in the 1970s. One of the underlying causes of the continued gap is the fact that the ratio of capital to labour was 38 per cent higher in German manufacturing in 1987. In 1990 and last year the productivity gap with Germany widened slightly. In the longer run, the institute concludes, reducing the disparity in levels of capital is crucial.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> 41 ILLEGAL ALIENS ARRESTED  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 41 illegal immigrants in Malibu and Topanga  last week, agent Mike Molloy of the agency's Oxnard office said.  </P> <P> Molloy said the arrests occurred during an early morning sweep last Tuesday of  places where day laborers congregate along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and  Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Topanga.  </P> <P> He said most of the arrests took place in Malibu. "We lost quite a few at  Topanga who ran into the rugged terrain," he said.  </P> <P> The Border Patrol, which has six officers assigned to Oxnard, staged the raid  at the request of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and officials of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles, he said.  </P> <P> Molloy said the raid was in response to complaints from Topanga residents and  others that some illegal immigrants who work as day laborers in the area have  set up primitive camps in the Santa Monica Mountains that pose a fire danger.  </P></p>

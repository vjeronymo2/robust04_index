Well informed sources in Dushanbe told Interfax that a  military group of about sixty people armed with mortars,  hand-held infantry anti-tank rocket launchers and automatic  guns, had tried to cross the Pyanj River. A unit of the Tajik  Security Ministry resisted the attack. One serviceman of the  government's forces was wounded.    This was the biggest Islamic military group which tried to  break through the Tajik-Afghan border since the beginning of the  year.    According to military sources, groups of ten to fifteen  people try to break through to Tajikistan every day. The  situation may significantly deteriorate in April.</p>

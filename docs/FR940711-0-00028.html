In the 1980's, prunes were not a popular fruit and most members of the public had little knowledge of their nutritional value, specifically, their high fiber content. In 1987, the prune Board began a campaign to highlight the link between consumption of high fiber foods (such as prunes, which were marketed as a good tasting, high fiber fruit) and cancer prevention. The program included direct mailings of product samples to physicians, publicity and media appearances by experts about the health benefits of prunes, and sampling programs in shopping malls and on domestic airline flights. Combined with generic advertising and promotion, the program resulted in a 12% increase in prune sales in 1987 alone. To date, the sales of California prunes continue to rise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The success of certain commodity programs has also been measured through technical economic studies on the effects of generic advertising on industry sales. The results are impressive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For instance, in a recent study of the Washington apple industry (Olan D. Forker and Ronald W. Ward, 1991) it was estimated that between 1988 and 1991, the industry received a rate of return of $6.63 for every dollar of assessments spent on the promotion of apples. In all, this represented a $133.76 million dollar return on a $17.5 million investment and the market price which Washington apple growers received for their apples between 1988 and 1991 was estimated to be 12.9% higher than it would have been without generic advertising.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, a recent study sponsored by the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board (Ronald W. Ward, 1993) examined the effects of generic advertising on the beef industry. Based on extensive economic analysis, it was estimated that between 1987 and 1992, the beef industry realized an average return rate of $5.80 for every dollar spent on promotional activities. By February 1992, the total economic return to the industry was estimated at $2.99 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A study by Ronald Ward and Bruce Dixon in 1989 provides an economic analysis of the effects of generic advertising on fluid milk consumption. The authors of this study found that such promotion, authorized under the National Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, ``confirm[s] a statistically significant relationship between fluid milk consumption and generic fluid milk advertising *&blank;*&blank;*'' Other research conducted by O.D. Forker and H.M. Kaiser of Cornell University indicates that between 1984 and 1990, dairy farmers realized a farm level return rate of 4.6 to 1 on investments in generic advertising authorized under the National Dairy Promotion Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

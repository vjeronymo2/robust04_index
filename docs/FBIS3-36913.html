His decision came after an emergency  meeting with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and  Chairman of the Ostankino TV Company Aleksandr Yakovlev on  Wednesday.    The meeting follows a threat by the communications workers  trade unions to cut down TV broadcasts to morning and evening  newscasts beginning Thursday unless the TV companies service  their debt.    The prime minister expressed concern over the TV companies'  arrears over 1993 and this year, his press office told Interfax.  He instructed the Finance Ministry to start covering the debt  by paying out wages to the communications workers, now several  months overdue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing April 17 (XINHUA) -- A series of campus-run  hi- tech enterprises have sprung up in Beijing recently.    Statistics show that in 1993 the output value of the  campus-run enterprises in Beijing hit 2.6 billion yuan (about  330 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 2.3 times over 1992,  with total profits of 400 million yuan, doubling 1992's figure.    In the 67 colleges and universities in Beijing, Beijing  University, Qinghua University, the Beijing Polytechnical  University and the Beijing University of Science and Engineering  each report an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan  from their campus-run hi-tech enterprises.    The Beijing University Founder Group Corporation is in the  lead, with an output value of 900 million yuan last year.    The corporation offers a series of new hi-tech electronic  products to the market, such as the third generation of cordless  phone and picturephones, according to an official from Beijing  University.    He attributed the success of campus-run enterprises to  advanced technologies, skilled personnel and some government  preferential policies.    Moreover, a technological foundation is expected to be set  up  to help the development of technology on the campuses.    Experts said that the emergence of these enterprises can  help  accelerate the process of turning technological achievements  into industries and promote economic development locally, as  well as support education.</p>

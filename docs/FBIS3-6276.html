			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is a report on the Pailin battlefield  situation on 11, 12, and 13 March:    1. During these three days, the two-headed government's  invading forces painstakingly carried out an offensive with  infantry, artillery, and tanks. Their warplanes bombarded and  attacked many areas.    2. All of their troops came from National Route 10.    3. The invading forces were backed by 18 heavy guns and  tanks.    4. Their military maneuvers were the same that they  employed on the Anlung Veng battlefield; that is, small special  units were sent to carry out swift attacks and fool us into  pursuing them, while their ground troops and tanks attacked us  from behind. Although they had many thousands of ground troops,  most of them were new recruits who lacked fighting spirit.    5. Their fighting spirit was low. We attacked and routed  many of their columns; after a short battle, they were  dispersed. They only showed the might of their artillery and  tanks from a distance; they did not dare move them close to the  fighting. We were able to attack them from remote areas, and we  intercepted them when they moved forward, just as we did at  Anlung Veng.    6. They used L-19 warplanes and helicopters to bombard  and shoot at us, but they did not dare come closer because they  were afraid of losing their aircraft.    7. We are continuing to counterattack and rout the enemy  troops in the north and south.    8. Our commanders were together with our troops, who  stayed permanently at the frontline. We are now following a  strategy of attacking the invading enemy forces with a high  sense of responsibility and lively initiative. We are  determined to defend our bases and people and thus contribute to  defending our nation and people. We are especially determined  to annihilate as many of the invading enemy forces as possible.    9. As always, our forces on the front and in the rear are  ready to fight with a high spirit to annihilate the invading  forces.</p>

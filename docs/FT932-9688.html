			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Hungarian right calls for border revision NATIONALIST members of Hungary's parliament have refused to renounce Hungarian territorial demands against Ukraine, indicating that border issues will continue to dog the country's foreign policy. A treaty confirming the existing border between the neighbours has inspired resistance from a far-right minority within Hungary's governing conservative coalition. The bilateral agreement with the Ukraine was ratified yesterday by a large majority after a tortuous parliamentary passage. Earlier in the week rebel MPs argued for the revision of borders with one calling for the 'peaceful reunification' of the Carpathian basin, the extent of Hungary until 1920. The government argued convincingly that the agreement, by enshrining rights for Ukraine's Hungarian minority, was worthwhile. Those openly seeking the return of territories are a small minority both among MPs and the Hungarian population as a whole. Nevertheless, this week's acrimonious debate has drawn attention to the lingering bitterness that most Hungarians feel about the loss of two-thirds of the country's territory after the first world war - land in which more than 3m ethnic Hungarians still live. Hungary's current political wrangling over the accord with Ukraine moreover foreshadows potentially graver disputes with other neighbours. Budapest, which has prided itself on model ties with Ukraine, starts from a far worse position in treaty talks with Romania, Slovakia and, eventually, Serbia. Hungary and Romania, in which about 2m Hungarians live, are deadlocked on the same issue of border guarantees and have failed to conclude a basic agreement. Budapest argues that it adheres to the multilateral Helsinki agreements which renounce the modification of frontiers by force and that this commitment is sufficient.</p>

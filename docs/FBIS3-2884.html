			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Practical Government Work Report"] </F>   [Text] It was generally agreed that Premier Li Peng's  government work report to the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC] was a practical report.    The government work report mentioned that this year's plan  fixed the growth rate of the gross domestic product at 9  percent. This was a realistic, positive, and feasible  arrangement. It seems that the 9 percent growth rate is  somewhat lower than the 13 percent growth rate in the previous  two years, but it will remain a rather high growth rate in the  process of China's economic development and a rarely-seen high  growth rate as compared with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some  Southeast Asian countries and regions where the economic growth  rates were high in world terms. If China can continue to  maintain its economic growth rate around 8-9 percent for a  number of years, it will be able to realize its second-step  strategic objective of quadrupling its GNP three years ahead of  the schedule, and this will be a remarkable achievement.    Through the practice of reform, opening, and modernization  over many years, more and more people have come to accept this  point of view: China is facing a rare historical opportunity,  which must be used to accelerate China's economic development;  but development must follow a new course and must not follow the  old course of unrealistically seeking a high growth rate of  output value and expanding the size of investment.    The government work report stressed: "All localities should  proceed from their own conditions when deciding a reasonable  development speed, and should not compare themselves with each  other in an improper way and unrealistically seek higher output  value." This guided all quarters in society to make solid  efforts rather than doing something ineffective; to consistently  focus efforts on achieving good economic results and seeking a  solidly high growth rate rather than unrealistically creating  some exaggerated statistics.    In China, the development of the national economy is  determined by two key factors: One is the vast countryside in  which the overwhelming majority of the population is living; and  the other is the more than 10,000 large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises which form the backbone of the national  economy. Successfully invigorating and developing these two  economic sectors is of decisive significance for ensuring the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy.    Therefore, Premier Li Peng stressed in his report the need  to  adopt various measures for strengthening the position of  agriculture and resolving prominent contradictions and problems  in the rural areas. He said that it is necessary to make the  rural economy prosper by every possible means, to increase  peasant income, and especially to help the 80 million people in  poor areas to obtain sufficient food and clothing within the  last seven years of this century. The government work report  also pointed out the need to improve production and management  in the manufacturing and transport industries, especially in  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. All local  governments and all departments should give priority to the work  of improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in  their work schedules, and should adopt measures to create a  benign external environment for these enterprises and help them  stop losses and increase profits in their business operation.    The government work report realistically analyzed the  prominent contradictions and difficulties in this year's work,  and put forward pertinent countermeasures. Among other  problems, the excessive size of investment in fixed assets is  the toughest problem which causes great risks. The government  has paid serious attention to this problem, and demanded that  the size of investment this year be kept from further expanding.  Even in the fields of basic industries and infrastructural  construction, investment should also be made according to the  actual capability. Financial and material resources should  first be used to meet the needs of key projects in the fields of  transportation, telecommunications, and major raw material  production as well as projects for harnessing major rivers.  Coastal areas are encouraged to make investment in the central  and western regions of the country. This year, the government  will not approve establishment of any new development zones, and  new capital construction projects will not be started if funds  are not guaranteed. The practice of using working funds for the  purpose of capital investment will be banned. At the same time,  through the in-depth reform of the investment structure,  mechanisms for regulating and controlling investment will be  established, and macro-control over investment will be improved.  This will reduce blindness in investment and will curb  investment swelling.    Strengthening agriculture, improving operation of the large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, resolving  contradictions, and overcoming difficulties will all rely on  reform. Reform is the key link and is also the motive force.  Without carrying out reform or without taking substantial  reform steps, China may just lose the opportunity and fail to  effect further development. Therefore, it is certain that this  year will be a reform year in China. The government work report  mentioned the contents, steps, and noticeable points of  financial and taxation reform, banking reform, the reform of the  state-owned enterprises, price reform, and institutional reform.  The reform measures will profoundly touch a wide scope of  vested interests, and their implementation will encounter great  difficulties and will also have a profound impact. The Chinese  Government is determined to lead the people throughout the  country to make breakthroughs in key points and to make advances  across the board by overcoming one difficulty after another.    Because of the reforms are being carried out intensively  against great difficulties, all localities throughout the  country are required to create a benign condition, which is  social stability. Without stability, it is impossible to carry  out any reform measures no matter how good they are. At  present, law and order in some localities is not good, and  corruption exists among a small number of government personnel.  These are unstable factors, which must be effectively overcome  according to the government work report's requirement for  preventing corruption and taking comprehensive measures for  maintaining law and order. Reform is conditioned by stability,  and stability should also be promoted by reform. The two things  complement each other, and cannot be separated from one another.</p>

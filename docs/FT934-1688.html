			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Nightmare on Marsham St: A welcome change of address for the UK environment department The customers in Sabrina's sandwich bar, just across the road, were unanimous: 'It's the pits,' volunteered motorcyle messenger Mr Jason Webb. 'It's a dump,' claimed legal clerk Mr Stanley Singer. Mr Webb and Mr Singer are in good company. According to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary: 'It is staggeringly and revoltingly offensive. It is ugly, unsympathetic, unhygienic and unsafe.' Mr Ian Clegg, spokesman for the four trade unions that work in it, has no argument with Mr Gummer: 'It's the most depressing place I've ever worked in. Good riddance.' The target of their scorn is 2 Marsham Street, Westminster, the crumbling, concrete monolith which, since completion in 1971, has led an ironic double-life as headquarters for the Department of the Environment and one of London's best-known, least-loved eyesores. Now, after the long-awaited announcement of plans to relocate the 3,000 people who walk its dark, identical corridors, the end is nigh for the 650,000 sq ft office complex known locally as 'faulty towers'. Faced with estimated refurbishment costs of at least Pounds 50m, ministers have decided that it will be reduced to rubble in 1998. Left behind will be a five-acre site worth about Pounds 25m, and questions over why it was allowed to be built in the first place. The weather-stained building, which also houses the Department of Transport, has lacked friends almost since the day it was designed in the 1960s by Mr Eric Bedford, chief architect to the old Ministry of Public Building and Works. The ministry was to become part of the DoE, created at the start of Sir Edward Heath's premiership in 1970. Its three, 200ft tower blocks breach a historic skyline noted for architectural landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster. The lifts that serve them are unreliable and slow, and stop short of the top floor. Last month, as he went to tell staff the details of the proposed relocation, Mr Gummer was trapped in a lift for 20 minutes: 'Its number was 666 - the mark of the devil,' he recollects with a wry smile. Mr Gummer, like successive environment secretaries before him, has welcomed visitors to his 16th-floor suite, explainingthat their viewpoint is the only one in central London not rudely interrupted by 2 Marsham Street. Independent Television News omitted the windswept tower blocks from the classy, computer-generated views of central London that introduce its bulletins. The building's visual shortcomings are matched by its deteriorating physical state. Outside, green netting hangs from scaffolding to catch the shards of concrete that occasionally break free from pre-cast wall panels to expose rotting reinforcing steel; windows remain partially open because they no longer shut. Civil servants on the south side of the complex can enjoy dramatic summer sunsets over Battersea while they fry in office temperatures of 30'C; in the winter, it can take the struggling boilers 48 hours to warm up the building. The DoE's next home will be in nearby Victoria, after a combination of cost considerations and threatened insurrection among staff ended the dream of former environment secretary Mr Michael Heseltine to move it east to Docklands. The new headquarters, incorporating the ultimate in 'green' credentials, will attempt to make amends for a building that has lasted barely 25 years and which, with hindsight, should never have left the drawing board. But Marsham Street was not out of place in its time, merely another utilitarian statement of the modern movement in architecture, which has left behind it equally unpopular and discredited buildings elsewhere in London and other provincial cities. Mr Bedford employed state-of-the-art industrialised methods to fulfil his brief of housing, as quickly as possible and at minimum cost, the maximum number of people under one ministerial roof. He had problems from the start. Massive reinforced concrete structures already filled much of the former gas works site and were too big to be broken up; they partly dictated the final, user-unfriendly design of the new building. The Pounds 5.5m construction contract - carried out by Bernard Sunley, now part of Lonrho, and M J Gleeson, still a family-run, quoted construction company - employed a pioneering building system designed specifically for the large-scale construction project. The simple, repetitious lay-out permitted mass-production of many construction components on site. But aesthetics, along with the need to create a practical, working environment which fitted comfortably into its surroundings, were given short shrift. 'The building is so remarkably hard to use,' says one senior civil servant. Westminster City Council, which regarded any building as an improvement on a derelict gas works site, nodded through the plans, and building work began in 1965. But completion was delayed by two years because of a wave of prolonged strikes which hit the construction industry. Mr Gummer, who says he would like to 'push the plunger' on demolition day, believes Marsham Street is a symbol of 1960s arrogance. 'It was in many ways an unpleasant period, which did not believe it had anything to learn from previous generations. It was brash and insensitive and this building stuck up two - or should I say three? - fingers to everyone.' According to Mr Clegg, in Marsham Street's first-floor union office: 'People have had to endure deteriorating working conditions which are simply not accepted in the private sector. The building rubs in that staff have not been the highest priority. It is dehumanising.' This time, ministers and civil servants are hopeful of something better. The new Eland House offices to be built in Bressenden Place, close to Victoria station, will incorporate a catalogue of fashionable architectural and environmental specifications, from the 'thermal buffers' of its double atria to ozone-friendly refrigerants and plentiful cycle bays. Already, however, the unions are hesitant about proposals for large, open-plan floors, which mean reliance on artificial lighting and air conditioning, which some believe can contribute to workplace illnesses. This time round, they want - though do not expect - to be consulted about more than curtains and carpets. The DoE says it has negotiated a 25-year lease on Eland House from Land Securities, Britain's biggest private commercial landlord. Whether or not today's architectural fashions prove more enduring, there is at least an expectation that the building will outlive the DoE's new lease.</p>

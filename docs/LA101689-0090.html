			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Hong Kong is looking to the private sector to fund up to 60% of an ambitious  $16.2-billion plan for a replacement airport and a new container port complex,  according to senior government officials.  </P> <P> The planners are hoping for the massive private participation even though the  projects will not be completed until well after 1997, when the British colony  reverts to Chinese sovereignty.  </P> <P> "We estimate that the private sector would find it attractive to participate in  about 40% to 60% of the total," Treasury Secretary Hamish MacLeod said.  </P> <P> Past Hong Kong infrastructure projects have seen extensive private sector  participation. But many banks have been reassessing the risks of investing in  long-term projects in Hong Kong after the bloody military crackdown on  pro-democracy protesters in Beijing June 3-4, which cast a shadow over Hong  Kong's future.  </P> <P> The replacement airport, to be built on a site created by flattening the small  island of Chek Lap Kok to the west of Hong Kong island, will cost around $4.5  billion.  </P></p>

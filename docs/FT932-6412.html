			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Science: real markets and knotty problem (1) Sir, The white paper published by the Office of Science and Technology stressed the importance of engineering to wealth creation ('Hunt for winning ideas heads science research proposals', May 27). By creating a research council specifically for engineering and physical sciences it should be possible for the government to fund the research projects which relate to real markets and will aid the nation's future prosperity. The establishment of an advisory body for key technologies is also most welcome. It is these new technologies from which we will create the businesses of the future and improve our competitiveness. I also welcome the transfer of the Link programme and the Teaching Company Scheme from Department of Trade and Industry to the Office of Science and Technology. By being closer to the science base these important programmes should be much enhanced and should also ensure that the industries concerned develop closer ties with universities. William Barlow, president, Royal Academy of Engineering, 2 Little Smith Street, Westminster, London SW1</p>

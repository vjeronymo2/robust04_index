			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERTY AND THE LIGHT BILL;  </P> <P> CONDO WARS: ANYTHING BUT RETIRING  </P> <P> Where the hell are the bills and receipts? Where, where? They keep making  special assessments -- $5 here and $10 there. It adds up, don't let anybody kid  you. And they never let you see the books. What -- you're supposed to trust  them? They sneak around like ants at a picnic.  </P> <P> My wife keeps saying, relax, you came here to retire and all you do is go to  meetings. But who can help it? Is it so crazy to want to know where the money  goes? Somebody has to stand up to these people. Liars! Smoothies! Can I say it?  Finaglers!  </P> <P> Jack Newman is talking. Or it could be Arthur Zank. Or Sol Shaffer. Any one of  the dissidents. Yes, there are dissidents. This is a condominium: Century  Village in Pembroke Pines. The brochure says it is a place "where living has no  limits." Of course there are dissidents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Condo Politics  </P> <P> Forget Democrats and Republicans. The most ferocious politics in America go on  between the unit owners of condominiums. How could it be different? In a condo,  you own the apartment, but the rest is held "in common," from the chlorine in  the pool to the weeds under the shrubs.  </P> <P> How can a man's home be his castle when he shares the moat and drawbridge with  partners? The common good is not every man's ideal, after all. You should see  some people. They open their front doors and fan in the air conditioning from  the hallways. Stealing the cool!  </P> <P> Of course, it would be wrong to knock it altogether. Some 16 million Americans  live in condos, and many think it is wonderful. Let them come to South Florida.  What goes on!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wild Board Meetings  </P> <P> Board meetings get so wild, people have dropped dead. And the elections. They  fight for proxies like piranhas. Experts blame retirees for this tumult -- no  matter where they're from or what they once did.  </P> <P> "Some of them sit around and read the Condo Act all day," says Alex Knight,  chief of the state's Bureau of Condominiums. "They have time to fight. Condo  politics is like a hobby."  </P> <P> But what the hell do bureaucrats know? Hobby? This is a hobby? This is not  mountains from molehills. A condo association's management budget can involve  hundreds of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> Down here, many of the condo developments are like small cities. There are  8,000 people in 75 buildings at Century Village in Pembroke Pines, west of Ft.  Lauderdale.  </P> <P> They have their own lake and 18-hole golf course and billiard room with 25  tables. And dances and live entertainment and mah-jongg club.  </P> <P> And two political factions that get along like the Monitor and the Merrimac.  Welcome to the aggravation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dissident Owners  </P> <P> "Where the hell are the bills and receipts?" Jack Newman, 70, wants to know. It  is a rhetorical question. The paper work of the recreation building might as  well be sacred papyrus from the Fertile Crescent, so well is it hidden from  inspection.  </P> <P> Newman is sitting among the dissidents in Arthur Zank's condo. Arthur, 61, the  unofficial leader, rises to secure more potato chips. He says, "99% of the  people don't care about any of this, but we care."  </P> <P> Sol Shaffer, 63, at Arthur's side, gives the overview. "Worst deal in the  history of Florida," he says. He is not sure that is dramatic enough: "This may  sound like bull, but we believe in freedom and justice for everyone."  </P> <P> This is why the dissidents call their newspaper the We the People News. It  comes out once a month, and you can find people reading it in the clubhouse --  retirement living's very own notes from the underground.  </P> <P> Editorials are so venomous they ought to print antidotes beside them instead of  the usual recipes for stuffed cabbage and ads for podiatrists.  </P> <P> "Forty years ago we fought a war to make sure this type of thing could not  happen . . . " reads one of them as it picks up steam. "Now is the time to  stand up and be counted among the Good Guys."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seek New Management  </P> <P> So what do the We the People people want? For one thing, they want to bring in  a new management company instead of the one that was left behind by the  developer. Management? You call this management?  </P> <P> "We know for a fact the lawns are supposed to be mowed 31 times, and we know  for a fact they only mowed them 24 times," says Sol Shaffer, retired from his  greeting card and jewelry businesses.  </P> <P> "They tell us sometimes it rained -- we couldn't mow -- and that's an act of  God. So why are we paying for acts of God?"  </P> <P> And they want their own auditors to review the books of the recreation  building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conniving Management?  </P> <P> Most of all, they want to end the connivance between young Steve Kittredge, the  developer's project director, and Kitty Thibault, president of mighty COOPPA,  the Condominium Owners of Pembroke Pines Assn.  </P> <P> One hand washes the other, and that's a dirty business, complains Arthur Zank:  "If your window gets broken by a golf ball, try getting it fixed unless you're  a friend of COOPPA's. Lots of luck to you without help from Kitty."  </P> <P> Oh, is this a Kitty! Kitty Thibault, a.k.a. Goldilocks, is a fraction of a  generation younger than most here. The dissidents describe her as having the  demeanor of a cheerleader and the instincts of a ward healer.  </P> <P> "Wait till you meet her," says Sol Shaffer. "Slick, like you wouldn't believe.  She flutters her eyes at you, you'll think so, too."  </P> <P> "A blond bombshell," says Sol's wife, Marlene.  </P> <P> "She has more energy than any two or three people."  </P> <P> "A blond bombshell."  </P> <P> "Nasty, oh boy."  </P> <P> "A blond bombshell."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Same Things, Over and Over'  </P> <P> But first Steve Kittredge.  </P> <P> The project director covers his face with his hand and then peeks out through  fingers. "I cannot begin to tell you what it is like to manage one of these  places," he says earnestly. "Same things, over and over and over."  </P> <P> History repeats on him like a bad meal. Kittredge has worked at older Century  Villages in other cities nearby and watched the politics take shape,  predictable as an allergy attack, pesky as a canker sore.  </P> <P> The trouble is, most people have had no experience with condo living. They  don't realize that eventually developers move on and unit owners must govern  themselves.  </P> <P> By law, the residents devise their own rules. They elect officers who then have  to worry about the roofs and the catwalks, the water and the sewers.  </P> <P> Of course, most retirees want to be retired from such things. Who needs it?  People treat you like a handyman. They call at 4 a.m. to demand you hear the  drumbeat of their dripping faucet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jump Into Action  </P> <P> But for some, the call to condo service is rousing as an anthem. They crave the  action. What, are you going to spend all day at poolside, simmering in your own  juices like a brisket of beef?  </P> <P> True, condos are a complicated business. You're dealing with maintenance for  the roads and buildings and such. That's why in 1985, the various Century  Village associations combined their know-how under an umbrella group, COOPPA.  </P> <P> In the glory days, COOPPA was combative as guerrillas in the hills. People were  being overcharged by the developer for use of the clubhouse. COOPPA did its  homework and nailed down the facts as airtight as canned goods.  </P> <P> But no sooner had Steve Kittredge made peace with the rebels than a rival group  sprang up, the We the People people. They have wrested away the support of at  least four of the 16 governing condo associations.  </P> <P> Please go get Kittredge some aspirin. "The yelling and the threatening," he  says. "And this guy, Jack Newman, he never comes in to talk. First thing, he  files lawsuits. He is, what do you call it, a litigious person."  </P> <P> Fact is, Jack Newman is a retired clerk of the New York Supreme Court. But  Kittredge does not know this. What he knows is: "The dissidents don't care  about issues, really, just power. Some of them want to be as big as Kitty  Thibault. Have you met Kitty?"  </P> <P> Not yet, but it's hard not to sense her presence. Most of the dissidents were  once Kitty's allies in COOPPA until, for one reason or another, they had  fallings out, each a story elaborate as the plot of a coup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dissidents Join Forces  </P> <P> Then one day late last year, Arthur Zank and Sol Shaffer, never bedfellows  before, met beside the pool and decided to rally the Outs against the Ins.  </P> <P> "We had 12 or 15 people over for bagels and lox at my apartment," recalls Zank,  retired from the shirt manufacturing business in New York. "Beautiful bagels  and lox, really good nova, delicious."  </P> <P> From that savory beginning came We the People, and, ever since, Century Village  has been in a rift wide as the 7-10 split.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Association Fights Back  </P> <P> COOPPA has its own newspaper for fighting back, four times the size of We the  People. In the May issue, readers found a letter to the editor from Harriet  Linar, who lives in Arthur Zank's building. She alleged:  </P> <P> "I caught Arthur Zank on Feb. 14th at 7:30 p.m. shutting the light in the  laundry room. He also lifted the cover of the washing machine while my laundry  was in it, which, of course, stopped the machine from operating any further.  </P> <P> "I asked him 'Why?' He said, shaking his fingers in my face -- 'It costs money  to keep the light on.' "  </P> <P> Can such a thing be true? As it turns out, yes. Arthur himself remembers: "She  asked me, 'How much can it cost?' I said, 'It's not a matter of how much. It's  that you're spending other people's money!' "  </P> <P> OK, right is right. But that's not the point. The revealing thing about the  incident is that it happened two years ago, and the COOPPA News has reprinted  the letter, by Harriet Linar's count, three times. Stop printing it! she pleads  with them. Arthur and I get along fine now.  </P> <P> Zank concurs. "This is typical of Kitty Thibault's tricks," he says. "Wait till  you meet her. She talks down to you like a school teacher."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Evil, Sneaky' Person  </P> <P> But it's much more than the speechifying, he says: "Over the years, she has  become evil, sneaky, slimy, a person of half-truths and half lies," to say  nothing of the fact that she has sued him for slander.  </P> <P> So finally, as promised, here comes retired businesswoman Kitty Thibault,  emerging from Steve Kittredge's office. She is a small, radiant woman, lovely  in a summer dress. "Sour grapes and jealousy started all the trouble," she says  sadly.  </P> <P> There is the music of civic-mindedness in her voice. "In any political system,  there is dissension, people nipping at your heels. But if you continue to help  your fellow man, you'll always have more victories than defeats."  </P> <P> This is just the oil, of course. Soon the conversation gets down to  particulars, and Kitty serves up the vinegar as well. "There are people around  here who've never accomplished anything in life and this is their last guttural  gasp to make something of themselves," she says.  </P> <P> "Well, they're not going to take over COOPPA. My shoes are big, and it'll take  bigger feet than they've got to fill them. And I don't mind saying so!"  </P> <P> She singles out Arthur Zank for special criticism, reciting his name as she  might a serial killer's: "A spiteful man." Then, unburdened, she settles back  into her best cheerleader's smile.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Is Rancor Worth It?  </P> <P> Ooh, my. This is some rhubarb. But is it really worth it? Is anything worth  this rancor? And maybe the answer to that belongs to Sol Shaffer, who has a  secret to share about condo politics.  </P> <P> C'mere. "There is something an outsider doesn't really understand," he says,  leaning close. "This is all fun. If it wasn't, it would drive you meshugge and  you'd talk yourself into a heart attack."  </P> <P> A few days later, it must be reported, Sol had a heart attack. "It was the  stress," says his wife, Marlene. "If it wasn't one thing, it was another. Who  needs this? I'm sorry we came here. It's a mess."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Sol will be home in a few days. Thank you, yes, he is doing fine.  And soon, Marlene says, he will get back into the rough-and-tumble of Century  Village politics. She says, "We'll get them, if it's the last thing we do."  </P></p>

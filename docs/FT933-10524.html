			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Building equipment sales set to decline SALES of construction equipment in Europe are forecast to fall by 15 per cent this year, according to a grim assessment by the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. It comes only four months after the group predicted sales would fall by only 8 per cent this year, and reflects sharp downward revisions in forecasts for Italy, Spain and France. Overall, the group predicts sales will fall from a slightly revised 96,656 units in 1992 to 82,708 this year. Every country in Europe is forecast to register a decline, apart from the UK, where sales are predicted to rise 21 per cent. The Italian market is expected to fall by 35 per cent this year to 10,230 units because of what the group calls 'the political and economic impasse'. Italy's corruption scandals have sharply reduced activity in the construction industry. Spain - where the market is set to fall 29 per cent to 2,195 units this year  -is 'unable to solve its economic problems,' says the group. In France, which is postponing spending on many big projects for the time being, the market could fall 25 per cent to 7,980 units. The group confirms its earlier forecast that Germany, which accounted for nearly 50 per cent of European demand last year, is cooling off rapidly this year. Sales are forecast to fall 12 per cent to 39,110 units. The German rental sector, fuelled by the post-reunification construction boom, is becoming rapidly saturated, says the group. Nearly all important products, apart from crawler excavators and articulated dump trucks, will suffer 'serious' declines in sales this year. However, the overall trend for 1994 is brighter. Outside Germany, unit sales will grow 7 per cent next year with improvements likely everywhere apart from Italy. Germany, though, will suffer a further 13 per cent decline, leaving overall European sales down about 2 per cent from 1993.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: PWA boosted by Airbus sale PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is to receive a CDollars 150m (USDollars 126m) cash injection from the sale of its three remaining Airbus 310 aircraft to the federal government. PWA will use CDollars 100m to repay debt on the five-year-old aircraft and CDollars 50m to bolster working capital. The money will give the airlines breathing space while it tries to negotiate an alliance with American Airlines or other deals to ensure its survival. The company has turned down a share exchange offer from Air Canada and is negotiating an equity injection worth nearly CDollars 200m from all its employees. It says it is still negotiating the sale of CDollars 45m of spares for the Airbus aircraft, made idle by the recession last autumn. In July, PWA asked Ottawa and three provinces for loan guarantees, saying it had been driven near to bankruptcy by heavy industry over-capacity and fare wars with Air Canada. Ottawa then said it might buy the Airbus aircraft on certain conditions, including merger talks with Air Canada. These talks failed earlier this month. Ottawa will use the 310s to replace Boeing 707s now operated by the Armed Forces.</p>

Discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Profiling_Situation Prior to Enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;152.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Profling is based on the premise that a set of characteristics_a ``profile''_can be developed to identify, at an early stage of unemployment, which workers are likely to exhaust UC and will need assistance to find new jobs. Research on this point sponsored by the Department of Labor and conducted in the State of New Jersey found that profiled claimants who received reemployment services returned to work earlier than those who did not receive such services. (See UI Occasional Papers 89&hyph;3 and 91&hyph;1 which contain reports on the New Jersey project). In addition, studies on the long-term unemployed have found that individual characteristics such as schooling and job tenure relate to when the individuals return to work. Thus, providing early reemployment assistance to individuals most likely to remain out of work should result in an earlier return to work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4 of Public Law 103&hyph;6 addressed the establishment of a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC (including new claimants under Federal unemployment benefit allowance programs) to determine which claimants may be most likely to exhaust regular UC and may need reemployment services to make a successful transition to new employment. Although States were not required to establish a system of profiling, the Secretary was directed to ``encourag[e] [its] adoption and implementation by all States,'' as well as provide ``technical assistance and advice to the States in the development of model profiling systems.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this legislation, the Department took action to develop a model profiling system. UIPL 45&hyph;93 was issued and States were encouraged to provide comments on the profiling system and the procedures needed to implement it. The Department was in the process of developing this system and a strategy for its implementation when Public Law 103&hyph;152 was enacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Profiling_Effect of Public Law 103&hyph;152.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments made by Public Law 103&hyph;152 repealed section 4 of Public Law 103&hyph;6 and added subsection (j) to section 303, SSA, to require States, as a condition for receiving Title III grants, to implement and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC. Under section 303(j)(1), SSA, the system must include components which: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

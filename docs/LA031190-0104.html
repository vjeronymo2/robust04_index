			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROKERS, AUCTIONEERS IN BID FOR RTC BUSINESS;  </P> <P> PROPERTY: COMPETITION IS KEEN TO GET SOME OF THE BUSINESS OF SELLING THOUSANDS  OF ASSETS OF DEFUNCT S&amp;LS.  </P> <P> The bidding war has started.  </P> <P> Real estate brokers nationwide are teaming up with auctioneers to offer sellers  one more incentive for signing with them. And real estate auctioneers are  trying to take their image beyond the courthouse steps by planning more upscale  sales to the public.  </P> <P> Everybody wants to claim a part of the more than 30,000 properties that are to  be sold through the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency charged with liquidating  assets of defunct thrift institutions.  </P> <P> The numbers are staggering. Properties for sale on the RTC's latest list fill  3,000 pages in nearly four volumes.  </P> <P> And there's something for everyone: A country club with no golf course, a  shopping center with no street access and Texas condos without air  conditioning.  </P> <P> Serious buyers, however, may have an unparalleled opportunity to benefit where  others have lost.  </P> <P> Auctions play a big part in the RTC plans to get all these properties off its  books and back in the private sector. That's where brokers and auctioneers see  an opportunity for themselves.  </P> <P> Real estate brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and  Coldwell Banker already have divisions set up to capitalize on the opportunity.  Several other companies are studying the matter, and so is just about everyone  else in the commercial scene.  </P> <P> Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. is planning to launch its joint venture with auctioneer  Ross Dove Co. by offering $100 million in properties at an auction set for late  spring in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> For now, the companies' strategy is to persuade troubled lenders to let them  sell their real estate portfolio before the feds move in and do it for them. At  the same time, Grubb &amp; Ellis Asset Services is lobbying to become a major  contractor for RTC property sales.  </P> <P> California will prove especially fertile ground.  </P> <P> Besides being the home to more than $4 billion in repossessed S&amp;L assets,  California also has a large number of potential buyers. About 60% of distressed  properties in Arizona, said Foster City-based auctioneer Ross Dove, are bought  by Southern California investors.  </P> <P> Grubb &amp; Ellis plans to assign each auction property to a broker and at the  same time, try to market it conventionally. Since every auction generates  thousands of inquiries, the company will turn those over to brokers, too --  creating a new pool of business prospects.  </P> <P> "The thing that attracts bidders to auctions is the idea that they may get a  bargain," said Robert C. Hildebran, president of Grubb &amp; Ellis Asset  Services Co. in San Francisco. "The reality is that a buyer may bid more at  auction than at the negotiation table. . . . Auctioneers will tell you that  record prices are almost always set at auctions."  </P> <P> "There is nothing that makes a property more attractive to a buyer than the  knowledge that someone else wants it too," reasoned Hildebran. "It creates a  different psychological mind-set."  </P> <P> It is through that mind-set that big-name brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis,  Coldwell Banker and Cushman &amp; Wakefield hope to open up for themselves an  altogether new market. Said Hildebran: "I see no reason why in 1991 we couldn't  be closing $1 billion in auction sales."  </P> <P> "Real estate auctions are coming out of the Dark Ages," claimed Earl Reiss,  executive vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Last year, his company teamed up with auctioneer Christie's for a one-half hour  sale of more than $40 million in properties offered by the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> Interested buyers had to front a $250 deposit for information on each property  and a 10% percent cashier's check or letter of credit on any property they  wanted to bid on. Buyers had another 60 days to pay the balance or lose their  deposit.  </P> <P> Such high-brow ground rules, Reiss said, helped keep out the "riffraff."  </P> <P> Indeed, real estate auctioneers want nothing more than to elevate their  reputation.  </P> <P> For the most part, they're perceived as an option of last resort. In contrast,  art auctioneers are a generally respected lot, and usually the first stop for  any serious seller.  </P> <P> Kennedy-Wilson Inc. of Santa Monica sponsors about 20 real estate auctions a  year and predicts an even busier future.  </P> <P> "Conventional sales will still be a big part of the RTC program," said Holly  Burgin, senior vice president at Kennedy-Wilson. But for many properties,  auctions will be the only way to go.  </P> <P> The key to a successful auction is offering buyers a discount of what they  would likely pay buying the same property through a brokerage. "If buyers don't  perceive a bargain, they won't come," she said. "Buyers are pretty well  educated and they know what value is."  </P> <P> Generally, Burgin added, her company starts the bidding at 25% to 30% below  what the auctioneer predicts will be the high bid. It's this strategy, she  says, that has helped her win the business of First Interstate Bank, Bank of  America, Security Pacific National Bank and the General Services  Administration.  </P> <P> A growing interest in real estate auctions has also helped the company expand  operations in Texas, Arizona, New Jersey and Washington.  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker also is planning to pursue more auctions nationwide. Instead of  public auctions, however, Coldwell prefers to think in terms of sealed-bid  auctions that provide buyers a bit more anonymity and allow for more  behind-the-scenes maneuvering.  </P> <P> "Only a small number of buyers know how to deal with auctions," said James W.  Field, manager of the company's Portfolio Disposition Services.  </P> <P> "I'm an old-line real estate type," he said. "I'm not convinced you maximize  value at a public auction."  </P> <P> Such activities also pose a problem of internal competition, Field said. "Our  feeling right now is that Coldwell Banker shouldn't be in competition with its  own brokers."  </P> <P> And, while auctions may be particularly effective for condos and small  commercial properties, Field said, complex purchases that require significant  research by the buyer may not be at all suited to an auction.  </P> <P> Auctions have the possibility of backfiring on a brokerage if the buyer  realizes he or she has made a mistake. They'll be unlikely to return as  Coldwell Banker clients. At auctions, Field said, the key is to "get people to  bid before they can think."  </P> <P> "Everybody thinks auctions are fabulous and wants to jump onto the bandwagon,"  observes Mario Piatelli, a 40-year auctioneer with the Piatelli Co. in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> "Everybody thinks auctions are a cure-all for overpriced property," he said,  but in reality, the RTC will have to offer some bargains if it expects to  dispose of its massive portfolio.  </P> <P> Piatelli's most recent auction at the Los Angeles Convention Center drew more  than 5,000 potential bidders -- all of them looking to get a great deal.  </P> <P> Piatelli also hopes to be among about a dozen major auction contractors  selected by the RTC. His expectations, however, are tempered by years of  experience on the auction circuit.  </P> <P> The potential for profits is there, he said, "but it's a very tough business."  </P> <P> Development  </P> <P>  -- The Allen I. Kay Cos. of Bethesda, Md., and Mitsui Kenetsu of California  Inc. have completed the $52-million La Jolla Executive Tower at 4225 Executive  Square in what's known as the Golden Triangle.

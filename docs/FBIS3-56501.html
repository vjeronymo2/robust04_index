The Union in Support of the Republic of the Crimea  [Soyuz za Pidtrymku Respubliky Krym], the Communist Party of the  Crimea, the Republican Party of the Crimea, and the People's  Party of the Crimea [Narodna Partiya Krymu] are part of it. The  initiators of setting up the bloc have stated that it is not  ruled out that other parties and organizations of the republic  will join it too. Yuriy Komov [name as received], a member of  the political council of the Union in Support of the Republic of  the Crimea and people's deputy of the Crimea, has stated that  the association's main task is to act as a united front against  the current "party of power" in the Crimea and Mykola Bahrov,  its leader. "We are not rejecting Bahrov as a person," Yuriy  Komov emphasized, "but the policy that he is conducting on the  principle `divide and rule' -- a policy of advancing on people's  backs." In their speeches the leaders of parties accused the  speaker of betraying the interests of the (Communist) party and  of plagiarism ("he has collected in his program the cream of the  election programs of his rivals"); the opinion was expressed  that Mykola Bahrov bears personal responsibility for the  poverty-stricken economic state of the Crimea.    Fedir Volchan [name as received], a member of the republican  committee of the People's Party of the Crimea, noted that the  bloc that has been set up is not a provisional attempt, but an  attempt calculated for the future to shape relations between the  parties of the Crimea after the elections. In his opinion, the  actions of the government and the Central Electoral Commission,  which has become Bahrov's "doormat" during preparations for  elections of the president of the Crimea, indicate their  readiness to agree to falsifying the voting results.</p>

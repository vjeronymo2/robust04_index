Our military observer Vladimir  Klimov asked him to talk about the committee's work plans.    [Yushenkov] We will be approving the work plans at a  committee sitting in the very near future. The draft laws we  will be preparing and the changes to existing laws can be split  into several groups.    In the first I would place laws envisaged by the Russian  Federation Constitution: the Law on Martial Law, the Law on the  State of Emergency, and the Law on Alternative Service. That  represents our foundation. The laws are extremely wide-ranging  in their effect and they require meticulous, detailed study.    The next group comprises laws connected with the main points  of the military doctrine. Basically we will be examining  amendments to existing laws. For example, the Law on Military  Obligation and Military Service must be brought in line with  presidential edicts and the military doctrine. Changes will be  made to the Law on Defense, the Law on the Status of Servicemen,  and the Law on Additional Guarantees and Compensation for  Servicemen.    The third group -- perhaps it should be regarded as the  second in terms of importance -- will include laws that will set  parameters for the reform of the Armed Forces. First, the Law  on Defense Expenditure. That is, the economic and financial  aspects of the reform and the identification of the structure of  expenditure and the quantitative parameters. Equally important  is the Law on Civilian Monitoring. If we are building a  rule-of-law state, then this implies civilian monitoring of the  activities of the power structures, glasnost, and access to  information -- in fact, hitherto, certain topics that are not  state secrets have been declared closed.    The next group of laws regulate military service in the  border forces, internal forces, and special services. They  might include social guarantees for servicemen, members of their  families, and people who have been discharged into the reserves.    [Klimov] What is your relationship, Sergey Nikolayevich,  with the power structures, in particular with the Defense  Ministry?    [Yushenkov] Above all I must stress that we are not the  Armed Forces Committee, but the Defense Committee. Anything  relating to defense falls within the sphere of our activity:  the military-economic, military-technical, and the actual  military policy of the state. And the part of the  military-industrial complex that services defense.    We have not been operating for long, so we do not have any  close contacts with the power structures as yet. But we are  already developing a working relationship with the Defense  Ministry.    [Klimov] Sergey Nikolayevich, what can be regarded as the  priority problems in the social sphere?    [Yushenkov] Things are difficult for society and even more  difficult for the Army, since it is very hard to be a stable  organism in an unstable society. You know what a problem the  draft is at the moment. As a result officers are sometimes  performing the functions of privates: guard details, alert  duty. But they are not getting paid and are not being given  apartments.    The Army needs to be thoroughly reformed, not merely for the  sake of it, but in order to be able to achieve the goals the  Armed Forces face.    [Klimov] Only a very strong team can tackle such important  and extensive plans. Who is on the committee?    [Yushenkov] There are 16 people. Some of them are very well  known. For example, Artur Nikolayevich Chilingarov, president  of the association of polar expedition members, a man who spent  six months at the North and South Poles and got in the Guinness  Book of Records. Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov needs no  introduction. Colonel General Yuriy Nikolayevich Rodionov is  Russian Federation deputy chief military inspector.    [Klimov] The current composition of the State Duma is  extremely varied. Are you optimistic about the future, Sergey  Nikolayevich?    [Yushenkov] There are questions on which common sense must  prevail. Although there are bound to be people in the Duma who  will place political and ideological functions before actual  legislative activity. This must be seen as inevitable.  Churchill said that demcracy is the worst form of government,  but mankind has not come up with anything better.</p>

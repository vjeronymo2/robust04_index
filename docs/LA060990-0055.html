			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY OF YOUTHS' PROBLEMS FINDS A GENERATION AT RISK  </P> <P> America is raising a generation of adolescents plagued by pregnancies, illegal  drug use, suicide and violence, a panel that included medical and education  leaders reported Friday.  </P> <P> "We are absolutely convinced that, if we don't take action immediately, we're  going to find ourselves with a failing economy and social unrest," said Roseann  Bentley of the National Assn. of State Boards of Education.  </P> <P> The commission's report concluded that "young people are less healthy and less  prepared to take their places in society than were their parents."  </P> <P> The 36-member panel gathered statistics that, Bentley said, astonished  commission members. Among the trouble signs were:  </P> <P>  -- 1 million teen-age girls -- nearly 1 in 10 -- get pregnant each year.  </P> <P>  -- 39% of high school seniors reported they had gotten drunk within the two  previous weeks.  </P> <P>  -- Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death among teen-agers.  </P> <P>  -- The suicide rate for teen-agers has doubled since 1968, making it the  second-leading cause of death among adolescents.  </P> <P>  -- Teen-age arrests are up thirtyfold since 1950.  </P> <P> Inattention to these problems has left thousands of young people doomed to  failure, "which for many will be a precursor to an adult life of crime,  unemployment or welfare dependency," the report said.  </P> <P> The commission was formed by the National Assn. of State Boards of Education  and the American Medical Assn. to make recommendations on the role of the  school and community in improving adolescent health.  </P> <P> The commission recommended that teen-agers be guaranteed access to health  services, regardless of their ability to pay. That health care should include  psycho-social as well as medical services, the report said.  </P> <P> It said communities should set up adolescent health centers in schools or other  convenient places that would be financed by local, state and federal funds and  by private money.  </P> <P> The commission called on schools to play a larger role in improving  adolescents' health. It suggested "a new kind of health education -- a  sophisticated multifaceted program that goes light years beyond present  lectures about personal hygiene." Such a program should include sex education,  the panel said.  </P></p>

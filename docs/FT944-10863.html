			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Moscow wins Iraqi pledge over Kuwaiti sovereignty Russia's mediation drive between Iraq and Kuwait moved into top gear yesterday, when Mr Tariq Aziz, visiting Iraqi deputy prime minister, handed over a letter dealing with Baghdad's recognition of its former Gulf War foe, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'Tariq Aziz. . . handed President Boris Yeltsin a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and borders under United Nations Security Council Resolution 833,' a foreign ministry statement said. Foreign ministry officials would not comment on whether the letter had specified Iraq would now officially recognise Kuwait. But the statement said Mr Yeltsin had ordered Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to fly to Baghdad 'to take part in completing the appropriate constitutional procedures'. Itar-Tass news agency said he would leave for a three-day trip to Iraq today. Mr Kozyrev has been pushing for weeks for Iraq formally to recognise Kuwait, and for the international community to lift trade and oil sanctions against Moscow's old ally in response. The talks with Mr Aziz follow Mr Kozyrev's announcement on October 13 that he had won an apparently unconditional promise from Mr Saddam to recognise Kuwait's sovereignty and borders. But the Security Council insisted this pledge had to be fully ratified in legal form before sanctions could be eased. In return for full Iraqi recognition of Kuwait, Mr Kozyrev last month promised that Russia would support a lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil exports after six months. Iraq has been under UN trade sanctions since shortly after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The embargo includes a ban on crude oil exports, which were the country's main foreign revenue earner before the Gulf War. Although food imports are allowed under the ban, Iraq has refused an offer to sell a limited amount of oil under UN supervision and use part of the proceeds to meet domestic humanitarian needs. Yesterday's meeting in Moscow, from which reporters and photographers were kept at arm's length, continued moves by Moscow to recover lost status as a player in high-profile Gulf diplomacy. Apart from raising the Kremlin's faded profile in the Middle East, a settlement with Iraq allowing it to resume its oil exports would clear the way for Baghdad to resume paying Moscow an estimated debt of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 16bn for arms supplied in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow resists pressure as IBM shares drop Wall Street US SHARE prices were flat-to-lower yesterday in the wake of some more bad news from IBM, one of the market's biggest stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 7.84 at 3,284.36, having spent the entire day a few points below opening values. Had it not been for the big loss in IBM the Dow would have ended in positive territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also held up well, ending just 0.27 off at 432.57. Secondary markets displayed less resilience, with the Nasdaq composite, which has put in the best performance in recent months, giving up 3.98 at 650.75. Turnover on the New York SE was busy at 228m shares, and falls outpaced rises by 947 to 836. The day's only economic news, a 0.3 per cent decline in November business inventories, came in as expected and had little effect. This left investors to focus on technical and corporate factors. The technical factor that dominated was the reluctance among some investors to trade heavily ahead of Friday's 'triple-witching' expiration of stock and stock-index futures and options, an occasion which typically creates considerable turbulence in the underlying cash equity markets. The main corporate news of the day shook the market. IBM, traditionally the bellwether stock among US blue chip companies, announced that it would cut 25,000 jobs in 1993 and take a Dollars 6bn charge in the current quarter. Although investors have long been aware of IBM's problems, and there was weakness in the shares last week, this latest bout of restructuring and downsizing cast a cloud over market sentiment, which has lately been relatively sunny. IBM shares reacted to the news by dropping sharply. By the close the stock was trading at Dollars 56 1/8 , down Dollars 6 3/4 , after turnover of 12.2m shares. Other large technology issues were dragged lower. Compaq gave up Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 42 1/4 , Digital Equipment Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 33 and Motorola Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 100 1/4 . The other big corporate news came from Boeing, which was expected yesterday to win about two-thirds of an order of more than Dollars 4bn for new jet aircraft from International Lease Finance. The good news about the order helped offset Monday's disappointing news that UAL, owner of United Airlines, was in talks with Boeing to reduce significantly its capital spending plans for new aircraft. In strong two-way trade Boeing finished Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 34 3/4 . Motor shares were all notably weaker as the latest set of car sales figures began to stream in. Chrysler receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 5/8 , Ford Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and General Motors Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 amid growing concern among investors that the recent upturn in consumer sentiment has not fed through into higher auto sales. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed after a day of brisk tax-loss selling and warrant redemptions. The TSE 300 index edged up 2.6 to 3,264.6 but declines outnumbered advances by 380 to 275, with 323 issues unchanged. Volume was boosted by several block trades and jumped to 52.7m shares valued at CDollars 424.1m. The gold and silver shares index strengthened 39.8 to 5,147.1. TransCanada Pipeline firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 17 1/2 on heavy volume of 7.3m shares due to yesterday's expiry of 37.5m TransCanada share purchase warr-ants issued in 1990 by BCE.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Between no gain and some pain  -Last year's downgradings should limit the fall in an already weakened market THE STOCK MARKET is facing a testing time. Over the next few weeks it may have to contend with a stream of companies cutting - or even passing - dividends as they report their 1991 results. After 18 months of recession, with precious few signs of a recovery and a general election looming, investors are nervously avoiding action. 'The market is hunkered down, waiting for the storm,' suggests one market strategist. 'Its difficult to spot winners until we get a full damage report on 1991 and the recession.' 'We are trapped between no gain and some pain,' says Mr Nick Knight, head of strategy at Nomura, arguing that the best the market can hope for is to get through the results period unscathed. The reporting season is unlikely to produce many nasty surprises in terms of the numbers companies publish, if only because there have been so many revisions to forecasts already. This time last year analysts were expecting industrial companies as a whole to show earnings rises in 1991. But hopes of a post-Gulf war recovery proved false. Now forecasts are for earnings of industrial companies to have fallen in 1991 by about 10 per cent. A heavy round of downgradings towards the end of last year means that forecasts of companies' profits and earnings should by now be fairly accurate. And since those downgradings were at least in part responsible for the weaker stock market at the time, the hope is that the market should not fall much on poor profits news now. The expected fall in earnings might look modest, given the length and depth of the recession. Yesterday's figures for the UK's fourth quarter GDP (excluding oil and gas), showing a decline of 0.4 per cent against the third quarter, was the sixth quarter of recession and brought the fall for 1991 to 2.6 per cent (again excluding oil and gas), the worst year-on-year fall in output since 1931. However, companies have worked to cut costs to bring them into line with the levels of activity, and the UK stock market derives a high proportion of its earnings - approaching half - from abroad. Also the average figure includes a wide variation of results. Some sectors, such as health and household goods, are expected to show good profit gains, while utilities are relatively unaffected by the recession. It is companies in areas like capital goods which will bear the brunt of the recession, seeing much larger falls in earnings. Outside the industrial group, figures from financials such as the banks and composite insurance companies will be bloody. Surprises in the results season are more likely to come from decisions on dividends, with the average level of dividend cover down to about 2 times - lower than it was in the depths of the early 1980s recession. Then cuts were rarer as the higher rate of inflation gave companies more scope to hold dividends. This time round, with inflation lower, the decisions will be harder. The low level of dividend cover will take some time to restore. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities house, estimates that it would take three years of earnings growing by 12 per cent a year and no dividend increases to restore dividend cover to 2 1/2 times. 'The dividend issue is the big one,' says one fund manager, 'and there are bound to be upsets.' However, he thought that price movements following cuts will be 'stock specific', rather than pulling the market down as a whole. However, dividend cuts could affect the market as a whole, if they were so widespread that a large proportion of the market was involved or if a large and leading company not expected to cut - an ICI for instance - decided to do so. There is also a political element to the dividend decision. A string of headlines about the poor performance of British industry could be thought unhelpful to the Conservative party's prospects in the election. Shares of companies whose dividends are considered most at risk have already moved to reflect fears of a cut, with stocks such as Royal Insurance, T&amp;N and Lucas on double figure yields. But as one investor put it: 'Very often a cut is not fully in the price even when you think it is.' Some investors are prepared to accept cuts, hoping that even if a share price falls on the day, once the bullet has been bitten they can stop focusing on the short-term news and the investment horizon can move outwards again. 'The atmosphere has changed from a year ago when companies were expected to maintain dividends at all costs,' says one broker. 'Now it's recognised that if companies over-distribute, the only result will be them asking for the money back through a rights issue.' Dividend cuts are not only important for companies to conserve cash. The decision to make a cut will be seen by shareholders as a more tangible and immediate indication of the directors' view of the future than a gloomy statement would be. 'If they cut dividends it means there is no end to the recession in sight,' is the opinion of a broker. One fund manager says that 'at the end of the day companies will have to make a decision about 1992. My fear is that they will get nervous and cut when in fact they do not really need to. Cashflow cover of dividends is better than earnings cover and many companies could take the long-term view if they do not lose their nerve.' If companies do cut their dividend, though, they may find themselves subject to a takeover bid later. 'We are working on a lot of things,' says one corporate financier, 'and we are just waiting for the dividend cuts and the election to get out of the way before we move.' As at this time last year, forecasts now are for a revival in earnings in the current year. Some brokers are expecting a sharp bounce in profits in 1992, with estimates for industrial group earnings rising as much as 20 per cent. But already the estimates are being pulled downwards from numbers even higher than that. Most forecasts are now for percentage increases in the teens. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is claiming the low field with a forecast of an 8 per cent rise. That low forecast is on the basis of no pick-up in economic activity, while the more optimistic ones are hoping for some revival later in the year. Thus, even without any help from the economy, earnings should begin to recover. It is widely expected that actions companies have taken to cut costs will feed through to profits this year. 'If the volume of business is unchanged in 1992 compared to 1991, there will still be gains from rationalisation,' says one stockbroking strategist. While the economy has been falling, companies have been trying to cut their cost bases to match the lower level of demand. If the economy stabilises, the redundancies taken will have brought improvements in productivity, and other cost cutting moves will also start to pay off. Once there is a pick-up in business, then the lowering of the cost base of industry will have increased operational gearing, meaning a sharper rise in profits. British Airways, for instance, gave the market a pleasant surprise when its third-quarter results showed a five-fold improvement in profits, in part due to cost-cutting. Another source of profit improvement is the overseas earnings of UK companies. Other countries' economies have not fared as badly as the UK, and there are early signs of recovery in the US. With foreign earnings such a large proportion of the UK companies' profits, the impact on the stock market is significant. Companies should also find their interest charges reducing, as interest rates have fallen and many have worked to improve their balance sheets. Rights issues raised Pounds 9.5bn last year, helping companies to pay down debt taken on in the late 1980s. In the short term, then, strategists are not expecting the market to perform well unless some unexpected good news arrives - such as a stronger Conservative showing in the opinion polls or more certain signs of a national economic recovery. The FT-SE 100 Index is seen as being in a trading range between 2,450 and 2,600, with the lower figure regarded by many as representing reasonably solid value on current earnings and dividend forecasts. 'The market is not riding for a fall,' says one, 'but there will be individual surprises.' Once the results season is out of the way, there will be the election to contend with and then the looked-for economic revival to appear on the horizon. It may be some time before the bulls can run again.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: UK must retaliate on California tax Sir, George Graham in his article 'UK defiant over California tax' (April 29) said that 'Britain and the US are heading towards confrontation' over California's use of worldwide unitary tax. The US administration should be under no illusion over the strength of feeling on this issue in the UK. Some 214 members of parliament, from all parties, have signed a Commons motion calling for the government to retaliate. At the Unitary Tax Campaign's co-ordinating committee meeting on April 27, the members voted unanimously to retaliate. At the meeting of the CBI's 'American Club' on April 29, there was an overwhelming vote to retaliate immediately (25-30 in favour, four against with a few abstentions). Too many Americans have given too many assurances over too many years. Our patience has run out. America understands only one language, that of tough negotiation as demonstrated again in their dealings with the Japanese. The British government should no longer be prepared to be fobbed off with promises for future action which, from past experience, come to nothing. The government should now retaliate immediately to get this issue resolved once and for all. Sir Michael Grylls, MP, chairman, Conservative backbench trade and industry committee</p>

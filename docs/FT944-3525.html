			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / OFT post turns into a competition headache: Robert Rice surveys the list of likely candidates to meet the challenges as head of the Office of Fair Trading Given the preference for industrial policy over competition policy expressed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, finding a successor to Sir Bryan Carsberg as chief of the UK's competition watchdog will not be easy. As one economic consultant put it last week: 'It's a bit like trying to appoint a bishop when the archbishop doesn't believe in God.' Many observers feel that Sir Bryan's consumerist approach to competition policy as head of the Office of Fair Trading set him on a collision course with Mr Heseltine. Ultimately their difference of approach made his position untenable. His successor must live with the knowledge that Sir Bryan found the lack of any real power too frustrating. Few will relish the prospect of ploughing the same barren furrow. In the light of Sir Bryan's experience the qualities required for the job are also not easy to define. Mr Stephen Locke, director of policy at the Consumers' Association, which has been critical of the UK competition authorities in recent years, believes independence is the main requirement. He said: 'It must be someone who sees it as a vital part of the job to protect consumers' interests - someone who is not frightened to stand up to awkward politicians or producer lobbies.' Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir Bryan's predecessor who served 16 years at the OFT, also listed independence as the chief quality required. He highlighted the need for a questioning mind, the ability to make a strong case - to the public, the Department of Trade and Industry or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - and leadership qualities. The DTI's hint that it would be looking for someone with regulatory experience puts the utility regulators in the frame. Ms Clare Spottiswoode at gas, Mr Donald Cruickshank at telecommunications and Mr John Swift at rail are all relatively new to their jobs and most observers think they are unlikely candidates. That leaves Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, at water. Opinion seems equally divided on their suitability. Both recently completed industry reviews and have several years of regulatory experience. Prof Littlechild, a former economics professor at Birmingham University, has served on the MMC where he was extremely non-interventionist. This approach might appeal to Mr Heseltine, but his appointment would cause an uproar among the consumer lobby which might prove politically unpalatable for the government. Some observers believe Prof Littlechild would not accept the job anyway. He enjoys Offer, where he has real power, and may be unwilling to give it up for the OFT after witnessing Sir Bryan's frustration. He has also just been re-appointed for a second five-year term. Mr Byatt is seen by many as a safer bet. As a former civil servant - he was deputy chief economic adviser at the Treasury - he is used to the Whitehall machine. If it is accepted that the director-general's job is less 'independent' under Mr Heseltine than in the past, he might be the ideal candidate. It is also widely thought that he finds the water job dull. But his appointment would also anger the consumer lobby, which feels he was too soft on the water companies and their shareholders in the recent water prices review. Some observers believe he does not have broad enough experience for the OFT job. Of the accountants and lawyers who might be suitable the name of Ms Sheila Masters, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, crops up frequently. She is a member of the private finance panel, the Inland Revenue Management Board and the NHS Policy Board. She has advised the Treasury on privatisation and between 1988-1991 she was seconded to the Department of Health as director of finance on the NHS Management Executive. Among lawyers, Prof Richard Whish's name is mentioned by several observers as a possible candidate. A partner of City solicitors Watson Farley &amp; Williams, he is the author of a standard competition law textbook and highly regarded. At the Bar, Mr Jeremy Lever QC, the deputy warden of All Souls College, Oxford, has a good reputation but at 61 is thought by some to be too old. Mr Steven Richards is frequently mentioned, but as a junior Treasury counsel is widely tipped for a High Court appointment. Mr Thomas Sharpe QC, a former competition law lecturer at Wolfson College, Oxford, is also seen as a possible candidate. Numerous economists are suggested, but three names stand out - Mr Derek Morris, the macro-economist in charge of Oxford economic forecasting and a former MMC member; Prof Martin Cave, dean of the faculty of social sciences at Brunel University, who is seen as one of the great privatisation gurus; and Professor John Kay, head of the centre for business strategy at the London Business School. In many ways Prof Kay seems the ideal candidate - a highly respected micro-economist who was director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies for seven years before leaving to set up the centre for business strategy in 1986. Under his leadership the IFS took an interest not only in tax reform but also in the benefits system, pensions and competition policy. He is not an unquestioning believer in privatisation, saying that effective competition is more important as a means of improving efficiency and levels of service than simply moving an organisation from the public to the private sector. But his approach would differ from that of Sir Bryan. He takes issue with Sir Bryan over his opposition to restrictive distribution agreements. Prof Kay says they are often essential if manufacturers are to add value to their products - the MMC reached the same conclusion in its recent report on fine fragrances. The main question mark over his candidature is whether he could be persuaded to do the job. It is widely believed that he was offered it three years ago, before Sir Bryan, but that he turned it down because he could not persuade the government to give the OFT greater independence with Next Steps agency status. If the government is keen to demonstrate the OFT's independence rather than just paying lip service to it, Mr Heseltine could do worse than give it agency status and appoint Prof Kay.</p>

R. Nixon's recent  meeting with leaders of the Russian opposition is a perfectly  natural event, in my view. The sounding-out of post-Yeltsin  Russia is beginning.    For the Western perception of the situation that has taken  shape in Russia since the December elections there is no precise  divide between those whom we at home have become accustomed to  considering political antagonists. Yeltsin and Zyuganov,  Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev, and, finally, Zhirinovskiy--they are  all for the Western mind primarily "Russians," and only then  "democrats," "communists," or "fascists." Such, if you will, is  the Western aberration with our idee fixe of "national  reconciliation"--such "reconciliation" emerged for the West,  apparently, even before it did for ourselves. Is, in fact, the  difference between Yeltsin and Zyuganov that great, for that  matter, if the first is increasingly beginning to incline toward  national-state ideas, wiring for sound what was just recently  being proposed by the opposition?    The strong constitutional authority of the president has  today neither an organizational nor conceptual pillar within the  democratic camp. The government is beginning to play according  to the rules of the opposition. This means that sooner or later  the winner will be whoever produces political know-how, not the  one who "consumes" it, stamping decisions in accordance with  another's "license."    The main know-how today is the party. What in political  science is called "organizational authority" affording an  opportunity to initiate, introduce, and polish decisions adopted  at government level.    Organizational authority is lacking, incidentally, not only  with Yeltsin but also Zhirinovskiy. This brings them unusually  close together, despite all their differences and  noncomparability. The political style of both is "one-man  theater" and the constant pedaling of the personality factor.  But it is not the personality but the party-organizational  factor that is becoming most important today. And the fact that  all more or less important politicians have suddenly hurled  themselves into the creation of their "own parties" is further  confirmation of this.    Who disposes of real organizational authority in Russia  today? Gennadiy Zyuganov's party. As of the present this is not  only the largest but also the most structured party, having  inherited from the CPSU a sizable personnel and financial base.  It has a renewed national-communist ideology, one of the  strongest factions in the Duma, and, according to certain  information, good connections in the elite groups. In terms of  type this is a power party, proposing the traditional  techniques of a solution of the managerial crisis in the base  sectors of the economy (and it is the crisis of management which  is determining for the so-called "economic crisis"). In an  alliance with the agrarian-industrial lobby and also in a  potential alliance with the center and democratic-patriotic  forces Zyuganov's party has a chance of becoming a serious  political factor in the country, despite all the unpopularity of  its ideology.    Is the West ready for a serious dialogue with Russia's  communists? Strictly speaking, for Western conservatives the  communist establishment has always been an object of close  attention primarily as a traditional component of the Russian  political elite. More, since the clamorous Fuehrer-type  escapades of Zhirinovskiy, who shocked Europe with the imaginary  threat of "Russian fascism," G. Zyuganov's balanced position  might appear the most acceptable version of Russian revanchism.  The West is looking in Russia for "righteousness" as some  standard of what is to be expected from Russia in the immediate  future. Neither Yeltsin nor Zhirinovskiy nor anyone else  manifestly cut it as yet as "righteous." Only national  communism, directly or indirectly influencing all the other  currents in Russian politics, may be the "new righteous" today.    Russia has approached in earnest the phase of  "postdemocratic  stagnation," and one has the impression that the West has waived  Russia's reforms goodbye. The main concern of Western  politicians are not qualitative transformations within Russia  but, rather, the geopolitical controllability of the new Russian  revanchism.    Were not Brezhnev's stagnation of the mid-1970's and the  suppression of the dissident movement not ultimately the result  of a kind of "deal" between Russian and Western conservatives?  It is worth remembering that the first phase of that  "stagnation" pertained to the time of detente, and only after  the USSR had invaded Afghanistan did the Western community  return to the policy of the cold war. I see no grounds for  believing that something similar might not be repeated today.  The entire history of Russia's relations with the Western  community indicates that its principal determining factor is  Russia's geopolitical predictability, not the fate of Russian  reforms and not the human rights situation. At the present time  Russia is too weak for expansionist activity outside of the  former USSR.    An era of conciliation, a time of geopolitical deals are  beginning. I have always been struck by Americans'  punctiliousness with regard to the formal procedures of  democracy. During his January visit to Moscow Bill Clinton  observed that the results of the December elections and the  democratically elected parliament were no less important to him  than the popularly elected President Yeltsin.    Strictly speaking, he could have said something similar in  1933 in respect to the democratically elected Reichstag and the  new German chancellor.</p>

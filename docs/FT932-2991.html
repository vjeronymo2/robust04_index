			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rothschild pays the price of a Swiss scandal / A look at an affair which has forced the family to bolster bank reserves If it had been anyone but the Rothschilds, they would not have been able to survive.' That comment, from a leading Zurich banker, sums up the reaction to a scandal that has held the Swiss financial community spellbound for the past year. In the latest chapter, the bank revealed yesterday it had written off SFr270m (Dollars 190.10m) provision for losses on bad loans. The story began last July when Rothschild Bank, the Zurich-based affiliate of N. M. Rothschild of London, announced it had to liquidate its SFr63.5m of hidden reserves to help cover SFr100m in loan losses. This was an immense loss for a bank with only SFr185m in capital and was supposed to be in the business of managing rich people's funds, not lending. A few days later, Mr Jurg Heer, the bank's credit manager, was arrested and charged with defrauding the bank. More details later dribbled out. The amount of the losses was more than SFr200m, undermining the bank's capital base, and most of it had been loaned to one client, breaking Swiss law. In October, Mr Heer, who had been freed by the Zurich police pending completion of investigations, made a series of sensational charges in the Swiss press. The bank was setting him up as a scapegoat, he said, and he would do his best to implicate others. He said the bank had been operating a 'criminal system' to help rich Italians hide their fortunes from the tax authorities. He claimed Rothschild had been involved in various schemes, even including the payment to the alleged murderers of Mr Roberto Calvi, the former chairman of Banco Ambrosiano found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982. The bank yesterday again denied the allegations: 'We are convinced that criminal proceedings will prove that Heer's statement as to a criminal system within Rothschild Bank is untrue.' The charges have caused immense damage to the reputation not only of the Zurich bank, but also to the Rothschild family. 'Obviously, we have lost some clients,' says Mr Guy Wais, the general manager hired last autumn to straighten the bank out. However, the Rothschild family closed ranks, injected SFr120.5m of new capital into its Zurich problem child and set about implementing the 100-odd recommendations for tightening up procedures made in a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Operating profits have been maintained and Mr Wais says the net loss of customers is 'not dramatic'. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, the chairman, writes in the annual report that the bank is 'strongly placed to meet the challenges of the future'. A full picture of what actually went wrong must inevitably await the completion of investigations, but the broad outlines are now clear. The bank's troubles date from 1981 when Mr Gilbert de Botton, its original general manager, left to work for Mr Jacob, now Lord, Rothschild's bank in London (which has no association with the Zurich bank). Baron Elie de Rothschild, head of the French family and then chairman of the Zurich bank, hired Mr Alfred Hartmann, a Swiss banker, to replace him. By all accounts, neither Baron Elie nor Mr Hartmann was particularly attentive to the business, and a triumvirate of line executives, including Mr Heer, were left largely on their own. In the subsequent years, the bank would get into a couple of serious scrapes, making an illegal loan to the Zug-based international commodity dealers Marc Rich in 1984 and buying some SFr11.8m worth of Jacob Suchard shares for its own account in 1991 when it was advising on a takeover bid for the confectionery group. The bank's most fateful adventure, however, was financing the projects of Mr Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, two German Canadians with an impressive record leading private consortia of European investors in North American property deals. Rothschild, through Mr Heer, provided loans to companies associated with these two, mainly Castor and York Hannover. The documentation for the loans, which a lawyer for Mr von Wersebe has shown to the FT, reveals very large front-end commissions. Moreover, on occasions, Mr Heer would observe that Rothschild's own lending exposure to the York Hannover-Castor companies was at its legal limit, so would propose organising some Rothschild clients into a private consortium to provide the loans through an offshore company. In 1991, when the squeeze in the North American property market became acute, the lending increased to a level that began to arouse suspicion at the bank. And early last year, when both York Hannover and Castor collapsed, Rothschild found itself with a huge portfolio of worthless loans. What remains at issue is who committed illegal acts. Mr Heer has admitted skimming off SFr30m in commissions on his lending activity, an amount that is remarkably close to the commissions shown in Mr von Wersebe's documentation. Rothschild has maintained that Mr Heer was acting alone and hoodwinked the bank's directors and auditors. Baron Elie and Mr Hartmann, who was deputy chairman, have since left the board, and the bank's former auditors, KPMG, Fides Peat, have been replaced. Outsiders cannot understand how one man could have committed a relatively small bank to SFr270m in loans without other directors being fully briefed. The Banking Commission's investigation is aimed at discovering whether others, perhaps including some officers still at the bank, were complicit. Investigations are being seriously hampered by the disappearance of Mr Heer. He fled Switzerland in December.</p>

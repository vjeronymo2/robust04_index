			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Peers pledge to oppose core of de-regulation bill The government's bill to cut regulatory burdens on business faces a difficult passage through the House of Lords, opposition and Conservative backbench peers indicated last night. Labour and Liberal Democrat peers made clear that they would mount a determined bid to remove core provisions in the bill, which would allow the government to short-circuit parliamentary procedures in abolishing regulations. Lord Peston, chief Labour spokesman on the de-regulation and contracting-out bill, denounced as a 'constitutional outrage' the government's proposal to abolish regulations using parliamentary orders. The orders are subject to short debates and cannot be amended whereas primary legislation is subject to the full parliamentary process. Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, for the Liberal Democrats, described the provisions as 'outrageous'. Lord Cockfield, the Conservative peer and former cabinet minister, also criticised the growth in ministerial power at the expense of parliament. He urged ministers not to be mesmerised by the catchphrase 'de-regulation'. Assurances by Lord Strathclyde, the minister in charge of the bill, that the bill's 'exceptional' powers would be subject to new safeguards in the Commons as well as the Lords, failed to satisfy the critics. Lord Peston called on peers to delete the provisions from the bill and force the Commons to think again. 'If we do not do that I cannot see what justification there is for us being here at all.' From the non-party cross benches Lord Bancroft, a former head of the civil service, said the process of dismantling the public service through the transfer of functions to agencies subject to very limited parliamentary control and debate had gone too far. Lord Beloff, the Conservative peer and academic, said the 'professionalisation of politics' had reduced MPs of all parties to lobby fodder. Lord Clinton-Davis, in the final speech from the opposition front bench, reaffirmed that if the bill became law it would be repealed by the next Labour government. The bill was given an unopposed second reading.</p>

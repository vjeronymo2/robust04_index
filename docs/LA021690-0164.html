			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BONN UNVEILS REUNIFICATION DEFENSE PLAN;  </P> <P> SECURITY: MEMBERSHIP IN NATO, SINGLE ARMY AND 16-STATE GOVERNMENT SEEN.  </P> <P> West German officials today unveiled plans for a military defense strategy for  a united Germany that would include NATO membership, a move opposed by the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The government also announced plans for a 16-state government that would  encompass West and East Germany.  </P> <P> West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg met with reporters today to  discuss a common security concept that he said is being drafted by his  ministry.  </P> <P> "Defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for a whole  Germany," Stoltenberg said, noting that military integration would be an  important initial step in a single German state.  </P> <P> He said that a cornerstone of the joint force would be its membership in the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet Union has insisted that a united  Germany be neutral.  </P> <P> Despite Stoltenberg's proposal, the military alignment of a united Germany is  to be the subject of reunification talks this year among the German states,  Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France.  </P> <P> Washington wants at least the West German portion to remain in NATO. East  Germany is a key component of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> Stoltenberg said there likely would be a transition phase during which the East  and West German armies would be merged. "But we are not going to have two  different armed forces in a united Germany for long," Stoltenberg said.  </P> <P> There was no immediate comment from the Soviets or opposition leaders.  </P> <P> The governors of West Germany's 11 states met today to discuss how a united  Germany would be administered. They voted unanimously to pursue a 16-state  federal structure once the Germanys are united.  </P> <P> They proposed that the East German territory be divided into five states along  the borders of the traditional regions, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Sachsen,  Sachsen-Anhalt and Thueringen.  </P></p>

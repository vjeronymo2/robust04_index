			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Big rise in people on low incomes: Richest sector receives increasing share The proportion of the UK population with income below half the national average has more than doubled in the past 30 years, says a report published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday. In 1961 about 5m people - 10 per cent of the population - had incomes below half the national average. This fell to just over 3m in 1977 but rose by 1991 to 11m - 20 per cent of the population. The report says that the share of income going to the poorest tenth in society fell from 4.2 per cent to 3 per cent in 1991, with most of the fall occurring in the 1980s. The share of the richest tenth rose from 22 per cent to 25 per cent during the three decades. The report is based on a study of living standards in the UK during the past three decades funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. It shows that the income of the poorest tenth increased 57 per cent between 1961 and 1991. The income of the richest tenth rose by 113 per cent and average incomes grew by about 84 per cent. Rising housing costs mean that the income of the bottom tenth, net of housing costs, barely rose over the three decades. For this group income after housing costs was no higher in real terms in 1991 than in 1967. The income of the richest tenth after housing costs almost doubled in this period. The report shows that the long-term rise in unemployment has become a significant factor in the changing pattern of low incomes. Families with children now account for almost 50 per cent of those on less than half average income, compared with just more than a third in 1961. There has been an increase in the number of self-employed at the bottom of the income scale, reporting very low or zero profits. The report says their growth in the 1980s suggests that some were forced into insecure and low-income forms of self-employment through the absence of jobs. The number of pensioners below half average income, which fell from 2.3m to just under 1m between 1961 and the early 1980s, has risen sharply to 3.4m in 1991. The study says the ending of the link between the state pension and average earnings is largely responsible for the surge. Part of the growth in inequality is caused by growing inequalities in earnings, the report says. But the inequality of income from self-employment and investments is growing faster and becoming increasingly important. The report says the rise in inequality during the 1980s dwarfs the fluctuations in inequality in the 1960s and 1970s. Average incomes have grown more quickly since 1960 in the south of England than in the rest of the country, the Institute for Fiscal Studies report says. At 1994 prices, average incomes in the south and Midlands were similar at the start of the 1960s, on Pounds 150 and Pounds 144 a week respectively. Average income in the north was already somewhat lower at Pounds 136 a week. By the 1970s the south had pulled away from the rest of England with average incomes about 10 per cent higher. This widened further during the recession in the early 1980s, when the Midlands, in particular, suffered. By the start of the 1990s the south had moved 30 per cent ahead of the rest of England with average income of Pounds 292 a week, compared with Pounds 237 in the Midlands and Pounds 224 in the north. Scotland and Wales started the 1960s with similar incomes, although below the average for England. For Scotland, the average was Pounds 129 a week, compared with Pounds 128 for Wales. During the 1970s, however, Scotland started to pull away from Wales and has stayed ahead. By 1990 incomes in Scotland had risen to Pounds 237, the same as for the English Midlands and 10 per cent above the Pounds 215 a week for Wales.

They inspected  Dayuan Iron and Steel Company Limited and Caili Aluminum Company  Limited, both subsidiaries of Songdai Village Hengda Group  Company. They listened to the report given by the leaders of  Hengda Group Company.    Songdai Village is a natural village with a population of  over 600. Guided by the talks given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping  during his southern China tour and the spirit of the 14th  National CPC Congress, the people in this village emancipated  their minds, renewed their concepts, and boldly brought in  talented people, technology, and funds. As a result, the  village underwent marked changes. In 1993, the sales income of  the village-run enterprises registered 120 million yuan and  per-capita income for the year was over 3,000 yuan.    Li Changchun also had an amiable conversation with the eight  college graduates employed by the company who are from inside  and outside the province.    The college graduates said: The reason we came to Songdai  Village Hengda Group Company is because this village has a  united, practical, innovative, and enterprising leadership  group. Here, we can bring our talents into full play and put  our knowledge to practical use to realize the value of our life.    Li Changchun was very positive of their bold and wise  choice.    After listening to reports, Li Changchun pointed out: Your  village-run enterprises show that the ideas of the people in  Songdai have changed a lot. It also indicates that township and  town enterprises are a vast world where much can be  accomplished. With the reform of the system of ownership and  operational power, mixed economic sectors will be more and more  common. It is necessary to break the established concept that  township and town enterprises are inferior. In the future, no  matter what ownership an enterprise is under, it must face  market competition and excel. Township and town enterprises  should be treated the same way as state-owned enterprises  without discrimination in terms of enterprise categorization,  grades of employment, and flow of professionals. Songdai  Village is now a step ahead in accordance with the requirements  of the establishment of socialist market economic system. It  has attracted capable people and helped the whole society  understand the value of capable people in a new light. I hope  Zhengzhou City will take the first step in this respect and, in  accordance with the principles of market economy, formulate a  set of measures that encourage the rational flow of scientific  and technological personnel.    Li Changchun instructed Songdai Village Hengda Group Company  to develop toward foreign orientation, high-technology, and  integration; strive to upgrade its standards, increase  varieties, and improve quality; proceed from reality and make a  long-term and scientific plan; and make painstaking efforts in  implementation. He also expressed the hope that Songdai Village  will try to catch up with and surpass the star villages in the  province in sophistication and efficiency and become one of the  province's advanced enterprises as soon as possible.</p>

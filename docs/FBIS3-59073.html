They are  into drugs and arms, but also into hotels, spas, tourism,  finance, etc. The Anti-Mafia Commission mapped out Cosa Nostra's  activities outside of Sicily and has discovered that....    Maybe it does not yet hold true for London, where according  to a fictional investigation published in the SUNDAY TIMES the  remnants of the Mafia's top leadership now reside, but it  certainly does hold true in Cinisello Balsamo. For Cosa Nostra  this town in the hinterland of Milan could just as well be  located in the outskirts of Palermo, a piece of Mafia territory  that thus far has only been identified with Sicily. Very soon,  the old rule that a boss loses his control outside of Sicily  could no longer apply.    This was one of the more interesting discoveries made by the  Anti-Mafia Commission, which all last year traveled the length  and breadth of Italy trying to understand to what extent Mafia  corruption had infected the country. Their conclusion, which is  contained in the report just completed by PDS [Democratic Party  of the Left] Senator Carlo Smuraglia, is the following: There is  no region that is exempt from the contagion. New targets for  Mafia investments include: the very tranquil Val d'Aosta, where  the Nirta clan from Calabria is in control of the region's  criminal activities; the impenetrable Sardinia, where the  Mafia--according to a credible informer like Gaspare  Mutolo--engages in real estate speculation along the eastern  coast and is trying to get its hands on the tourist industry  almost everywhere; and even the less important Basilicata  region, which became attractive to the criminal groups after the  construction of the FIAT plant in Melfi and the agricultural  development of Metaponto because of the economic setup that made  it possible to manipulate public works subcontracts and those in  charge. Not even the Molise region is immune. It is used as a  transit zone for the drug traffic between Puglia and Calabria.    The Mafia's traditional economic activities are still drugs,  arms, and public works contracts. These are followed by  extorsion, usury, and investments in businesses (the Mafia buys  hotels in Versilia; casinos in Liguria; and spas in Tuscany). It  is flexible in adapting to local ircumstances, and disguises  itself so well that it manages to get its own representatives  elected to local administrations. Will we soon be seeing  municipal councils dissolved in Lombardy because they were  infiltrated by the Mafia, like the councils were in Calabria,  Campania, and Sicily? Infiltration is so widespread that  territorial conflicts arise between the various organizations  and are referred to the Mafia courts in the areas of  origin--Palermo, Reggio Calabria, or Naples. But arbitrators are  also sent out in the field to make peace.    Senator Smuraglia's report offers the Milan Car Park as a  dramatic example of the new Mafia strategy. It was investigated  by the Florence District Attorney's Office without anyone  questioning its jurisdiction in the matter. Individuals such as  Giacomo Riina, uncle of the boss of bosses in Cosa Nostra, and  Nitto Santapaola, who is connected with the Corleone family,  were involved with the car park, which in fact was not only an  important part of the Mafia activities of Cosa Nostra in  Lombardy, Tuscany, and Emilia Romagna but of the 'ndrangheta as  well.    The members of the Anti-Mafia Commission say that one of the  most obvious ways that corruption is spread is through the  institution of legal exile, which removes dangerous Mafia  members from their region of origin. Although there was a recent  decision to abolish these measures, there are still 1,079 of  these individuals scattered throughout Lombardy, Tuscany,  Piedmont, Basilicata, and Abruzzo. And the so-called Brenta  Mafia in Venetia suffices to illustrate the potential for  contagion. Here in Venetia, between Padua and Venice, total  control of the territory has been organized on the basis of an  ironclad alliance between the first relocated Mafiosi--who built  a local hierarchy divided into gangs--and the local criminals.    According to the Commission, the signs of corruption are  unmistakable and common to all nine regions studied: Abruzzo,  Basilicata, Emilia Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Val  d'Aosta, Sardinia, and Tuscany (Latium was excluded only because  it is the object of a separate investigation by DC [Christian  Democratic Party] Senator Paolo Cabras). Arms and drug  trafficking are on the rise all over, as are the number of  financial companies and, above all, the sale of  businesses--hotels, shops, and companies are changing owners at  an astonishing rate--which often involves secret ownership. Then  there are other regions where the Commission's work was based on  written information and documents, like in Friuli  Venezia-Giulia, Umbria, the Marches, and Molise. Here as well,  we find shocking surprises, like discovering that Friuli has  become the center for the illegal traffic of arms, drugs, and  even nuclear material. It has been mostly the Camorra that has  corrupted Molise and the Marches, especially between Pesaro and  Urbino, where the Mafiosi buy up companies as fast as they can.  In Perugia, which is in Umbria, it buys real estate instead.    Is there a regional pattern to the Mafia's activities? Only  partially, because there are larger geographical combinations.  For example, in the north there is heavier arms traffic, as  shown by a list of the latest kidnapings in Lombardy. In Val  d'Ossola in Piedmont, laboratories have been equipped to adapt  arms coming from Switzerland to the requirements of the Mafiosi,  who prefer automatic weapons. Venetia, on the other hand,  directs the traffic from the East. The Colombians have a special  preference for Liguria for landing their shipments of cocaine  (265 kilograms were confiscated last April). Milan remains the  capital of money laundering. Sardinia, the coast of Abruzzi, and  especially Tuscany are chosen for their tourist trade. Mafiosi  have bought hotels like the Kursaal in Montecatini, luxury shops  in Florence, and beach establishments in Versilia where a string  of fires was set by arsonists. To the commissioners, the  president of a business association denied the criminal nature  of the fires out of fear that the area's good name would be  damaged.    They are afraid of the same thing in Abruzzo, which holds  the  record for limited financial companies whose directors minimized  any causes for concern to the commissioners. Senator Smuraglia  notes in his report that the same thing has happened in the past  in Puglia, and we know how that turned out--Puglia ended up  ranking fourth in Mafia corruption. Public opinion in Tuscany is  perceptive, but that does not make Prosecutor Pier Luigi Vigna's  testimony any less agonizing: 800 investigated for Mafia  connections and the Mafia's tentacles are everywhere. In Lucca,  there is the Musumeci mob from Calabria; in Pistoia, a group  connected to the Catania mob from Pulvirenti; and the Camorra  rules in Valdarno or Figline. Also disturbing are the ties  between the Mafia and the Masonic Lodge, which is very strong in  the region.    Symptomatic of the general tendency to underestimate the  danger of the Mafia was the failure of the law that made it  mandatory for banks to report suspicious transactions. As of  August 1993, there had only been 230 such reports, and only nine  of them came from the financial quarter of Milan.</p>

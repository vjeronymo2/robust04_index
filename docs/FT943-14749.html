			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: Losing foreign control Foreign subsidiary managers of global companies are losing clout and control, according to a report* from the worldwide business organisation The Conference Board. Based on in-depth interviews with 82 such managers in North America, Europe and Asia, the survey finds that authority over production decisions is in many cases being transferred to the product division at group headquarters. The biggest area of conflict between foreign subsidiary managers and the centre is marketing, with corporate headquarters increasingly issuing guidelines in this area. 'For many foreign subsidiary managers global competition and integration are generating negative experiences,' says the report's Paris-based author Stephen Gates. 'They become frustrated and demotivated since they retain profit responsibility whilst losing control over decisions. As their commitment to the company declines, they underperform and may eventually leave.' The report highlights the choice between local nationals and headquarters expatriates when it comes to filling foreign subsidiary posts, and reveals that it is the former more than the latter who are losing autonomy. It suggests their strong local affiliation can be a barrier to embracing the group's global strategy; but the expatriate type has a tendency to implement strategy in the local market too rigidly, and is liable to feelings of frustration on returning to base. The report describes a number of ways in which the foreign subsidiary manager's role can be enhanced, including taking advantage of entrepreneurial opportunities in local markets. Head offices, for instance, can follow the example of NEC USA and Monsanto Canada by assigning responsibility for a global product or service to a local manager with the intention of developing a centre of excellence within the group. *The changing global role of the foreign subsidiary manager.

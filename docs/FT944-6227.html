			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Speech): How the six wise men saw the chancellor's performance Andrew Britton National Institute of Economic and Social Research It is a broadly neutral Budget, which is right for this year. The chancellor has said that he will make more significant tax cuts when they can be afforded, that is to say when the level of borrowing has been significantly reduced. On his present figuring, that claim might well be made in his Budget speech next year. The Budget includes some welcome changes, particularly the measures to reduce structural unemployment. I was particularly pleased to hear of the cut in the rate of National Insurance cont-ributions at the lower end of the scale. He described the measures as affordable, which means he felt constrained by the need to reduce borrowing. He was able, nevertheless, to make some useful changes to the benefit system, which will help the transition back to work, especially for the long-term unemployed. It was, overall, a step in the right direction, but it leaves a lot still to be done - perhaps next year. Tim Congdon Lombard Research With this Budget, the chancellor has consolidated the progress in reducing public sector borrowing which began in the two Budgets of 1993. Next year the PSBR will be 3 per cent of GDP, still rather high but no longer excessive. In 1996-97, there is a good chance the public debt will be growing more slowly than national output. That is a signal achievement, particularly in an international environment where virtually all other industrial countries have rising ratios of public debt to national income and serious problems of long-run fiscal unsustainability. After massive tax increases announced in 1993, a large change in the tax burden was plainly not in prospect. Instead, Mr Clarke has made only marginal discretionary changes. This cramped his style and made for a very dull speech. Nevertheless, the outlook for the PSBR is exciting. David Currie London Business School This is a well-crafted Budget, delivered with characteristic panache. The overall Budget judgment is the right one: a broadly neutral Budget, but leaving in place the Pounds 6.5bn tax increases due next year as a result of the 1993 Budgets. The cuts in public spending are largely in cash terms, and not real, reflecting lower inflation; and the chancellor has made some sensitive adjustments to spending priorities, notably in health. However, the Budget does not avert the need for further rises in interest rates if the chancellor is to maintain his ambitious inflation target. The measures to promote savings, help the long-term unemployed and in taxing landfill are imaginative, though he could have gone further, particularly in using environmental taxes to reduce taxes on jobs, particularly for the low-paid. The chancellor's caution this year leaves him room for manoeuvre next year, when we may see more fireworks. Gavyn Davies Goldman Sachs International The package of measures to help the structural unemployed is welcome, though limited, and the chancellor has been wise enough to ignore calls for early tax cuts. However, he may not have done enough in this Budget to slow demand growth, which is now clearly excessive. I would have preferred larger cuts in the real level of government spending, or higher consumer taxes, to slow the economy and thus limit the need for higher base rates. Although the PSBR is falling fast, this does not justify tax cuts now or later. Paradoxically the government needs the economy to slow down from its present excessive rate in order to justify tax cuts, even if this retards the drop in PSBR. One way of achieving this is to raise interest rates further in the near future - something which would anyway have been needed, but now looks more necessary in the wake of today's broadly neutral package. Professor Wynne Godley Cambridge University Given the current rate of economic expansion, there remains the danger that the Budget was not tough enough in strategic terms. The chancellor is taking a bit of a risk in not capitalising on the current favourable economic conditions to raise taxes further and cut public expenditure in order to arrest growth. Tighter fiscal and spending measures would allow for a more accomodative monetary policy later. I stated in the last Treasury advisers' memo that the right thing to do is nothing at all. I would be sorry in the event of economic overheating if the chancellor was forced to raise interest rates prohibitively. The focus should be on getting investment going and maintaining a competitive exchange rate. Professor Patrick Minford Liverpool University This is a cautious Budget, built on a supply-based improvement in UK performance that has surprised forecasters. It has a welcome emphasis on modest improvements to incentives for the low-paid and on continuing reforms, and unexpectedly tough control, of public spending, including the injection of private finance. The chancellor rejected demands for higher capital allowances against corporation tax, preferring to keep the low corporation tax rates. The new housing benefit rules should stop 'rent inflation'. The forecasts of the PSBR have been revised down sharply, but still look too high and show that fears about the public finances were greatly exaggerated. There is scope for tax cuts: Mr Clarke's Pounds 1bn-plus devoted to business rates and the low-paid is modest. But by deferring large-scale tax cuts he has scotched any case for raising interest rates.</p>

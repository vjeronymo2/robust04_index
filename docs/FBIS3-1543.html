			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, president of the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo], wants a national unity government  for the country after the elections. Dhlakama says the idea  does not mean the October elections will not be held, stressing  that Renamo wants the polls to take place as scheduled. Afonso  Dhlakama explains his idea:    [Dhlakama] In the first phase of a democratic system in  Mozambique, I do not believe that it should be Renamo, Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] or any other party to rule the  country alone. Other parties ought to be made to feel at  ease.    Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, one of the  government representatives at the Supervision and Control  Commission, has reacted to Dhlakama's suggestion.    [Hunguana] I do not know what Mr. Dhlakama means when  he says each party should establish such a principle, in  addition to the principles enshrined in the Constitution and in  the General Peace Accord. Does he want to add any other  principle to the Constitution and the Peace Accord? He would  better clarify his position.    A number of opposition parties favor the establishment of a  multiparty forum that would define the principles of a national  unity government with a view to establishing them in the  Constitution. The Renamo leader said that is not what matters  right now.    [Dhlakama] I do not think it is very important to have  an agreement before elections are held. In fact it could be  construed as if we were not ready for elections. It would mean  that we would be discussing (?the number of votes) from the  onset. It would be a very complicated issue because one could  say: I will win and will require so many ministers from this  and that party.    Asked to give the government's view on a multiparty forum,  Hunguana said:    [Hunguana] Well, I think they are putting the cart  before the horse. We need free and fair elections to establish  democracy in this country. We need to have elections that would  lead to the creation of a forum where the country's future is  debated and defined. By proposing the establishment of such a  forum before elections are held, I think they are putting the  cart before the horse. Do they want to decide the future of the  country for the electorate? That has very little if anything to  do with democracy.    Teodato Hunguana noted that if Frelimo wins the elections,  it  would look into the possibility of establishing a national unity  government. He said Frelimo will search for every possible  solution to ensure peace, stability, democracy, and justice. He  questioned, however, whether the other parties would be able to  form a national unity government if they win the elections.</p>

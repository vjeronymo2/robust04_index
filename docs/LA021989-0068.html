			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE SUPREME COURT HOW IT WAS, HOW IT IS BY WILLIAM H.  REHNQUIST (QUILL/WILLIAM MORROW: $10.95)  </P> <P> Combining personal anecdote and juridical analysis, the chief justice of the  United States presents details of his own background and discusses the history  of the Supreme Court in language accessible to the literate layman.  </P> <P> Rehnquist does not discuss court cases since 1953 in which his current  colleagues played a part. He writes instead of his own beginnings as law clerk  to Robert H. Jackson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and of his  first years at the Capital.  </P> <P> He presents a cogent precis of the Court from the time of John Marshall to the  mid-20th Century and sketches the lives and personalities of some of the  important justices of our time.  </P> <P> The most instructive section is the last, which provides a summary of the  mechanics of the Supreme Court. Of the more than 5,000 appeals received per  year, the justices choose which cases to bring to the full court; of these  cases, each is debated for a full hour and an opinion conveying the outcome of  the final vote is written -- the drafting of which may take months.  </P></p>

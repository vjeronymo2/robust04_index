			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: GTE to sell its lighting operations for Dollars 1.1bn GTE, the US telecommunications group, has agreed to sell its worldwide lighting business to Siemens of Germany and a consortium of international investors advised by London-based Citicorp Venture Capital in two separate deals worth Dollars 1.1bn. GTE put the business, best known for its Sylvania brand light bulbs, up for sale last September, saying it wanted to focus its resources more fully on the telecommunications business. Osram, the Munich-based light bulb subsidiary of Siemens, will buy the North American part of the business, which has operations in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico. The international consortium, which is taking the name of Sylvania Lighting International, will acquire the operations in Europe, the Far East, Latin America and Australia. GTE declined to name members of the investor group or break out details of the two transactions, but Osram is believed to have paid the larger amount. The Dollars 1.1bn includes the assumption of about Dollars 100m in debt. Osram will increase its sales by some 70 per cent, to about Dollars 3bn, through the deal, and boost its employment from 16,400 people to about 29,000. GTE is getting a little less than Wall Street forecast when the business was put up for sale, but analysts yesterday said they were glad the company had finally got out ot the lighting business. The deal excludes two other subsidiaries in GTE's electrical products group, Valenite, which makes cutting tools, and Control Devices, which makes circuit breakers. They have a book value of about Dollars 200m. GTE said that when these were sold, the group expected to 'break even' on its electrical disposals, with no charge or gain against the division's Dollars 1.4bn book value. The divestiture is the latest of many disposals of non-core assets in recent years by GTE, which has simultaneously been building up its telecommunications assets, most notably by the Dollars 6bn acquisition of US regional group Contel in 1990, and last year's deal which gave it operating control of CANTV, the Venezuelan telephone company.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie drops to lowest level for five months - Market report The UK equity market fell to its lowest levels since July as both the FT-SE future and the FT-SE 100 index continued to drop below crucial support levels. Dealers said London had fallen away for various reasons  - domestic, international, political and economic. And there was no support for equity markets from international bonds which gave ground across the globe amid continued inflationary fears. The FT-SE 100 index ended the session a net 33.9 off at 2,943.4. Over the past two sessions the index has now fallen 70.4, or 2.3 per cent. The market's weakness extended to the second liners; the FT-SE Mid-Cap 250 index dropped 23.4 more to 3,372.4, for a two-day retreat of 55.5. A sudden and sharp sell-off in the FT-SE future in mid-morning helped to depress equities. Dealers ascribed the slide in the UK market to unease about Wall Street, which has been beset with worries about inflation and the possibility of another rise in US interest rates in the short term. The Orange County bankruptcy, and the threat of big forced selling of bonds, has increased pressure on US markets. Such was the gloom in London that even a positive opening performance by the Dow Jones Average, which moved up about eight points shortly after the opening and was still marginally higher two hours after London closed, failed to produce any worthwhile response from the UK market. There was little or no pressure on the market at the outset of trading when the 100-index opened about a point higher and gradually pushed up to the day's high of 2,987.5, up 10.5, helped by Wall Street's surprisingly steady performance last Friday. At that stage, however, a big seller of the FT-SE future, believed to have been a big US investment bank, found little resistance and both the future and the cash market began to tumble, helped on the way down by a couple of small to medium-sized sell programmes. Shortly after midday the 100 index moved down and never recovered, sliding to a low of 2,941.9 and closing below what was previously perceived as a strong resistance point of 2,955. Some marketmakers saw the failure of the market to finish above 2,955 as finally putting paid to any chances of a year-end rally. 'It's turn the lights out and come back in 1995 as far as I'm concerned,' said one. Another said the market felt 'unhappy, but not disastrous', and spoke of selective buying interest on the way down. The head of trading at one of the big integrated UK houses said it was difficult to be positive about a market which had crashed through two very important chart levels. The first of a series of crucial economic numbers to be released this week, input and output producer prices, failed to cause any big shift in sentiment. This morning brings the monthly Confederation of British Industry survey of Distributive Trades. Retailing provided one of the few strong sectoral performances with the top quality retailers, Marks and Spencer, GUS and Kingfisher making sound progress in spite of a generally bearish weekend press. There was more buying of the merchant banks/stockbrokers. Northern Electricity took over the lead in the regional electricity companies' interim dividend race, posting a scintillating 30 per cent rise in its payment. Composite insurers were roughly treated following the heavy flooding in Scotland, while housebuilders were affected by the recent interest rate rise and forecasts of further rises next year. Programme trades helped swell turnover in equities to 602.5m shares, with non-FT-SE stocks accounting for 54 per cent of the total. Customer business last Friday was Pounds 1.13bn.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler tries to defuse funds row THE CONSERVATIVE party has received no money from the governments or ruling families of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Brunei, Sir Norman Fowler indicated yesterday, as he tried to defuse the row over the party's funding. The Tory chairman spelt out four categories of donations the party would not accept. He told the home affairs committee his party would refuse any donation to which strings were attached; which the party had reason to believe contained illegally obtained monies; which came from a foreign government; or which it did not know the source of. He sidestepped questions about alleged donations from other individuals including Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping tycoon, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong businessman. 'We don't reveal details of people . . who make contributions,' he said. As Labour stepped up its attacks over the Pounds 440,000 in contributions the Tories have admitted receiving from companies controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, Sir Norman said the party accepted the money 'in good faith.' 'Contributions made do not buy influence in the affairs of the Conservative party,' he said. Sir Norman's comments came as Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on the Conservatives to repay Mr Nadir's donations, claiming the issue 'is now a matter for serious public concern'. Labour plans to pursue the subject further next Tuesday by arranging a Commons debate on the 'secrecy' of Conservative party funding. The party said it was 'not going to let this matter rest.' Yesterday, a Labour backbencher's bill designed to shed more light on Conservative party finance cleared its first parliamentary hurdle, although it has virtually no chance of becoming law. Meanwhile, the TUC added its voice to calls for tighter controls over political donations by companies. Trade unions last year spent Pounds 8m from 'political funds' on non-party political activities, in addition to the Pounds 8m they gave Labour, it disclosed. Questioned on whether his statement that the Conservative party had had no donations from the governments of Saudi Arabia or Kuwait included contributions from the respective royal families, Sir Norman said: 'Yes, I think that would also apply.' He said he was 'totally opposed' to the direct state funding of political parties. In a written submission to the committee, the party argued state funding would 'either unduly favour established parties or encourage the formation and growth of extremist parties.'</p>

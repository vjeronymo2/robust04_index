			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Tories cool on idea of June election SENIOR Conservatives yester-day sought to damp speculation that Mr John Major is considering a June general election as election fever gripped the three main parties. Close colleagues of the prime minister insisted that in 10 Downing Street the idea of a snap election had gone 'colder than cold' after last week's local election losses. Barring a 'spectacular' - and unexpected - Conservative majority in next week's Monmouth by-election, Mr Major had his sights set firmly on the autumn. But the Labour party indicated that it would attempt to harry the Conservatives into an early poll. Senior figures in the shadow cabinet believe that next month would offer the strongest chance of a Labour victory. Mr Major is expected today to tell Scottish Tories of his plans for a white paper this summer on a 'citizens charter' to promote better public services. Proposals being considered include performance related pay for public sector workers and compensation to consumers for bad services. The refusal of several ministers to close publicly the option of a June election left an impression that Mr Major is sufficiently anxious to secure his own mandate to believe that he might win next month. Ministers also stepped up their attacks on Labour's tax and spending policies. Following a lead set by Mr Major in the House of Commons, they charged that Mr Neil Kinnock's plan to abolish the ceiling on national insurance contributions would hit millions of people in the south of England whose incomes were barely above the average for the region. A Gallup opinion poll in today's Daily Telegraph puts the Tories just half a percentage point ahead of Labour. Speaking in the Monmouth by-election campaign, Mr John Cope, the deputy Conservative party chairman, refused to rule out the possibility of a June poll. At the Scottish Conservative conference in Perth, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, offered similarly opaque replies to questions from journalists. At one stage Mr Heseltine appeared to increase speculation with a series of confident predictions of an imminent turnaround in the economy. He cited this week's fall in mortgage rates and the expected sharp fall in inflation due to be announced next week as a secure basis for a fourth Conservative election victory. Senior ministers are emphasising in private that the party's analysis of the local election results does not provide a secure enough foundation for an early election. The interpretation offered to cabinet colleagues yesterday by Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, was that in spite of the loss of more than 900 seats, if a general election had been held last week the Conservatives would have secured a majority of 20 at Westminster. But Mr Patten is believed to consider that such a figure is well within the margin of error and to have advised Mr Major to wait until the autumn. At the Scottish conference today, the prime minister will develop further the Conservatives' strategy for attacking Labour. But he may also use his closing address to take some of the steam out of the speculation on June. Citizens' charter, Page 10 Taxing question, Page 15</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling offer from British Land finds favour VOLUME in the international bond market picked up yesterday as British Land launched its widely-expected Eurosterling offering. The commercial property group raised Pounds 150m through an offering of 30-year Eurobonds. The relatively generous yield spread on the unsecured bonds ensured a favourable reception with investors. The bonds were priced to yield 180 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent UK government bond due 2017. Lead manager SG Warburg said that following this issue, the average maturity of British Land's outstanding debt would exceed 20 years. Only a few years ago, 70 per cent of the company's debt had a maturity of less than five years. The bonds, which were mainly placed with UK investors, had a fixed re-offer price of 98.843. When they were freed to trade they eased to 98.69 bid, in line with the weakness in the underlying UK government bond market. However, the spread on the bonds narrowed to 178 basis points. The Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia is expected to make its debut in the international bond market today with a FFr1bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Catalonia's Eurobonds, via CCF, are likely to be priced to yield 30 to 35 basis points over the underlying French government OATs. By contrast, the forthcoming FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds from the Spanish region of Andalucia is expected to have a yield spread of around 35 basis points. Depfa, the German mortgage bank, is expected to achieve a yield spread of 20 to 25 basis points when it raises between FFr2bn and FFr3bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Catalonia's issue is the result of the region's decision to open new channels for financing its debt. The region plans to fund up to a quarter of its annual borrowing needs in foreign bond markets from next year. The region also plans to raise Pta25bn before the end of the year in the domestic Spanish market. The domestic issue and the Eurobond issue will complete the region's 1993 borrowing programme of Pta93bn. Catalonia plans to raise a similar amount next year. Catalonia, which has a credit rating of Aa2 from Moody's, has chosen French francs for its first Eurobond offering because of the low volatility between the franc and the peseta. Between 30 to 50 per cent of the proceeds of the forthcoming Eurobond issue will be swapped into pesetas. In the Eurodollar sector, the Kingdom of Sweden increased its recent global offering of floating rate notes by Dollars 500m to Dollars 1.5bn as investors sought protection against the volatility in the US Treasury market. In the domestic sterling bond market, NatWest Capital Markets brought a Pounds 125m issue of debenture stock due 2018 for Halos, a new special purpose vehicle consisting of 10 housing associations. NatWest said that the introduction of covenants relating to capital and income gearing and its agreement to provide a 25-year loan facility representing 5 per cent of the nominal stock were designed to meet any investor concerns about the long maturity of the issue.</p>

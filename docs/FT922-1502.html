			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Aldeburgh Festival - Music In her autobiography the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya recounts how delighted she was to return to Aldeburgh after years away and find that the town had not changed a bit. There is something about the open fenland and the force of the elements on the wind-swept East coast: life moves slowly here and time encourages contemplation of man's place in the world. It is difficult to think of a more congenial spot in which to make acquaintance of a new opera by John Tavener. His music also inhabits a time-scale of its own and the very slowness and inaction is intended to bestow upon his work a mood of undisturbed transcendental mysticism, as a remarkably patient Aldeburgh audience found at the premiere of his second opera, Mary of Egypt, on Friday. Its story is the same - unintentionally, one imagines - as Massenet's Thais. It tells of the prostitute Mary and a holyman, who meet in the desert and through their discovery of each other find their positions in effect reversed, for she knows true goodness, while he only starts to find it through his love for her. As Mother Thekla's text spells out at one point, 'there is more than one way to know God'. ***** The mood is static, imbued with the sounds and rhythms of religious ceremony. The cast is small; the atmosphere rarified; the manner of composition full of self-imposed restrictions, using an ancient Byzantine hymn as the basis for the whole score. As it happens, these are also the building-blocks of some other stage works that Aldeburgh knows well: Benjamin Britten's Church Parables. But how much more Britten made of his comparable exercise. All the music in Mary of Egypt is derived from two or three phrases. One of them, a simple harmonic minor scale, is repeated so often that one comes out with it going round and round in the brain - a hypnotic effect, as the composer no doubt intended, but one that does not conceal the basic paucity of ideas. Repetition is all there is, occupying vast half-hour swathes at a time. An F pedal runs through virtually the whole of the 100-minute score. Very little actually happens and Lucy Bailey's production, with designs by Jeremy Herbert, has merely to bide its time with the right aura of mystic grace. It was not entirely the producer's fault that the scenes of temptation were so weak. Tavener provided no more than rhythm-less drumming, at which the dancers, clad in Hare-Krishna orange, regularly became possessed by a desire to lift their skirts and show us their knickers. Patricia Rozario was the ideal Mary, spinning long, melismatic lines of sultry soprano tone; Stephen Varcoe played Zossima, the holy man, with firm resolution. On-stage and off-stage choruses were taken severally by the Britten-Pears Chamber Choir and the Choristers of Ely Cathedral, while Lionel Friend led the musical performance from the pit. Nothing they did, however, could stop the air of a 1960s 'happening.' ***** Tavener is the featured composer at Aldeburgh this year and his music turned up again the next night at the London Sinfonietta's concert. With Oliver Knussen as conductor and Christopher van Kampen the cello soloist we heard The Protecting Veil Tavener's recent and unexpected cult success. Compared with the opera, this score is positively packed with incident and its luxuriant string harmonies sounded well in the Maltings's glorious acoustics. For a complete contrast the programme also included the first performance, nearly 70 years after it was written, of Grohg, a ballet by Aaron Copland. Violent, jazzy, a riot of activity in which strong musical ideas tumble one over another, this is an orchestral showpiece on the lines of Bartok's Miraculous Madarin and the much-enlarged Sinfonietta played it with noisy panache. In the morning the festival's middle week-end gave a respectful nod to its founder, Britten. None of his five Canticles is without some weakness, but heard together they make a natural recital programme, the very diversity of styles lending strength to the series as a whole. The tenor soloist, who sings in all five, was Adrian Thompson, not an elegant singer, but honest in his instincts and able to allay any suspicion of artifice in the music. Nicholas Clapton and Peter Savidge joined him as counter-tenor and baritone; Roger Vignoles was the pianist, Michael Thompson the solo horn and Skaila Kanga the harpist, able colleagues all.</p>

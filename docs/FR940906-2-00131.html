Department of Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Summary of Response Mission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Energy (DOE) owns and operates a variety of radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities throughout the United States. These activities include: fixed nuclear sites; the use, storage, and shipment of a variety of radioactive materials; the shipment of spent reactor fuel; the production, assembly, and shipment of nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials; the production and shipment of radioactive sources for space ventures; and the storage and shipment of radioactive and mixed waste. DOE is responsible for the safe operation of these activities and should an emergency occur at one of its sites or an activity under its control, DOE will be the LFA for the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to its technical capabilities and resources, the DOE may perform other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roles within the Federal response to a radiological emergency. With extensive, field-based radiological resources throughout the United States available for emergency deployment, the DOE responds to requests for offsite radiological monitoring and assessment assistance and serves as the initial coordinator of all such Federal assistance (to include initial management of the FRMAC) to State and local governments. With other specialized, deployable assets, DOE assists other Federal agencies responding to malevolent nuclear emergencies, accidents involving nuclear weapons not under DOE custody, emergencies caused by satellites containing radioactive sources, and other radiological incidents as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Capabilities and Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> DOE has trained personnel, radiological instruments, mobile laboratories, and radioanalytical facilities located at its national laboratories, production, and other facilities throughout the country. Through eight Regional Coordinating Offices, these resources form the basis for the Radiological Assistance Program, which can provide technical assistance in any radiological emergency. DOE can provide specialized radiation detection instruments and support for both its response as LFA and as initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinator of Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance. Some of the specialized resources and capabilities include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Aerial monitoring capability for tracking dispersion of radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and mapping ground contamination;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A computer-based, emergency preparedness and response predictive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability that provides rapid predictions of the transport, diffusion, and deposition of radionuclides released to the atmosphere and dose projections to people and the environment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Specialized equipment and instruments and response teams for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locating radioactive materials and handling damaged nuclear weapons;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Medical experts on radiation effects and the treatment of exposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated patients; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Support facilities for DOE response, including command post  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies, communications systems, generators, and portable video and photographic capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

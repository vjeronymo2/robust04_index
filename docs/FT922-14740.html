			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Travel: Welcome to the pleasure dome - Richard Gilbert enjoys a return visit to a Center Parcs all-weather complex IN 1967, Piet Derksen, the Dutch founder and chairman of Center Parcs, had a vision of the ideal holiday experience. It would be, he said, 'a holiday the weather couldn't spoil, with every imaginable facility built in, combining the flavour of the country club, the health farm, the sports complex and the villa holiday.' To which the only answer might well have been: 'Come off it, Piet - have another pils and stop dreaming.' Today, though, there are 12 Center Parcs in Europe - seven in their native Holland, two in Belgium, one in France and two in England. The occupancy rate rarely seems to drop below 95 per cent; the company, now part of Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries, increased its net profit last year, and the concept envisaged by Derksen seems custom-built for sun-starved, environmentally-aware North Europeans who want to take short breaks in man-made forest villages. Impressed by my first exposure in 1990 to the Center Parc formula at the Elveden Forest village in Suffolk, I became part of the repeat trade and took my unprotesting family last year to Holland, to see how the Dutch run their own invention on home ground. Thanks to the efficiency of Netherlands Railways we reached Het Meerdal, in the south-east region of Limburg, just three hours after buying rail-rover tickets in Amsterdam's Central Station. Het Meerdal is one of Center Parcs' oldest villages, but the concept is the same as the two English Center Parcs in Elveden and Sherwood Forest: 650 stone-built villas are cunningly scattered through 400 acres of woodland, surrounded by gorse and sand. The cunning comes in the original layout and its harmonisation with existing woodland. As a result, you are largely unaware that there are 2,000 other holidaymakers in the village. All the villas are single-storey with their own front path and a back patio overlooking water or forest. Center Parcs' roads are a car-free zone and most people hire bikes from a cycle centre. After admiring the ten-station TV (including two free film channels) and the view of the lake and woods through the sliding lounge windows, we headed for the nerve-centre of every Center Parc - the Subtropical Swimming Paradise. Here, under an impressive transparent cupola, is a fan-shaped leisure lagoon: pools, chutes, rapids and flumes. The temperature is a constant 84 degrees and my two sons instantly disappeared like two pieces of pale driftwood into a foaming slide that curved serpent-like outside the geodesic dome and back again. At 102 metres, the Het Meerdal slide is the longest of all the Center Parcs, and this was one of the features that helped tilt their verdict over Elveden. It is outside the Swimming Paradise that an English visitor soon notices the differences between Center Parcs at home and away. At Elveden, the demand for sports facilities, whether tennis, squash, bowling or petanque, is greater than the demand at Het Meerdal. In fact, within months of opening, Elveden had to expand its sports areas greatly just to keep up with the British appetite for sports and recreation, despite the extra charge you have to pay for all activities except swimming. While Elveden hires out 3,000 bikes each week, at Het Meerdal only 1,000 are rented. At Het Meerdal we had no trouble booking any sport we wanted during our long weekend. Outside the swimming areas there are shops, restaurants and cafes clustered round landscaped ponds, streams and rockeries under the same transparent geodesic dome. Parakeets, turtles and flamingos laze among the orchids. I found a tranquil escape from all this sport at Chez Pierre, a bar that offered an excellent selection of beers. For eating out you can choose between an Italian restaurant, a pancake house, fast food or the Bistro, which serves gargantuan meals. In Holland, though, more visitors seem to cater for themselves than at Elveden Forest. Centre Parcs states that the first staff to move on to any new site are not designers or architects but professional ecologists who ensure that site development does not destroy the local flora and fauna, which are all carefully identified before a sod of earth is lifted. At Elveden there are apparently more species flourishing in the ancient Suffolk forest habitat than in 1987, when building began. I am no naturalist, but the only red squirrels I have met in 25 years were a pair that ran in front of my bike in Het Meerdal last summer. The appeal of the Center Parc formula is that it crosses age barriers and national frontiers, and leaves decision-making to the guests. If you want to fish for golden carp or try your hand at archery, pony trekking, wind-surfing, tennis or ten-pin bowling, the squeaky-clean facilities are readily available. On the other hand, if you want to cook a meal in your own forest villa (not chalets, thank you) or sink a bottle of genevra, that too is easily done. Above all, Center Parcs are unpressurised, comfortable and offer what the trade calls an NWDF - a non-weather dependent facility. That is why the villages are in such demand in autumn and winter. How will Center Parcs develop? There are plans for a third English village - in the grounds of Longleat - but the most interesting new direction is likely to be leisure-starved east Germany and beyond. Think of all those forests in eastern Europe and Russia. As a misty-eyed Dutch manager said to me: 'Terrific consumer potential out there, but getting the infrastructure sorted out will be a nightmare.' Currently, prices for a two-bedroom villa at Elveden Forest range from Pounds 222-Pounds 275 for a mid-week break (Monday to Friday), Pounds 235-Pounds 290 for a weekend, and Pounds 365-Pounds 456 for a week. During the summer school holiday you can only book by the week: Pounds 637-Pounds 764 for a two-bedroom villa. In Britain, reservations for any Center Parc: tel: 0623-411411. Brochures: 0272-244744.

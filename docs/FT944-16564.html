			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Delors refuses to reveal plans Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, said in an interview yesterday with the newspaper, Liberation, that he would make no decision on whether to run for the French presidency until his Brussels mandate ended on January 6. This announcement came as an opinion poll for the first time put him level with the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, in the crucial run-off vote for the presidency, while easily outdistancing the other Gaullist contender, Mr Jacques Chirac. The Socialist party is holding a full party congress next month and then a mini-convention in December specifically to discuss what sort of platform it would like a candidate to run on in May. However, few in the Socialist party would complain if Mr Delors were subsequently to bend that platform to suit himself. In the current presidential 'phoney war' no mainstream contender wants to make his candidacy formal and thus open to attack from all rivals. Mr Delors' asset at the moment is the cast-iron pretext for silence that his Commission presidency gives him until January.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight commenters were in favor of eliminating the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the processor ensure that invoices clearly show the discount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included or refund due to the recipient agencies for the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product purchased. Commenters provided two main reasons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishing to eliminate this requirement: 1) it has proved very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to require distributors to identify refunds due or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discounts given on the invoices and 2) the requirement had become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somewhat obsolete because FCS policy currently allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors/distributors to provide pricing summaries to recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies in lieu of providing the pricing information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invoices. Five commenters were opposed to the proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that they wanted to retain the pricing information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the invoices because the invoice is the best place to alert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agencies that a refund is due or a discount has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given. One commenter added that many processors who utilize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund system provide a pre-printed rebate application which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lists the commodity value for each end product. Two commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that the proposed rule would have little, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on their operations. Only one comment was received on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes proposed for the NCP Program. That commenter endorsed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed provisions in section 252.4(c)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, several processors and distributors have expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern to FCS about the added cost of redesigning and reprinting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invoices in order to accommodate the requirement in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that the processor/distributor invoices clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate the discount included or the refund due on end products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the growing concern, on May 2, 1989, FCS issued a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy memorandum which allowed processors or distributors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide recipient agencies a fact sheet, which clearly identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the processed end products are made from commodities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates the amount of refund or discount due eligible recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies for such purchases. The Department believes it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to incorporate this existing policy into the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. These pricing information summaries need only consist of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information such as the product code, gross price, refund due or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discount given and net price. These summaries, as well as any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> updates to the summaries, must be prepared by processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to recipient agencies by either the processor or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributing agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, this final rule adopts sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(c)(4)(xvii), 250.30(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2)of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed NCP regulations without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substitution of Donated Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(f)(1)(i), of the proposed rule would allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution of commercial food for those donated foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically listed as substitutable in the current regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without requesting prior approval from the distributing agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, sections 250.30(f)(1)(iii), 250.30(f)(2), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(f)(4) of the proposed State processing regulations include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following provisions: 1) Processors may continue to request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval from FCS to substitute other commercial foods (except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meat and poultry), although without the requirement that requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be made only when the distributing agency's inability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain the necessary inventory of donated food at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing plant would disrupt the production of end products and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all cases in which a State processing contract permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution, provided that processors must provide documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to substantiate that they continue to acquire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient substitutable commercial foods necessary to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 percent yield requirement; 2) Distributing agencies can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withhold deliveries of donated food from processors which have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced their level of commercial production because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the State processing program; and 3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorization to substitute commercial foods for donated foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not specifically listed applies only for the duration of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts currently entered into by the processor. Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed rule would similarly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend the NCP regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received sixteen comments on this proposal. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters concurred that processors should not need written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval from the distributing agency to substitute those donated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods listed as substitutable in the regulations with commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods. However, two commenters stated that the Department should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider making all donated foods substitutable and one commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that all donated food, except for meat and poultry, should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered as substitutable. Those commenters who favored a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total or almost total substitution of all donated foods provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions under which substitution should be permitted: 1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service inspectors and/or USDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agricultural Marketing Service graders verify that the commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food being substituted is of equal or better quality and is of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same generic identity as the donated food; 2) the processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide the specifications of the commercial food used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute for donated food, along with a certification that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituted foods are of equal or better quality; and 3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor must report all substitution on the monthly performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to the distributing agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments were received in response to the proposal which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would permit distributing agencies to withhold deliveries of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> donated food from processors who have reduced their level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial production because of participation in the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing program. These commenters made it clear that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe distributing agencies do not have access to a processor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records on the production of commercial end products in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether withholding donated food is appropriate. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor expressed concern that the documentation necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiate that the processor acquires sufficient amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutable donated food would increase the overall workload of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the distributing agency staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

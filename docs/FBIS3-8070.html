The commander of the Serb forces in the territories east of  Tuzla, Colonel Momir Zec, has said that the Serb forces,  regardless of the agreement which allows humanitarian flights to  Tuzla, are keeping a close watch on the airport.    Col. Zec Told Belgrade daily POLITIKA that the top Serb  military officials were not surprized by the decision to re-open  the Tuzla airport.    "This is a political move which removes the NATO threats  and,  within such a compromise, it suits us better to have Russian  troops supervize the airport," Col. Zec explained.    The whole issue of the Tuzla airport has been discussed by  the media for the past seven months, the Colonel recalls. It is  an artificial, extremely politicized construction, allegedly  aimed at facilitating the supply of relief aid. it is obvious  that some Western countries want to neutralize the arms embargo  resolution on Bosnia and use the airport to supply the Bosnian  Moslems with arms.    The Tuzla airport is 5-6 km away from Serb front lines, Col.  Zec said. it is in poor condition. The runway, which was  damaged, is being repaired, but not the airport buildings.    Colonel Zec also denied some agency allegations that the  Bosnian Serbs bombarded Tuzla 3 days ago, immediately after the  downing of the four aircraft near Banjaluka. "We do not bombard  Tuzla. We only respond to Moslem provocations, but our actions  are aimed strictly at military targets," Colonel Zec said.    Since the beginning of the war, two years ago, there have  never been large-scale battles between the Serbs and Moslems in  and around Tuzla. 14,000 Serbs still remain in the town, but  the Moslem authorities refuse to allow them to leave.</p>

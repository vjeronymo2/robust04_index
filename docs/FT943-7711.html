			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Economists find worrying fall on the supply side Economists have found fresh cause for concern about the health of the UK economy - a reduction in the supply of economists. British schools are apparently producing instead a generation of would-be entrepreneurs who see business studies as a route to fulfilment. Mr Paul Walton, economist with James Capel, the UK securities house, says in a report that the number of candidates for A-level in economics  - often termed 'the dismal science' - hit a 20-year low this year at 30,885, a drop since last year of 15.2 per cent. It peaked at 43,500 in 1983. While the pass rate has improved to 78.4 per cent (up from 63.7 per cent in 1978), Mr Walton says it has not kept up with other subjects - only social sciences and computing have worse failure rates. Charts produced by James Capel show a 'tentative relationship with the economic cycle', and Mr Walton argues that the result is likely to be 'a smaller band of more rigorously trained economists'. The sharp fall in A-level economics has been balanced by a rise in applicants for business studies, which was introduced as a subject only 15 years ago. Applications for the subject, which concentrates on financial analysis and management science, rose by 9.9 per cent this year to 24,920. Mr Walton's analysis for James Capel suggests that the rise of the stock market, and the 'cult of the businessman', have encouraged this trend. He adds that pass rates have improved to 80.2 per cent this year, from 49.5 per cent in 1978. However, the proportion earning the top 'A' grade remains the lowest for any subject, at 6.6 per cent. Figures for numbers of full-time undergraduates at UK universities show that the trend is continuing in higher education. The numbers studying business and management studies rose by 12.9 per cent this year.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Observer: Photo squall Forget 30 per cent inflation a month, competitive decline and mounting home debt, the president of Brazil, Itamar Franco, is pre-occupied with a more pressing worry. It's that Rio de Janeiro's 20,000 taxis have taken to displaying his photograph on the price tables carried in their windows. The idea was the response of Rio's mayor to a survey showing that a lot of Brazilians didn't know who their president was. So out went the beach scenes and so on normally fronting the price lists issued monthly to account for inflation, and up went Franco's photo. Whereas most politicians would welcome the citywide parade of their image, he was livid. Seeing it as a sneaky way of blaming him for price increases, he demanded that the pictures be removed . . . only to have the mayor decline, saying they were tokens of Rio's homage to the president. But Franco was not to be mollified. He has now issued a government decree ordering taxi-drivers to white out the photos on pain of a fine. Some are saying he'd be better trying to wipe out the inflation instead.</p>

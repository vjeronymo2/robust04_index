Storms were  widespread from North Carolina to New York, dumping five inches of rain at  Madison, Va., 4.25 inches at Kinsale, Va., and 3.80 at Whalleysville, Md.  Officials evacuated 18 to 20 residents of one apartment complex in Chapel Hill,  N.C., when water overflowed the banks of a nearby creek.

In Durham, a tornado destroyed a section of a concrete storage  building and strong wind gusts up to 50 m.p.h. downed power lines. There were  no reports of injuries.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d) of &sect;1717.860 expands the circumstances under which a lien subordination may be obtained for investments in rural development and other non-electric utility endeavors in the case of borrowers that meet the 110 percent test. It provides that a borrower that meets the 110 percent test is eligible for a lien subordination on the specific assets financed by a loan made directly to the borrower for rural development or other non-electric utility purposes, provided that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated under paragraph (d), after taking into consideration the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination. While the rule grants this additional latitude to borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, REA continues to urge all borrowers to use separate subsidiaries when making investments in rural development or other non-electric utility endeavors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investments lien subordinated under paragraph (d) will be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent of total utility plant limitation set forth in 7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not constitute approval of the investment under 7 CFR part 1717 subpart N.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) of &sect;1717.860 exempts borrowers that meet the 110 percent test from the requirement of &sect;1717.856(d) that they submit an equity development plan with their application for a lien accommodation or subordination if the ratio of their equity to total assets is below a specified level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(ii)(A) of &sect;1717.852 are amended to make it clear that programs of demand side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems are eligible for lien accommodations and subordinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1717.904_Exemptions Pursuant to Section 306E of the RE Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new section establishes policies and procedures, consistent with those in &sect;1710.7 and 1717.860, for lien accommodations for supplemental concurrent loans made to borrowers that meet the 110 percent test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

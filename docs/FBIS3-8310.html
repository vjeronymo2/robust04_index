			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Open Letter by Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov in </F> Connection With the Petition Signed by Officers of the Bulgarian  Army, and Organized by Certain Members of the Rakovski Bulgarian  Officer Legion"]    [Text] Democracy in the Armed Forces has its limits.  Certain activists of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion  crossed these limits. Already, on several occasions petitions  were initiated and signed by officers of he Bulgarian Army,  something that contradicts the Disciplinary Regulations of the  Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, Article 104, Chapter  5, and the following paragraphs, according to which petitions,  proposals, and complains can only have a personal character.  Those actions contradict the basic postulates regarding  relations between the Ministry of Defense and the Rakovski  Officer Legion, according to which mutual activity must be based  on the steady observance of the Constitution, the country's  laws, the military charters, and the principle of  one-man-command.    Those who seek an increase in the military budget through  petitions and publishing opinions at this very difficult period  for the country, speculate with the common interest of the  military personnel, and push the Army toward destabilization and  politicization. In their striving to protect their own  interests the organizers and initiators of the petition are  prepared to trigger a confrontation between the Army and  society. As a minister of defense, I have only one choice in  anything related to the military budget: To accommodate the  Army within the budget adopted by the National Assembly through  painful but prudent decisions.    With its actions, the leadership of the Rakovski Bulgarian  Officer Legion inflicted a blow on the authority of the Legion,  which as established in order to increase the status and  prestige of the officers, rally the officer corps, and assert  the Bulgarian Army's values and traditions.    There can be no instigation in the Bulgarian Army, and such  a  situation will not be tolerated.    Those who think that the Armed Forces of the Republic of  Bulgaria could be directed through petitions from the bottom to  the top are deceiving themselves.</p>

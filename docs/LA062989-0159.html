			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME;  </P> <P> SOUTH'S CRAYTON GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO IMPRESS AT HIS CHOSEN POSITION  </P> <P> Estrus Crayton of Santa Ana High School tried for two seasons to convince  coaches and teammates that he was a running back.  </P> <P> One future teammate had his doubts the first day Crayton walked into Santa  Ana's gymnasium after moving to Southern California from Texas as a junior.  </P> <P> "I was walking through the gym with my uncle and some guys asked me if I played  sports," Crayton said. "I told them I was a running back.  </P> <P> "Robert Lee (the Saints' 1,000-yard rusher) looked at me and said, 'Running  back? You can forget it.' "  </P> <P> Welcome to Santa Ana High, Estrus Crayton. Now prove that you belong on the  same field with some of the best athletes in Orange County.  </P> <P> It wasn't easy. Crayton spent most of his junior season getting acclimated to a  new school, playing cornerback and trying to talk his coaches into giving him  an opportunity to run with the football.  </P> <P> "I begged them to put me in at running back," Crayton said. "Finally, I got my  chance one day in practice."  </P> <P> Crayton ran several sweeps, accelerating around the corners and breaking into  an open field. Afterward, Lee told him, "You made them (defense) look real  stupid."  </P> <P> Crayton had impressed Lee. The next step was the coaching staff. He became a  third-string running back in practice, then finally got a chance to run in a  playoff game against Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Crayton rushed for nearly 100 yards in a lopsided victory and many were  predicting he would replace the graduating Lee at tailback as a senior.  </P> <P> Before his senior year, Crayton worked out with his uncle, Jim Lyday, three  days a week lifting weights and running in the deep sand of the Santa Ana River  bed to increase his leg strength. He rode an exercise bicycle 10 miles every  day.  </P> <P> He anticipated a productive senior season at running back. Instead, he  alternated with junior Garner Hicks at tailback.  </P> <P> "It seemed like every time I made a good run and felt like I was getting  started, I was back on the sideline," Crayton said. "I felt I should have  played more."  </P> <P> Crayton gained 639 yards in 93 carries, averaging 6.9 yards per carry and  scoring eight touchdowns. He also started at cornerback and was tried as a wide  receiver in an early season loss to Loyola.  </P> <P> "I caught one pass for three yards in that game," he said. "Nothing worked that  night. The next day, the coaches asked me what I wanted to play. I told them I  was a running back and decided to prove it in league (play)."  </P> <P> Crayton was convincing in leading Santa Ana to its third straight Century  League title and was later named the most valuable player of the Century  League. Crayton had silenced his critics as an established running back. Well,  almost.  </P> <P> Crayton was selected to play for the South team in the 30th Orange County  All-Star football game on Friday night in Orange Coast College's LeBard  Stadium. But he was originally picked as a defensive back.  </P> <P> "I think coaches take one look at me (6-foot-3, 180 pounds) and automatically  think I'm a receiver or a defensive back," he said. "I know defensive players  look at me and think, 'I'm going to kill that skinny guy.' "  </P> <P> But once again, Crayton has made an impression. He will be the starting  tailback for the South team in a game that showcases the top talent in the  county.  </P> <P> "A lot of people see him as a wide receiver or defensive back," said South  Coach Dave Holland of Corona del Mar. "But he's shown good explosion and the  ability to turn the corner quickly at running back. He's the best back in  camp."  </P> <P> On game night, there will be another test for Crayton. He will likely be  compared to the North's highly publicized starting tailback, Derek Brown of  Servite. Brown established a county single-season rushing record as a senior  and has signed a letter of intent to play at Nebraska in the fall.  </P> <P> "People are saying this game is going to be the Derek Brown Show, but I feel I  have something to show people," Crayton said. "I'm hoping people will look at  me and say, 'Who's that guy?"'  </P></p>

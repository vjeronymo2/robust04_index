			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- Shortly before 7.30AM  KwaZulu Chief Minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi cast his vote at an Umlazi polling station.  Few voters at the polling station knew about the IFP leader's  unannounced arrival and there were only about 50 voters at the  station. Just before Mr Buthelezi's arrival at Umlazi the  ballot papers and necessary IFP stickers had been delivered.</p>

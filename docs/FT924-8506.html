			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Looser curbs discussed on eve of Iraqi invasion JUST THREE weeks before Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait on August 2 1990, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called a meeting of senior British ministers to consider the relaxation of restrictions on defence-related sales to Iraq. The meeting on July 19 1990 was the culmination of more than two years of Whitehall battles over guidelines set out in 1985 by the then foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to prevent Britain arming either side in the Iran-Iraq war. Its conclusions, and background papers prepared beforehand, may prove one of the most fertile areas of investigation for the judicial inquiry set up yesterday by Lord Justice Scott. As a confidential Ministry of Defence background paper re-veals, the issue of machine tool sales to Iraq was at the heart of the meeting. The paper, dated July 17 1990, says ministers had five days earlier been issued with intelligence assessments of Iraq's 'strategic weapons programme'. Until then senior ministers might have claimed they were unaware of many of the detailed decisions taken by officials and more junior ministers which had allowed sales of sophisticated arms manufacturing equipment to Iraq over the previous two years. But on July 19, the government papers suggest, the issue was being discussed at the very top of the government. Last night Downing Street said Mr John Major, then chancellor, had not attended. But the papers make clear that a Treasury minister was represented. A cabinet office paper prepared for the meeting outlined a series of options. One favoured the status quo while another called for a formal relaxation of the rules. The third, strongly favoured by the MoD, suggested outright abolition of the special restrictions. Previously, the Department of Trade and Industry had fought tenaciously and, usually successfully, for the the loosest possible interpretation of the rules. By June 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, trade and industry secretary, decided to formalise the status quo. He wrote to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, to request the high-level review. Mr Hurd was chosen to chair it. Mr Ridley was forced to resign from the cabinet over some remarks on Europe five days before the meeting. The outcome is not documented in the mass of secret government papers which emerged this week from the collapse of the court case against machine tool manufacturers Matrix Churchill. In the event, any decisions made were quickly overtaken by the much tighter regime imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>

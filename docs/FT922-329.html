			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: High-tech rackets are ruination of tennis Sir, As I watched on German television some of the men's singles matches at Wimbledon, that of Boris Becker versus Martin Damm was typical of what one now is used to in grass and hard courts championships. By my reckoning, each point consisted on average of just three strokes - service, return, and volley. Thus, in each hour, the ball was actually in play for about three-and-a-half to four minutes maximum. The German television commentator ironically, and in my view aptly, referred to both players as 'Aufschlagsmachinen' - hitting machines. The introduction of the 'high-tech' racket in the 1970s has massively contributed to the ruination of mens' championship tennis, transforming it largely into a spectacle of power and speed, dominated perforce by men well over six feet in height, who, by the very nature of their technique, lack the artistry, touch and grace of their predecessors. What I really fail to understand is the attitude of the Wimbledon spectators who are prepared to pay for, and sit through such boredom, 'enjoying', if that is the word, watching the ball in play for so short a time - probably less than 7 per cent of total match time.

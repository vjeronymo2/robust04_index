			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman of the Slovak </F> National Party, by Eva Zelenayova; place and date not given: "I  Spoke With Zhirinovskiy"]    [Excerpts] The World Congress of Slav, Orthodox, and  Christian Nations was held in Moscow on 3 April. The Slovak  National Party [SNS] sent Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar to the  congress as an observer. His participation in the congress  triggered an unusually strong and above all negative response in  the mass media. The fact that the congress was held immediately  after the conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which organized the congress,  served as a pretext for spreading speculation.    [Zelenayova] With what intentions did you depart for Moscow?    [Molnar] My visit to Moscow is being commented on with the  expressed aim of generating certain moods and spreading  disinformation. Efforts can even be detected to discredit this  visit and the foreign policy line of our party. Indeed, the  congress was organized by the LDPR and we have been saying  openly that we used our participation in the congress to  unofficially establish contacts with LDPR representatives, which  undeniably represents a real political force. I went to Moscow  in order to obtain firsthand information.    [Zelenayova] The LDPR is considered to be an extremist  party. Your contacts with its representatives allow politicians  and journalists to argue that the SNS has also joined this  current.    [Molnar] Our party also had an observer at the congress of  the Coexistence Movement, and no one claimed that our  orientation is pro-Hungarian. Our party has carried out a very  precise analysis of the developments in Russia. In this  analysis, we did not evaluate or consider whether the LDPR is a  positive or a negative phenomenon. We merely considered that it  represents a real force that must be reckoned with and that can  influence developments in Central Europe.    [Zelenayova] I do not assume that you consider the LDPR a  real force only because of Zhirinovskiy's strong words. His  plans to create a Russian empire reaching to the Indian Ocean  and his reference to Bratislava as the capital of this empire  have rightly alarmed politicians.    [Molnar] The real strength of this party does not lie in  Zhirinovskiy's vocabulary but in the election results. It has  entered the Duma as the strongest party. As for Bratislava, it  is being considered as a possible ideological center of the  Slavs and not as the capital of a Russian empire. After all, it  would be absurd for Russia to try to bring together some empire  and hand over its capital to another nation. At the Moscow  congress there was talk about creating an association of Slav  nations and it is in this context that one has to understand the  reference to Bratislava. It would play a similar role as  Strasbourg, which fulfills the function of capital for the  European Union. However, there has never been talk about a new  state formation.    [Zelenayova] Do you consider it conceivable for the Slav  nations to unite? This is not a new idea.    [Molnar] It is interesting that whenever there is talk about  Slav nations, someone always makes a tremendous fuss about it.  Slovakia is a member of the Central European Initiative, which  does not remind anyone of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although  it occupies the same geographic space. But when there is talk  of 300 million Slavs, all kinds of noises can immediately be  heard about links with the former regime and such like. This is  natural. Were the 300 million Slavs to unite, they would  constitute a decisive force in Europe and the world. Western  Europe is naturally afraid of this because it is ethnically  mixed, being inhabited by Latin nations, Germans, Anglo-Saxons,  and remnants of the Celts. As for Zhirinovskiy's plans, at the  congress in Moscow it was said that the unification of the  nations of Russia [as published] should be brought about by  nonmilitary means. [passage omitted]    While in Moscow, I clearly declared that the Slavs cannot  unite on the basis of political parties but on the platform of  governments, which should work out the common, basic idea of  such a community. I consider the congress as a mere declaration  of intent, as the first step that should raise this issue and  give it a topical dimension. [passage omitted]    [Zelenayova] Could you tell us what you learned from your  talks with LDPR representatives?    [Molnar] We wanted to find out what their ideas are, because  their electoral victory is a realistic prospect. I also  inquired how far the empire under discussion would stretch in  the west, for example. Would it swallow Slovakia? Mr.  Zhirinovskiy clearly said that Slovakia is, and will remain, an  independent state. This was also confirmed by the LDPR deputy  chairman, and was also published in the press.    [Zelenayova] Did you speak with Zhirinovskiy personally?    [Molnar] Yes, I had a personal conversation with him.    [Zelenayova] What impression did he make on you?    [Molnar] It is difficult to form an impression in 10 or 15  minutes. He definitely does not come across as a radical,  although one has to admit that he has an emotional mode of  expression. I consider this a form of the struggle for power.  Apparently, he does not have access to the media and,  therefore, opts for this method. Western politicians also used  to talk about driving the communists beyond the Urals and so on,  before coming to power. Their vocabulary changed when they came  to power. But I would not like to evaluate the LDPR; I do not  know whether its strength will make a positive or negative  impact. We have only established contacts, because it  represents a real political force. [passage omitted]</p>

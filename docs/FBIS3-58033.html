"She's the boss," he said. The judgement on the headstrong  Mrs Ciller rings increasingly true, even if the Turkish state  that she rules seems to be growing ever weaker, undermined by  political gridlock, stark economic contradictions and a Kurdish  rebel war that on many days kills as many people as die in  former Yugoslavia.    A rare interview with European newspapers shows that  Turkey's  leader has come a long way since her election last June to lead  the conservative True Path Party, the senior partner in the  coalition government. It is already hard to remember early days  when she was so unaccustomed to official life that while  disembarking from official flights she could sometimes be found  squeezed unceremoniously among a common crush of junior aides.    Bureaucrats, advisers and even ministers have been changed  with bewildering speed to the point where everyone is beholden  to her. A note of firmness has asserted itself in a voice that  can wrap up a meeting in a few seconds. Traces creep into her  speeches of her occasional role model, Baroness Thatcher, as she  implies a policy is right because she believes it to be right.    Unlike Lady Thatcher, however, her only ideology seems to be  reform. Like her country, she is always in a hurry and often  late. But like her other role model, the late Turkish President  Turgut Ozal, she bravely covers up the most gauche of statements  ("We have come a long way, baby, in democracy since the 1940's")  with her greatest asset -- a brilliant smile in a face that  seems a decade younger than her declared age of 47.    She is no longer a novice in juggling with Turkey's complex  tangle of priorities, and brushed aside flustered aides as she  trod on sensitive ground such as Turkey's worries about the  enlargement of NATO and President Bill Clinton's compromise  proposals for a Partnership for Peace to be put to next week's  NATO summit in Brussels.    "I feel it's a realistic kind of attitude. I feel that we  should be looking not for the separation of Europe, but for the  unification of Europe. The Partnership for Peace proposal is  even too gradual as far as we are concerned, maybe we should  move a little faster," she said.    Mrs Ciller warned that the West should take seriously a  potential Russian threat to newly-independent states in the  Muslim southern belt of the former Soviet Union, whose  population has ethnic links to Turkey. "Despite what President  Yeltsin may have in mind, a theme has come to the surface now,  not exactly going back to the old borders (but) definitely a  nationalistic attitude. The will is there...to make Russia the  sole protector of that region," she said.    But she stressed that Turkey -- which once kept watch on a  third of NATO's front with the Warsaw Pact -- wanted to  co-operate with its northern neighbour and had no ambitions of  territorial expansion. But she refused to rule out completely  military intervention to stop Armenia's victories against  Turkey's ethnic cousins in Azerbaijan.    "We always are watching closely...considering and  reconsidering. As far as Turkey is concerned, we all feel that  Armenia should withdraw," she said.    When the British Prime Minister, John Major, Mr Clinton and  other NATO leaders gather at the Brussels summit they will meet  a woman not afraid to make demands, particularly over clamping  down on the activities in Europe of sympathisers with the  Marxist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkish officials say  reports of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's death in Syria are  untrue and hope for Western pressure on Damascus to curb his  activities, particularly after the banning of the PKK in Germany  and France.    "We have to stand together on all these issues. We should  not mix up the issue of the PKK with the Kurds living in Turkey  and elsewhere. About 2,000 people have been killed in Turkey in  the last year. We are trying to protect our citizens," she said.    Mrs Ciller showed no sign of flinching from her backing for  the security forces' nine-year-old attempts to put down the  separatist rebellion by force. Any hint of approaching moderate  Kurds was muted, as was any promise of reforming Turkey's 1982  constitution under which people are still sent to prison merely  for speaking their mind on Kurdish and other issues.    "Democratisation is something we believe in. We are going to  take giant steps in that. Not as a concession to the PKK, not  for that region, but for the whole country," she said. That may  be her wish, but diplomats say any major reform will only be  possible in the unlikely event that Mrs Ciller's party receives  substantial new backing in local elections due in March.    Mrs Ciller may get a more sympathetic hearing on the  question  of Turkey's relations with the European Union [EU]. She said  the takeover of the EU presidency by Greece was only a minor  problem, even though Athens has vetoed any substantial European  aid to Turkey since 1980. She said she was pleased about a  recent British-German initiative to establish a new consultative  mechanism to be set up during a visit to Ankara later this month  by the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and his German  counterpart Klaus Kinkel.    "The major point is that the other European countries see  the  vitality in Turkey. We are moving very fast (towards customs  union with Europe). It's costing us a lot. Despite this we are  committed to doing this step by step. What we are doing must be  recognised by our friends in Europe. There has been no other  country that has done this on her own," she said.    "Turkey is a bridge to peace, a bridge to the independent  countries that have separated from Russia, a bridge for Western  values in the Middle East as well," she added. "When you give  up Turkey you may end up with a border that has Muslim  fundamentalism. We need to look not for a separation of  cultures, but an intermingling."</p>

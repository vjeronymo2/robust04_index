He told INTERFAX that "from the very beginning both sides  had  succeeded in overcoming the cooling of relations, caused by the  recent spy scandal, and that the Americans had agreed that the  new Russia could not be responsible for everything that had  taken place in the past."    To quote Rybkin, the leaders of the State Duma committees  for  international affairs, defense, budget and economic policies had  established good contacts with colleagues in the U.S. Congress.    He also announced that at the end of March or at the  beginning of April Democratic and Republican leaders in the  Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, would arrive in Moscow  on the State Duma's invitation. At the end of the current year  or at the beginning of 1995 Speaker of the U.S. Congress's House  of Representatives Thomas Foley is likely to visit Moscow, he  said.    Rybkin stated that cooperation with the U.S. was Russia's  absolute priority, because the two countries cannot live without  one another in the present-day world. "We also assured our  American colleagues that we would promote the reforms which are  absolutely irreversible," he said    On Wednesday afternoon, the Russian deputies are to meet  with  President Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore, after  which the State Duma delegation will leave for Moscow.</p>

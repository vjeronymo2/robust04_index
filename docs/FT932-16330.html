The rise to DM3.1bn (Dollars 1.86bn) represents a slowing from the 22 per cent sales gain to DM2.5bn reported for the first five months of this fiscal year. Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, said order inflows in the fiscal first half were DM5bn, 55 per cent higher than those of a year before. Last month, the company had reported a 47 per cent increase in five-month orders to DM3.8bn. Adjusted to exclude newly-acquired units, he said orders rose 32 per cent. Order backlogs at March 31 were DM9.4bn, 29 per cent higher than a year before. Adjusted to exclude acquisitions, the gain in order backlogs was 5 per cent.</p>

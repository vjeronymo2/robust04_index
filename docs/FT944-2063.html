			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Something to go with the kangaroo fillet? - Jancis Robinson begins a two-part look at Australian wines Just back from 10 days in Australia and what sticks in my mind? The juiciest, fruitiest little oysters I have ever had in my life, from the west coast of South Australia and now feared as commercial rivals to the Sydney rock versions; a boned, spiced quail sitting on a couscous salad with fresh date chutney; meltingly tender kangaroo fillet in chilli and black bean sauce . . . Oh, and I believe I washed down Australia's dynamic new cuisine with the odd glass of wine - some of it just as exciting and mould-breaking. Come to think of it, I do not think I drank a single overtly oaky Chardonnay - the wine style with which the Australians wooed the now-infatuated British - the whole time I was there. Australia continues to refine its wine styles. Over-oaked, heavy wines are becoming a thing of the past - in fact, within Australia, oak is now seen as an enemy to be tamed. Many wines are sold with the word 'unoaked' on the label, typically carrying a price premium above basic Chardonnay. The cheaper product's fruit is often given 'oak flavour' by oak chips rather than by maturation in barrels, which can cost as much as ADollars 1,000 (Pounds 450) apiece once they have been shipped from France, although the Australian wine industry is one of the better customers of the American oak barrel business. Australia's new pride in its widely planted Shiraz (the Rhone's noble Syrah) has been a delight to behold - and I even got the faint impression that Cabernet Sauvignon was out of favour, although admittedly I spent most of my time in the Barossa Valley, Australia's Shirazshire. Another noticeable trend is that Australia, like California, is developing its own band of Rhone Rangers, producers cherishing other vine varieties commonly - if in some cases erroneously - associated with France's Rhone Valley. As in California, Grenache and Mataro (aka Mourvedre) were scorned as cheap workhorse varieties for years, until their respective direct links with Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Bandol were recognised. Today dry-farmed (non-irrigated) Grenache from the likes of Rockford and Turkey Flat (grape-grower Peter Schulz's fruit made at Rockford) is offered with pride in the smarter restaurants of Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. Another cult wine is RBJ Theologicum, a gamey blend of Grenache and Mourvedre from the Barossa (the 1993 is Pounds 7.49 from the Australian Wine Centre). And was it my hopeful imagination or was Riesling actually making a comeback as opposed to being about to? These racy, dry wines make a great alternative aperitif to champagne. Certainly Australia is now a seriously useful source of well-made sweet wines, typically about Pounds 7 a half bottle, that can, often should, be drunk young. They are not desperately popular in Australia itself and so it is up to us to encourage their producers to continue with this painstaking sideline. In Britain there are still scores of beautifully made wines to be found in the price bracket Australia continues to do best, Pounds 5-Pounds 10ish a bottle, and a high proportion of them are sold by the Australian Wine Centre (AWC). Tel: 0800-716893 until December 22 at 50 Strand, London WC2 and afterwards by mail order only. WHITES: Primo Estate Colombard 1994, Pounds 5.99, Australian Wine Centre (AWC). Charmingly idiosyncratic wine made from a grape variety that is usually dull as ditchwater, but in the hands of Joe Grilli (the 'Joseph' of the cult red wine Moda Amarone), these grapes ripened under the merciless sun of the Adelaide Plains become a full-bodied, spicy, fruity, dry white. Stafford Ridge Lenswood Riesling 1991, Pounds 6.75, Adnams of Southwold; Pounds 6.99, AWC. Geoff Weaver releases his Riesling late, and here is the closest the Adelaide Hills get to Alsace. Definitely dry (which not all Australian Rieslings are), long and kernel-scented. Chapel Hill Eden Valley Riesling 1993, Pounds 6.49, AWC and Bottoms Up. Pure, long, intensely aromatic. St Hallett's Chardonnay 1993, Tesco, Thresher etc, Pounds 7.49. Big, broad Barossa-style of Chardonnay but with enough subtlety to convince an extremely experienced Burgundian blind taster that it was made with French and not American oak. Ironstone Semillon Chardonnay, Pounds 5.99, Majestic, Fullers, Cellar 5. Truly interesting South Western Australian that smells of tangy Semillon, but has the weight of carefully grown Chardonnay - a less expensive label from Cape Mentelle. Rothbury Hunter Valley Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 5.99, Oddbins, Davisons and Marco's shops around London. First-class value for medal-winning liquid gold. Buy lots of this vintage; the Hunter is suffering dreadfully from drought. Petaluma Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 9.99, Oddbins. Very good price for this level of sophistication from the cool Adelaide Hills. Great delicacy for the moment, but this one is worth hanging on to until the four to eight-year-old 'drinking window' recommended by its maker Brian Croser. Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 10.99, Winecellars. Textbook early-1990s barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Where will fashion take us from here - back to matchsticks in pineapple juice? Henschke Croft Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 11.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex. Savoury oak, appetising. A third fine Chardonnay from the Adelaide Hills. Primo Estate Botrytis Riesling 1993, Pounds 7.99 a half, AWC and Harvey Nichols, London SW1. Pure but not for purists, as this was made by inducing the botrytis mould at the winery rather than in the vineyard, but for me it is a delightfully racy sweet wine without the clout of a Griffith Semillon. REDS Peter Lehmann Vine Vale Shiraz 1992, Pounds 3.99. OK, so it is less than Pounds 5, but do not complain, just enjoy the oomph. Chateau Reynella Basket Press Cabernet/Merlot and Shiraz 1992, Pounds 6.49 each from Oddbins. Evidence of Australia's new pride in 'old-fashioned' wine technology. Chapel Hill Cabernet Sauvignon, Pounds 7.99 Tesco, Thresher and Pounds 8.99 AWC. The AWC will soon have some of Pam Dunsford's miraculous 1992 vintage, which was voted best of the best at this year's Canberra show. It is deliciously suave and persuasive now but should get even better. The 1991, which Tesco is selling at Pounds 7.99, during December, is also worth taking seriously and it is expected to stock the 1992 next spring. Cape Mentelle Cabernet/Merlot 1992, Pounds 7.49, Majestic. This is the bargain from the Western Australian arm of the company that brought you Cloudy Bay, although alcohol freaks should be thrilled by the zany Zinfandel 1991 stocked by Adnams of Southwold at Pounds 8.95, and bargain hunters may prefer the cheaper Ironstone label. Coldstream Hills Pinot Noir 1993, Pounds 8.49, Oddbins. Lavishly refinanced and on a medal-winning roll, this Victorian winery run by the wine writer James Halliday has Australia's surest touch with the red burgundy grape - although Bannockburn can be damn fine too, as indeed is the Tasmanian Freycinet (join the waiting list on Boxford Wine, 0787-210187). Henschke Abbott's Prayer Merlot/Cabernet 1992, Pounds 12.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler. Very superior stuff, apparently designed to win over those who find most Australian reds just too big. Yeringberg Cabernets 1990, Pounds 13.75, Bibendum of London NW1. Gorgeously fashioned, serious, glossy, fine claret from the Yarra Valley. Yarra Yering Dry Reds, Pounds 16.99, Oddbins. Majestically idiosyncratic, just like its maker, the donnish Victorian Dr Bailey Carrodus. E &amp; E Black Pepper Shiraz 1990/91, Pounds 13.49/Pounds 12.75, Eckington Wines of Sheffield (0246-433213). This is the sort of strapping red Aussies themselves fight over. Next week: why the next two Australian vintages may prove crucial.</p>

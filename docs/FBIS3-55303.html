Concerning the Situation in the Agrarian Sector"]    [Text] Agriculture had a difficult time last year. The  problems began in the spring, but the farmers still managed to  carry out the sowing at the optimum times. We were expecting a  good crop, and these expectations were bolstered by actual  results at the start of the harvest. But the farmers were  unable to buy combines, spare parts, and fuel in good time  because economic arrangements had not been settled between the  producers and the purchasers of our products (the rural  commodity producers did not have their own resources, and credit  was exhausted). Then there were the adverse weather conditions  in a number of grain regions. All this delayed the harvest work.  More than three million hectares were not cleared. The gross  grain harvest was 100 million tonnes. That is less than  expected.    There were problems with other agricultural crops as well.  The sugar beet yield was on a par with past years. The gross  harvest was more than 25 million tonnes. But this time the  sugar content was somewhat higher. The harvest of oil-seed  crops was approximately on a par with 1992. As for fruit and  vegetables and potatoes, the situation is as follows: A large  part of the harvest (36 million tonnes were harvested) has not  been taken up. Those who are supposed to store potatoes have  not been taking them.    I believe there are two reasons for this. The first is the  lack of circulating capital. (Consumers did not receive  sufficient credit resources either). On the other hand, the  wholesale depots were privatized during that period and these  depots found that they could operate more profitably with  commodities other than perishable products. In short, the  process was administratively unmanageable, while market  relations had not yet taken shape. Unfortunately we did not  succeed in privatizing the entire rural infrastructure, as we at  the Agriculture Ministry were intending. As a result, no matter  what production chain you take, it turns out that none of the  rural workers' partners is making a loss. Processing, even with  reduced processing volumes, is operating profitably by raising  the prices of products. The only loser is the rural commodity  producer.    Even the alcohol industry is not taking potatoes any more,  since it is more profitable to produce alcohol from grain. As a  result many farms have had to store potatoes themselves, often  in unsuitable storage facilities. This means that there will be  major wastage. Moreover, owing to the lack of demand, some of  the potatoes were not harvested at all, primarily in the  European part of the country.    Livestock numbers continued to decline. This was due not  only to prices, which are dictated by the processing industry.  The main problem is that effective consumer demand is low.  Some of the products are not being taken up. Even in Moscow  Oblast, where milk yields are at their lowest in winter, a great  deal of milk stays on the farms. All this is causing rural  commodity producers to further reduce livestock numbers. There  has been a marked reduction in per capita consumption of dairy  and meat products in the current year.    Despite the rather good harvest, many agricultural  enterprises are now almost bankrupt. The state, in the shape of  "Roskhleboprodukt," which concluded contracts for the purchase  of grain, owes more than 700 billion rubles [R] for products  that have already been received. Purchases of oil-seed crops  have been held up for that reason. Sugar beet has been  purchased from the countryside, but the payment was in sugar,  not money.    Moreover the state has not paid peasants for meat and dairy  products that were supplied for processing and to the trade  network. In view of this, we believe that the total debt to the  countryside currently stands at more than R2 trillion.    This means that farms are unable to make normal preparations  for next year. For example, we were unable to buy mineral  fertilizers, seed, and fuel for fall cultivation or storage.    Credit policy has been tightened as well. What they are  saying to us today is: Have the money, but at the bank rate,  which is more than 200 percent. This means that the prices of  our products, which are still not being sold in their entirety,  are rising sharply. For these reasons we left around four  million hectares of winter crop land unsown. This means that  next year's harvest is in jeopardy. We left five million  hectares unplowed in the fall -- which increases the spring  workload by nine million hectares. Even fewer mineral  fertilizers were applied than in the previous year. Stocks are  not being accumulated.    It is still not clear what kind of arrangement the state  will  have with commodity producers -- whether it will form state food  stocks or people in the countryside will be left to face the  vagaries of the market alone. Will the state subsidize  livestock products or not? All these questions remain  unanswered.    Worst of all is that fact that the major livestock-raising  complexes and poultry farms, once the most efficient, are now in  a most difficult situation. They used to buy in feed, which  became expensive, so production became inefficient. Unless the  question of mixed feed compensation (at least 50 percent) is  resolved, they are going to have to start slaughtering poultry,  but even that would take at least three-four months, and perhaps  as many as six. And the remaining birds have to be fed with  something over that six-month period.    Even in countries where agriculture is seen as being highly  industrialized it is still supported by the state in various  ways. Either by direct subsidies or by price regulation. There  are countries where the state meets up to 60-70 percent of the  cost of agricultural production. It is perfectly clear to us in  the agrarian sphere that Russian agriculture will not survive  without state support. We appreciate that when the budget is  bursting at the seams it is very difficult to contemplate such  things. But a way must be sought. Because if the countryside  is alive and well, the country and the entire economy will be  alive and well.

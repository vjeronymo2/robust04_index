			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> HALSTON;  </P> <P> MADE-TO-ORDER COLLECTION REFLECTS SPIRIT OF THE FAMILIAR NAME  </P> <P> The glass-and-mirror showroom with views of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the  Empire State Building looks much the same. So do the oxblood carpets and  modular furniture. And the bouquets are as large and extravagant as always.  </P> <P> But Halston doesn't live here anymore. Or more precisely, work here, even  though a collection of custom-made clothes with his name on the label was  recently presented in the showroom.  </P> <P> The designer vacated the place some five years ago while in the midst of  complicated legal negotiations about the Halston moniker.  </P> <P> Recently, Revlon Inc. purchased the Halston name and now, in an attempt to  revive interest in the label for possible new licensing ventures, Revlon is  presenting a 70-piece Halston made-to-order collection, still without Halston's  involvement. Rumors are that the designer is in ill health.  </P> <P> The clothes are the work of a team including John David Ridge, the company's  vice president of design services; Bert Keeter (he worked for Holly Harp as a  designer in 1979 and also had his own label in Los Angeles for a time); Chris  Royer, creative marketing director and director of accessories (and a former  Halstonette, the nickname given to the models who did Halston's shows and  personified his look in the '70s), and Salvatore Marano, who was the head  tailor in Halston's workroom for years.  </P> <P> It's not surprising that such a team has come up with a collection that  reflects the spirit of Halston's classic, spare and elegant designs -- the  bias-cut day and evening dresses, supple cashmeres, double-faced coats devoid  of extraneous details and cowl-necked pajama ensembles that Halston's loyal,  legendary client, the late Babe Paley, used to wear.  </P> <P> There is also lots of signature Halston red in the collection (he once posed  for a People magazine cover with acolytes Liza Minnelli and Elizabeth Taylor  both wearing red ensembles). And there is an Oriental simplicity to many  designs accented with obi-like wrapped waists.  </P> <P> "We basically wanted to emphasize what Halston was about -- his theories of  exquisite fabrics and simple but also complicated cuts," Keeter says. "It's a  very, very pared-down look with very subdued details and in the Halston classic  colors, true colors like deep purple, fuchsia and fire-engine red."  </P> <P> Asked if any of Halston's old patterns were brought out of mothballs, Keeter  says it wasn't necessary. "We have a pretty good idea of the look, and we  wanted the collection to be younger and to go one step further."  </P> <P> Standout looks in the line, which sells for $1,500 to $20,000: the red silk and  Angora dress draped across the bodice and with matching stole; the taupe  cashmere day suit with long-point collar; the dazzling red-and-black  hand-painted georgette dress with sequin embroidery, and for glamour girls, the  black silk-satin coat lined in pink satin and edged in black fox over a  bias-cut gown.  </P> <P> Halston once said: "What makes a designer famous is that his clothes are  recognizable. They don't look like someone else's. That's what makes you famous  -- your signature."  </P> <P> The question now: Does the signature work when it's in someone else's  handwriting?  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Effects of base rate change on savings Savers may have to wait some time before they find out the effect of the base rate change on the returns they receive from their deposits. The normal pattern is for building societies to announce cuts in savings rates some weeks after they reveal planned reductions in mortgage rates. Savings rates cuts tend to be implemented immediately, however, while mortgage reductions are usually delayed. When rates do change it is unlikely that savers will suffer the full effect of the 0.5 percentage point cut. Abbey National, which expects to make an announcement after the Budget, said that given the low level of savings rates it did not expect to cut rates for savers by the full half point reduction. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said he expected savings rates to fall by 0.2 to 0.3 of a percentage point. Many building societies' instant access savings accounts pay about 4.5 per cent to 4.6 per cent gross on deposits of Pounds 5,000, equating to a net income of 3.4 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer. Competitive pressures may restrict the societies' freedom of action, Mr Wriglesworth added.</p>

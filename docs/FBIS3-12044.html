Those were  the words of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro when he said that  in no other country of the world has such a situation been  discussed publicly. He said this process is unprecedented in the  political history of the world. Castro added: We are the only  brave ones who dare to do this and to [words indistinct] and  discuss it in a way that could not be more open. That is the  reason we must analyze these things before applying any measure;  the situation is very complex, complicated even for specialists.  Fidel went on to say: What would our position be if we had all  the gas or coal we wanted? This is what forces us to seek other  feasible means.    In evaluating the discussions of the work centers, Fidel  said: The works in these parliaments suggested many wise and  intelligent ideas. These meetings that were held for the very  first time.    In his report to the national plenum of the CTC summing up  the process of the parliaments in the work centers, Pedro Ross,  secretary general of the CTC, pointed out that we have just  begun and summarized the principal results of the assemblies.

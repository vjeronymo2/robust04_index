			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> ARTFUL APPAREL;  </P> <P> DO CLOTHING AND JEWELRY TAKE ON A DIFFERENT MEANING WHEN THEY'RE ONE-OF-A-KIND  CREATIONS?  </P> <P> Idon't know about you, but whenever I hear the word art, I think of paintings,  sculptures, music or dance. I don't think about jewelry, and I certainly don't  think about clothes.  </P> <P> Perhaps my fashion horizons need expanding. Then again, maybe I actually slept  through something important in my college "Introduction to Art" class. What  other explanations could there be for all the Ventura County stores now  claiming to sell "art to wear?"  </P> <P> "Of course clothes can be art," Helga Cordes, co-owner of Helga and Hellmut  Wearable Artin Ojai, said as she pointed to the hand-painted silk ensembles on  a rack behind her. "These are all one-of-a-kind pieces that were made by a  local artist. Each one is like wearing a canvas with unique coloring."  </P> <P> Cordes, whose local artist-designer also happens to be her husband, isn't the  only one who says that clothing and jewelry can be art.  </P> <P> Anne Knight, originally from England and now living in Malibu, held up an  ornate, brass patina belt in Cordes' store. "This is hand-sculpted and just  look at the colors," she said. "This is art to me. I mean, have you ever seen  anything like this?"  </P> <P> In all honesty, it looked like a belt to me. A very nice belt but still not  something I could see hanging in a gallery. But this view, I'll admit, might  show a lack of visual sophistication on my part: I still think Andy Warhol's  acclaimed box of Brillo pads belongs under a kitchen sink.  </P> <P> Anne Gottweld, visiting from Germany, wasn't convinced of the wearable art  concept, either. "It's nonsense," she said. "In Germany, you would never call  this art. It may be beautiful, but clothing has nothing to do with art."  </P> <P> Still not satisfied, I walked a few doors down to Ojai's Primavera Gallery.  Gallery owner Khaled Al-Awar moved past the paintings and sculptures on display  to show me some one-of-a-kind pieces of jewelry. One was a "treasure necklace"  that combined small artifacts, including African trade beads, Peruvian coral  carvings, Chinese coins and Indian ivory walruses.  </P> <P> What, I asked him, was the difference between ordinary jewelry and art? If  there was no other piece like it, did that automatically make it art?  </P> <P> "Just like music, the colors have a certain harmony," Al-Awar said, holding up  the treasure necklace. "Real artists create that harmony in their work. And a  part of us longs for that."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, with a price tag of $1,350, I had to take my longing elsewhere.  So I headed over to the Bluestone Gallery in Ventura, where owner Karen Stone  had promised a two-day-only exhibit of jewelry by the famed French artist Erte.  </P> <P> Erte, you may recall, is recognizable for his art deco drawings and sculptures.  He joined such contemporaries as Picasso, Mondrian, Klee and Dali when he  branched out into jewelry design. In fact, Erte actually trademarked the term  "Art to Wear."  </P> <P> The gallery, as it turns out, had only a handful of Erte pieces, which were  displayed next to a glass case full of watches with the faces of the Mona Lisa  and other well-known paintings. The Erte art deco cameos, in which gold and  gems were used like colors of the artist's palette, made me reevaluate the  whole idea of wearable art.  </P> <P> One last stop at the Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks and then perhaps I would  understand the whole concept. A small kiosk displayed "Wearable Art by Masti  Ozlati." There were jean jackets with a rhinestone rendition of the city of Los  Angeles, T-shirts with hand-painted fish, furry sweaters with rhinestone  flowers and even a long-line bra studded with, you guessed it, rhinestones.  </P> <P> Suddenly, I understood. Wearable art, like any other medium, is art if the  artist says it is.  </P> <P> I got into my car and drove home with a fresh, new perspective. This, I  thought, must have been what my housekeeper was trying to achieve when she put  my favorite cashmere sweater in the washing machine with my son's baseball  jersey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PREMISE  </P> <P> Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There  are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style -- personal and  off-the-rack -- and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a  month, we'll be taking a look at fashion in Ventura County -- trends, styles  and ideas -- and asking you what you think. If you have a fashion problem,  sighting or suggestion, if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, let  us know. We want to hear from you.  </P></p>

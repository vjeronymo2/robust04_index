			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl played a decisive  role in helping Sweden to reach an agreement with the European  Union [EU] yesterday, and Prime Minister Carl Bildt thanked Kohl  for his contributions in a telephone conversation today.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] The German contribution was very  important in the final stages of these negotiations, and we have  also had reason to thank other people: The Belgian foreign  minister made important contributions, and we had the  opportunity to be in contact with the British foreign secretary  at a decisive stage; so these complement the contributions that  were naturally made by the Greek chairmanship. I think the  German political will was of decisive importance.    [Unidentified reporter] So without that contribution there  might not have been any agreement?    [Bildt] We cannot know that, but I think that it played a  decisive role, in that the negotiations were able to continue at  a critical stage and lead to a conclusion, and it is also  playing a big role in that negotiations are now continuing with  Norway and will, I believe, lead to a result.

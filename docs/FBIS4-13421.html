			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by news research and commentaries group] </F>   [Text] While global insistence on military intervention to  prevent the aggressive Serbs' shocking crimes in Gorazde is  increasing, the United Nations and world powers have refused to  adopt a serious approach on this problem, which has greatly  jeopardized world security, and have even abandoned their former  threats.    With the increasing human tragedy of the military fall of  Gorazde and increased world demands for military intervention  against the Serbs, new overtures are being made by foreign  countries involved in the Bosnian crisis to give the Serbs a  free hand to intensify their aggression.    The United Nations has withdrawn its limited forces from the  oppressed city of Gorazde on various pretexts. There was never  more than 15 UN soldiers protecting this city, which was  declared a so-called safe haven by the United Nations, and its  70,000 inhabitants from the Serbs' immense military power. But  even these 15 UN soldiers were withdrawn from Gorazde at a time  of danger, which is exactly the time when they should have  carried out their duties.    The United Nations is now pursuing a policy that the  presence  or absence of forces is ineffective, therefore it is better to  leave Bosnia. Thus, the Serbs have received the initial green  light from the United Nations for their future crimes.    Following this step by the United Nations, which definitely  stems from the decision by the Western countries and others  involved in the Bosnian problem, Russia has also stated that it  will soon end its mediatory role with the Serbs. This stance by  Russia has of course been adopted within the framework of  condemning the Serbs. However, when Russia ends its mediatory  role it will be shunning responsibility for the Serbs' actions  and will be giving them a free hand to commit other crimes. In  addition, in closing this channel of contact the possibility of  inflicting pressure on the Serbs will decrease.    Russia is continuing its indirect support for the Serbs and  has stated that it opposes any type of blind bombing of Serb  positions. This is at a time when the blind bombing and the  unrestrained massacre of the Muslims in Gorazde have--according  to various news agencies--filled the streets of the city with  the corpses of Bosnian martyrs and wounded.    In parallel with the new policy of the United Nations and  Russia, NATO has also stated that it will not take any military  step without the approval of NATO members. Thus, the main  foreign powers involved in the Bosnian crisis have washed their  hands of world demands for serious action against the Serbs.  This clearly means that the Serbs have been given a free hand  and the green light for their crimes.    Something that further clarifies the new program of the  United Nations and the will of the world powers is the brief but  horrific news about returning the Serbian heavy artillery  centers around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo to the Serbs.  Thus, the United Nations should expect a heavier tragedy than  that of Gorazde.    This also clarifies the fate of the world of Islam, too. If  the world of Islam does not adopt a serious approach on the  Gorazde tragedy, the Western countries, the United Nations, and  the Serbs are ready to create new tragedies. In the midst of  all these bitter and soul-rending incidents, the Muslims should  once again realize the fact that in this era of force their only  alternative to continue to live is to become more powerful.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Panos Loukakos: "Greek Blue-Helmets Too"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Balkans entered an era of radical change  that will perhaps soon lead to new arrangements. U.S. President  Bill Clinton's letters to Athens and Ankara make it clear that  pressure will increase for an overall solution to the  uncertainties in the area, according to the interests of  Washington. Corresponding pressure is also unfolding from large  European countries that are strongly interested in developments  in the Balkans.    In this climate, Turkey returns to the Balkans with its  military as a regulating factor, 80 years after the Balkan wars  of 1912-13, which resulted in Turkey's expulsion from European  territory. Within the above climate, Athens appears to insist  against Greek military intervention in the crisis of the former  Yugoslavia.    That decision was correct when it was first made by the  entire political leadership, because it declared that all Balkan  countries should stay away from a military engagement. As a  result, that decision limited the Balkan countries to diplomatic  efforts, in which Athens maintains a significant advantage over  Turkey and the other neighboring countries. However, there is  already a huge change in the facts: Ankara secured the dispatch  of Turkish peacekeepers to the crisis point. Therefore, Turkey  has reinforced its greater political role in the region.    The change of developments since the initial decision  against  Greece's engagement in the crisis should lead to the  reexamination of the whole problem. That is because Turkey is  now present in the crisis. Following this, do we still believe  that Greece should be absent? [passage omitted]    These facts lead to the conclusion that, despite the  popularity of the decision for no military engagement and  despite the unpopularity of a decision to send Greek  peacekeepers, the whole problem should be reexamined from the  beginning in light of new developments. [passage omitted]    That is because things have now reached a critical point:  The role that Greece will play in the greater area in the  coming years is now at stake. What is at stake is the position  Greece will take as new arrangements in the Balkans are decided  and imposed. What is at stake is the special weight that Greece  will have in the area in relation to Turkey and also in relation  to the other countries of the region.    From an initial examination, for Greece to stay in the  proceedings and not on the sidelines, it should not be absent  from the peacekeeping force at a time when Turkey will be  present. Because if Greece does not participate with its  military now, who will take Athens' view into account later at  the diplomatic front? And how will Greece avoid decisions for  arrangements without its presence and against its interests?</p>

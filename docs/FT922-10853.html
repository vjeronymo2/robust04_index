			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Folkes shows sharp fall to Pounds 2.5m FOLKES GROUP, the West Midlands-based property, engineering and building products concern, suffered a 38 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 2.5m. Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman and chief executive, said that the company had yet to see signs of recovery. With uncertainty and a lack of confidence in industry, it was difficult to predict the outcome for the current year. Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.07m) and there was a turnround from interest received of Pounds 919,000 to payments of Pounds 60,000. Mr Folkes said that the property division performed well, helped by develop- ment projects coming on stream and enhanced rent revisions. The engineering side was satisfactory but fortunes of the building products businesses were dominated by the progress of the housing market. Group turnover was Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 47.7m) and earnings per share came out at 4.93p (7.49p). An increased final dividend of 1.8p is proposed for a total of 2.375p (2.3p).</p>

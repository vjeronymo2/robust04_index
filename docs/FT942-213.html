			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Holland struggle past Morocco to win Group F Dennis Bergkamp made sure the struggling Dutch squeezed into the second round as Group F winners with a 2-1 win over Morocco in Orlando yesterday. The Dutch avoided traveling by winning the group and next face Ireland in the Citrus Bowl on Monday. Morocco, who lost all three of their group games, were eliminated. Playing slowly and with little cohesion against a makeshift Moroccan team, the Dutch suffered badly in the heat, which peaked at 48`C (118`F). Bergkamp scored the first goal in the 43rd minute and provided the vital pass for fellow striker Bryan Roy to score the decider twelve minutes from time. Earlier, the Dutch defence had been caught napping to allow Hassan Nader to score early in the second half.</p>

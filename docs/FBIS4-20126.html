			<p>BFN     [Text] A Soviet-built plane will be spying over British  military installations this week -- with the blessing of NATO.    Described as part of the Ukrainian Air Force, the Antonov 30  will exercise its rights under the open skies treaty by carrying  out surveillance sorties.    The treaty provides for various nations to fly over each  others territory to gather intelligence using aerial  photography, radar and video cameras.    It will be the first time an Antonov 30 from Ukraine is seen  here as it flies over Lincolnshire to RAF Scampton on Thursday.    The Ukrainians will be hosted by a team from the Joint Arms  Control Implementation Group, which is based at Scampton and has  reciprocal arrangements for carrying out similar spying missions  over former Iron Curtain countries.</p>

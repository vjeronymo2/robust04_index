			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ismet G. Imset; punctuation as published] </F>   [Text] Turkey last week found itself once again in the  midst of a debate with regard to taboos over the country's Armed  Forces and whether anyone had the right to call for the lifting  of such taboos without ending up being branded as a traitor.  Strongly-worded statements made by Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan  Gures were undoubtedly the highlights of the debate, in the form  of a top level warning to all who dared to table and discuss  such issues.    On the one hand, there were reports of increased draft  evasion spreading throughout the country. On the other, Gures'  own son Serdar had become a target for criticism, suspected of  using family influence to dodge compulsory military service. As  if this was not enough, two journalists had even dared to put on  a TV program about draft evasion.    Coming one after another, these developments clearly  disturbed Gen. Gures for, during a visit to Bolu, he departed  from his official text and ended up delivering an ultimatum.  According to him, the debate targeted the very command center  of the Turkish Armed Forces and was the work of "dwarfs and  miserable people," individuals and groups with the aim of  inflicting damage on the Turkish military.    It is still not clear which of the developments was the last  straw for Gures but the general suspicion is that his latest  statement, which put to flight many newsmen, was designed to  defend Serdar more than the army itself.    Those journalists who refused to be scared thus ended up  defending their position in commentaries, and underlining that  they had no wish to damage the armed forces but wanted only to  deal with the deficiencies of the whole system.    It quickly became apparent that what was debated was not  military service and/or Serdar's conduct but the fate and  functioning of Turkish democracy as a whole.    What Gen. Gures did last week, in the words of one prominent  columnist, was to slap the press across the face...  <H5>  A Blow to Serdar </H5>   The whole debate actually started months ago with reports  that Serdar Gures was a draft evader. News was that this bright  new name of mischief in Turkish society, an apprentice actor  climbing the ladder of success, was using family influence to  dodge his military service.    Serdar was not a new name for Turks fond of scandal or  society pages. It was claimed that he had once been escorted by  troops in a hotel raid which he organized as part of a personal  vendetta. His name also surfaced in a holiday resort where he  allegedly used a police pistol to bash the head of someone he  had fought with. Then there were numerous reports of his  alleged love affairs. This year, when his dog was said to have  been killed by poisoning, there were even claims that the  outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was warning the father  through the son's pet. Serdar, it appeared, was a focus for  scandal reports and did little to keep out of the media's way.  His name had surfaced as early as last year when a left-wing  weekly magazine noted in its cover story that a majority of  officers' children did not serve in the troubled Southeast  region, where more than 2,000 security personnel have died since  1984 in Ankara's war on separatist terrorism.    It resurfaced sometime last month immediately after Turkey's  Defence Minister announced publicly that the number of draft  dodgers in this country had reached an all-time high of  250,000--about half the current strength of Turkey's army. The  statement led to debate on what could be done to fill this gap,  and there was much speculation that the entire military service  system would be reviewed and that the term of service could be  increased despite Turkey's drive for a more compact and modern  army. In the process, prison terms and fines for draft evaders  were increased.    As for Serdar, he was cited among the 250,000 and there were  claims that he had evaded military service by extending his term  in school. The report, however, was a mere claim until his  teachers at the state conservatory, led by Ahmet Levendoglu,  held a shocking press conference at which they disclosed the  truth.    Serdar, who had been attending the drama department at  Istanbul University's State Conservatory for the last five  years, allegedly was accepted by the school due to pressures  exerted by his family, and although he was not even attending  classes, had managed to graduate to the fourth year. Actor and  director Levendoglu, who previously resigned from the board of  education to protest at Serdar's special treatment, told  journalists that Gen. Gures's son had been accepted into the  school through the influence of then rector Cem'i Demiroglu. He  was reportedly brought to the school by a senior aide of his  father's and there and then became a student.    But he failed classes for two years and did not fulfill his  student requirements. He did not attend rehearsals but despite  all of this, managed to continue his studies for the duration of  five years.  <H5>  The Response </H5>   The irony of the whole issue was that the incident emerged  at  the same time as Ankara's efforts for further recruitment and it  was clear that what Serdar was doing was overshadowing these  efforts.    If--as the son of Chief of Staff--he was indeed evading  military service, then how could the Chief of Staff's office  explain to the rest of the Turkish people why they should go and  fight for their country, and perhaps die in the process, in the  troubled Southeast?    Moreover, reports of Serdar's alleged draft dodging  coincided  with a strongly-worded statement from Chief of Staff spokesman,  Col. Dogu Silahcioglu.    At about the same time that Turkey was debating what Serdar  had done, Silahcioglu made a statement referring to draft  dodgers and said, "The nation will probably never forgive  them...those who should really be sorry for what is happening  are the families of the people who will do anything to avoid  military service and thereby have lost their principal values."  According to him, draft evaders would certainly be punished  "the way they deserve, and will live with this disgrace for the  rest of their lives."  <H5>  Arrested Newsmen </H5>   Just at the moment when Turkey had Dogan and Serdar Gures as  well as the overall draft dodging crisis on the operating table,  the Chief of Staff took one step which further complicated the  debate.    Already, eyes were turned on Dogan Gures due to the  behaviour  of his son, and there were questions on what he was planning to  do about his own family while calling on others to serve their  country. Statements by Silahcioglu and the defense minister had  further escalated the debate and, naturally, all reporters were  interested in covering the issue in one way or the other. Draft  evasion had thus become a highlighted issue on the country's  agenda.    All newspapers and television channels were covering it in  one way or the other and it was getting as much attention as the  PKK.    At this juncture, two television newsmen made a crucial  mistake and literally ended up as scapegoats.    On one hand, the country's military was furious at the draft  dodgers. On the other, they had too many problems to face in  the Southeast where--despite all the rosy statements--there was  no observable improvement. And there were the accusations  against Serdar Gures.    Under these circumstances, Turkey's highest level military  official gave the necessary orders: two newsmen working for the  popular Anten program on the private television channel HBB were  arrested for broadcasting interviews on draft evasion. They  were not only arrested but they were arrested by a military  court. For the first time since the military coup of 1980,  which put thousands of people on trial, civilians once again  faced a military tribunal in Turkey.    According to the prosecutor's indictment, producer Erhan  Akyildiz and reporter Ali Tevfik Berder, had broadcasted  material that encouraged Turks to evade military service. In  their documentary on Turkish draft dodgers and deserters from  the Army, two people interviewed were quoted as saying they were  against compulsory military service and would not service in the  military if given the choice.    Akyildiz (46) and Berber (34) were arrested and hauled into  the Mamak military prison, where once thousands of political  inmates were detained by the military.    Arrest warrants were also issued for the two Turks they had  interviewed.    The case took a turn for the worse when the Naval Forces  Command court turned down an attorney's request for the release  of the two suspects.    Protests in the press started at once and the incident was  highlighted in the newspapers, magazines and on television  channels. There were numerous appeals to the President, Suleyman  Demirel, to intervene on behalf of the newsmen. There was also  widespread criticism of two civilians being tried at military  courts.    But, as Demirel said later on, this was the law and the law  did give permission for "crimes" committed against the military  institution to be judged by military courts--under military laws.    Still, Akyildiz and Berber were released at their first  hearing. The military prosecutor explained that their arrest had  already served its purpose, possibly meaning: a warning. The  chief judge, also a military officer, explained to the  defendants that the prosecutor would not have acted on his own  initiative but would have filed the case under orders from  superiors. It was evident where the order had come from. How  much this ordeal has helped Turkey and encouraged military  service is yet to be seen, though it appears that instead of one  single television news report on draft dodging simply losing its  importance and fading from memory, what happened afterwards has  eroded the military more than anything else.  <H5>  Gures Reacts </H5>   It was inevitable that the debate on how much control the  Turkish military has on the entire political system should  resurface.    And, accordingly, Gen. Gures spoke out. In his first  statement, while inspecting Turkish commando forces in western  Turkey, he reaffirmed that "the armed forces are a guardian of  democracy... Everything will remain within the boundaries of  democracy. No one should have doubts about this. Turkey will,  until eternity, protect its unitarian structure," he said.    His most interesting remark, though, was that the military  was trying to keep out of politics.    He also emphasized Turkey's increasing stature in the region  and the growing importance of the Turkish armed forces. If he  wanted to get support for this statement, he go it from Ciller  whose own statement coincided with that of Gures. They are  working 24 hours a day to protect us, it said.    But what actually appeared to stir matters up, was another  statement Gures made at the end of last week. According to  sources, this was an unrehearsed speech and reflected the  personal views of the Chief of Staff.    Last Friday, while inspecting troops in Bolu, Gures lashed  out strongly at those demanding the lifting of the taboos on the  Turkish Armed Forces, and branded them as dwarfs and miserable  people. Gures warned that in the "critical days" Turkey was  passing through, there would be "accusations and attacks" on  Turkish military commanders.    For him, the Turkish Armed Forces were too powerful to be  "eroded by the vociferous statements of the dwarfs. "These  miserable people are hiding behind democratic remarks like the  Turkish Armed Forces is not taboo and hiding their real  intentions," Gures said.    "We are living through critical days but we will overcome  everything."    Saying that the Turkish nation strongly supported the  struggle of the Turkish military, Gures said, "But from time to  time, and especially during critical periods, people who are  vociferous and organizations that are low in figure and dwarfish  in quantity, can appear and make baseless accusations and  attacks on military commanders. I am saying we are surprised  and sorrowed by this."    Gures warned that such circles may have taken on a mission  specifically against the interests of the country and added,  "Some of those accusing the Turkish Armed Forces want to produce  ideas without knowing what is happening, while some are after  showing off and running after cheap heroism. Another group  which is not aware of the threat is on the same tack."    Gures added, however, that these were not the dangerous ones  and pointed out that "those who are dangerous are people and  organizations who have taken on duties for special purposes.  The danger is the terrorist organization, it collaborators and  its supporters in words and print. Don't worry, the Turkish  nation is after them."  <H5>  Serdar Lashes Out </H5>   Gures's statement was a strong one and met with a strong  reaction in various quarters. Although a majority of Turkey's  columnists held back from replying, it was interesting that a  majority took the threats personally. There was an undeclared  agreement not to turn the issue into a personal vendetta.    Some, however, did push the matter a bit, and there were  appeals from the bolder columnists for Gures to be relieved from  duty. There was criticism of his conduct and demands for the  Turkish democracy to work.    Once again, the prestige of the military was being eroded  from within.    And this was not the end of the story.    Immediately after his father's reference to the traitors, as  if he had been waiting for the chance to get even, Serdar spoke  out as the second-in-line of the Gures family.    In an exclusive interview with the Turkish daily MILLIYET,  conducted in a luxurious 21st floor suite at Istanbul's Harbiye  Officers' Club hostel, Serdar not only voiced anger at recent  press reports directed at him but gave his support to his  father's accusations.    He argued that such reports--that he was at the state  conservatory through his father's influence and was evading  military service--lowered the morale of Turkish soldiers serving  their country in the troubled Southeast.    He said that those who spread such "rumors" were "traitors"  who were actually after his father but could not reach him  directly.    He also warned that the press was placing too much pressure  on him and said, "I could kill a journalist."    Serdar, clearly with the courage he received from his  fathers  statements, spoke not like an ordinary actor or the draft dodger  he was accused of being, but as if he was a field marshal. His  messages were clear:    "Traitors are behind the rumors about me..."    "The rumors are spread by those who cannot reach my  father..." "Claims about me are damaging the morale of the  solders in the east..."    "They are pressing me too much. If they go on like this, I  could shoot a journalist."  <H5>  The Days Ahead </H5>   Today, no one truly knows what is in store for Turkey in the  days ahead, but indications are that the Turkish Armed Forces  will be on the agenda more than ever. Despite threats and  warnings, an issue which was barely heard of now has a place  high on Turkey's list of priorities.    Also, many of the country's intellectuals are worried that  the Turkish democracy, in this era of development, may actually  be developing towards a secret authoritarianism.    The most recent debate has clearly raised questions on the  country's military apparatus, and the amount of authority it  enjoys. And there are bound to be more questions in the future.    What matters most, however, is for Turkey to get through  this  debate without damaging the prestige and morale of its armed  forces, which is a crucial part of the overall system.    Looking at the recent ordeal, it is abundantly clear that  the  military has to take more care over this than the civilians.    Meanwhile, as part of the democratization drive, there is  the  need to lift all taboos on the armed forces even if it requires  major amendments in the laws, in the constitution, and, most  important of all, in the position of the Chief of Staff.  Perhaps, the whole issue is the result of the fact that still,  in the last decade of the 20th century, the Turkish Chief of  Staff is not connected to the Ministry of Defence and is only  "responsible" to the prime minister. What this could mean, we  have seen thrice in our contemporary history. The last thing we  need is another example...</p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Delays in new milk market to be probed The delay in opening up the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to competition will be investigated next week by the Commons agriculture select committee, Deborah Hargreaves writes. The committee said it would hold a special session to examine why market liberalisation had been put back from April to November. Government objections to the Milk Marketing Board's plans to turn itself into a voluntary farmers' co-operative have delayed introduction of competition.</p>

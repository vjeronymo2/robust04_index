			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Institutional investor in challenge to 10 groups ONE OF the most influential institutional investors in the US has thrown down a gauntlet to 10 of the US's largest companies - including American Express, International Business Machines, and Time Warner - and threatened to vote against the re-election of their directors if they do not pay more attention to shareholders' interests. The action represents a significant escalation of a campaign being waged by activist investors in the US for better corporate governance - making companies more responsive to the wishes of the shareholders who own them. The threat comes from the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the leading US public pension fund, which complained that the 10 either paid their top managers too much, had too few outsiders on their boards, or failed to consider shareholders' interests when setting strategy. The result was poor financial performance. Calpers has emerged as the most aggressively activist of the US's large institutional investors and in recent years has put down many reformist resolutions to be voted on at companies' annual meetings, which tend to be held between March and May in what is known as the 'proxy season'. Last autumn, in a change of policy, Calpers said it would try to negotiate behind the scenes with a dozen unnamed companies where it wanted to see change, rather than engage in public confrontation during the proxy season. Now, however, it has shifted its tactics again. It said that two of the 12 companies - Ryder System and ITT Corporation - had made changes along the lines it proposed but the other 10 had yet to do so, while some had even refused to meet it. Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, said that 'if we are unable to reach agreement with the remaining 10 companies we may be forced to vote 'no' at the next election of directors'. Many of the companies replied that Calpers' criticisms were unfounded or being addressed. Calpers' aggression is deeply disliked by corporate America and is controversial among institutional investors.</p>

The 3,000 deputies were urged to work to balance the  national reforms, development, and stability.    Premier Li Peng has warned the United States that China is a  sovereign country and will not negotiate or agree to anything in  detriment to its self-determination. Li Peng said he expected  better results during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher between 11 and 14 March. That trip was  preceded by a broad campaign against alleged Chinese human  rights violations, in which Beijing was threatened with  withdrawal of most favored nation status in bilateral trade.</p>

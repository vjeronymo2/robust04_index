			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, June 6 (SNARK)--The relative peace in  Karabakh, lasting for three weeks already, was violated last  night by shellings of the positions of Karabakh Defence Army  forces at the south-east (Martuninskiy) sector of the front.  The Azerbaijani side used grenade launchers and various types  of automatic weapons. As SNARK was informed in the Karabakh  State Department of Information and Press, there had been no  retaliate fire from the Karabakh side. No reports on the  consequences.    Despite such actions, the observers tend to think that the  truce is kept, on the whole.</p>

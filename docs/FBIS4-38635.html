			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is ready to hand over the nuclear test range  near Kurchatov to Kazakhstan as of 1 June. The Kurchatov test  range was used for nuclear tests from 1949 until 1991, when the  moratorium on nuclear arms tests was introduced.    Kazakhstan proposes to turn Kurchatov into an international  center for radiological, engineering, and medical research.</p>

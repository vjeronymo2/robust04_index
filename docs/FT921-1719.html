			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letter From Tokyo: The golden age of Japanese youth March, the season of plum-blossom in Tokyo, is also graduation time for thousands of young Japanese and their parents. The academic year ends with a flourish of ceremonies marking the five great divides of Japanese education - from kindergarten to junior school, from junior school to middle school, from middle school to high school, from high school to university and finally from university to adult life. Each is endowed with a symbolic importance matched in Britain only by the cloak and mortar-board ritual of the university. My six-year-old daughter, Sabina's, graduation from our neighbourhood kindergarten was no exception. My wife and I knew this would be no ordinary day. Weeks in advance she was told the other mothers would all wear formal clothes but that 'since you're a foreigner, please wear something bright and cheerful'. A few days later she was told: 'Tell your husband to wear a suit and tie. And we've chosen him to make a speech.' The great day came last Friday. We dressed in accordance with instructions and made sure we were on time. Almost all the other parents wore shades of navy blue and grey, with pearls and video-recorders very much in evidence. The kindergarten has an unusual history. It was established earlier this century by a philosophy teacher who read the Bible and other western works and selected the passages he thought most appropriate for Japan. Applying the same utilitarian eclecticism with which other Japanese scoured scientific manuals and patent records, the founder created his own church. The church and the kindergarten almost fell victim to the Japanese land boom of the 1980s. Their landlord wanted to reclaim the site in the middle of Tokyo, which the congregation has occupied for decades, and started legal proceedings. With Solomon-like logic, the lawyers decided the landlord could have the use of only half the land. Moreover, the landlord was instructed to pay a substantial sum to the tenants in return for their giving up rights to the other half of the plot. With the proceeds, the congregation built a new kindergarten and a chapel. The graduation took place in the chapel. Despite being bent double by her advanced age, the headmistress presided over the ceremony with great spirit. Almost as soon as she began speaking of the trials and tribulations the six-year-olds would face in life, mothers started sobbing. They were quickly joined by the teachers. Contrary to western opinion, Japanese are very emotional. They are simply brought up to avoid being emotional in the wrong places - such as the office or factory floor. The headmistress believes the problems of modern Japan, especially political corruption, are all to do with people not being properly educated as children. 'All these politicians trying to escape blame for their own wrong-doings. They have no sense of personal responsibility,' she says. Her pet hate is the Japanese bow. Bowing breaks eye-contact between people. It is also a symbol of inequality, since inferiors are required to bow lower than their social superiors. The headmistress prefers the western-style handshake: every morning she insists the children look her in the eye and shake her hand. However, she regards the graduation ceremony as so important that she makes an exception. When the children received their certificates from her, they were told to bow low out of respect to the kindergarten. After several speeches, the event ended with a tear-jerker of a song called 'Thank you, sayonara,' followed by photographs and a huge party. I wondered why so much energy is lavished on a ceremony for such young children, especially as it is repeated at the ages of 13, 16, 18 and 22. Partly, it seems to reflect the respect given to teachers in Japan. In traditional Japanese custom, a debt to a teacher is one which can never be repaid. Also, these ceremonies are a measure of the significance of the peer-group. In adult life, people tend to be promoted by age. They regard peers as equals and look up to elders. When asked their age, children will frequently reply by giving their school-year. Executives often describe their seniority by reference to when they entered the company. While such principles might seem overly conservative to westerners, many Japanese believe they contribute greatly to social order. Watching my daughter leave the kindergarten for the last time, I considered how different the experience had been from the stereotype of Japanese education. A common western view is that Japanese schooling is an examination hell in which children are forced to rote-learn and spend their evenings at cram school. They achieve high grades in international comparative tests, but at the price of their childhoods. There is truth in this view - but it applies mostly to teenagers. Japanese kindergarten is a golden age in which children receive no formal instruction in Japanese language or arithmetic and are encouraged to play and run about. Japanese parents mostly like it that way, aware of the pressures which lie only just beyond the kindergarten gates. Little wonder they cry on graduation day.</p>

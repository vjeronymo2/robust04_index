			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Private companies 'optimistic' THE RECESSION has bruised but not defeated private companies, according to a survey of 1,000 owner-managers, published today by Pannell Kerr Forster, the chartered accountants. While 65 per cent claimed to work more than 50 hours a week and 44 per cent described bank managers as having been 'distinctly unhelpful' in the previous year, 64 per cent looked to improved performance for their companies over the next. Job satisfaction was also relatively high: 57 per cent said it had been 'fairly or highly satisfying' to run their businesses in the past year.</p>

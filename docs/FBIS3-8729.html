			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Slobodan Rackovic: "All of Sandzak Stands </F> Accused"]    [Text] The prisons in Sandzak could get overcrowded, for  the Montenegrin-Serb police are very eager to arrest all  "suspicious Muslims," regardless of which party they belong to,  although, at the very beginning, the action to "preserve the  territorial integrity of the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia]" was directed exclusively at the SDA [Party of  Democratic Action] or, to be more precise, toward its  leadership. (The Montenegrin MUP [Ministry of Interior]  reported several days ago that they had arrested the 13th  "Muslim extremist" -- another four are still at large -- but did  not say which party he belongs to.) Practically every Muslim is  a suspect here in Sandzak and some municipal assemblies, such as  that of Bijelo Polje and Berani, publicly gave the police "the  green light" to continue hunting them down. It is no longer a  secret that they are after all the Muslims, who have suddenly  also lost the right to their nationality (in their reports, the  MUP of Montenegro refers to them as people "of Muslim religion,"  ignoring their nationality!), for they allegedly did not  disassociate themselves from "those who want to break up  Yugoslavia." Radonja Zekovic, the famous Serbian chauvinist and  member of the militant National Party, uttered the following  threat to all Muslims at the session of the Bijelo Polje  Municipal Assembly: "The only thing you do is to demand rights  and you do not fulfill your obligations to your native country,  with which there is no bargaining." His words met with wide  approval of committee members of the ruling DPS [Democratic  Party of Socialists], who say they are a civic party.  Naturally, in that tub-thumping atmosphere, which has nothing  to do with parliamentarianism, the proposal to ban the SDA, as  well as the Liberal Union and the Social Democratic Party, was  accepted with loud cheers. The same scenario was realized even  more easily in Berani, which was a well-known Greater-Serbian  chetnik stronghold during World War II.    The Muslims will, therefore, continue to be persecuted  wherever they are and it would not be surprising if "honest  Muslims," who (out of fear or naivete) are now hiding in the  ruling DPS, will be treated in the same way. If it is any  consolation to them, it will not be much easier for those who  associate with them either, whether in parties or privately,  those who are, as a rule, authentic Montenegrins who do not  admit to be "of Serbian origin" at all and advocate an  independent state for Montenegro. It is precisely those people  and professionals like Vladan Djuranovic, Ranko Vukotic, Vesna  Rajcevic, and Velibor Markovic, as well as Velija Muric and Agil  Nasufovic, who have engaged in futile efforts to represent the  13 arrested Muslims from Pljevlje, Bijelo Polje, Rozaj, Berani,  and Petnjica, who are now in prison (almost all of them since 26  January this year) and the four others who are on the run, all  accused of "breaking up Yugoslavia." However, they are almost  helpless and, in a month of pretrial detention, which has now  been illegally extended, they saw their clients once for half an  hour while the latter did not manage to see their families at  all.    Defense attorney Ranko Vukotic said the following: "This is  an unprecedented violation of all the defense rights in the  legal system since the time of Cominform. The television  spectacle in which the suspects presented hidden weapons was  arranged specially for that occasion, and was carefully aimed at  preparing the public. Every voice that demands that the  Constitution be respected, is, regarding this case, treated as  belonging to traitors or to the enemy." His colleague Velija  Muric claims that human rights were not denied in this way even  to the most notorious war criminals. Both attorneys point out  that it is now most important to end this unconstitutional  investigation that which denies the accused's rights to have  defense attorneys and that defendants should be given a public  trial.    The situation is the same in Novi Pazar, where a trial of  25 Muslims, most of them SDA activists, is under way; they are  accused of the same "crime" -- "having weapons and breaking up  Yugoslavia." Those people, most of them from Novi Pazar, have  already endured the worst -- beating and police pressure in  pretrial detention. Owing to the lack of evidence, the trial,  which has unprecedented security measures, is very sloppy: It  is often interrupted, and the accused deny everything that they  admitted during the pretrial investigation, claiming that they  did so under duress.    "The investigation was a scandal and a travesty of justice  as  it was arranged to make the our defendants look guilty. This is  a purely political process," says a well-known Belgrade  attorney, Rajko Danilovic, and attorney Azem Vllasi agrees with  him and is optimistic about the outcome of the trial.    "It is good that the trial was open to the public, so the  domestic and international public will be able to find out what  this is all about. People who sympathize with the accused know  the truth, but the authorities, which want this trial, are  creating more tension and distrust, although that is another  unpleasant factor for them," says Vllasi.    However, with regard to the domestic public, it seems that  Mr. Vllasi has no good reason for his optimism. Admission to  the court house in Novi Pazar (and it will be like this in  Bijelo Polje too) can only be gained by regime journalists of  Podgorica and Belgrade's state media, who have already passed  judgment on the accused. We know how the international public  will, on the other hand, find out something more about the  motives and goals of those trials through its journalists, who  are hard to find indeed, and through diplomats in Belgrade who  are following the trial in Novi Pazar and will certainly be  following the one in Bijelo Polje as well, which is bound to  have higher ratings because of the higher "ranks" of the  arrested SDA leaders.    The Yugoslav authorities will, no doubt, realize their goal  -- they will definitely destroy the SDA in Sandzak as they have  all the state instruments necessary to do so. It will be the  first time since 1946 that a legitimate and legally registered  party is banned in Yugoslavia, this time significantly broken  up, which shows that there is actually a quasi-pluralism in the  deeds of the Montenegrin-Serbian federation, just as there was  right after World War II.</p>

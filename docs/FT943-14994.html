			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obvious advantages to a Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester flotation Sir, Debate of the issues raised by the Lloyds Bank bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has focused on the problems of structuring a bid within the Building Societies Act. Too little attention has been paid to the transaction itself. Although C&amp;G has restricted information to members, it is apparent from the wider briefings given to analysts and the press that there is at least one immediate and viable alternative to the Lloyds bid. The current position appears to be: 1. C&amp;G could convert to a public company and obtain a Stock Exchange listing within the existing legislation (as did Abbey National). 2. The Stock Exchange value of C&amp;G would be about Pounds 1.8bn according to most analysts of the banking sector - ie about the same as the Lloyds bid. 3. In a flotation there would be no restriction on distributing shares to members of less than two years standing. Consequently the board could allocate shares on the basis originally proposed. 4. The listing could be underwritten so that members could choose to receive value in cash or shares. On an underwriting price of Pounds 1.8bn, the amount payable to members would be the same as the Lloyds offer, ie Pounds 500 and 10 per cent of deposits up to Pounds 100,000. There are three obvious advantages to a flotation. First, C&amp;G members should be able to receive the money or shares within six months as compared with the Lloyds bid timetable of mid-1995. Second, if Lloyds wishes to acquire C&amp;G, it will have to pay the proper bid premium for control. Third, members receiving shares should be able to defer any capital gains tax liability to suit their circumstances. There may be some losers from the proposal, including Lloyds Bank shareholders, who benefited from a 10 per cent increase in share value on the announcement, and any others with arrangements dependent on the success of the bid. It is unlikely, however, that ordinary C&amp;G investors or borrowers would be any worse off. It follows from this analysis that the merits of the bid should be subjected to far greater scrutiny. What are the real advantages of the Lloyds bid over a flotation? Is Lloyds paying the right price ? Are there other purchasers prepared to pay more? Are there other options? How will the board ensure that members have a real choice? Analysts have spent some time and effort informing Lloyds Bank shareholders of the advantages of the bid. Who will perform a similar independent review for C&amp;G members? There is no obvious body to provide investor protection for the interests of members in these circumstances, but the press can help by asking why the C&amp;G board seems committed to a proposal with obvious flaws when there may be better alternatives.

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nokia halves annual deficit to FM158m NOKIA, Finland's leading electronics and communications group, cut pre-tax losses to FM158m (Dollars 26.53m) last year from FM324m in 1991, as sales rose 18 per cent to FM18.2bn from FM15.5bn. The group would have made a profit but for the performance of its consumer electronics division, where operating losses deepened sharply to FM783m because of worse-than-anticipated conditions in the European market. However, profits rose substantially within telecommunications and mobile phones, and the group is confident of further progress this year. Nokia was heartened by the trend in its performance in the final four months, when operating profits amounted to FM440m compared with a FM71m loss in the same 1991 period. This enabled the group to record an operating profit of FM288m for the whole year after 1991's FM96m loss. A further increase in operating profit is predicted for 1993, although the group is wary about forecasting an overall return to the black given continuing currency turbulence. Nokia is planning additional rationalisation within consumer electronics this year to cut costs by at least a further FM200m. It is also looking to form alliances with other groups within the tubes and home electronics sectors. 'The difficult situation in the market place means internal measures alone are not enough,' said Mr Jorma Ollila, president and chief executive. Sales at Nokia Telecommunications rose 73 per cent to FM3.21bn last year and operating profit amounted to FM427m. Mobile phones recorded a FM437m operating profit on a 45 per cent increase in sales to FM3.64bn. Consumer electronics saw a 9 per cent rise in sales to FM5.76bn. This is the first time the group has specified operating profit for each of its individual divisions. The group said sales of mobile phones doubled, helping it to consolidate its position as Europe's leading mobile phone manufacturer. The group loss after extraordinary items rose to FM723m from FM211m. The group made a FM332m profit on the sale of its shareholdings in the European soft tissue maker Jamont and a Finnish power company. But it is taking a FM342m provision to cover the costs of further rationalisation within consumer electronics this year. The FM2.00 per share dividend is maintained.</p>

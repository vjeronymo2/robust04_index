			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News in Brief: Getz Bros acquires Agroker Getz Bros, the international distributor and marketer indirectly owned by the Pritzker family of the US, yesterday acquired Agroker, a leading Hungarian wholesaler of agricultural machinery and chemicals, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Getz, a subsidiary of the Pritzkers' diversified Marmon Group, took an 82.9 per cent stake in Agroker for an undisclosed sum. Getz, whose activity has centred on east Asia, said it planned to expand into both eastern and western Europe from a base in Hungary. Yesterday's acquisition complements Getz's earlier purchase of Intercooperation, a Hungarian trading company. That transaction, made in 1989, is believed to have been the first outright western acquisition of an eastern European state company.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Sharp fall in Russian output Russian industrial output in May was 29 per cent below the level of a year ago, according to figures from the state statistics committee. January-May output was 25.9 per cent below the same period last year. The statistics committee said one quarter of small and medium-sized enterprises had closed at least one production line or stopped one shift in May because there was no demand for their products. Production of some goods, including some drilling machines, some computers and some types of road building equipment, had been stopped completely in the first five months. The statistics office said the fall was sharpest in the machine building sector where January-May output was 45 per cent below levels a year ago. Light industry output was down 35 per cent. However, some officials say Russian statistics are unreliable. The statistics committee only appointed people to monitor the emerging private sector late last year and official data takes little account of the activities of private companies. Reuter, Moscow.

Industrial output grew 10.6 per cent in the year to the end of April, mainly thanks to sharp export growth, the central statistics bureau said. Finland's gross domestic product rose 1.6 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter compared with a 4 per cent fall in the first quarter of 1993, Statistics Finland said yesterday. Finnish industrial production volume rose 9.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 1994 compared with a 2.0 per cent year-on-year rise in January-March last year.

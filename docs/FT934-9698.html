			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (4): Don't pay what they charge - Michael Skapinker offers advice on choosing a hotel Approaching a hotel a year or two back, a business traveller would look from the outside at how many room lights were on and then how busy the lobby was. If the hotel appeared to be having a difficult time, as so many were then, the business traveller would demand a room at a ludicrously cheap price - and get it. Things have changed slightly since then. In some cities, such as London, occupancies have crept up and hoteliers are less inclined to give their rooms away for next to nothing. But despite the improvement in some hoteliers' business, published or 'rack' rates are largely fictional. Few travellers pay them. Mr Juergen Bartels, chief executive of Carlson Hospitality, which owns the Radisson hotel chain, says that in the US, only 20 per cent of guests pay the full rate. One of London's most distinguished hotels admits that only 10 per cent of its guests pay the rack rate. A survey published earlier this year by Pannell Kerr Forster, a leisure consultancy, found that guests in Edinburgh hotels were receiving average discounts of 44.8 per cent off the official rate. In Oslo, discounts of 44.7 per cent were available. Business travellers could get 42.8 per cent off their bills in Manchester and 40.1 per cent in Athens. Even the European cities with the firmest room rates were found to be offering substantial reductions: 12.5 per cent in Zurich, 14.5 per cent in Prague and 15.5 per cent in Berlin. Business travellers are in a stronger position to negotiate than five years ago because there are fewer of them as a proportion of all hotel guests. Mr Geoff Parkinson, a director of the Horwath hotel and leisure consultancy, says the worldwide proportion of hotel guests who are business travellers, conference delegates and government officials has fallen from 56 per cent in 1988 to 49 per cent in 1992. The remaining guests are tourists - who spend less. Mr Parkinson says: 'Although tourists are clearly welcome, the tourist market is very competitive and many hotels will not be able to return to full profitability without an increase in business traffic.' But while the business traveller remains the guest of choice for hoteliers, his or her money has been difficult to come by since the Gulf War. Mr Michael Ball, marketing director of Utell International, which handles sales and reservations for hotels around the world, sees signs everywhere that companies and business travellers are economising on their hotel expenditure. Although occupancies have started to rise in a few European cities, bookings are still being made far later than they were three years ago. The length of time that business travellers stay in hotels is shorter than it was a few years ago. Mr Ball says cross-border hotel reservations are now for an average stay of 2.5 nights, compared with 2.7 nights before the Gulf War. Companies are still looking for reduced rates or instructing their staff to stay in cheaper hotels, Mr Ball says. The difference compared with a year ago, he says, is that it is corporate buyers who are now obtaining the discounts; individual travellers attempting to negotiate a cheaper rate might find it more difficult. He says: 'The individual traveller can no longer make the guaranteed assumption that rates are going to be reduced. There will still be hotels where, if you arrive late, you will be able to negotiate the rate down. But the fire sales which we saw in some markets have pretty much come to an end.' However, Mr Michael Stajdel, Inter-Continental Hotels' head of marketing in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says that companies have become far shrewder in negotiating hotel rates for their travelling employees. Mr Stajdel says: 'In years past, travellers had almost a completely discretionary choice as to where they would stay and what airline they would fly. At the time of the Gulf War, companies began to scrutinise their travel and entertainment budgets and they realised that there were opportunities to make savings. 'Companies began to analyse what they were worth to travel suppliers such as hotels and to use that to negotiate more effectively. They've begun to limit the number of hotels they use. This increases the volume of travellers they send to any given hotel and they can use that to get a better price.' Some companies have begun to instruct their employees to use certain hotels rather than others. In one US financial institution, a regular travel report throws up the name of any employee using a hotel which is not recommended by the company. The employee is asked why the hotel was chosen and warned that staying in unauthorised accommodation could result in travel expenditure not being reimbursed. These rigorous procedures are not yet in force everywhere, however. Many employees still have more choice over hotels than they have over airlines or car hire firms. Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director at Thomas Cook Travel Management, said research carried out for his company in the UK by the University of Surrey, found that 27 per cent of companies had strict policies on which airlines staff could use. Nearly one third placed strict limits on the choice of car hire firm. However, only 18 per cent of companies told staff which hotels to use. This means hotels can still try to find ways of attracting individual business travellers. Apart from keeping their rates down, hotels are looking at how to make business travellers' stays more comfortable. Free gifts, free breakfast and reduced telephone and facsimile charges are some of the devices being used to attract business travellers to hotels. Ms Vanessa Leak, Thomas Cook Travel Management's head of marketing, says: 'Hotels are starting to see the benefits that loyalty programmes have provided to airlines. Frequent guest programmes differ from airline programmes in that they usually give a benefit that is immediately redeemable, like a room upgrade or fast check-out.'</p>

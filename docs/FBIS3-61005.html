Babich under the rubric "Combat Training: Experience,  Problems, Opinions": "Artificial Intelligence at the Service of  the Pilot"; conclusion--for previous parts see Nos. 10--12, 1992  and No. 1, 1993]    [Text]  <H6>  4. The Chief Expert--The Commander </H6>   Analysis of the combat losses of aviation by opposing sides  in armed conflicts that differ in scale makes it possible, in my  opinion, to uncover more fully the nature and determine the  priority ranking of errors that are made by pilots in the air  when performing missions. If we trace how fighter aviation was  used in World War II, we can reveal the following causes of such  errors: insufficient circumspection in battle, numerical  supremacy of the enemy, disruption of the interaction between  crews in a group, the use of ineffective maneuvers in a dogfight  and the lack of suitable command and control of the battle...    We will consider the last cause in more detail.    The foundation of the command and control of subordinates in  the course of combat operations, as is well known, is the plan  of the air commander, which he makes on the basis of a  clarification of the combat mission, conclusions from an  evaluation of the situation and calculations performed. We would  note that all of this takes place on the ground. But what about  in the air, with an unexpected change in the situation, when the  commander has turned over virtually all of the functions of  getting information about the enemy to the hardware entrusted to  him, and most often receiving just meager information from it?  Only a wealth of combat experience, to all appearances, could  help him to grasp the developing situation and predict its  continuation. But unfortunately far from all have enough  experience, and the training process will moreover not be able  to make up for these gaps in training.    So then who today receives the right to make the decision to  enter into battle?    If we are talking about a rank-and-file pilot, then he  rarely  enjoys that right, as before--only in the course of an intercept  of a solitary airborne target. It is appropriate here to recall  the experience of the recent war in the Persian Gulf, where solo  sorties were not recorded at all, even though the aviation was  operating primarily at night. The flight (four aircraft in  tactical aviation and three in strategic) was the tactical  entity entrusted with the fulfillment of independent missions.  Group battles and strikes constituted the foundation for the  employment of aviation, while organizing the interaction among  crews remained the primary concern of the flight commander.    Specialists have noted that even the crews of the AWACS and  EW aircraft coordinated operations not only among themselves,  but also with a detail for their direct coverage--a pair or a  flight of fighters. A Hawkeye airborne command post, an EC-130  EW aircraft and four F-15C aircraft as an aggregate, for  example, represented a dynamic system with controlling and  controlled objects and uniform channels for communications and  information exchange among them, with an informative nature  "upward" and a command nature "downward." The effectiveness of  the functioning of the system with feedback was evaluated  depending on the duration of the command-and-control cycle.    Foreign specialists also include the flight of fighters,  "encircled by an external environment with various threats,"  among similar dynamic systems, based on the experience of local  wars. The crews experienced particular stress in combat  operations when protecting the aircraft of strike groups, and  concretely in those situations where the enemy, making use of  camouflage and military cunning, selected the most favorable  moment for attack.    The proposal to utilize the variation of first takeoff, and  then the posing of the concrete task, was adopted as the  standard one, taking this circumstance into account. The  commander was forced to perform such labor-intensive processes  as evaluating the situation, analyzing the possible options for  action and planning the battle right in the course of the  flight, simultaneously devoting the lion's share of his  attention to piloting the aircraft.    The scarcity of time for the mental work of the pilot, as  has  already been emphasized, brought about the necessity of creating  on-board expert systems. It was, however, not difficult to  assume that the "electronic assistant" should function in  different ways in those cases where a dialogue is conducted with  it by, for example, a rank-and-file pilot or the leader of a  flight: the former, after all, is controlling just an aircraft  and its weapons, while the latter, aside from that, is also  controlling subordinate crews. The latter is moreover also  obliged--and this is one of his chief tasks--to turn the four  fighters into a powerful combat entity able to win a victory in  group battle. Specialists have determined that the commander, in  order to achieve that aim, should make a so-called  organizational decision, after assessing the situation, based on  the competent disposition of forces before battle and the  efficient distribution of functions among the crews.    What do those functions consist of apropos of the actual  conditions of the group combat flight?    The aircraft flight formation, to the extent of the  development of aircraft technology and armaments along with the  growth in the combat potential of fighters, was opened up to  such intervals and distances that at first provided for the  preservation of visual contact among the crews, and then became  commensurate with the distance for launching air-to-air guided  missiles with semi-active radar homing heads. Visual contact  among pilots was broken off as a result.    The command and control of subordinates that you cannot see  is a difficulty that was experienced to the full by the pilots  who took part in the armed conflicts in the Near East at the end  of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s. The enemy, along with  everything else, was constantly jamming the sole channel for  information exchange among the crews--radio communications.  Under such a variation, at the threshold of the development of  fighter aviation called "go out separately, but fight together,"  the functioning of a dynamic system with a large number of  objects under command and control became simply ineffective. One  aircraft was then dropped from the flight of four fighters. The  three-element structure proved to be more suited to waging  all-aspect battle, the "crux" of which was considered to be a  missile attack on straight-on headings.    This step led to an appreciable change in the redistribution  of functions among the crews in the course of aerial battle. The  departure from the principle of "shield and sword" (one covers  and the other attacks) entailed the rejection of mutual coverage  of fighters. Completely new tasks--decoy operations, the  performance of break-off, back-up or free maneuvers  (augmentation of efforts)--were designated at the same time. It  was only necessary to distribute them correctly among the  controlling and controlled objects (the function of "sword"--the  "strike aircraft"--was preserved).    The commander of the threesome automatically became the  "strike" aircraft while supervising the two subordinate crews,  which were delegated other functions than his. When a flight  used to go up in full complement (four) in a single tactical  entity with its own definite mission, a pair of aircraft was  formed. The crews, having received a specific combat assignment,  operated not spontaneously but rather in accordance with a plan  developed earlier. A strike against the enemy, which was then  augmented, was made according to the rules that were discussed  earlier (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, 1993, No. 1) after the decoy  operations. The "free-maneuver" group (or aircraft) operated at  that moment "according to the situation," ready at any moment to  assist a crew that got into a difficult situation.    Some fighter pilots have in recent years unfortunately begun  to forget such a crucial stage of the preparation for flight as  the development of a plan for the impending battle. The reason  for this is the widespread opinion that only improvisation is  characteristic of the true master. The experience of both the  recent and the now-distant past forces us to approach an  evaluation of the professionalism of the pilot today, and  especially the leader of a group, with different standards.  Today he should be not only an excellent pilot and shooter able  to lead a four-aircraft element, but also be recognized as a  leader able to evaluate and predict a complex situation, plan  group battle, organize interaction in the air and independently  make comprehensively well-founded decisions on the application  of the forces subordinate to him.    It would not be superfluous in this regard to refer to the  Manual of Combat Operations of U.S. Tactical Aviation, which  says that "Leadership in battle is a talent that should be  recognized at all levels. Individuals able to lead subordinates  in the air must be noticed in timely fashion and promoted. The  talent of the commander is usually manifested in the course of  warfare, but the ability to think and reason intelligently is  acquired beforehand."    The crisis in the sphere of the mental activity of the pilot  has forced the aviation command in the United States to take the  path of training pilots in the skills of "intelligent reasoning"  in duels with an active "enemy." Each tactical-aviation  squadron, as is well known, takes part every year and a half in  the Red Flag exercises at the Nellis test range, specially  equipped for the purpose. More than a hundred simulated PVO  [air-defense] assets and an "aggressor" squadron operate in  complete accordance with the tactics of a likely adversary, not  "playing along" with the trainees. The pilots can receive a  "homework assignment"--refine poorly mastered elements of  weapons delivery--after the completion of the exercises and  analysis of the results (chiefly the "losses").    The white heat of training of the mind weakens appreciably  at  "home," however, since the principal impetus to pose tactical  riddles to the pilot--the "enemy"--is lacking. The  standard-issue simulator equipment available at each air base is  little help in the development of tactical thinking among the  pilots, since it by and large facilitates only their acquisition  of motor skills in operations in a concrete situation.    American specialists feel that it is essential, first and  foremost, to fill in the vacuum between the expense and  complexity of the training process, on the one hand, and its  simplicity, on the other, in order to achieve even an  inconsiderable rise in the intellectual level of the pilot. They  feel it mandatory in this regard to put the trainee into an  operating mock-up of the cockpit of a combat aircraft--it would  suffice to put the moving situation being evaluated by the pilot  onto a special desktop screen that is analogous to the display  inside the cockpit.    Several "desks" with such screens have been installed in an  already operating system for training flight personnel in the  evaluation of a situation and making tactical decisions. The  aerial situation is simulated on the screen in the form of  aircraft blips ("own" and "enemy") by the supervisor of the  classes, who can where necessary break off a flight and even  "take a step backward" for the extemporaneous investigation of  erroneous decisions.    The important conclusion was drawn, according to the results  of the first simulations, that they were none other than a  continuation of the training process of the likely adversary and  the concluding stage of the mathematical modeling in the course  of which the logical framework of the battle is formulated. The  exercise using full-scale modeling is in turn defined in the  course of the flight experiment, and only after its completion  are recommendations issued for the practical assimilation of  tactical innovations by flight personnel.    A study of the experience of fighter operations in real  battles and semi-full and full-scale modeling has made it  possible for me to develop a very simple algorithm of the  resolution of a task according to an analysis of the situation  by a flight commander (see diagram). This process, in my  opinion, should begin from the moment when the group target has  been detected, and its azimuth, range, speed, altitude and  direction of flight, as well as the numerical composition,  determined.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-001C-08A>           Algorithm of Situation Assessment </FIG>          Block one--"correlation." It is felt that the  flight should enter battle with forces equal to the enemy. A  numerical inequality of forces could be established after  identification of the specific situation, however. Then the  model of battle "in the majority" or "in the minority" takes  effect.    Block two--"weaponry." The fighters could prove to  be in a situation where they have a "surplus" or "shortfall" of  firepower; that is, there are greater or lesser areas of  effective engagement for the on-board weaponry than the enemy.  An advantage in firepower makes it possible to compensate for  shortfalls in "quantity."    Block three--"points." The point of engagement at  which the fighters should arrive strictly on time is designated  when performing the task of covering strike groups. This cannot  always be accomplished, however, under the rapidly changing  conditions of contemporary battle. Any skirting maneuvers, most  naturally, are ruled out in the event of lateness, for instance,  and there remains just one chance for victory--a frontal strike  (head-on battle). The "weaponry" moves to the forefront in such  a situation--greater permitted launch ranges of missiles should  compensate in full for lateness and have an effect on the  configuration of the disposition of forces before the start of  an attack. The precise or early arrival at an assigned point  brings about the necessity of employing some tactical maneuvers  ("claw" or "dragon").    Block four--"position." After reaching the point  of engagement, the flight could prove to be at too small or too  large a heading angle in relation to the enemy for a reliable  attack, and higher or lower than the target. The flight  commander, proceeding from tactical considerations and with a  regard for the maneuverability of the aircraft as well as the  destructive capabilities of his weaponry, should determine the  most advantageous position for the performance of a standard  method of attack by the flight. It should be emphasized that  "one's own" methods and combat formations correspond to each  position.    It is not difficult to note that the proposed algorithm is  nothing more than the simplest model for the resolution of a  tactical task. It could be made more detailed and supplemented  with blocks at that or a lower level. It is proposed that  readers, and especially flight commanders, do so.

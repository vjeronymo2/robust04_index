			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DECADE-LATE SEABROOK NUCLEAR PLANT AT FULL POWER FOR 1ST TIME  </P> <P> The Seabrook nuclear plant, focus of debate over atomic energy, has reached  full power for the first time.  </P> <P> The $6.6-billion reactor -- among the nation's most expensive -- went to full  throttle at 9:52 p.m. Thursday, plant spokesman Ron Sher said today.  </P> <P> The plant generated 1,150 megawatts, electricity for 1 million New England  homes.  </P> <P> It's the most important milestone yet for the decade-late project and another  setback for anti-nuclear activists whose mass civil disobedience demonstrations  had made Seabrook a symbol of their movement.  </P> <P> "Reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so hard to achieve,"  said Edward Brown, president of the plant's operator, New Hampshire Yankee.  </P> <P> For plant opponents, the milestone was the latest in a series of  disappointments since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a  commercial operating license in March.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: The Measures at a glance New lower tax band The chancellor left the 25p basic tax rate unchanged but introduced a lower rate of 20 pence in the pound for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The change, which Mr Lamont said would benefit the low paid, will make most taxpayers about Pounds 2.64 a week better off. The ceiling on mortgage tax relief was left unchanged at Pounds 30,000, but will be applied at 25 per cent throughout despite the new 20p rate. Personal allowances: Income tax and age related allowances will rise in line with inflation. The married couple's allowance will be frozen this year, but husbands and wives will be allowed to transfer this allowance from the husband to the wife or to share it equally from April 1993. The wife will be allowed to claim half the allowance at her own request. Pensions increase Single pensioners on income support will get an extra Pounds 2 per week and married couples an extra Pounds 3 a week from October. Boost for car industry The rate of car tax was halved from 10 per cent to 5 per cent at midnight last night. The capital allowance limit on business cars will be raised from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 so that 80 per cent of business cars will be treated like any other business asset. Taxis, car hire firms and driving schools will be allowed to reclaim VAT when they buy cars. A move to company car tax scales based solely on the price of the car rather than the size of its engine is being considered. The VAT charge levied when firms offer employees a choice between a car or extra salary will be scrapped. Excise duties raised Excise duties on alcohol, diesel and unleaded petrol will rise in line with inflation. The duty on leaded petrol will rise by 7.5 per cent, widening the differential between taxes on leaded and unleaded petrol to 5p per litre. Duty on cigarettes and other tobacco (including the chancellor's own favourite - slim panatellas) will rise by about 10 per cent, raising the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 13p. Pipe tobacco will rise in line with inflation. One concession to smokers: the duty on matches and mechanical lighters will be abolished. Vehicle excise duty on cars will be increased by Pounds 10 to Pounds 110. Betting duty will be cut from 8 per cent to 7 3/4 per cent. Help for companies No change in corporation tax rate or depreciation allowances. No business will face an increase in the uniform business rate (UBR) higher than the rate of inflation. This includes those properties protected by the transitional arrangements set up to ease the switch from rates to the UBR in 1990. Occupiers of new premises, currently not eligible for transitional relief, will inherit the transitional protection of the previous occupier. Most business assets will now be exempt from inheritance tax so that family businesses can be passed on without a tax charge. The business expansion scheme will be scrapped from the end of 1993 but the chancellor announced measures to make it easier to use the BES for mortgage rescue schemes. Small businesses To improve the speed at which bills are paid, bigger companies will have to state in their annual reports how quickly they pay bills. Government contracts will include clauses requiring contractors to make prompt payment to subcontractors. The limit for employers making quarterly rather than monthly PAYE and NIC payments will be increased to Pounds 450. Savings and inheritance The annual limit on Personal Equity plans (Peps) will be raised from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000 for unit and investment trusts. The threshold for inheritance tax will rise by more than inflation to Pounds 150,000. The amount of capital gains exempt from tax will rise in line with inflation from Pounds 5,500 to Pounds 5,800. Value Added Tax Penalties for mistakes on VAT returns will be reduced so that a penalty will no longer be imposed for an error of less than Pounds 2,000. The system under which small businesses with turnover under Pounds 300,000 can defer VAT payments until bills owing to them are paid will be extended to those owing Customs and Excise up to Pounds 5,000. The film industry Tax relief for pre-production costs will be available as it is incurred and production expenditure will be written off at a flat rate of 33 per cent once the film is finished. PSBR doubles in 1992-93 Budget giveaways totalling Pounds 1.49bn were more modest than the City was expecting. But moderate economic growth and depressed tax revenues mean that the government is now forecasting a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28.1bn, higher than expected. Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, total expenditure is expected to rise by Pounds 22bn while total revenue increases by just Pounds 7.7bn. A PSBR of Pounds 28.1bn, up from Pounds 13.8bn in this current fiscal year, is equivalent to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP. Excluding Pounds 8bn of privatisation receipts the figure rises to 5 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. A medium-term fiscal strategy: According to the Red Book, the government's objective is to 'balance the budget over the medium term while permitting the 'automatic stabilisers' to operate . . . The budget will return towards balance as activity recovers.' Fiscal imbalance: General government expenditure is forecast to peak in 1993-94 at 42 1/4 per cent of GDP, up from 40 1/2 per cent in the current fiscal year, before falling again as annual GDP growth rises above 3 per cent. Tax revenues are expected to fall by 1 percentage point to 37 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 and then to rise in subsequent years. But the PSBR is still forecast to remain in deficit at least until 1996-97, by which time it will have fallen back to  3/4 per cent of GDP. 'A Budget for recovery' Economic growth will resume this year, the chancellor said. The recovery will 'start slowly but gather pace' encouraged by falling inflation at home, and by rising confidence and falling interest rates in the US and Europe. The chancellor blamed the 'unexpected weakness' of the US and world economy for undermining the 'clear signs of renewed growth in the late summer and early autumn of last year.' GDP fell by 2 1/2 per cent last year. The defeat of inflation will bring 'enormous benefits to British businesses and families', he said. But unemployment is expected to carry on rising 'for some time', although at a slower rate. He confirmed the government's commitment to membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling will be moved to narrow bands within the ERM at its current central rate of DM2.95 'in due course.' The highlights of the economic forecast are: Growth resumes: GDP grows by 1 per cent this year. This is slightly higher than the consensus of City forecasters, but substantially lower than the 2 1/4 per cent growth the government forecast in its Autumn Statement. The recovery is expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year. GDP grows by 2 per cent higher in the second half of 1992 compared with the same period a year ago, and 3 per cent in the first half of 1993. Inflation falling: Retail price inflation falls to 3 3/4 per cent by the end of 1992, and to 3 1/4 per cent by the middle of next year. Factory gate price inflation falls further to 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of 1993. Sluggish spending: Consumer spending grows by 1 per cent this year, but picks up to 3 per cent in the first half of 1993. Fixed investment spending falls by  1/2 per cent in 1992 but grows by 3 1/2 per cent in the first half of 1993. Trade deficit widens: The current account deficit rises to Pounds 6 1/2 bn this year, and to Pounds 9bn, at an annual rate, in the first half of 1993. Exports grow by 3 1/2 per cent in 1992, lower than the 6 per cent forecast in the Autumn Statement, but imports grow by 4 per cent. By the first half of 1993, exports growth rises to 6 1/2 per cent and import growth to 8 1/4 per cent as the world and UK recoveries gain momentum. World recovery: There is a modest world economic recovery this year. The total output of the seven largest industrialised countries grows by 1 1/2 per cent this year and by 2 3/4 per cent in the first half of 1993. World trade ion manufactures grows by 4 per cent this year, and 6 1/4 per cent in the first half of next year. Spring Budget bites the dust Whoever wins the election, yesterday's budget was one of the last as we know it. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, began his speech with the announcement that from December 1993, tax and expenditure decisions will be brought together and announced in a December budget - an idea already touted by the Labour Party. The new 'crystal clear' budget will show 'where the money is coming from and where it is going to,' said Mr Lamont.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DEEPER INTO DEFICIT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1991-92             1991-92         1992-93                         Last Budget est.

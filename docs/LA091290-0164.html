			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PBA CLEARED IN BOWLING BALL SUIT  </P> <P> A federal court has dismissed a multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit filed by  a bowling ball manufacturer against the Professional Bowlers Assn.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in 1988 by EurekaUrethane Inc. of St. Louis after the PBA  did not clear for use in its tournaments a bowling ball the firm produced that  carried a beer company's product name and logo.  </P> <P> In his ruling last week, Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh said the PBA's actions in  refusing to sanction the ball were "neither unreasonable nor anti-competitive"  and were "a sound exercise of business judgment calculated to preserve their  ability to serve the interests of professional bowlers."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Recruiting families who respond to advertisements placed in various media as part of the proposer's metropolitan areawide affirmative marketing plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) An areawide list of housing opportunities offered by managers of participating multifamily projects subject to AFHM requirements. These housing opportunities may be categorized by jurisdiction within the Chicago metropolitan area, by neighborhood within the City of Chicago, by assisted or insured housing program, and by bedroom size;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The demographics of each development and the neighborhoods in which the assisted and insured housing opportunities are located must be included and updated as turnover occurs. Information on the social services, transportation, schools, churches, employment opportunities and other facets of the community must also be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Carry out a major effort to secure voluntary participation in the clearinghouse by a significant number of housing providers subject to AFHM requirements that do business within the area designated by the applicant. For purposes of this NOFA, housing providers include corporations, individuals, or other entities who own and/or operate apartment complexes of 10 or more units (including the Illinois Housing Development Authority which operates Section 8 Housing projects subject to AFHM requirements), realty companies and home builders who build, rehabilitate or sell 10 or more new single-family homes annually, and financial institutions involved in the making of loans on residential property. This effort shall include outreach and education programs targeted at apartment managers, real estate sales organizations and housing industry professionals, and shall describe the roles of the clearinghouse and the providers in helping individual families take advantage of expanding affordable housing choices throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. These outreach activities should be targeted especially toward those housing professionals that do business outside of racially-impacted, ethnically-impacted and lower-income impacted neighborhoods and are willing to attract applicants to those areas in which their race does not predominate. Such activities should also be targeted to housing professionals who do business in predominantly minority areas and are willing to attempt to attract non-minority applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clearinghouse operator will have to explain the financial benefits and obligations of participating in the clearinghouse, which can include the participants' being relieved of their AFHM and eligibility determination responsibilities. To encourage participation by housing providers, HUD will waive the AFHM requirements and, as necessary to permit participation, other regulatory and contractual requirements pertaining to tenant selection and assignment that are not required by statute throughout the period of the lab. These waivers would affect those who would otherwise be subject to the waived programmatic requirements (i.e., all persons approved for the development or rehabilitation of single-family subdivisions, multifamily projects of 10 or more units, and all other persons subject to AFHM Plan requirements in Departmental programs). This affirmative fair housing marketing lab will not alter in any way the requirement for Public Housing Authorities to develop and submit an Equal Housing Opportunity Plan (EHOP) for Section 8 existing housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Operate a one-stop metropolitan areawide housing center which shall perform the following services:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Processing applications for participating federally-assisted and/or insured privately-owned and operated multifamily housing submitted by families who desire to investigate housing opportunities offered by participating owners, managers and real estate brokers. While making applicants aware of all housing opportunities in the area designated by the applicant, the office shall emphasize housing opportunities within areas in which the applicant is least likely to apply for the housing without special outreach activities, because of where the housing is located, and offer additional fair housing counseling for those persons desiring to relocate within such areas. The clearinghouse shall also encourage the creation of housing opportunities within predominantly minority sections of the lab area, so that applicants regardless of race or ethnicity may take advantage of them. The clearinghouse shall also make available information on transportation, schools, social services, employment opportunities and other facets of living in the area selected by the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

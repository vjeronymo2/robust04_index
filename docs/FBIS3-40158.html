			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report written by Li Kuo-chiang (2621 0948 1730) on 9 </F> November 1993 in Xian, Shaanxi, interview at the State Council  Information Office at the Olympic Games Village in Beijing on 8  November 1993 with State Council Information Office Director  Zeng Jianhui (2582 1696 1798): "Help the World Understand China  -- Interview With PRC State Council Information Office Director  Zeng Jianhui"]    [Text] China has entered an age of rapid growth.    China's every action and movement is increasingly becoming  the focus of worldwide attention.    So to "help China understand the world, and the world to  better comprehend China," a new department emerged in China  three years ago, that is, the State Council Information  Office--an agency to assist all major State Council departments  in speaking for the State Council.  <H5>  Zeng Jianhui: China's External Propaganda Official </H5>   Hong Kong and foreign reporters conducting interviews in  mainland China have to maintain frequent contacts with this  office.    In media fields such as press, publication, film, TV, and  broadcasting, increasing numbers of figures from outside of  China's borders wish to cooperate with the relevant parties in  China. They of course know that the State Council has an  Information Office that is in charge of China's external  propaganda.    The Information Office's director is Zeng Jianhui, who is  also a deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda  Department and director of the Central External Propaganda  Office, so is in charge of China's external propaganda policy.    Early on the morning of 8 November 1993, the city of Beijing  seemed particularly warm and bright. At 0830, I arrived by car  at the State Council Information Office in the Asian Games  Village to interview Director Zeng Jianhui.    The radiant but simply attired Zeng Jianhui was somewhat  alike in features and build to the well-known Hong Kong scholar  and Hong Kong affairs advisor Liu Chao-chia [0491 0340 0163],  with his presentation of views and style of conversation also  similarly well-considered and methodical. He had had very little  previous exposure, and for a figure as important as he, it was  understood that this was also the first time that his life  experiences were being disclosed in such detail to the outside  world.  <H5>  Information Office Is Set Up After the "4 June Disturbance" </H5>   The Information Office was established as the State Council  news department after the 1989 "4 June disturbance."    The State Council Information Office was founded in early  1990, with its first director being Zhu Muzhi [2612 4476 0037],  who retired in March 1993, to be succeeded as Information Office  director by Zeng Jianhui.    China's reform, opening up, and national conditions were in  great need of understanding by the outside world. To speed up  China's development, it was necessary to help "China understand  the world, and the world to better comprehend China." In light  of the comparative backwardness and slowness of China's external  media means, the control by the West of the contemporary world's  crucial mass media, and the experience of the "4 June" incident,  China had become even more aware of the urgency of providing  accurate and rapid news to help the world understand China.  While it had taken certain previous actions in this area, it had  no department in special charge, and no single agency to  coordinate all government departments. So it set up the State  Council Information Office in early 1990 as a comprehensive  administrative body and news department to objectively brief the  outside world on China's key policy decisions.    Zeng Jianhui disclosed that the State Council Information  Office in Beijing had less than 100 employees, for a  well-streamlined staff.    Zeng Jianhui's two assistants, deputy directors Yang  Zhengquan [2799 2973 3123] and Li Yuanchao [2621 3293 3390],  were both very competent and qualified.  <H3>  Information Office Put in Charge of State Council Press  Statements in 1993 </H3>   What key tasks is the Information Office charged with? Zeng  Jianhui said that they are:    1. To coordinate and expedite government-sector briefings of  China's conditions to the public and the world, particularly  China's advances in reform and opening up focused on the  economy. As overseas and foreign figures are coming to China  to gather news in increasing numbers, it is necessary to have an  agency like the Information Office take charge of all aspects of  coordination. All State Council departments have now installed  press spokesmen, who are working in very active coordination to  further overseas understanding of China and pave the media way  for reform and opening up. Zeng Jianhui disclosed that beginning  in 1993, the Information Office has been responsible for State  Council press statements.  <H3>  Information Office Holds Two Press Conferences a Month,  Inviting Departmental Officials To Respond to Reporters'  Questions </H3>   The work of the many State Council departments is varied and  complex, making it hard to fully understand and promptly report  on the conditions of all departments. Zeng Jianhui said that the  State Council Information Office holds two press conferences a  month, inviting one State Council department director each time  to respond to questions of public concern. We have held 17 such  press conferences, which have been attended by figures such as  Li Lanqing (former MOFERT Minister and now State Council Vice  Premier), Peng Peiyun (currently State Councilor and Minister in  Charge of the State Family Planning Commission), Wang Zhongyu  (director of the State Economics and Trade Commission), Tao Siju  (Minister of Public Security), and Xiao Yang (Minister of  Justice), who have responded at these press conferences to  questions put by reporters from various countries. This enables  all departments to serve as their own spokesmen to give all a  deeper understanding of each department.  <H5>  Information Office Sets Up a Journalist Liaison Room </H5>   2. To take questions from reporters, the Information Office  has a Journalist Liaison Room, with Information Office Deputy  Director Zhao Shaohua (f) [6392 1421 5478] in charge, to serve  foreign, Hong Kong Macaoan, and Taiwanese reporters. Reporters  can present any questions to this Liaison Room, which will help  to answer them.    In helping reporters to get interviews, what is the  difference between the Information Office and the All-China  Journalists Association? Zeng Jianhui said that: The All-China  Journalists Association is a mass organization, which can help  reporters by furnishing information and solving certain  practical problems; but for authoritative news within China, it  is necessary to go through the Information Office; for  interviews in other parts of the country, the Information Office  can provide reporters better interview conditions.    In the last few years, under State Council leadership, the  Information Office has published "white papers" on matters such  as human rights, Tibet, and Taiwan to help foreigners understand  the truth. All of these "white papers" have been followed with  interest by all countries.  <H3>  "News Coverage in China Not Increasingly Difficult, But  Rather Ever Easier" </H3>   Since the "Hsi Yang incident" of Hong Kong's MING PAO, it  has  been asked: Will news coverage in China be increasingly  difficult, with ever more blockages? Zeng Jianhui stated clearly  that news coverage in China will be not increasingly difficult,  but rather ever easier. As long as news coverage is normal and  within legal limits, China's enormous changes and all news and  events will be sources that overseas reporters can cover to  their heart's content. The Information Office is going to show  more initiative in providing the outside world with information  on China's crucial matters, by reinforcing contacts with  overseas press circles.    As Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997  nears, exchanges between Hong Kong and the interior should  become closer. Zeng Jianhui said that Hong Kong reporters are  welcome to make more contacts with the Information Office. In  1994, the Information Office is likely to organize a news  coverage of Bohai Wan (bay) and the great northwest, which will  last about one week, and in which Hong Kong reporters are  invited to take part.  <H5>  A Well-Supported News Specialist </H5>   Zeng Jianhui is a well-supported cadre.    A senior correspondent told me: "Zeng Jianhui is a genial  person who does painstaking work. Despite his important  position, he has no air of a high official, both keeping contact  with the public, while having rich practical experience, so that  he is truly a lifelong news specialist."  <H5>  Zeng Jiahui Is Born in Changsha, Hunan in December 1928 </H5>   While Zeng Jianhui was born on 1 December 1928 in Changsha,  Hunan, his ancestral home was in Pingjiang County, Hunan.  Pingjiang is located in eastern Hunan, being a mountainous area  where CPC guerrilla forces were active at the time. Five  months after his birth, on 22 July 1928, it was there that Peng  Dehuai led the famous "Pingjiang uprising," and at the end of  the year led his troops into the Jinggang Mountains.    The War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) broke out on  a full scale in 1937, with the flames of war spreading before  long to the banks of the Xiangjiang River in Hunan. Zeng Jianhui  was studying at the time in Hunan at the Mingde High School,  which was moved in 1944 to Xiaolan'gang in rural Hengshan  County. When the Japanese army invaded and occupied Hengshan  in May 1944, 16-year-old Zeng Jianhui, who had just finished  10th grade, fled to Chenxi County in western Hunan. As Hunan  University's temporary campus was there at the time, Zeng  Jianhui attended there for a year with his older classmates,  studying independently to complete his high school courses.  <H3>  Zeng Jianhui Takes Part in "1 December" Student Movement in  Kunming, Passes Entrance Exam to Qinghua University's Department  of Electrical Engineering </H3>   In July 1945, Zeng Jianhui arrived in Kunming, Yunnan, by  which time the examination period for Southwest Joint University  (formed during the war of Beijing University, Qinghua  University, and Nankai University) was over. After the War of  Resistance Against Japan ended in victory on 15 August 1945,  Zeng Jianhui passed the entrance exam to the last college  preparatory class at Southwest Joint University. After he had  completed this course, Southwest Joint University closed down,  with the 1946 demobilization in Kunming bringing the restoration  of Beijing, Qinghua, and Nankai universities. At that time, Zeng  Jianhui was promoted to the Department of Electrical Engineering  at Qinghua University.    Due to his dissatisfaction with the KMT's corrupt rule and  zeal for civil war, Zeng Jianhui, like many of his classmates of  the time, threw himself into the Kunming student movement,  taking part in the "1 December" student movement that began on 1  December 1945 in Kunming. As he was not yet a member of the CPC  at the age of 17, he threw himself into the student movement  only out of a sense of youthful justice. He opposed the KMT  military and police siege of the campus, and its massacre and  beating of striking anti-civil war professors and students. He  attended with his classmates an anti-civil war public lecture on  the Southwest Joint University campus in the western Kunming  suburbs, where the KMT military police actually fired warning  shots. Who would have guessed that the following day's KMT press  would say that "last night's gunfire came from bandits in the  western suburbs," turning all professors and students into a  gang of bandits. This further aroused the students' righteous  indignation, to the point where they announced a boycott of  classes. When the KMT sent spies to break this student strike,  sending armed police who beat students and actually threw hand  grenades that killed four of them, Southwest Joint University  students took the lead in launching the mammoth and famous "1  December" student movement among all Kunming schools, in which  Zeng Jianhui was an active participant.    When the war ended in victory, Zeng Jianhui moved with the  Kunming demobilization to Qinghua University in Peking, studying  in its Department of Electrical Engineering, where his  classmates included people such as now PRC Minister of Radio,  Cinema, and Television Ai Zhisheng.    The KMT at the time was zealously fighting a civil war,  bringing civilians extreme misery and unspeakable suffering.  Peking students were against starvation and civil war,  staging marches and demonstrations like a raging fire, in each  of which Zeng Jianhui took an active part. This gave him more  opportunities to ponder the status quo of the society, from  which considerations he searched out a new path and took action  in response.    In 1948, Zeng Jianhui finally joined the CPC underground  party, at which time he was the editor of the Peking semimonthly  ZHONGJIAN sponsored by progressive professors at Beijing and  Qinghua universities.  <H3>  Zeng Jianhui Begins General Information Office Work, in  Charge of External Propaganda </H3>   Peking was peacefully liberated at the end of 1948. As  broadcasting personnel were treated very well at the time, and  the newly established New China Broadcast Station (the  predecessor of the Central People's Broadcast Station) needed  someone who knew English, it chose Zeng Jianhui, who was fluent  in English, as an assistant editor of its English broadcast  section, which responsible department was also the predecessor  of the New China News Agency's Foreign Affairs Department. In  the more than four decades since, Zeng Jianhui has always been  in charge of external propaganda, taking part in foreign affairs  work.    After the founding of the PRC in October 1949, PRC officials  paid great attention to press work, setting up the General  Information Office. The General Information Office was under the  charge of Hu Qiaomu [5170 0829 2606], under which was the  International Press Bureau, whose director was Qiao Guanhua  [0829 0385 5478], with the New China Broadcast Station's English  broadcast department being subordinate to this bureau, to become  the International Press Bureau's news agency, which was  specially charged with the New China News Agency's external news  releases. Zeng Jianhui was an assistant editor at the news  agency of the General Information Office's International Press  bureau.    In 1951, the General Information Office was dismantled, with  Zeng Jianhui being reassigned to the New China News Agency's  Foreign Affairs Department, starting as a secretary and moving  up to editor and correspondent, with his work being to write the  English texts of external broadcasts.    In 1952, during the Korean War ceasefire negotiations, Zeng  Jianhui was ordered to lead a group of correspondents to North  Korea to report on prisoner repatriation, where he wrote his  famous news dispatch entitled "POWs Did Not die on the March."    From the mid-1950s to the 1966 Cultural Revolution, he was  one of the few New China News Agency's political foreign affairs  correspondents allowed to cover the news within Zhongnanhai. He  was already very well known in press circles, having been  promoted to director of the New China News Agency's Foreign  Affairs Correspondents Group.    During the Cultural Revolution, he was put out of the way  for  a time, allowed to do only in-office translation work, while  also spending a few months at a cadre school in Fangshan County.  As English writing and news coverage talent was needed at the  time, and he had outstanding competence in this field, he was  reassigned during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution to  the New China News Agency's General Editorial Room as an  assistant editor-in-chief, taking part many times in covering  the news of meetings by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with foreign  heads of state and important guests.  <H3>  Zeng Jianhui Twice Leads Delegations To Cover Major  International Sports Competitions </H3>   Zeng Jianhui has also led delegations twice to cover major  international sporting events.    In 1978, when he was assistant editor-in-chief at the New  China News Agency, Zeng Jianhui led a large delegation of  Chinese correspondents to Thailand to cover the Bangkok Asian  Games.    In 1984, when the Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles,  Zeng Jianhui also led a delegation of Chinese correspondents to  cover them, by which time he was a deputy director of the New  China News Agency.  <H3>  Zeng Jianhi Promoted to Deputy Director of Central  Propaganda Department in 1988 </H3>   In May 1982, Zeng Jianhui was promoted to deputy director of  the New China News Agency, in charge of external propaganda and  particular editorial room work. Then in 1988 he was promoted  to deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda  Department, while still serving concurrently as deputy director  of the New China News Agency. By 1992, as he had too many  affairs to manage, he finally left his post at the New China  News Agency.  <H3>  Zeng Jianhui Takes Over as Information Office Director in  March 1993 </H3>   Zeng Jianhui's current key post is director of the State  Council Information Office, which is not only a key post at the  ministerial level, but also can be called the PRC State  Council's mouthpiece.</p>

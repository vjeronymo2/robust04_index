			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bucharest, April 20 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat called on Israel Wednesday [20 April] not to delay the  implementation of an autonomy accord for the occupied  territories.    Speaking ahead of a meeting here with Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres Thursday, he urged Israeli leaders "not  to delay what have been agreed, not to delay the implementation  of what have been agreed before."    The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was  referring to the April 13 deadline for the accord granting  limited autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip.    "Unfortunately our efforts and our negotiations with Israel  still face great difficulties, so the date of April 13, when the  Israeli occupation was supposed to end, has passed," he said.    'Arafat said he would meet Peres overnight Wednesday or  Thursday morning. Peres arrived here late Wednesday.    'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave here Friday, will  instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of  the executive committee" of the PLO, he said.    A meeting to be chaired by the two men has been brought  forward to Thursday for the same reason, he said. The meeting  is to discuss Middle East economy and development issues, and  will be followed by a press conference.    'Arafat was speaking to journalists after a meeting with  Romanian President Ion Iliescu. [passage omitted]</p>

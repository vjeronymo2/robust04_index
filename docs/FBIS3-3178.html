We should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to  run rampant in China.    Ai Zhisheng said: China has signed agreements of cooperation  and exchange with over 100 countries and regions and many  television programs are introduced from overseas. These  practices are necessary. However, the problem is that we do not  analyze and differentiate programs introduced from overseas, and  consequently, a large number of movies, videotapes, and tapes  even regarded as vulgar or pernicious in the West are  introduced. Radio and television programs have been overflowing  with vulgar popular songs, rock and roll shows, and beauty  pageants in disguised forms.    Ai Zhisheng said: Many movies and audio-visual products from  Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the West are brought into our country  through various legal and illegal channels, and occupy most of  the theaters in cities and townships. This severely affects  locally produced movies. An overwhelmingly majority of these  movies and audio-visual products are vulgar, and are very  damaging to adolescents.    Ai Zhisheng pointed out: It is equally notable that some  people from overseas use money to entice others to make movies  which smear the revolutionary history of China, play up the  seamy side of things, and reject socialism. Some people from  overseas also come to the mainland to hold various false  "charity shows" and "beauty pageants" in disguised forms, and to  use huge monetary awards to wantonly promote a decadent  lifestyle which advocates consumption and hedonism, as well as  negative and decadent ideologies and culture. These activities  have brought about many grave consequences.    Ai Zhisheng said that, in order to safeguard the interests  of  the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and to  educate the younger generations in a better way, it is necessary  to unswervingly implement Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We  must unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the  outside world and vigorously widen the scope of exchange with  the outside world on the basis of equality and reciprocity; but,  in the meantime, we must keep sober-minded and resolutely resist  the corrosive influence of foreign decadent ideologies. We  should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to run rampant in our  country."</p>

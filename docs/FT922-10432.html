			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / China chips reluctantly away at its 'iron rice bowl': Why the policy of 'smashing' the system of safe state jobs is pursued half-heartedly A worker in the city of Hefei, made redundant from his job in a chemical factory, killed the factory manager by running him over twice with a truck. He was sentenced to death last month. Like most workers in Chinese state factories, Mu Huining, had grown accustomed to a world where no one could be sacked, unless caught gambling or fighting on the job or failing to turn up at work with no good reason. In China this is the state sector system of the 'iron rice-bowl', guaranteeing workers not only a job for life, but free medicine and schooling, subsidised food and subsidised housing. The system also has a secure 'iron chair' for the factory managers, good or bad, and the same 'iron wages' paid to workers whether they work or not. Official policy is to smash the iron rice bowl, pay higher wages to the harder-working and sack the surplus workers who account for anything over 10 per cent of a factory's payroll. The aim is to make the state enterprises competitive and profitable. A third of them are losing money. They cost the state billions of yuan in subsidies every year, and the more competitive collectives, private businesses and foreign joint ventures are growing much faster. These now account for almost half China's total industrial production, up from less than 25 per cent in 1980. Reforming the state sector, especially labour reform, is 'in' in China, as it has been off and on for years. A journalist told of visiting a factory in the mid-eighties which claimed to be implementing labour reform, offering as proof the fact that two workers had been sacked. When the journalist asked what their offence was he was told they had not turned up for work for six months. Smashing the iron rice bowl is easier to say than put into practice. The tendency is to chip rather than smash. The problem is a worker who is fired loses all the other perks that go with a state job which form the basis of China's social welfare system, catering to more than 100m workers. It is not surprising factories tread warily. Even adjusting wages can be a risky business. A recent report from Yunnan province said a truck driver went beserk after a row with his bosses over pay and rammed his vehicle into cyclists and pedestrians, killing nine and injuring 25. Chen Deping, aged 43, was executed. The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory claims to be a model of reform. When Wuhan established a sister city relationship with the German city of Duisberg, the factory brought in a retired German manager for two years to help with modernisation. Since 1987 new workers have been employed on labour contracts, and 15 per cent of the workforce is now on contract. Labour minister Ruan Congwu has said contracts do not weaken the workers' position as 'masters of an enterprise', rather they 'legalise' labour relations. In practice, contract workers can only be fired if at the end of five years their performance is found to be not good enough. Four have been sacked but the labour contract is not very different in reality from the old life-time deal. Few companies, let alone the communist government, would be happy about laying off large numbers of inefficient workers, depriving them and their families of housing and free services and risking the growth of a hostile army of urban unemployed. The government particularly fears the emergence of a Polish-style Solidarity movement. Most Chinese workers, surveys show, are not anxious to lose their job security either. Even a model factory such as Wuhan's diesel engine plant, is a long way from seriously grappling with the problem. Real progress, say economists, will only be possible when China develops a social security net and reforms the housing market so that shelter is not tied to employment. The goal of a free labour market, they say, would not only give individual employers the right of hire and fire, but the workers the right to choose their job. Chinese workers who want to quit for a better job must pay their employer 'compensation'. A state employee who quits may find himself barred from other state enterprises. There are not enough jobs for the number who want them in the fast growing non-state sector. Urban unemployment is put at less than 2.35 per cent, but the figure disguises a massive problem of underemployment. Like most state enterprises the Wuhan plant is plagued by the 'debt triangle' where one factory owes millions to another and is in turn owed millions by a third. It is owed 19m yuan (Dollars 4.9m) and owes 11m yuan it cannot pay until it collects its debts. Moreover its profit level is low because the government fixes the price of its engines to its main market, the farmers. The factory would double the price if it were free to do so.</p>

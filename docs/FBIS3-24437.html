			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Yakovlev, Russian Academy of Sciences </F> Far East Institute professor: "Economic and Political Interests  of the Russian Authorities: How They Do Not Coincide With the  Interests of the Opposition"]    [Text]  <H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>   Arguments concerning the precedence of politics over  economics and vice versa have been conducted since time  immemorial and, moreover, with particular fury in periods of  social troubles and a search for ways to get out of them. The  present catastrophic situation in Russia and in the space of the  former USSR naturally placed this argument at the center of  endless discussions on the centuries-old Russian question: "What  is to be done?" And it seems that it is already not so much  these discussions as it is life itself that answers this  question unambiguously: It is necessary with any measures, right  up to extreme ones, to save the economy, and to restore and to  develop production at a high tempo, which alone can now  extricate the country from the slough of monstrous inflation.    This crying voice of real life is heard by all, but in very  different ways. And this does not at all depend on the extent of  common sense, professionalism, and people's civic  responsibility, but rather on their specific vital interests,  which are determined by social position and social inclination.  And, according to the letter of scientific truth, the ideology  of different social forces and a policy that corresponds to it  express these interests in a concentrated way.    At all times those tendencies and processes dominate the  economy in any country that responds most of all to the  interests of the social stratum or class that has a decisive  influence on the character of state authority and, consequently,  on its policy. Of course, all of this is political science  prescriptions. But, unfortunately, through the efforts of  certain interested social circles during the years of  perestroyka and reforms, such a chaos of ideas and categories  was created that people now have difficulty distinguishing red  from white and brown, and left from right. As for the usual  "isms," they are anathematized and even declared nonexistent in  the modern life of humanity. Meanwhile, the "civilized world,"  which is dear to the heart of our perestroyka supporters and  reformers, persistently calls its society capitalistic (but the  main thing is it considers it to be capitalistic), ignoring the  lamentation of our Marxist-Leninists that somewhere just "over  the hill" genuine socialism is blossoming. But God will be their  judge. But this is not what the question is now.    It is about something else--about the correlation of  political and economic concerns of our Russian authorities. Only  a blind person may not see that they are working most of all on  problems of self-reinforcement. This is its highest and truly  vital priority today. The economy as such and the distress of  the people is of interest to them only to the extent they do not  prevent them from concentrating efforts precisely on this  priority. But its reliable guarantee consists first of all on a  rapid expansion of social support of the authorities in the form  of important entrepreneurs and numerous small and average  knights of profit who will staunchly defend their just acquired  "beautiful life" and a government that opens the way for them to  such a life. Hence, the destructive pace and scales of  privatization of the economy of the country, and hence the  almost unlimited scope for the purchase and sale of all and  everything for the enrichment of the leaders of the excessively  growing bureaucratic apparatus.    But, of course, in trying to entrench themselves forever,  the  current Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to  develop friendship with the "fraternal" West. Reliance on its  assistance and defense is so great that these authorities did  not and will not spare the price. But the price here is  well-known--economic and every other kind of dependence on it  for a "reviving Russia." While perfecting the priceless  moral-political support of the "civilized world," vividly and  opportunely demonstrated by it in the tragic days of  September-October 1993, the Russian powers that be are trying to  impede the objectively necessary transformation of the CIS into  a real union of states in every way possible, for such a  prospect is interpreted in the West as "the worst nightmare of  all possible nightmares" in this world, with the exception of a  nuclear war.    The proposals of Kazakhstan in the spirit of this prospect  have long ago and openly been ignored by Moscow, and the  decisive integrational initiative of Belarus was met with  hostility by those influential figures who did everything to  bury the idea of an "all-Union ruble space"; that is, to destroy  one of the most important economic prerequisites for a political  reintegration of the former Union republics.    In the light of the aforementioned understanding of the  priorities of today's ruling elite, at the very least the  endless reproaches directed at it on the part of our  multicolored opposition look naive in that it, this elite, was  formed out of loonies and professionally incompetent people.    The most urgent task of our reformers is to achieve the  irreversibility of social processes in Russia and to bring it  into the club of "democratic" states at any price. Only a  bourgeois Russia can be brought into this club, but it is not  entirely mandatory that it be independent and prosperous and,  what is more, strong and possessing a powerful defense  potential. With these kinds of parameters, Russia is not wanted  in this club. And when "Russian opposition to its majesty" in  the person of Skokov complains about the fact that "there has  really not been any real reformation as such" and that, he said,  as a result of the spontaneous process there has been some kind  of restructuring of economic management "that still has not led  to anything intelligible," then the impression is created that  it will be difficult to free it, this opposition, from  professional economic blindness. Does it really not see that the  reforms, of which there did not seem to be any, changed the  socioeconomic essence of Russian society and the state system of  Russia in a radical way? There also were the kind that in their  results were equivalent to a revolution or a counterrevolution.    And now the whole problem is only whether the social  upheaval  in Russia will turn out to be bourgeois-nationalistic or openly  colonial-comprador in the final analysis. It appears that Yuriy  Skokov and his like-thinkers in the Federation of Commodity  Producers they head were hoping for the first variant. But then  he, in private, should more carefully weigh the real reasons for  his dismissal from key posts in the government. If this variant  would be necessary to those circles that now determine the  domestic and foreign policy of the country, then it cannot be  ruled out that he specifically, Skokov, would be sitting now in  the chair of the prime minister, devoting all of his official  time to the restoration and development of commodity production  and the creation of hothouse conditions for an industrial  bourgeoisie, and not for a more quickly maturing trade-money  lending bourgeoisie. But he is not sitting in this chair,  inasmuch as the political elite of the country does not now  stand in need of patrons from the commodity producers.    Generally speaking, the need for workers of such an  orientation and such an economic mentality may not even surface  in Russia in the foreseeable future. A majority of them are not  capable of building a colonial-comprador model of the economy, a  model which, as the most likely, shines through everything that  is being done and is occurring in politics, in society, and in  the economy of the country, and also in its relations with the  near and far abroad.    A genuinely creative stage in the development of the economy  of Russia can arrive only when the question of authority, that  is, the most important political question of contemporary  Russian life, is finally and reliably resolved either in favor  of the national-patriotic strata of the rapidly forming  bourgeoisie, which, out of necessity, will push aside from the  state helm the pioneers of bourgeois restoration who are too  closely tied to the West, or in favor of the supporters of a  socialist orientation who are now capable in an incomparably  greater measure than before to combine it with the priority of  national-state interests. (In the latter case, it is a question  actually of the Chinese variant of implementing the socialist  choice on the path of development of a market economy.)    The appeals of the government and of the multifaceted  opposition for reconciliation no matter what happens--and  history indicates the nature of these appeals with the political  amnesty in February of this year--undoubtedly make considerable  social sense at the present time, when there is yet another  regrouping of sociopolitical forces in the country. But the  contradictions in society that were created by perestroyka and  reforms are too deep for these appeals to play a substantial  role in maintaining political stability in the country in the  long term. Without significant adjustments in the positions of  the government in the spirit of national-patriotic demands, or  without a really meaningful personnel renewal of the authority  structures in the very same spirit, social accord in Russia will  be unthinkable.    Any programs, even the most effective ones for getting the  country out of the crisis, will hang in the air, if they run  counter to the interests of strengthening the positions of the  present authorities, to its sociopolitical objectives, and to  its already insurmountable engagement with the West.  Consequently, in the near foreseeable term, the main line of  struggle for the revival of a powerful and prosperous Russian  state, as previously, will lie in the political and by no means  in the economic sphere. And the endless claims of officials and  of the mass media close to the authorities that the people are  tired of politics are called on precisely to disorient Russians  with respect to the location of this main line.</p>

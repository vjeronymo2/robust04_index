			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS, ANXIOUS RESIDENTS KEEP VIGIL  </P> <P> In the early dawn today, clusters of residents and city officials stood on the  world-famous strand here, looking out to sea.  </P> <P> The group held a subdued vigil as they watched for any signs of oil. Some had  been on the beach all night. By noon, however, no oil had washed ashore. But  city officials said the reprieve, due mainly to favorable winds, might not last  more than a few hours longer.  </P> <P> About 2 miles out to sea, the oil tanker American Trader dominated the horizon.  It was a leak from the ship that on Wednesday afternoon caused a 297,000-gallon  oil spill and which triggered the residents' anxious watch over their beaches.  </P> <P> "They've got to be more careful," said Tim Wynglarz, 29, a steel worker, as he  watched the ship. "This is my hometown."  </P> <P> The oil slick was not visible from shore. Some on the beach got their best  description of the slick from Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who flew over the ocean in  a helicopter about 7:45 a.m. and then came to the beach at First Street and  Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> "The slick is about 5 miles long and 2 to 3 miles wide," Mays told a cluster of  reporters and residents on the beach.  </P> <P> A slight odor of petroleum hung over the beach area, near the pier, where most  of the residents and sightseers gathered this morning. Earlier, the odor had  been stronger, according to some at the beach. The mild Santa Ana wind, blowing  from the land out to sea, had dampened the fuel smell as well as holding back  the oil slick, according to several observers.  </P> <P> Victor Leipzig, a city Planning Commission member and executive director of the  Bolsa Chica Conservancy, stood inside the city's lifeguard headquarters  building at the same intersection. Scores of volunteers approached him in the  early morning hours.  </P> <P> "I came here with my children, and we want to do what we can to help save the  birds," said one woman.  </P> <P> Leipzig told her and other volunteers to walk the beaches, looking for any  injured birds or sea animals.  </P> <P> "If you find any, gently put them in a cardboard box and bring them here  (lifeguard headquarters), and then we'll take them to Huntington State Beach  headquarters and clean them off," Leipzig said.  </P> <P> State officials said two dozen shore birds had been fouled by the oil, and six  died.  </P> <P> Environmentalists standing on shore said they were relieved that the danger to  the city's main beach, at the pier, seemed to have lessened.  </P> <P> Still, the residents said, the danger still hovered, always dependent on the  whims of winds and tides.  </P> <P> Debbie Cook, chairwoman of the environmental group Save Our Parks, said,  "Something has to be done to prevent this from ever happening again. Maybe the  solution is double-hulled boats."  </P></p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Observer: High merit, low hope What price a Brit as next president of the European Commission in the wake of last week's successful trade negotiations? With Jacques Delors due to go at the start of 1995, there's little doubt who'd be the UK's ideal choice: EC trade commissioner and former cabinet minister, Sir Leon Brittan. Whitehall has been impressed by his skill in guiding the market opening negotiations of the 'quad' group of countries to fruition, as well as by his performance at the G7 summit in Tokyo. While national political leaders were quick to claim credit for progress towards a global tariff-cutting agreement, Brittan could fairly reflect that it was he who started the talks on the way to breakthrough. He broached the idea of a market-access deal with the outgoing US administration in January, and later took it up with Bill Clinton's special US trade representative, Mickey Kantor. It was only after the two of them had gained useful ground together that Japan and Canada joined the EC-US discussions to make up the 'quad' group. Alas, whatever Brittan's merits, his home country would look to have little hope of securing the EC commission presidency for him, even if further trade talks in Geneva bring a successful end to the long-stalled Uruguay Round. For one thing, it isn't all that long since the UK supplied the president: Roy - now Lord - Jenkins held the post in the late 1970s. For another, regardless of Premier Major's rhetoric about Britain being at the heart of Europe, London would find it hard, if not impossible, to win support for a Brit from 'federalist' EC member states. So the UK will probably concentrate on blocking any overtly 'federal' candidate for the post. Hence former Belgian prime minister Wilfried Martens could expect a veto from London, as likewise might Felipe Gonzalez if he decides to abandon the Spanish premiership for Brussels. From a UK viewpoint, the Netherlands premier Ruud Lubbers would be a more desirable candidate to replace the departing Delors. True, like most Dutch politicians, Lubbers believes in a federal future for Europe. But he is a free marketeer and, as such, stands well in John Major's esteem.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: ITT to build resort complex in Las Vegas ITT, the conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, said that it planned to build a Dollars 1bn, 5,000-room resort complex in the Nevada gambling city of Las Vegas on land being bought from Mr Kerk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor. The resort, to be built in phases over a decade, would be on a 35-acre site next to the Desert Inn. Sheraton bought the site for around Dollars 160m from Mr Kerkorian last June. ITT has been making a push into the booming US gambling industry. At the time of the Desert Inn deal, Mr Rand Araskog, the group's chairman, said that the group wanted to build a 'tremendous showplace' in Las Vegas to rival the city's biggest and most profitable resorts. Mr Araskog said that the company was undaunted by the fact that several competitors were gearing up to open new theme resorts in the desert city. The 5,000 rooms envisaged for the ITT resort would match the number at a Dollars 1bn hotel-casino being built in Las Vegas by MGM Grand, which has claimed that this will be the world's largest hotel.</p>

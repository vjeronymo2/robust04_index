			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Furui (6079 3843 4395)] </F>   [Text] Copenhagen, 17 May (XINHUA) -- On behalf of the  Danish Government, Danish Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft  hosted a luncheon here at noon on 17 May, in which he warmly  welcomed Li Ruihuan, chairman of China's National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During  the luncheon, the host and his guest delivered warm and friendly  speeches, in which they praised Sino-Danish friendship and  signaled their willingness to work together to further promote  the continuous development of relations between the two  countries.    Li Ruihuan said: I visited your beautiful country 11 years  ago. Your country's quiet idyllic scenes, and your warm-hearted  and hospitable people, produced a deep impression on me. The  industrious people of Denmark, after several centuries of hard  work, have built Denmark into a modern country with highly  developed industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and tertiary  industry. The Chinese people highly admire the achievements  scored by the Danes.    He said: The Chinese and Danish peoples began friendly  contacts several centuries ago. Denmark was one of the first  Western nations that established diplomatic relations with New  China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two  countries kept developing and strengthening friendly contacts  and mutually beneficial cooperation. Over the past few years in  particular, joint efforts by the two sides have led to more  exchanges of visits by high-level officials, ever-deepening  mutual understanding, and the rapid development of cooperation  in the economic, trade, scientific, technological, educational,  and cultural fields.    Li Ruihuan said: Over the past 10 years or more, China's  achievements in economic construction have riveted the world's  attention, with sustained growth in the national economy and  marked improvements in people's living standards. We should  further intensify our efforts in reform and opening up; maintain  the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy; maintain political stability; and promote all-around  social progress.    Lykketoft said: The friendship between the Chinese and  Danish peoples dates back to ancient times. At present, trade  between the two countries continues to grow, economic  cooperation keeps expanding, and political contacts are  increasing gradually. The Danish Government and the Danish  business community are devoting great efforts to advancing  relations between the two countries, especially to further  developing economic relations and trade. He expressed the  belief that Li Ruihuan's current visit would benefit contacts  and cooperation between the two countries.    Lykketoft also recounted his visit to China in 1993 as head  of a delegation. He said the Chinese people's resolve to  realize the established goal of modernization, as well as rapid  economic development, had produced a profound impression on  members of the delegation. Moreover, China's efforts to  strengthen its legal system to ensure stable economic and social  development and its realistic approach toward political reform  are unforgettable. He said: Denmark thinks highly of the  positive role played by China, in its capacity as a permanent  member of the UN Security Council, in international and regional  affairs, and in maintaining world peace and stability.</p>

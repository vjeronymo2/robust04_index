			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by own commentator: "(2) On Strengthening </F> Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New  Circumstances--Ensuring Correct Guidance of Public Opinion"]    [Text] At the All-China Conference on Propagandistic and  Ideological Work, general-secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that  it is necessary to guide the people by means of correct public  opinion media. This is a most important task to be achieved at  the propaganda and ideology front.    The effects of accurate guidance of public opinion are huge.  Accurate guidance of public opinion will consolidate popular  feelings and enhance popular spirit. Faulty guidance of public  opinion will result in slackening of morale, which will have  serious consequences. Historical experiences tell us that it has  never been possible to achieve glorious victories, be it in  revolution or in construction, without accurate guidance of  public opinion. During the past 15 years of reform and opening  up, accurate guidance of public opinion has been extremely  effective. It has been effective in the "liberation of minds,"  in renovating concepts, in unifying thought and action of the  entire party and of all people throughout the nation, in  preserving a secure and united social and political situation,  in arousing and manifesting the enthusiasm, initiative, and  creativity of the masses, and in promoting the smooth progress  of reform, of opening up, and of all modernization projects. The  exemplary strength displayed by Jiao Yulu [3542 5940 4389], when  secretary of the county party committee, is up to this day an  inspiration for all the many cadres and for the masses. The  pioneering spirit of the people of Linxian County has the effect  of a huge motivating force for all the people of the province to  work hard toward bringing prosperity to Henan Province. The  great "liberation of the mind" discussion, that has been  organized these last one, two years, has promoted a renovation  of concepts among all cadres and the masses throughout the  province. The systematic reportage on "The Upsurge of Reform in  the Mid-China Plains" strengthened the confidence of all the  people throughout the province in deepening the reform and in  promoting economic development. The heroic feats of Xu Honggang  [1776 3163 0474] and Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409], their  readiness to fight for a just cause, is just now encouraging  millions of young men and women of the central plain to fight  courageously against evil and wickedness and to promote and  develop a healthy atmosphere. The many advanced models that have  emerged on all our battle fronts have already become examples to  be emulated by all the people of the entire province... We must  review the experiences in these various quarters and draw  lessons from them, in order to enhance the effectiveness of our  guidance of public opinion.    Correct guidance of public opinion requires of us that we  firmly persist in preserving unity and stability, that we evoke  enthusiasm, that we pursue a policy of positive propaganda, and  that we give prominence to the main theme of reform, opening up,  and economic development. We must propagate most thoroughly the  spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, of the Third Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and of the Eighth Session of  the Fifth Provincial Party Congress, namely to maintain  continuity and stability in our basic propagandistic themes. We  must comprehensively and correctly propagate the political line,  principles, and policies of the party. We must persist in  dialectical materialism and avoid one-sidedness, and we must  also observe propagandistic discipline. We must profusely  propagate the achievements of reform and opening up, and must  concentrate attention on economic construction as focal point  and main battle ground. We must effectively deal with the  various relationships. We must accurately guide, effectively  protect, and effectively bring into play the enthusiasm of the  masses and of every sector of society. We must encourage and  stimulate the unswerving confidence of the masses, and have them  energetically forge ahead as of one heart and one mind, while  taking the interests of the whole into consideration, in order  to have the various reform plans smoothly presented and  implemented and creating an excellent social environment in the  area of public opinion. We must predominantly propagate those  positive ideas and actions that will encourage, inspire, and  enlighten the people as to the struggle for the purpose of  achieving a prosperous and strong state, the welfare of the  people, and an advanced society. We must regularly and without  respite propagate various advanced exemplary cases of topical  characteristics, review and disseminate the advanced experiences  created by cadres and masses in every locality, and have their  advanced ideas and experiences become the common wealth shared  by the entire province.    Correct guidance of public opinion requires more propaganda  among the masses. We must enthusiastically propagate advanced  personalities as such are found among workers, peasants,  intellectuals, and soldiers, who at their ordinary posts show  unselfish dedication. We must more effectively guide the  enthusiasm and creativity of the masses toward the grand  undertaking of our modernization projects. We must create  throughout the entire society an excellent custom of striving  for healthy progress and active forging-ahead. In the opposite  case, if we were to pander to the tastes of some people and  unrestrainedly publicize the stars, people of financial  prominence, and the abnormal consumption of those who spend  money like water, our guidance would be misdirected, would lead  to a slackening of morale, and to a collapse of fighting spirit.    This year is extremely critical for the deepening of reform  and for progress in economic development, a year in which a  series of new important reform measures will continuously be  initiated, and in which, as a consequence, some new  contradictions and new problems will prop up. This will require  of all who are engaged in propagandistic and ideological work to  familiarize themselves well with the overall situation, to  effectively handle, in the course of ongoing work, the  relationship between reform, economic development, and social  stability. It requires close coordination with the general and  particular policies of the party, deep penetration of the basic  levels, and strengthening of investigation and research in  public sentiment and in the mentality of the masses. It requires  fullest propagation of the enormous achievements of reform and  opening up during the past 15 years, and active propaganda of  the excellent state of reform, opening up, and economic  development, informing of good examples and good experiences in  all reform measures seen in actual practice. It requires opening  up ideological channels deep into sentiments and reasoning, with  convincing arguments and in forms that are appreciated by the  masses, concerning those problems that impact social stability,  it requires resolving contradictions, straightening out moods  and sentiments, and converting negative into positive factors.    Correct guidance of public opinion also requires effective  supervision of public opinion. Through supervision of public  opinion we shall be able to oppose bureaucratism, to rectify  unhealthy tendencies, to overcome various negative and decadent  phenomena, and to strengthen the people's confidence in  progress. Supervision of public opinion must pay attention to  commending the good and to criticizing all shortcomings. It must  appropriately deal with disturbing elements, it must support  whoever favors reform, it must encourage exploratory activities,  must educate those that have gone astray, must penalize the  corrupt, and must prosecute those who lodge false accusations.  In short, supervision of public opinion must definitely overcome  the tendency to merely and purely strive for "sensational  effects." Our attention must be directed toward achieving  beneficial social results. We must firmly adhere to the  principle of seeking truth from facts in order to create a great  environment in which solid work will be performed and new  achievements will be attained.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bosch braced to be one of the few - A leaner future for the components supplier THE top management changes at Robert Bosch coincide with increasingly difficult business and labour conditions for the group, Germany's 10th biggest industrial company and largest supplier to the troubled automotive industry. Last week, some 10,000 workers held an unprecedented demonstration outside the company's headquarters at Gerlingen in the hills outside Stuttgart, bussed from the company's 57 production sites across Germany to protest at planned cuts in employee benefits. Under Mr Marcus Bierich, the outgoing chief executive, Bosch employee numbers have dropped by 20,000 to 170,000 worldwide over the past two years, and are set to fall by another 10,000 in the current year. So far, these cuts have been achieved without compulsory redundancies and employees' real ire is reserved for a plan to cut employee benefits. Bosch is planning to do away with a quarter of its DM1bn (Dollars 625m) benefits bill. This means chopping perks such as subsidised lunches, awards for long service, spa cures and nursing cures. When combined with the below-inflation pay rise of 3 per cent this year for the German workforce, pay will in effect be frozen this year. Mr Bierich, who departs at the end of the month to be replaced by Mr Hermann Scholl, was not expected to step up to the Bosch supervisory board until his contract ran out next year. There has been speculation that his early departure follows board-level disagreements over cost-cutting - in particular, disagreement with Mr Hans Merkle, the group's legendary 80-year-old patriarch. Mr Merkle was chief executive from 1963 to 1984 and his influence over the company remains large. More than 90 per cent of the shares in the Bosch group are owned by the Robert Bosch charitable foundation - but voting control is concentrated in a small holding company headed by Mr Merkle. In an interview this week, Mr Bierich, 67, insisted that his departure at this time was long planned. He flatly denied that he was leaving because of differences of opinion over cost-cutting or any other issue. The cost-cutting measures were grounded in business necessity, he said. In the first three months of the year, Bosch has sunk into operating losses and turnover has dropped 10 per cent worldwide, by 14 per cent in Europe and by a much larger percentage in Germany. Turnover increased in only four countries: the UK, the US, Australia and Brazil. One factor is the impact of the appreciation of the D-Mark against other currencies in recent months. Half of the group's sales (DM34.2bn last year) were made outside Germany, but three quarters of the group's manufacturing was in Germany. Mr Bierich said that like other German companies it had to accept reduced margins to maintain market share in countries other than Germany. The main problem for Bosch is the pressure car manufacturers are putting on suppliers worldwide - a problem shared by all the 2,000 or so German companies which supply the industry. Just how big a problem has been underscored by the recent arrival of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez at Volkswagen from General Motors. Mr Lopez, known as the 'Russelsheim strangler' in honour of his prowess at cutting costs at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, is charged with doing a similar job at Volkswagen. Bosch management has had a two-hour meeting with Mr Lopez since the latter joined VW. Mr Bierich refused to disclose what was discussed in any detail. However, he said he agreed with Mr Lopez's objectives - to cut costs via a simplification of components - and was keen to ensure that the cost-cutting should take place in an orderly way. Mr Bierich confirmed that pressure on prices from car manufacturers has led the company to stop supplying certain products. 'This was our decision,' he said, without giving details, 'the prices were not right.' In spite of the suppliers' increasingly severe problems, Bierich was optimistic about Bosch's long-term future. He agreed with industry analysts who said that the coming shake-out in the sector would be so large that by the turn of the century there would be only 200 German suppliers left, whittled down to a fifth of the current level through mergers and bankruptcies. 'A few will pull through and emerge stronger than they were before, and many will simply disappear,' Mr Bierich said, confident that as Germany's biggest company in the sector, Bosch would be one of the few. As a measure of this confidence, he said Bosch was unlikely to abandon its prized status as a private company and seek a stock-market listing. 'So long as we can finance our investments out of cash-flow, this just isn't necessary,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African army has strengthened its force in  the volatile kwaZulu-Natal area. Eighty-eight people have died  in the area since the state of emergency was declared last  month. Seven hundred members of the Citizen Force Unit have  arrived in Ladysmith and 150 more are expected tomorrow.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica van der  Westhuizen]  Citizen Force members arrived at the Ladysmith base early this  morning. They were called up and mobilized within two weeks.  The men will be joining other troops in northern Natal and  Zululand. Welcoming the troops later in the day Brigadier Deon  Ferreira of Natal Command emphasized that their main task was to  help restore peace and stability. Brigadier Ferreira said there  was a perception that the army was against the Zulu nation.  This he said was not the case. He added that a lack of  tolerance had resulted in the callous murders of people. The  army was deployed to help stop this ongoing tide of violence in  the area. Ninety percent of the Citizen Force come from Natal.    [A-Company Commander Maj. John Rutherford] We are all family  people. We are here basically so that there is stability -- to  ensure stability in the country so that there can be free and  fair elections at the end of the day and then go home and then  be happy again, really.    [Van der Westhuizen] The force members wasted no time in  making sure their vehicles were in tip-top condition. The  troops will leave for Eshowe tomorrow from where they will be  deployed in volatile areas. With the arrival of the 850 members  today and tomorrow there will be over 2,000 additional troops in  kwaZulu- Natal. [end recording]</p>

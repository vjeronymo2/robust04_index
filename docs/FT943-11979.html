			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: CBI report well received in more active trade - Market report The confident trend among manufacturers in the latest Confederation of British Industry report sent the UK stock market ahead yesterday, although shares came off the top as British government bonds shied away from the report's warning about upward pressures on prices. Trading volume was better than on Monday but still below the level generally considered satisfactory by the London-based securities houses. Early trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index gain nearly 27 points to 3,132.8, encouraged by a strong opening in stock index futures. But this proved to be the best of the day and shares retreated as the bond market began to react negatively to the CBI report of potential price inflation. At the close, the FT-SE gain had been trimmed to 11.1 for a reading of 3,117.2. The market was also restrained by a dull start on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial Average shed 10 points in UK hours as the US dollar gave ground. Some dollar stocks ended the session lower, among them Shell Transport, a prominent Footsie stock, as investors took profits following confirmation of the sale of the Billiton interests to Gencor of South Africa. Traders maintained that the fall in Shell shares would prove to be short-lived and that there was nothing in the Billiton deal to unsettle investors. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index held a gain of 17.1 points to 3,641.1 and the overall tone of the market remained very firm. Traders said that the CBI report had been very well received, with its disclosure that manufacturing orders were growing at the highest rate for nearly six years serving to confirm the stock market perception that economic recovery is showing through strongly in terms of higher earnings and prospective dividend payments at British companies. Seaq volume of 551.7m shares compared with 431.4m on Monday when retail business returned a total worth of Pounds 1.02bn. World markets are still relatively quiet, while awaiting the week's sole highlight in the form of the latest US gross domestic product numbers, due on Friday. Confidence ahead of the flow of results from the UK financial and banking sector, which opens today with figures from Lloyds Abbey Life, was encouraged by the favourable reception from the German stock market for first half figures from Deutsche Bank. There were gains in a number of other blue chip shares which are on the point of disclosing trading results. Reuters and ICI, both with interim results due this week, closed firmly, and the confident tone of the banking sector overflowed into the insurance stocks. Pharmaceuticals also brushed off dollar weakness as several of the sector leaders continued to stabilise after somne recent uncertainty. Wellcome remained firm, under the influence of last week's trading statement. Hopes that the recovery in manufacturing industry will soon spill over into consumer spending brought some buyers in for the store and retail issues, which have been marking time as market attention has focused on the engineering and industrial sectors. But trading volume in these traditionally active retail issues was fairly modest and analysts doubted whether investment views towards the sectors had changed significantly. Futures markets provided most of the lead for equities and at one time a premium of more than 20 points against cash was reached on the September FT-SE futures contract. This premium began to weaken a little in later trading. This morning will feature the auction of Pounds 2bn in British government securities and this could restrain share prices at the opening of today's session in London.</p>

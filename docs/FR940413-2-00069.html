This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assistance will be provided only to CWRU for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to CWRU.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CWRU is the most appropriate and qualified agency to provide the services specified under this cooperative agreement because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In 1991, CWRU was the only applicant funded through the competitive announcement  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 114, ADEPT/HIV-Related Tuberculosis Demonstration. The study being conducted is a trial of preventive therapy in HIV-infected persons in Uganda; regimens being followed in the current study are novel chemotherapy regimens requiring long-term follow up of patients to determine the efficacy of these drugs. CWRU currently has enrolled more than 600 tuberculin-positive patients in the study. During the initial months of recruitment, the investigators found a significant number of immunocompromised patients unable to respond to skin test antigens (anergic). Since October 1993, these patients are being enrolled in the study to assess whether they are at even higher risk for the development of tuberculosis and whether preventive treatment would be effective. As of November 1993, 11 anergic patients were participating in the trial. Enrollment into the study is continuing; however, there will not be sufficient time in the current project period to complete the enrollment of 1200 nonanergic and 500 anergic patients and follow these patients for the 2 years necessary to collect meaningful data on the efficacy of the preventive therapy regimens. Without continuing the project for an additional 5 years, the data collected to date will be of limited usefulness in assessing the efficacy of the regimens evaluated in this study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The work under this cooperative agreement will be conducted in the Republic of Uganda. Uganda has one of the highest prevalences of HIV and tuberculous dually-infected persons in the world. The CWRU project is able to enroll 20 nonanergic and 5 anergic patients each week; no other known sites have access to sufficient patients to enroll at this rate. This rate of enrollment is necessary to ensure that sufficient numbers of patients are enrolled to provide statistically-valid results within a relatively short period of time. The CWRU research team also has established relations with Ugandan institutions that should ensure the success of a high-quality trial. Results on the efficacy of preventive therapy regimens in HIV-infected persons are needed to aid in the elimination of tuberculosis in the United States, as outlined in ``A Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United States.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. CWRU possesses proven scientific and managerial competence in treating TB patients and in conducting clinical research trials. Many of the patients in the current cohort have been followed for as long as a year with very few patients lost to follow up. CWRU has been successful in other CDC-funded clinical trials involving the long-term follow-up (2 years or more) of HIV-infected persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To date, CDC has provided over $1,000,000 to establish this cohort. Use of this cohort will be less expensive and provide more timely results than to begin enrollment of another cohort at a different site. Additionally, no other known site can provide enrollment at the rate necessary to adequately assess the treatment regimens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The current spread of TB demands new methods for combating this disease. The results of this study will add significantly to the body of information on the efficacy of specific regimens in preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons. The rifampin-containing regimens may provide options for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons exposed to INH-resistant organisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application is not subject to review as governed by Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

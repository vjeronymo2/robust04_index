			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: VW sees second-term deficit cut VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, yesterday said that it would make a loss in the second quarter of the current year but it would be much smaller than the DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m) deficit posted in the first three months. In a letter to shareholders, Volkswagen indicated that it would start making profits again in the second half of the year and would be able to report a positive result for the year as a whole. These confident comments reiterated the message given by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive, at the group's press conference at the end of March. It was then that he revealed the scale of the first-quarter loss - but said that the worst was over. The comments support investors' confidence that VW's aggressive cost-cutting measures would bear fruit later this year, possibly allowing the company to pay a dividend after the pay-out for 1992 was cut to DM2 from DM11 in 1991. VW's shares added DM4.50 yesterday to close at DM322. The company is planning to shed 20,000 jobs this year out of a total of 36,000 job cuts to take effect by the end of 1997. The company's commitment to tackling its bloated cost base was underscored by the hiring of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez, the Spanish purchasing chief who left General Motors to join Volkswagen at the end of March. BMW yesterday announced that sales for the first four months of the year had dropped by 8.3 per cent to DM9.67bn. Production of cars fell by 11.5 per cent to 189,528 units, showing that the company was not immune to the downturn in the German car sector. However, the Bavaria-based company continued to escape the worst of the problems: in Germany the number of new passenger vehicle registrations in the first quarter of the year fell 21.5 per cent. Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, speaking at his last shareholders' meeting as chief executive, said that BMW would deliver a healthy profit for the full year.</p>

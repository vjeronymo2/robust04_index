Investigations have revealed that a Palestinian spy network  worked for the Israeli intelligence service Mosad in Gaza.    Palestinian security services inside discovered during their  two-month investigations that this network received orders from  Mosad to begin the assassination scheme. The security services  managed to unravel the clues and enticed one of those implicated  to go to Tunis at the end of last week.    This Palestinian is named as Ahmad Abu-'Awf, a resident of  Khan Yunus. He is 24. He was enticed to go Tunis after  visiting his brother in London.    Palestinian security services kept silent about this case to  ensure that other members of the network would not escape.  According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information, a committee has  been formed from the inside and outside to follow up this  delicate case.</p>

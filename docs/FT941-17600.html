			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Mr Blobby for Number 10 Time to put my money where my mouth is and produce a few fearless forecasts for 1994, even though, on balance, it looks like being a muddling year - neither memorable nor especially horrible though marked, come autumn, by the first tangible wisps of PMT (pre-millennial tension). None of these forecasts is based on econometric modelling or indeed on anything more highfalutin than hunch and experience. They are serious predictions, though I am happy to confess - most forecasters never do this - that wishful thinking has infected most of them. Off we go: Stock markets world-wide will endure a nastier ride than most pundits are predicting. The FT-SE 100 will set a record high of approximately 3,660 before Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone in September or October, finishing the year below 3,000. I myself plan to go almost totally liquid on February 24, which happens to be my birthday. Contrary to what the experts say, gold will glitter in 1994 as it dawns on market-makers that every 15 seconds another 45 people are born on earth and that 10 of them, at least, are likely to be gold-bugs. In 1994 gold will again approach Dollars 500 an ounce (Dollars 391 at present) as a prelude to startling gains at the end of the century. It will be a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy columnists will finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hilary Clinton, her husband's possible successor as US president in seven years' time. But it will be a cruel and desperate period for Europe's leaders, particularly John Major, whose days as UK prime minister are - mercifully - numbered. Major won't be pushed; he will go voluntarily, late in the year, probably late at night, his poor wife in tow, deciding, not unnaturally, that enough is enough and that he has already endured more obloquy than mortal man can bear. (Why should he worry? He will become a rich and much-loved pensioner). His successor - but only for a short while - will be Kenneth Clarke, the Mr Blobby of UK politics. Eventually, however, the present chancellor's astonishing good luck will dribble to an end and he will be stabbed in the back - with svelteness, of course - by Michael Portillo. John Smith will meander through another low-key year as Britain's Opposition leader and will (or will not) move towards some form of alliance with Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. If he doesn't, the Tories stand a chance of stealing the next election just as they stole the last one. Something unpleasant, painful and messy will happen to bossy Virginia Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I won't say what; it would ruin the fun. Soccer's World Cup will be tremendously successful, with Norway beating Brazil 3-1 in the final. The success of the competition will lead millions of American sports fans to wonder why, all these years, they let themselves be fobbed off with such girl's-blouse sports as baseball and basketball. It will be a good year for Prince Charles as more and more people come to appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British throne. What could be more fin de siecle, modern or sophisticated? (The divorce itself will come next year). Behind the scenes, Queen Elizabeth II will be informing her less-than-close relatives that the gravy train has departed and that the monarchy is being downsized while revelling secretly in the knowledge that she and her heirs are safe. Correspondingly, the Church of England will stumble ever faster towards disestablishment and outer darkness. The Grand National steeplechase will again be a fiasco. People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more and more like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced. Newsdesks will realise that people are fed up with coverage of Russia and China. What people want most is about 30 years' silence from Russia and China while those two unfortunate countries ponder their mistakes and smarten up their acts. That is my fondest wish for 1994: that we hear nothing more from Moscow and Beijing until New Year's Day, 2024.</p>

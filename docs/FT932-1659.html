			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / French push franc's status: 'Anchor' role sought in ERM THE Bank of France yesterday repeated its desire to see the franc as one anchor for the European exchange rate mechanism. Speaking at a seminar in London to senior economists and central bank officials yesterday, Mr Andre Icard, the head of research at the Banque de France, said: 'The French franc is sharing the duty of anchoring the (European exchange rate) mechanism. . . the D-Mark is impossible to avoid as an anchor but other currencies will share the responsibility.' His comments follow the steady decline in French short-term interest rates, which on Monday fell below those in Germany for the first time in 26 years. Mr Icard said of the franc: 'I am not saying it will become the anchor but it will become one anchor among others. The most important thing to me is that our interest rates are below those in Germany.' In Copenhagen, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, agreed that the franc along with other 'hard-core' EC currencies might take over temporarily the D-Mark's anchor role inside the ERM. Mr Delors said recent cuts in French, Dutch and Belgian interest rates, which occurred independently of the German Bundesbank relaxing monetary policy, was a comforting example of European co-operation. 'It shows that the system is not dominated by one single country or currency. But it should not be an excuse to sing The Marseillaise,' he said at the EC summit. EC officials acknowledged that German interest rates remained the most important long-term influence on the rest of the Community, and expressed hope that the Bundesbank might resume its cautious programme of rate cuts. One Brussels official predicted a move on July 1, ahead of the G7 summit in Tokyo. Mr Icard's comments were interpreted by some economists as confirmation that the French government is keen to use the franc's strength to promote Paris as a European financial centre and possible site for a European central bank. 'The strength of the franc within the ERM is a further development of Paris as a financial centre,' said Mr Icard. 'The future of Paris is closely related to the soundness of the franc.' It was only when the present conservative administration took power that the government was able to generate enough confidence among international investors to cut interest rates without the franc suffering. Official interest rates have now been lowered nine times in two months.</p>

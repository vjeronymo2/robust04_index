			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FABRICATING FITNESS;  </P> <P> FASHION: MANUFACTURERS ARE CHOOSING HIGH-TECH MATERIALS THAT OFFER  CLIMATE-CONTROL BENEFITS, IMPROVED DURABILITY, BETTER FIT AND, SOMETIMES JUST  FOR FUN, COLOR CHANGES.  </P> <P> A tennis player volleying in the heat of the day probably won't know -- or even  care -- if his Nike tennis shirt is made of Coolmax, a moisture-repelling  fabric. But when he notices how dry he stays during the game, he might go back  and buy another shirt.  </P> <P> Coolmax, developed by Du Pont, is just one of many new "performance" fibers  being used to manufacture state-of-the-art activewear.  </P> <P> These technologically advanced fabrics take a marketing cue from today's  specialized athletic shoe business. Sports men and women are already paying up  to $175 for tony shoes featuring pump gadgets and patented inner sole systems.  Fiber manufacturers are betting that consumers will embrace high-tech apparel  just as readily.  </P> <P> Some fibers, like Du Pont's Coolmax, repel moisture. Others, like Microfine,  also by Du Pont, repel wind yet allow perspiration to escape. Microfine is used  in bicycle wear by Hind.  </P> <P> In addition to their climate-control benefits, most of these new fibers offer  improved colorfastness and a better fit.  </P> <P> Just as celebrities have been endorsing apparel lines and tennis shoes, they  are now working as spokesmen for new fibers. Tennis champ Andre Agassi, who  wears Nike sportswear, is one. Cyclist Greg LeMond's Coolmax-clad physique is  featured in full-page color ads in national magazines. Triathlete Dave Scott of  Hawaii also endorses the fiber.  </P> <P> "If your body doesn't have the ability to breathe, your body temperature is  going to rise and you're not going to be able to dissipate heat," Scott says,  adding that he believes clothes made from the fabric enhance his performance.  </P> <P> Supplex is another new Du Pont fiber being used in activewear and swimwear  fashions. Laurie Allyn, vice president of merchandising for five swimwear  divisions of Apparel Ventures Inc. -- Too Hot Brazil, Citrus, Sassafras, Cessa  and Cha Cha Cha -- says designers appreciate Supplex's cotton-like look and  feel -- without cotton's inherent fading problems in salty or chlorinated  water. She also favors Supplex over nylon.  </P> <P> "These suits, made of nylon, would look too cheap and sleazy," Allyn says, "but  Supplex, with its cotton look, makes them work. It provides the needed fit and  color fastness."  </P> <P> Consumers should expect to pay more for these high-tech fabrics. A running top  made of Coolmax would cost 50% to 75% more than one made of a typical nylon  fabric, says Pete Szanto, communications director for Du Pont's Coolmax  division.  </P> <P> Allyn says that Supplex costs 25% to 30% more per yard than nylon, a fabric  used traditionally in swimwear. She estimates a bathing suit that might cost  $47 will now run "in the mid $50 range," if made of Supplex.  </P> <P> Wendy Manasse Wiese, who designs swimwear for L.A.-based Catalina, is using  Supplex for brightly colored solid and patterned halter-style suits. Wiese, who  says she pays about $3 more per yard for Supplex than for nylon/lycra blends,  says she's not sure if Catalina customers will be willing to pay an extra $6 or  so more for a Supplex suit.  </P> <P> "If someone is very athletic, it might make a difference to them that what they  wear is made of Coolmax or Supplex, but most of the new performance fibers are  for pure sports."  </P> <P> Patagonia, the Ventura-based company that outfits athletes as well as exploring  expeditions, has the exclusive right to Capilene, a polyester fabric that  absorbs moisture easily and dries quickly. The company uses the fabric as a  lining for outerwear, and for long underwear.  </P> <P> One of the newest clothing collections using high-tech fabric carries the  Freezy Freakies label. It came about when 10-year-old Judah Rifkin suggested a  line of outerwear that would go with a pair of his winter gloves, which changed  colors in various temperatures. His uncle took him up on the idea, became a  licensee of Freezy Freakies and started to manufacture a line of children's  jackets made from a color-treated polyurethane fabric. The bomber jackets and  parkas -- whose graphic designs change color when the temperature falls -- are  priced from $60 to $80 and sold through the J.C. Penney mail-order catalogue  and in smaller specialty stores.  </P> <P> The color changes on the clothes are mainly for effect. But eventually, the  company hopes to use the fabric for environmentally sensitive clothing that can  adjust to any climate change. For example, a jacket might turn white to reflect  unnecessary heat, then turn a dark color to absorb warm rays when the  temperature drops.  </P> <P> Though many of the new fibers are reserved for sports, some are moving into  moderate to better-priced non-athletic activewear.  </P> <P> Sunny Sport, a division of the Dallas-based Sunny South Fashions Inc., used  Supplex in its spring '90 line, and again for spring '91. But because it is  pricey, Supplex will not be featured in the summer line, explains designer  Debbie Castillo.  </P> <P> "We save it for big seasons, fall and spring, for our active and weekend wear,"  says Castillo. Though Sunny Sport was one of the first companies selected to  test Supplex, it may also be one of the first to discontinue it, Castillo  explains, citing concerns over a saturation in less prestigious retail outlets.  </P> <P> "The fabric is all over the market in a variety of price ranges -- including  the racks at Walmart and K mart," Castillo says.  </P></p>

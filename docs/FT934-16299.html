			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / CAA chief attacks airline subsidies CIVIL Aviation Authority yesterday opposed calls for more state aid for financially-troubled European airlines, adding its voice to the growing debate over government subsidies for the industry. Mr Christopher Chataway, CAA chairman, said state subsidies were against the consumer's interest and threatened to undermine the European Commission's 'open skies' policy. A committee of EC 'wise men' is investigating the problems facing the industry and is expected to make recommendations by the end of this year. The UK is fighting against proposals from other European countries, including France and Belgium, to provide EC funds to assist airlines in the recession, as well as a temporary freeze on capacity and fares.</p>

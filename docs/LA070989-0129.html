			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQMD TRIES AGAIN TO CUT PLANT'S EMISSIONS  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District has renewed its efforts to  require the Commerce refuse-to-energy plant to meet emissions standards,  attacking the legality of the facility's recently granted variance from  pollution limits.  </P> <P> The district's Hearing Board on Tuesday is scheduled to consider a petition for  a new hearing on the variance, which allows the plant to operate in violation  of AQMD pollution standards until Nov. 1. The variance was granted in April.  </P> <P> "The board made errors of law which render (the decision) improper," AQMD  lawyer Elliott Sernel wrote in a petition to the Hearing Board.  </P> <P> Hearing Board Chairman B. C. Escobar declined to comment on the allegation  because the matter is before the independent, quasi-judicial body. The AQMD  could seek a Superior Court order to overturn a Hearing Board decision.  </P> <P> The Hearing Board also is scheduled to consider a petition for an order of  abatement, which would empower the AQMD to require the plant to stop emitting  excessive amounts of pollution.  </P> <P> The AQMD staff would like the plant to meet emission standards sooner than is  likely under the variance, said Robert R. Pease, the district's senior air  quality engineering manager. The variance requires the plant to meet emissions  standards by Nov. 1, but the Hearing Board has scheduled an Oct. 25 hearing to  consider an extension if necessary.  </P> <P> "We want to ensure compliance on an expedited schedule," Pease said.  </P> <P> The district could seek to shut down the plant, as a last resort, if it failed  to meet emissions standards, Pease said.  </P> <P> A plant official said the abatement order was unnecessary because the county  Sanitation Districts and the city of Commerce, which jointly own and operate  the plant, are making more than $500,000 in improvements to pollution-control  equipment under the variance. Those improvements should be completed in  September, project manager Michael Selna said.  </P> <P> "We're moving extremely fast," Selna said. "We're doing quite a bit better and  are hopeful that we'll meet the (original emissions) standards."  </P> <P> The plant, the first in the county, fired up in late 1986 and operated under a  construction permit. The facility is capable of burning up to 420 tons of  municipal garbage a day in its boiler, which turns water to steam to drive a  generator. The plant, which sells electricity to Southern California Edison  Co., produces enough power for 20,000 homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District Denied Permanent Permit  </P> <P> The AQMD and plant officials have been at odds since January, when the district  denied a permanent operating permit after citing the facility for exceeding  limits on nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions on 40 days during a  two-month period last year.  </P> <P> Emissions of nitrogen oxides exceeded limits of 41 pounds an hour by as much as  14 pounds. Emissions of sulfur dioxide ran as high as 27.8 pounds an hour, more  than triple the limit of nine pounds per hour. In addition to volume limits,  the plant also exceeded concentration limits of 225 parts per million for  nitrogen oxides.  </P> <P> Under the variance, the plant is permitted to exceed its hourly emissions  limits a small percentage of the time.  </P> <P> Emissions reports indicate the plant has stayed within the variance limits, but  it has continued to exceed the original emissions levels, Pease said.  </P> <P> From April 3 through June 11, the plant exceeded the original hourly volume  limits for sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide four times. It also exceeded  concentration limits for nitrogen oxides at least nine times during the same  two-month period.  </P> <P> In its petition for a new hearing, the AQMD attacks the Hearing Board for  allegedly granting the variance without satisfying accompanying legal  requirements.  </P> <P> The state Health and Safety Code allows such variances only under certain  circumstances. There must be evidence that an owner would be forced to close  his business or suffer an unreasonable loss of property if required to meet  emissions standards.  </P> <P> There must also be proof that such a closure would be without a corresponding  benefit in reduced emissions. Several other findings must be made as well  before a variance can be granted.  </P> <P> Sernel, the deputy district counsel, could not be reached last week to describe  specific allegations against the Hearing Board's decision.  </P> <P> The AQMD filed the petition for a new hearing on June 2, several days after  officials from the district met with officials of the California Air Resources  Board. The state agency has jurisdiction over the local air pollution control  districts.  </P> <P> The California board reviewed the variance proceedings after receiving letters  from Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and others in  opposition to the variance.  </P> <P> In a June 21 report, the California board's staff also criticized members of  the Hearing Board for allegedly granting the variance without meeting the legal  requirements.  </P> <P> The board's staff found, among other things, that Commerce officials had not  proved the plant would fail financially if the amount of trash burned was cut  back to reduce emissions.  </P> <P> The state board could move to modify or revoke the variance granted by the  local Hearing Board. But James J. Morgester, chief of the state board's  compliance division, said the agency would await the Hearing Board's decision  on the new hearing.  </P></p>

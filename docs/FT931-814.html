			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When a gift is a sale I OWN THREE light industrial units which I bought in 1981 and 1982 and set wholly against income tax as then allowed. They are now worth more than the original price. If I sold them, I understand that I would be taxed on the income tax relief previously claimed, and then face a CGT bill on any excess of the price realised over the original price. If I gave them away to my adult son, what would be the position? By virtue of section 21(6) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990, any transfer of the relevant interest in an industrial building otherwise than by sale in the open market has the same consequences as a sale at the price which it would have fetched on a sale in the open market. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CA2 (Capital allowances on industrial buildings) and CGT16 (Capital gains tax: indexation allowance: disposals after April 5 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- "The Russian economy has  embarked upon the most difficult stage of reforms. We must see  that they bring sprouts of revitalisation and not new sufferings  to the country," First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets told the  newspaper "ROSSIA". His interview is published in today's issue  of the daily.    Soskovets said that the government had begun to determine  what projects should be supported from the budget. It was  decided to render government support to the coal industry. It  is to get from the budget 3.4 trillion roubles in the first six  months of this year. A decision was also adopted to settle in  the first quarter of this year the mutual debts of several  enterprises of the defence industry, the agro-industrial sector,  and the fuel and energy complex. Quotas were fixed for the  export of strategic raw materials, as well as customs duties for  imported goods. A list of federal programmes that are to be  financed from the budget this year was drawn up. All but ready  are proposals to effect state control over railway fares and  over the cost of electric and thermal energy. "Not all the  measures can be regarded as 100 per cent market oriented, but  the government is compelled to take them," Soskovets stresses.    "In spite of some successes, the economic situation remains  unstable," he notes. "Crisis phenomena were not stemmed last  year. The situation in the first quarter of this year is  characterised by the continuing industrial slump, shrinking  capital investments, accompanied by the growth of prices for  factory-made products and consumer goods."    "The steps taken by the government are still not yielding  the  expected results," Soskovets states. At the same time, he  stresses that "market relations are gaining strength in the  Russian economy and measures are being taken to reduce the  social burden of the transition period. Steps were taken to  curb the inflation. The process of privatisation is proceeding  quite dynamically. The non- state sector of economy is gaining  momentum. The investment decline was slowed down. The consumer  market is being restored. The country's foreign trade balance  is favourable."</p>

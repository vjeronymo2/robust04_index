			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unpropitious time chosen for British Coal's export drive BRITISH COAL is understandably pleased with itself this week as it begins to ship its biggest export order this year - for 100,000 tonnes of steam coal to a Danish electricity generator. But it could hardly have chosen a more difficult time to make a push into the European market. Steam coal prices look set to fall once again for 1994 deliveries. Contracts are now being concluded between the South African producers and the Belgian utility Electrabel at prices Dollars 3 below last year's, giving a 1994 price at the South African export terminal of Dollars 27 a tonne. With ocean freight rates from Richards Bay to Rotterdam around Dollars 6.75, delivered prices into north-west Europe look unlikely to exceed Pounds 22 a tonne. Although some of the power companies in Europe - the Netherlands' GKE for example - will be paying slightly higher prices for better quality coals, many will be seeking, and getting, deliveries at spot-related prices. Stadtwerke Bremen in Germany is believed to have settled first quarter 1994 business at Dollars 21 fob Richards Bay and the two Danish utilities, Elsam and SK Power, at below Dollars 20 from South Africa. Outsiders, seeing a market where supplies are threatened by the US coal strike and the sudden rise of Russian rail freight rates to Dollars 20 a tonne (they were Dollars 2 a tonne two years ago), will find this weakness difficult to comprehend. But weak power demand in Europe and in Japan has resulted in poor purchase levels, particularly from companies that had been counted on to be big buyers - Electricite de France, Italy's ENEI, and the British power companies. While ENEI has been cutting back its annual purchases from nearly 10m tonnes to about 2m tonnes this year, EDF, PowerGen and National Power have been transformed into companies selling on their imports rather than signing up for new business. Earlier this year EDF found itself in the embarrassing position of paying suppliers either to delay or cancel deliveries. Although some expansion in purchases can be expected in Europe from GKE, from Electricidade de Portugal and from Morocco, 1994 looks likely to be as gloomy as 1993. In contrast to Europe, the Asian market is undergoing a boom. Although a cool wet summer kept demand down and hydro supplies up in Japan, the sheer volume of new coal-fired power stations coming on to the grid bodes well for irresistible growth throughout the decade. Elsewhere in Asia - particularly this year in South Korea - demand for imports is mounting as much from new power stations as from, in southern India and on China's Pearl river, inadequate indigenous supply. The price outlook in Asia should be very different from Europe's, with new demand not matched by the new supply. But the perversity of the settlement calendar puts the Japanese steel producers, like their European competitors all making losses, ahead of the power utilities, so weakening the steam coal exporters' prospects relative to those of their coking coal cousins. If they do have to take price cuts this year  - and the weakness of the Australian dollar certainly makes cuts that much easier to accommodate - it will be doubly galling since export stocks have fallen throughout the year to reach a four-year low at the end of September. However, the vigour of the Asian market will do little to improve the prospects for those who believe British Coal's redemption will be through a sustained export campaign. What pickings there will be over the next 12 months will be lean and cheap.</p>

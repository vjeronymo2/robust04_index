			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Brussels plans crackdown on industrial piracy THE European Commission yesterday proposed wide-ranging measures to protect industrial designs in order to prevent trade piracy and to strengthen the single market. The new rules, which must be approved by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament, cover electronics, furniture, fashion and the controversial market in industrial spare parts. The Commission proposals are linked to an expanding Brussels effort to harmonise national rules covering trademarks, copyright, and intellectual property, supported when necessary by Community-wide legislation. The Commission said new legislation was necessary because national laws on design protection varied widely. It said: 'Superior design is an important instrument for European industries in their competition with industries from third countries having lower production costs.' Under the new initiative, member states will be asked to support a new Community Design Office which will offer protection throughout the EC. National design rights will not be abolished, but the goal is that the EC design will gradually supersede them. The Commission proposed that industrial designs with an 'individual character' will be eligible for EC-wide protection from counterfeiters for five years, renewable up to a maximum of 25 years. Industries such as fashion which produce large numbers of designs with a short shelf life can apply for a weaker form of protection called Unregistered Community Design. This would apply for a maximum of three years, and would exist once the design was made available to the public. The Commission took a more controversial decision on the level of protection to be offered to spare parts for cars. Under the Brussels proposal, spare parts would receive only three years' protection from the date a model comes on to the market. The decision represents a victory for commissioners such as Sir Leon Brittan who argued that greater protection would restrict competition and raise costs to consumers; but it is a setback for large car companies such as Fiat and VW which wanted broader protection for items such as bonnets or bumpers whose design is dictated by the car's overall appearance. Commission officials hope to introduce legislation within the next two years. The initiative follows extensive consultations.</p>

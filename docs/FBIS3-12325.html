			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Assembly has strongly condemned  Friday's ugly Zionist crime against our Palestinian Arab people.    In a statement, the assembly stressed that in the name of  the  Iraqi people, it denounces that terrorist, racist crime. It  urged the international community, the United Nations, the  Security Council, and the Arab League to assume their historic  and human responsibilities in order to provide protection for  the Palestinian Arab people in the occupied territories and to  ensure their right to self-determination.    The assembly urged world humanitarian organizations to stand  up against Zionist racism and terrorist practices in the  occupied territory against the defenseless Palestinian people.  It urged Arab people everywhere to close their ranks and forge  a broad Arab front against defeatists, those running behind the  U.S. mirage and spiteful dreams, and those anxiously seeking to  join the capitulatory settlements that have led to further  deterioration in the Arab situation.    Praising the heroic stand of the Palestinian revolutionaries  everywhere, the assembly stressed that Arab unity can be  achieved only through the full recognition of the Palestinian  Arab people's rights to their territory and water, not through  defeatism, retreat, and behind-the-scenes plans</p>

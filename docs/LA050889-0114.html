			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMWAY CORP. STILL PONDERING BUYOUT OF BIG RIVAL AVON  </P> <P> GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.-Amway Corp. still hasn't decided if it will pursue  acquisition of its larger rival in the direct sales business, Avon Products  Inc., one of Amway's founders said today.  </P> <P> Amway, a large direct seller of personal and home products, has purchased more  than 10% of Avon common stock in the last month, in partnership with a  Minneapolis-based investor, Irwin L. Jacobs.  </P> <P> Jay Van Andel, co-founder of Amway, based in Ada, Mich., told the Grand Rapids  Economic Club today that an acquisition would have to benefit both companies.  </P> <P> He compared Amway's position to that of a diver who walks out on the diving  board "and has to decide whether to make a swan dive . . . or a belly flop. We  haven't made that decision yet. We're still on the board looking around.  </P> <P> "If we were to decide to make the plunge . . . the plunge would have to be good  for Amway as a company and Avon as a company," Van Andel said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> More than $240,000 was raised for AIDS research, education and patient care  Sunday at an Art Against AIDS/Los Angeles auction held at Butterfield &amp;  Butterfield. The auction brings the total raised by the two-year Art Against  AIDS campaign -- which has included events in Los Angeles, New York and San  Francisco -- to nearly $5 million. "We were absolutely delighted," Sally  Morrison, director of development for the American Foundation for AIDS  Research, said Monday. She noted that proceeds from the auction will be split  equally between AmFAR and AIDS Project Los Angeles. The top price at the  auction, which included works by Richard Diebenkorn, Laddie John Dill, Larry  Bell and Carlos Almaraz, was generated by a David Hockney lithograph, "Walking  Past Two Chairs," which went for $65,000.

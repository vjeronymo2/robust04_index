			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Jansons sparkles with the LPO Within a couple of hours of the Arts Council making its final proclamation on the funding for London's orchestras, the London Philharmonic was taking its place on the platform at the Royal Festival Hall. The orchestra must have felt like bringing forward its end-of-season performance of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. In fact, the concert was a modest occasion. Mariss Jansons, since last autumn Principal Guest Conductor, was in charge of a standard classical programme, comprising overture, concerto and symphony (almost a rarity these days). From this concert it would seem that the orchestra has decided to let him roam further afield than before. Jansons has become so highly regarded for his interpretation of Russian and Scandinavian music that he has rarely been allowed to conduct anything else by the London orchestras. Every concert has featured music from within a few hours' train or boat ride of his native Latvia; Schubert and Mozart must seem to entail a long journey. Any fear that he would lose his customary ebullience on the way was quickly set aside. Schubert's Overture in the Italian style sparkled with brilliance. Even in Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto it was the conductor and orchestra who were the focus of attention, rather than the soloist Mikhail Rudy, who sat amid playing of dramatic fire without the heat seeming to touch him. The high quality of his musicianship was only partial compensation. The Mozart was Symphony No 41, brilliant again in the Jansons manner, while staying within accepted notions of classical style. The conductor's spruce handling of orchestral ensemble worked well in this symphony. Under Jansons a crochet or quaver is just that, never longer, often trimmed slightly short. When no note is allowed to overlap with another, the effect is of sharpness and clarity, and every part in Mozart's complex finale was easy to hear. In retrospect, it is difficult to imagine how the Arts Council could have justified starving one or two of London's orchestras of funds. When the LPO is playing as well as it did for Jansons, it is within reach of the international standard the bureaucrats crave. Then there is the Philharmonia, forging exciting artistic alliances, staking a prime place for itself on the international stage in Paris and Salzburg. Each has made - and won - its case.

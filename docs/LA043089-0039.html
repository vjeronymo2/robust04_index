			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Goldstein's articles indicated that there is a shortage of black writers.  Actually, there isn't a shortage of black writers, merely a shortage of  opportunities.  </P> <P> Without proper representation there is no way for a writer, black or white, to  gain access to the Hollywood community.  </P> <P> The real dilemma starts with literary agents. Most of the major literary  agencies won't represent black writers. They feel that our product isn't  commercial enough, that since we are a minority we write about the minority  experience and the agencies don't envision this as marketable (unless it's a  comedy). Thus we have films such as "Mississippi Burning" and "Cry Freedom,"  told through the eyes of whites.  </P> <P> PRESTON A. WHITMORE II  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

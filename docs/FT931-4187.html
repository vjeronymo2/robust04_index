			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Clinton cabinet completed PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's cabinet was completed yesterday when the Senate unanimously approved the nomination of Ms Janet Reno to be the first woman attorney-general of the US. She will be sworn into office within the next day or two. The 54-year-old state prosecutor from Miami, Florida, had sailed through two days of hearings without controversy, but also diplomatically revealing little about her views on some of the difficult questions confronting the justice department. These range from deciding whether to retain Judge William Sessions as head of the FBI to the continued use of special prosecutors in such cases as Iran-Contra. She satisfied Democrats by her commitment to civil rights, environmental protection and gun control, and pleased Republicans with her tough approach to control of crime.</p>

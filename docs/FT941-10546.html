			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Police scrutinise futures markets The National Criminal Intelligence Service is investigating possible activities including money-laundering by organised crime on London's futures markets. The investigation, which started four months ago, was undertaken with the co-operation of London's five futures exchanges including the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and the London Metal Exchange (LME). It was prompted by concern that futures markets in London could be vulnerable to criminal activities such as money laundering, as they have been in the US and other markets, rather than because of any individual cases. Det Insp Graham Saltmarsh, head of NCIS's organised crime unit, described the undertaking as an overview, prompted by anecdotal information. New money-laundering regulations form part of the criminal justice act which comes into force on April 1. This will place much more onerous responsibilities on parties that are unwittingly involved in money laundering. Mr Hamish Ramsay, legal counsel for the Futures and Options Association, the futures industry trade body, said: 'The new regulations will assist in tightening controls for second and third-tier institutions and this will have a positive effect on the futures and options industry in the UK.' The association is holding seminars on the issue of money-laundering. On futures exchanges individual member firms, such as brokers and banks, buy and sell futures contracts on behalf of clients. The exchanges do not, however, know the identity of these clients. Consequently the paper trail may be hard to follow. If the examination shows that money-laundering is occurring, it might be possible to change the structure of exchanges to block this route. Det Insp Saltmarsh said: 'We are not just interested in feeling collars but in disrupting organised crime.' According to Mr Richard Parlour, a legal expert at Clifford Chance, a minimum of Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) of dirty cash is believed to enter the world's financial system every year. The NCIS also said that at a later stage it might investigate whether organised crime had penetrated the toxic waste industry. 'It has happened on the Continent and in the US, although there is no evidence it has happened here,' it said. The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors said the NCIS's fears seemed 'highly unlikely - there are too many checks on waste management these days'.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Engineer body urges bolder reforms INTERIM proposals for unifying the engineering profession have been criticised by one of the big three institutions for being 'insufficiently bold and imaginative' as the debate over the profession's future moves into a crucial phase. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which has 78,000 members, was responding to interim proposals announced in August by a steering group set up after Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, launched a personal initiative to reform and unify the profession. The reform programme has created widespread interest, as many engineers feel the current structure, with the Engineering Council as an umbrella body for 44 professional institutions, has failed to revitalise the profession or adequately represent their views. The steering group proposed a structure based on 'colleges' elected by members, which would sit between the institutions and a new top body appointed by the colleges. Alternatively, it proposed a directly elected top body. Now the institution says that, while it supports the need for unification, including the present initiative, it is disappointed by the reform proposals. They 'lack a clear vision statement' and go into too much detail. The institution's stance underlines the difficulties faced by the steering group in reconciling differing views on the future of the profession. The big institutions are keen to preserve their influence and the institution says it cannot envisage a workable structure where all the present institutions are given more or less equal influence. Yesterday Sir John said he was encouraged by the institution's call for a bold approach. He noted that Professor Duncan Dowson, institution president, was also a member of the steering group. The institutions have been given until November 10 to respond to the proposals. Sir John said the shape of final proposals would probably be determined by discussions over the next two months.</p>

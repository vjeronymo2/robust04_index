			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BID speculation, and vague hopes that today's Bundesbank council meeting may bring a cut in German interest rates, boosted trading in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Buyers of the June FT-SE 100 futures contract were in evidence early in the session. Having opened at 2,875, just ahead of the previous night's close, June moved steadily ahead for the rest of the morning, with overseas institutions, said to believe the UK market was undervalued, reported to have been among the buyers. A poor opening on Wall Street subsequently unnerved the futures, causing a temporary decline, but a squeeze later in the afternoon pushed June to the day's high of 2,891. Profit-taking approaching the close left June finishing at 2,888, up 15 from Tuesday's close and some 11 points above its fair value premium to cash of around 8 points. Turnover improved from recent levels, reaching 8,472 lots. The volume in traded options continued to increase and totalled 29,560 contracts. Both the FT-SE 100 option and the Euro FT-SE option were busy and traded 9,074 and 5,594 lots respectively. Wellcome, one of the day's strong performers in the equity market, was the most active among the stock options and had a total of 1,510 contracts dealt. It was followed by Hanson, in which 1,307 lots were transacted.</p>

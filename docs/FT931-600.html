			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Mitterrand keen to make mark on the new team ONCE the final tally of votes in yesterday's parliamentary election is proclaimed this morning, France will move on to the other issues which will determine its political fortunes for the next two years - the choice of the prime minister and the cabinet. The conservatives' victory has been regarded as a foregone conclusion for so long that President Francois Mitterrand has had plenty of time to mull over the various contenders for the premiership. In theory he has a free choice, but in practice he must choose a candidate who can command a majority in parliament. The first step towards announcement of the new French premier will be the resignation of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the present incumbent. He is expected this morning to go to the Elysee Palace to tender his resignation personally to the president. Mr Mitterrand has traditionally tended to disclose the name of the new prime minister later on the same day; he did so in 1986 at the start of the last cohabitation government, when he announced in the evening his choice of Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR party. The president has an empty agenda today. But he may wish to delay announcing any decision either because he is genuinely undecided or because, characteristically, he wants to keep the conservatives on tenterhooks. The only constraint is that he must appoint a premier in time for the first session of the National Assembly on Friday, which means he has to make his choice by Wednesday evening at the latest. The next step will be the selection of the new cabinet. Mr Edouard Balladur, still the favourite for prime minister, is said to have drawn up a preliminary list. But the eventual premier will consult with senior figures in the RPR and UDF before finalising his choice. Moreover, the new cabinet must also be approved by Mr Mitterrand. The president objected in 1986 to Mr Chirac's suggested candidates for foreign affairs and defence, both of which are not only important portfolios but also areas where the president traditionally wields great influence. The president is almost certain to object to at least one of the new prime minister's suggestions this time, if only because he will consider it critical that he exerts his influence as quickly as possible over the new cohabitation government. He will also be anxious to use his power over the choice of cabinet members to exploit any potential rifts between the conservative parties on sensitive issues such as foreign policy, where the RPR is more chauvinistic than the UDF. The next important date is Friday, when the new National Assembly will meet for the first time and appoint its next president to replace the Socialist Mr Henri Emmanuelli. The constitution stipulates that new parliaments must begin either on October 2 or April 2, to avoid the ignominy of a new French government starting on April Fool's Day, or jour de poisson as it is called in France.</p>

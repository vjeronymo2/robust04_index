			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets JOHANNESBURG Investors will be hoping that last week's falls, following the resignation of the respected finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, will prove transient and the long bull market will resume its upward trend, writes Mark Suzman. After outperforming all other major bourses in the three months to June, Mr Keys' sudden departure pushed the Johannesburg market into reverse. However, with a competent and reliable successor named, former banker Mr Christo Liebenberg, brokers will be hoping that the focus shifts away from government and back to the anticipated flow of foreign funds to the market following its recent inclusion on some important emerging market indices. Helping the return to normality will be the announcement of the latest quarterly results from the country's gold industry. Gold Fields, one of the big mining houses, will be reporting its June quarter results today. Analysts caution that although the weaker rand will have helped production, its effect will have been offset by work stoppages at major mines over the election period. 'Absolutely impossible to gauge,' says Mr Bruce Williamson of JD Anderson. FRANKFURT Shares in Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, were under pressure on Friday ahead of eight-month figures due to be announced today. At the half-way stage, the group reported a 16 per cent fall in domestic sales, offset by strengthening foreign business which left group net earnings flat. Karstadt, the retailer, holds its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday. Last month, Germany's biggest retailer following the recent purchase of Hertie, reported that group turnover in the first five months of this year soared by 31.7 per cent. ZURICH Six-month sales figures could be on the way from Roche late this week or early next, with analysts forecasting group sales, expressed in local currencies, to have risen by 10 to 12 per cent in the first half, after a 12 per cent increase in the first quarter. Expressed in the relatively strong Swiss franc, first-half sales should have risen by 5 to 6 per cent. An 18 per cent increase in net profit is forecast for 1994. Last week, Roche certificates tumbled after Mr Andrew Tiverton at James Capel in London downgraded the issue to a hold after five years on the buy list. MILAN The market will be hoping to regain some momentum after publication, promised for mid-week, of the long delayed details of the government's budget proposals. The market also looked fragile towards the end of last week after rumours, subsequently denied, of government splits and ministerial resignations. Directors of Ciga are expected to bring to an end the battle for control of the hotels group tomorrow by handing over effective control to ITT, the US group which owns the Sheraton hotel chain and which has a direct stake of only 17.4 per cent. MADRID Second-quarter results are expected from Banco Popular tomorrow. Hoare Govette views the bank as possibly the most compelling buy case in the European banking sector. By concentrating almost exclusively on domestic retail business which offers the most attractive terms within the banking industry, Popular has avoided diluting its returns by diversifying into lower yielding activities and markets. Far from rendering it more vulnerable to competitive pressures, this tight focus gives Popular a significant competitive advantage, the broker says. TOKYO Investor confidence will largely remain dependent on the strength of the yen against the US dollar, as a higher Japanese currency is seen as a threat to economic recovery and to the competitiveness of the country's exporters, writes Emiko Terazono. Economic data expected this week will provide evidence that the country's recovery remains weak. In spite of a record low official discount rate, the benefits of low interest rates are barely filtering down to the real economy, since bank lending rates are still high due to the rise in long-term bond yields. Meanwhile, with most investors sidelined in such an unpromising environment, trading is likely to be dominated by technical activity led by the arbitrageurs. Even overseas investors, who have been the leading supporters of Japanese shares, are starting to take profits to take advantage of the higher yen. Foreign investors were net sellers for the second consecutive week during June 27 to July 1 and traders expect the trend to continue as long as the yen maintains its current level against the dollar.

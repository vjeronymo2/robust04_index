			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, Feb 4 (AFP) -- Turkey and seven countries  neighboring ex-Yugoslavia have agreed to meet Wednesday [9  February] in Geneva with mediators David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg to discuss ways of ending the Bosnian conflict, Owen  said here Friday [4 February].    "It will be a private consultation. No communiques, no  decisions. An open discussion between the ministers about the  problems of the former Yougoslavia, and how regional voice can  be raised to influence the outcome, bring an end to the fighting  in Bosnia," Owen told a news conference. "None of the parties  from the former Yugoslavia will be invited at this stage," he  said, adding that if the talks proved "useful," the mediators  might hold discussions later on "with the presidents of possibly  Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia."    Foreign ministers of the following nations would attend  Wednesday: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy,  Romania, and Turkey. Owen, the European Community's mediator,  who with Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, came here on the last leg  of a tour of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, said the mediators felt  "the European Union initiative and the negotiations over Bosnia  now need to be discussed within the region and also the wider  issues that affect the conference: Serb-Croat relations, the  minorities, the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo."    Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta meanwhile said  Bosnian Croats and Moslems might hold talks Wednesday in Rome.  The talks could take place between the meeting, Monday and  Tuesday, of European Community foreign ministers and Brussels,  and the meeting of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, he said.  Andreatta put the proposal to Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic on Thursday when they met here, he added.    Earlier, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, Owne said  international sanctions against Belgrade over its role in the  war in Bosnia could not continue indefinitely. "We can't go on  indefinitely asking countries quite far away from fighting to  make sacrifices, if there is no readiness of the parties to make  peace," he said. Bulgaria is one of the central European  countries whose trade and economy have been badly hit by the  United Nations embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the rump  Yugoslavia.    "I do not favour lifting sanctions," Owen added. "It would  be  premature. But I don't think the status quo can carry on  indefinitely."    Albania has expressed concern about the war spreading to  Kosovo, the restive northern province of Serbia which has a 90  percent Albanian population, or Macedonia, another former member  of the Yugoslav federation.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Southwest Air flying high SOUTHWEST Airlines, the low-cost Dallas-based carrier which specialises in flying heavily travelled commuter routes, yesterday showed up its larger rivals when it reported a Dollars 23.5m profit after tax in the three months to end-June, writes Nikki Tait. Most of the US airline industry is expected to post losses for the second quarter of 1992, which was beset by aggressive domestic 'fare wars'. But Southwest's profit, scored on revenues of Dollars 416.8m, actually improves on the Dollars 10.5m seen in the same period of 1991. The airline has now made net first-half profits of Dollars 49.5m, against Dollars 2.35m in 1991.</p>

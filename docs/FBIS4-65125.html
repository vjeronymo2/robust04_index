			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henrik Qvortrup: "Ellemann-Jensen Sharpens Tone </F> Toward Progress Party"]    [Text] The Liberal Party chairman totally rejects any idea  of giving the Progress Party the slightest influence over a  future nonsocialist government's foreign policy. He also called  remarks by Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen "indecent."    The Progress Party will not have a scrap of influence on a  future nonsocialist government's foreign, defense, and European  policies.    On this point Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen is  uncompromising. He completely rebuffs [Progress Party chairman]  Pia Kjaersgaard who demanded in INFORMATION that the Progress  Party be given concessions in these fields, if after an election  there is a majority comprising the Liberal Party, the  Conservative People's Party, and the Progress Party.    "I would like to make it crystal clear: They will have no  influence on foreign, security, defense, and European policy.  So there is no reason to waste any more time on this question,"  Uffe Ellemann-Jensen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. The party  chairman also stressed that under no circumstances can there be  any suggestion of a Liberal Party-Conservative People's  Party-Progress Party government. This is another possibility  with which Pia Kjaersgaard has flirted.    "I would like to make it abundantly clear what the objective  is here: We are hoping for a Liberal Party-Conservative  People's Party-Progress Party majority. And on that base we  will form a Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party  government," Ellemann-Jensen said.    At the weekend Radical Liberal Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen warned against a Liberal Party-Conservative People's  Party government which does not in advance have a majority for  its foreign policy. Helveg Petersen hinted that such a  government should not count on the help of the Radical Liberals,  for example.    Ellemann-Jensen called these remarks "indecent and  tasteless."    "These are the best words, because his remarks create  uncertainty about Danish foreign policy. And that is something  that Helveg Petersen as foreign minister should steer well clear  of."    Ellemann-Jensen admitted that the Radical Liberals' votes in  the field of foreign policy could be needed by a possible future  Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party government.    "It it really turns out that the Radical Liberals want to  return to the footnote politics of the eighties they will find  themselves facing an election. And we will see who wins it,"  Ellemann-Jensen said.</p>

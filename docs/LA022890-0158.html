			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITISH TRADE DEFICIT DOUBLED  </P> <P> Britain announced monthly trade figures today that were much worse than  expected, as the country's trade deficit more than doubled in January over the  prior month.  </P> <P> The data showed the deficit on the current account, the widest measure of  Britain's foreign trade, was $3.16 billion, more than double a revised  $1.37-billion gap for December.  </P> <P> Economists had been forecasting a current account deficit of around $2.2  billion for January.  </P> <P> The Central Statistical Office said Britain's monthly current account figures  are proving erratic and suggested that trends over three months give a more  accurate picture.  </P> <P> The office attributed the size of the January gap to a deficit in several  volatile items where a small surplus would have been expected. This reflected  large diamond imports and smaller aircraft exports than had been predicted, it  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Brands of bicycle FOR THE brands of bicycle we remember from childhood it is all change. UK cycle makers have been caught recently in a wave of takeovers. Dawes was bought two years ago by the Dutch group Atag whose main bike brand is Batavus. The UK industrial group Casket, which already controlled Townsend, acquired British Eagle and Falcon. The latter includes the Claud Butler and Holdsworth marques. Derby International which owns the former Raleigh business - Britain's biggest bike maker - has taken over Kalkhoff of Germany (renamed Derby Werk) and is building a factory in eastern Germany. Derby recently failed in an attempt to buy the Peugeot bike business of France. Peugeot then formed an alliance with the Spanish manufacturer, BH, which controls Cycles Gitane in France. Muddy Fox, a UK mountain bike maker is in financial difficulty and is likely to go into new ownership soon.</p>

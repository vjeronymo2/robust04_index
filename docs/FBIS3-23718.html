Loboda, member of the CPSU since 1942: "People </F> View Him as a Leader: A Few Words About Kim Chong-il"]    [Text] A great deal of information is published all  over the world these days about Kim Chong-il. Certain circles do  not stint on throwing a dark cloud over him and attributing to  him characteristics that do not evoke anything likeable.    Who is he really, this person who has been placed in  the highest positions in the Republic by the Korean Labor Party?  Why do real communists look at him with hope and favor, and  renegades with fear and loathing?    Enemies of socialism are frightened because Kim Chong-il, a  strong person with principles, embodies socialist strivings and  the decisiveness of the Korean people, and he is a true son of  the Korean people. They are frightened that every practical  activity and theoretical work by Kim Chong-il expresses  socialist ideas and the greatest strength of the Korean nation.  His image has imbedded itself deeply into the consciousness of  Koreans and has become as beloved to them as the image of his  father.    Foes are scared because in less than half a century the  country, led by Kim Il-song, and in the last decades by Kim  Chong-il, has become a reliable stronghold of socialism on our  planet. The invincible socialist system in the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], a party that is true to  communism, powerful armed forces, an impressive economy, and  nationwide popular support of its leaders and a deep and sincere  respect for them, have all become obvious facts.    We see in the DPRK a new form of socialist organization for  society and a country that has found its own road to socialism.  Imperialists and their accomplices--renegades of every sort--are  afraid of socialist Korea's influence on millions of people of  this Earth.    Together with Kim Chong-il, a new generation is taking over  the leadership of the party and the country. Kim Chong-il has  devoted a great deal of effort in bringing up and educating this  generation. This generation has a passion for action and a zeal  for new undertakings. It is against routine, sluggishness,  inertia, and indecisiveness. The energy and initiative of this  new generation are blended with the rich experience, knowledge,  and prudence of its predecessors.    History has given Kim Chong-il an enormous role, and at the  same time a great responsibility, but not just for the future of  his country. Pyongyang has become the center of unity for the  world's socialist forces. The Pyongyang Declaration, which has  already been accepted by over 200 political parties of the  world, is having an ever greater influence over mankind.  Everyone who has eyes can see how the forces of socialism are  getting over the shock caused by the treachery of renegades, and  how these socialist forces are growing in strength. Socialism  now does not simply exist, but is fighting and winning.    All this explains the increased interest in Kim Chong-il.  Neither blockades nor outright bans can hide the truth about  this leader and his written works. Every honest person sees the  image of a man for whom the happiness and well-being of his  people are more important than anything else in the world.    From a very early age he devoted his life entirely to the  cause of the revolution. In the quarter of a century since he  finished his university studies, he has gone through all the  stages of party organizational work and executive duties. He had  started as a rank-and-file instructor in one of the departments  of the Central Committee of the WPK [Workers' Party of Korea].  During these years he acquired a great deal of political  experience. His family environment also facilitated his gaining  this experience.    Kim Chong-il did not become simply a successor to his  father,  Kim Il-song, but the continuator of his father's  deeds. He kept up the creative development of communist theory  in accordance with the new conditions that came about as a  result of changes in society and society's scientific  achievements, including the achievements of the Korean people,  who belong to one of the oldest civilizations. This is why it is  unthinkable to separate Kim Il-songism, as a science, from its  continuator, Kim Chong-il.    From the very beginning, Kim Chong-il attached great  significance to moral education and to transforming all of  society on the basis of the ideas of chuche. This was timely,  not only because new tasks were arising in the process of  building socialism. World imperialism was increasing its  subversive work against the DPRK. In addition, it was necessary  to make fundamental assessments of the activities of the  renegades in the worldwide communist movement and to mercilessly  expose the roots of this most harmful phenomenon.    Efforts made in political-educational work, and the  consolidation of a united ideological system in the party and  among the people brought tangible results. Communist  consciousness was raised and the productive initiative of the  workers increased.    Kim Chong-il has devoted many works to problems of ideology  and the leading role of the WPK in ideology. It can be said  about these works and their contents that they constitute a  powerful attack against all forces of reaction, no matter under  what false colors they are hiding. The correctness of the  assessments and prognoses in these works has been confirmed by  the entire course of development of both the DPRK and other  countries.    As a writer, I understand and embrace Kim Chong-il's  contribution of every art form to leadership. It is difficult to  even enumerate all his important theses presented during  meetings with employees of motion pictures, writers, musicians,  and artists. Kim Chong-il comprehensively enlightened the roles  of these people and the intelligentsia in general in the  building of socialism. He charted an original course for  completing a radical revolution that guaranteed the present  flowering of artistry in motion pictures, literature, the stage,  and concert halls. In Kim Chong-il's pronouncements, especially  those given to motion picture employees, the following theses  can be noted: Art should not fear an exaggeration of the good,  so that this good can become even better. Also, art should not  fear an exaggeration of a bad, depraved person, so that this  exaggeration can evoke repulsion and ignite a striving to  eliminate everything hateful and shameful.    Readers of Kim Chong-il's works are favorably impressed by  the author's deep belief that by virtue of the objective laws of  historical development, socialism cannot be destroyed by any  alliances or blocs between renegades and imperialists. Day  always triumphs over night. Kim Chong-il is convinced that  gigantic forces are concealed within socialism, and that  socialism is capable of creating the most just society about  which the best minds of man have always dreamed.    Kim Chong-il's works also clearly demonstrate comprehensive  understanding that in given circumstances certain things for  which there is enough strength can be done and should be done.  The leader of the Korean people has proclaimed himself  uncompromising, he will not make concessions concerning  principles and problems on which the fate of the nation and the  success of socialism depend. It is not in his character to turn  down plans that had been approved, no matter how difficult they  may be. Kim Chong-il is convinced that every person, even one  who believes himself to be weak, has hidden strength and  potential. In order to bring them out, it is necessary for a  person to understand that he has them, and it is necessary to  motivate him with the all-conquering ideas of  chuche. Kim Chong-il is characterized by the strength of his  mind and his penetrating knowledge that allows him to quickly  and faultlessly analyze events, tell the difference between  people, and to assess everyone and use everyone in accordance  with his abilities. He openly talks about shortcomings and  errors, being convinced that the right way does not need to hide  anything and does not need to distort facts.    And there is something else: Kim Chong-il expresses his  thoughts in speaking and writing always in the most precise,  direct, clear, and short form. His analyses are penetrating. His  conclusions are based on facts. He expresses his thoughts  simply, convincingly, and spiritedly. This is because Kim  Chong-il frequently mixes with people from very different  professions, acquiring from them the habit for this style.    Notwithstanding his immense popularity among his people and  the respect given him in the DPRK, he has remained a modest and  unpretentious man, fierce and implacable towards his foes, but  touchingly attentive to his comrades and to working people. Kim  Chong-il presents identical moral criteria to himself and to the  rank-and-file. He believes that there should be no privileges or  exceptions for anyone with regard to morality.    Kim Chong-il's theory and practice, based on the great ideas  of chuche, are highly valued and approved by the world communist  movement. He is seen as a true communist leader who is firm and  independent, and who can resolve the most revolutionary problems  out of all the problems that now face the revolutionaries of the  world. Kim Chong-il is the hope not only of Koreans, but all  other progressive peoples of this Earth.</p>

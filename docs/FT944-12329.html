			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Postal sell-off hinges on appeasement: The Tory rebels' objections to the privatisation of the Royal Mail Conservative backbench rebels were last night studying complex fresh proposals by Mr Michael Heseltine for a partial privatisation of the Post Office. But with little more than a week before the cabinet finalises legislation for the next session of parliament, it was still unclear whether the trade and industry secretary had appeased enough Tory MPs to allow a part sell-off in 1995. The proposals, which involve a 40 per cent sell-off of the Royal Mail and the transfer of another 20 per cent of the shares to a new independent trust, will appeal to those MPs opposed to the private sector holding a majority stake. But the plans will do little to change the mind of those who are opposed to privatising the Royal Mail on principle. Even before he met Mr Heseltine to discuss the proposals, Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, signalled that he would oppose any flotation. 'If Michael Heseltine goes for a 40 per cent private stake in the Post Office that would net the Treasury Pounds 450m,' he said. 'But in the next financial year, the Post Office would net Pounds 280m in its current state. Is it all really worth it?' Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East and one of the most prominent rebels, also made clear yesterday that he would not be prepared to see anything more than a small sale of shares, mainly directed at employees. Such implacability underlines how difficult it has been for Mr Heseltine to win over Tory MPs with deep fears about the privatisation. With the government's majority in the Commons down to 14, he has made numerous concessions. Earlier this year, he gave assurances that the cost of sending mail would be kept within limits and that there would be a common charge throughout the UK. He has also insisted that the Post Office Counters section would remain in the public sector, assuring the continuation of village post offices. And he has guaranteed that the quality of service would be maintained. But the MPs with whom Mr Heseltine is negotiating have deep-seated reservations that will be hard to allay. One group is made up of Conservative MPs in the West Country who fear that privatisation would be deeply unpopular with their constituents. These MPs - who include Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, and Mr David Nicholson, MP for Taunton - argue that the privatisation of water and electricity in the region proved unpopular and that a further sell-off would be unacceptable. Mr Hicks said: 'Privatisation of any utility in my area is not flavour of the month.' A second group - which includes Mr Dykes and Sir Peter Emery, the MP for Honiton - are on the centre-left of the party and are opposed to Post Office privatisation on principle. Sir Peter said yesterday: 'I do not see why greater commercialism should not be given without privatising the whole thing.' The third group, and the most difficult to appease, includes those who have opposed contentious legislation before and have little to lose by voting against the government again. Among these rebels are Mr Winterton and Mr Patrick Cormack, the MP for Staffordshire South. This group is opposed to commercialisation of any sort. But Tory whips privately admitted that the best chance of getting legislation through would be to reduce the size of the sell-off and change the Treasury's borrowing rules. It looked last night as though that could work. Mr Hicks said: 'As long as the Post Office remains in the public sector and you lift the Treasury constraints to achieve commercial freedom, I would not find an injection of private-sector capital a problem. But the important thing is that it remains in the public sector for the time being.'</p>

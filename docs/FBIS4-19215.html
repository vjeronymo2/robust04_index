			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino Says Government Imminent"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 13 -- Italy's new government will  be formed "very, very shortly" in the view of Antonio Martino, a  Friedmanite economist and chief architect of Silvio Berlusconi's  free-market, tax-cutting economic platform.    "I think that the timeframe for the creation of the new  executive will be very short indeed; the programme is already  being vetted by the coalition," said the newly elected Forza  Italia MP on the sidelines of a conference here.    Asked about his own immediate future, the man touted by many  to hold a key economic post in the next government quipped:  "Those who predict catastrophes suffer twice over, but I'm  certainly about to give my last university lecture."    Before his involvement in politics, Martino was best-known  as  a comparatively lone voice in spreading Milton Friedman's  monetarist theories from his post at a Rome private university,  Luiss.    President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- who summoned Berlusconi  for  talks this morning -- is expected to give the Forza Italia  leader a mandate to form an executive after the House speakers  are elected, on Friday [15 April] or Saturday.</p>

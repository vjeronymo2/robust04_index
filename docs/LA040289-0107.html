			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DERAILED BY MOMMY TRACK?;  </P> <P> BYPASSED FOR TOP STATE COURT, BENKE SPEAKS OUT ON FAMILY AND CAREER  </P> <P> Justice Patricia Benke is sitting at her desk, below a smiling, autographed  picture of Gov. George Deukmejian, insisting she is not washed up. It is odd  she feels compelled to do so.  </P> <P> Benke is, after all, something of a wunderkind. Ever since Deukmejian named her  to the Municipal Court bench in mid-1983, Benke has powered through the  judicial ranks at a dazzling pace. Today, at 39, she is the youngest member and  only woman on the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego.  </P> <P> But last month, Benke was bypassed for a seat on the California Supreme Court.  And, although that news was a blow, the aftermath has been almost tougher to  stomach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Not Have Moved  </P> <P> The trouble started when Justice Marcus Kaufman remarked that Benke, widely  viewed as the favorite among four candidates for the prestigious post, may well  have lost the job because she refused to uproot her family and move to San  Francisco, where the court is based.  </P> <P> The governor's office will not confirm whether Benke's unwillingness to  relocate was, indeed, the deciding strike against her, and the justice herself  says it's all a mystery to her. Nonetheless, the possibility that it played a  pivotal role has created quite a stir.  </P> <P> In particular, Kaufman's observation provoked a rousing debate: Had Pat Benke  been relegated to the "mommy track"?  </P> <P> "After Justice Kaufman made that comment, people from all over started sending  me articles on this mommy track thing," Benke said in a recent interview. "I  had no idea the sensitive chord that was struck out there. It just exploded."  </P> <P> The mommy track concept was outlined in January in the Harvard Business Review  by veteran feminist Felice Schwartz, who suggested that some working mothers  might sacrifice a degree of career advancement and compensation in exchange for  flexible hours. The proposition has since been subject to a bitter assault by  those who contend such a track would institutionalize unequal treatment of  women in the workplace.  </P> <P> After Justice Kaufman's remark, Benke was deluged with requests for interviews,  as well as invitations to appear on television talk shows around California. A  few colleagues -- persuaded by all the speculation -- grumbled that it was  "unfair." Women lawyers groups throughout the state also took an interest.  </P> <P> The hubbub over Benke all but stole the spotlight from the true woman of the  hour -- Los Angeles Appellate Court Justice Joyce Kennard, Deukmejian's choice  to succeed retiring associate Justice John Arguelles.  </P> <P> Benke, meanwhile, was beginning to feel uncomfortable.  </P> <P> At first, she said that, if her desire to commute to the high court job had  tipped the scales against her, then it was "an absolutely legitimate" reason.  Although Benke stands by that statement today, the justice has come to sense  she might have "given off the wrong signal" -- or led people to believe that  she has in fact been mommy-tracked and it's just dandy with her.  </P> <P> For the record, she hasn't and it's not.  </P> <P> "I woke up and said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on out there in the world. Am  I pushing myself into a position of saying, 'Well, I'm just going to raise my  children now and go to plays and bake blueberry muffins?'  </P> <P> "That's not where I see myself at all," Benke said emphatically. "I'm 39 years  old. I plan on being around for a long time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Traditional Mom'  </P> <P> Benke calls herself "a fairly traditional mom," and she is unswervingly  committed to her husband, Don, and two young sons. But all the mommy track talk  made her uneasy -- worried that "people might think I was removing myself from  consideration for something else."  </P> <P> "The way this was being portrayed, I was afraid there was this perception I had  cut off my career," she said. "I can roll with the punches, but I'm certainly  not ready to sit back and retire."  </P> <P> As the news spread, speculation became contagious. Court watchers and  feminists, who had tabbed Benke as the favorite because she was the only  contender on the governor's list when he last made appointments to the court in  1987, began offering their own, often conflicting speculation.  </P> <P> Some say the governor may have been justifiably leery of appointing another  justice whose home base was outside the Bay Area. Arguelles, who stepped down  after just two years on the court, said the burden of commuting and being  separated from his family in Orange County was substantial. Both Chief Justice  Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson travel by plane on weekends to  their homes in Southern California, and some scholars have warned that the  strain of such commutes coupled with the court's heavy workload could  contribute to early "burnout."  </P> <P> "It is a very onerous job, and many of those who have tried commuting have  found it does not work for them personally," said San Diego Superior Court  Judge Judith McConnell, immediate past president of the National Assn. of Women  Judges. "Clearly, the governor wants to appoint people who are going to stay  there for a significant length of time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deciding Point  </P> <P> Given that goal, and given the governor's knowledge that commuters have  complained of "an unhappy marriage between work and home life," Benke's  decision not to relocate "may have been the telling mark against her,"  McConnell said.  </P> <P> "None of my contacts with the governor's office have indicated he's prejudiced  against mothers," McConnell said. "I'm unwilling to say there was a double  standard at work. I haven't seen it in other appointments."  </P> <P> Others have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Benke's desire to stay in  San Diego might have stacked the odds against her.  </P> <P> The president of California Women Lawyers, Los Angeles attorney Janice  Kamenir-Reznik, said it would be "an inappropriate sort of invasion into  someone's personal life to mandate how close they live to their job if they are  in fact qualified for the job.  </P> <P> "The only question is, can they be at work and are they capable of conducting  the work they need to conduct," Kamenir-Reznik said. "That's the only thing  relevant, not the age of the children, or how supportive her husband and baby  sitter are."  </P> <P> Kamenir-Reznik stressed that she has no evidence other than "scuttlebutt" to  suggest that the governor chose Kennard because she was willing to move to San  Francisco and Benke was not. And she lauded Kennard, 47, as "an excellent  choice."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the suggestion that the commute factor was decisive stirred  considerable debate in feminist legal circles. Many argued that, if Lucas and  Eagleson live outside the Bay Area and make long treks to work, then Benke also  could have pulled it off.  </P> <P> "People are talking a lot about it," Kamenir-Reznik said. "It's been a hot  topic coming as it did on the heels of that mommy track article."  </P> <P> After learning that Deukmejian had passed her over in favor of Kennard, Benke  spent a while pondering the episode alone in the quiet of her sixth-floor  chambers, surrounded by family pictures and colorful artwork contributed by her  two boys, Michael, 7, and Pete, 5. The mood was contemplative, laden with  disappointment.  </P> <P> "It was interesting because, the first time through, I was a long shot . . .  and this time there was this expectation out there," Benke said. "I had to find  a way emotionally to let go of it, to get rid of the trappings."  </P> <P> It took a few days. There was a leisurely fishing trip with her son, lots of  second guessing, a ton of "what ifs."  </P> <P> Would the job have been hers if she had persuaded her husband, Don, a  production supervisor at KPBS, to abandon their sprawling, custom-built home  near San Diego State University for a new life in the Bay Area?  </P> <P> "I don't know," Benke said, "I just don't know."  </P> <P> Was it wrong to tell the governor's office that, if appointed, she would be  reluctant to spend more than three days a week away from her family?  </P> <P> "I felt I had to be honest," Benke said. "If I were a different person, I could  say, 'No problem. I'll leave my kids with the housekeeper.' But that's not me.  There are people out there who probably can't understand that, because they  would give all the fingers on their left hand and right for the opportunity to  go for it, to say this is what I want and everything around me will adjust.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't do that."  </P> <P> Did that place her at a competitive disadvantage from the get-go?  </P> <P> No one said it was a liability, "but I think I knew from the beginning it was,"  Benke said. "If you've got somebody who says, 'My bags are packed and if the  call comes, I'm gone. I'll give 110%.' And you've got another person who says,  'I'd love the job. I'll do my best. But I need to tell you, this is my  limitation.'  </P> <P> "What do you do? Your highest priority has to be what's good for the court."  </P> <P> Finally, there's one other possibility to confront: "Maybe they just liked  Joyce better than me?"  </P> <P> Despite the angst of the moment, Benke is upbeat about her career, her life. It  is time, she said, to "really dig in here and concentrate," to develop a  writing style and a judicial philosophy, to make a mark on the Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> Benke acknowledges that she still has her eye on a state Supreme Court job,  which she calls "an incredible opportunity" and something that "someone who  loves the law just doesn't pass up."  </P> <P> "Will it happen? Maybe someday. I don't know. It's one of those things that  really is in the laps of the gods."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990 CENSUS QUESTIONS  </P> <P> April 1 was the deadline for the census and the inquiry has been superficial.  </P> <P> I have an office in which I work daily, and I have an abode where I reside and  sleep nights, and I am in the phone book. I have yet to see or talk to anyone  from the Census Bureau. I have not received any literature as yet.  </P> <P> I have talked to many people with the same story. How can we rely, with full  faith, in the numbers expounded by the Census Bureau?  </P> <P> RICHARD FUSILIER  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

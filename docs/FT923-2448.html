			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Top bosses seek work consensus AN ATTEMPT to create an industrial consensus based on the idea of flexibility for employers and job security plus involvement for employees was launched yesterday with the backing of several senior industrialists and union leaders. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, Mr David Sainsbury, deputy chairman of J. Sainsbury, and Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, were among supporters of the initiative launched by the Involvement and Participation Association. It was also backed by senior personnel directors at ICI and Unilever. The main proposals, which have emerged from private discussions between industrialists, union leaders and academics over the past two years, include: Making employment security the cornerstone of employment policy but linking it with job flexibility. Commitment to sharing success with the whole workforce. Recognising employees' right to be informed, consulted and represented whether they are in a union or not. Sir Bryan acknowledged that employers and unions would have difficulty in accepting parts of the document. The employment security commitment is likely to be especially difficult for employers, and some unions will find it difficult to give implicit support for German-style works councils and other forms of employee participation, which are seen as bypassing unions. The association is asking for responses from companies, unions and other groups. Unemployment has risen more than 70 per cent in the past two years, more than any other country in Europe, according to Ms Joyce Quin, a member of Labour's employment team. The monthly unemployment figures today are expected to show a 20,000-plus rise from the previous 2.75m, taking unemployment near 9 per cent.</p>

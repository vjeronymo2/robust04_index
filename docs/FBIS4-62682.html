			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 16 May (TURAN)--On the evening of May 15, the  police vacated the building of the AZADLIQ editorial office  which was controlled for the entire day.    The previous day, the police told the employees of the  newspaper that Baku's mayor, Rafael Alakhverdiyev, issued a  decree stating that the editorial office had to leave the  building.    On May 15, State Advisor, Gabil Guseinli, told Deputy  Ibragim  Ibragimli that "the matter concerning the removal of the  newspaper was adopted by the government and I have nothing to do  with it".    Meanwhile, on May 15 the authorities revoked their own  resolution and the police left the building. On the same day an  employee in of the Presidential staff told TURAN's correspondent  that "the resolution concerning the removal has been annulled".  However, Baku's mayor also issued a decree concerning the  evacuation by the independent TURAN agency, Centre for Strategic  Researches, Polyglot International Centre, Centre for  Azerbaijan's Democratic Reforms, AZADLIG editorial office from  the building.    On May 14 the closure of independent television channel,  BMT,  was reported which caused severe criticism.    On the next day, 16 of Azerbaijan's political parties  condemned the authorities' activities and demanded an end to  such illegal activities.    It is difficult to say why the authorities changed their  position. But it is clear that the actions by the current  leadership are becoming more and more unreasonable and may lead  to heightened tension.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bank of Thailand may consider squeezing consumer  credit to control inflation which may shoot beyond the target  due to a combination of factors, Wichit Suphinit, the central  bank governor, said yesterday.    He added that the Bank of Thailand may have to revise this  year's projected economic growth and inflation rates due to the  rise in crude oil prices in May.    Due to higher demand as the worldwide economic recovery  continues and the breakout of a war between north and south  Yemen, the price of crude has climbed to US$16.30 per barrel, a  15 per cent rise compared to the start of the year.    The higher crude price could lead to higher inflation and  affect growth as measures are taken to curtail inflation, he  said.    The Bank of Thailand has projected this year's GDP growth at  8.2 per cent and inflation rate under 4.2 per cent.    He said the monetary authorities are considering controlling  consumer credit to halt inflation.    In the first quarter, the credit of banks climbed to a high  of 22.8 per cent compared to the same period last year and above  the projected target of 21.7 per cent.    Without elaborating, the governor said the central bank did  not want to see excessive speculation in stocks and land.    This is the point which the central bank is focusing on to  keep inflation within the target, he said.    But he added that the curb on credit would not be drastic so  as not to lead to higher interest rates. The manufacturing  sector should not shoulder a higher cost of production, he said.    The Bank of Thailand is adopting an early stance in view of  the world economy picking up next year in all categories which  would spur the Thai economy, already performing well even with  the previous worldwide economic doldrums.    Inflation in the first four months was higher than the  target  set by the central bank of 4.7 per cent. Inflation might have  slowed down from March but was still high and of concern.    Banthit Nichathaworn, deputy director of the Research  Department at the Bank of Thailand, said the only major concern  was the price of crude.    The Omani price in May was up 18 per cent from $12.8 per  barrel in March to $15.    The average in the first five months was $13.7 per barrel  which is lower than the projection of $14.7 but there are signs  that the crude price is rising faster.    This could lead to higher production costs in the second  half  of this year for the Thai economy.    The Bank of Thailand is closely monitoring the situation but  is unclear about what the non-Opec member countries will do.</p>

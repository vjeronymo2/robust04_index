			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / BBC plans bi-media staff shake-up THE BBC is pushing ahead with plans to make news and current affairs staff interchangeable between radio and television through the creation of a single management structure. Mr Peter Bell, now editor of television news programmes, will from the beginning of January head all news programmes across radio and television. A new bi-media head of all weekly programmes will be appointed later this year. Mr Tony Hall, managing director of news and current affairs, believes the move will increase efficiency and get more programmes made for the same money. He added: 'There is no increase in management at all. We have re-allocated people's tasks.' Mr Hall became convinced of the wisdom of the bi-media approach the night Mr John Major won the Conservative leadership battle. A television outside-broadcast unit and a radio car were simultaneously dispatched to cover the story. The radio car broke down and the OB unit provided the necessary sound interviews. Mr Hall believes the bi-media policy will lead to 'a free market in ideas' throughout BBC news and current affairs and improve strategic planning across both radio and television. With investigative stories the most appropriate medium will be chosen, he said. A successful radio programme could lead to a television programme. 'I don't see this approach happening at ITV. No one else can do this,' said Mr Hall.</p>

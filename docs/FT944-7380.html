			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Rebels threaten to challenge Major over leadership: Ministers confident of victory in Euro-vote despite backbench revolt The bitter confrontation between Mr John Major and the Tory party's Eurosceptics escalated yesterday as leaders of the anti-Brussels rebellion threatened to turn it into a direct challenge to the prime minister's leadership. The latest bout in the struggle over increased contributions to the European Union followed formal cabinet endorsement of Mr Major's threat to seek a general election if he is defeated in a parliamentary vote on Monday. Despite the continuing defiance of a hard core of Tory Euro-sceptics and an attempt by Labour and the Liberal Democrats to defeat the government, senior ministers insisted last night they were assured of a comfortable victory. On paper, the government's majority is only 14, but Mr Major also expects the backing of 10 unionist MPs from Ulster. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, acknowledged publicly yesterday that a general election was unlikely. Amid signs of irritation among members of the cabinet over the prime minister's handling of the issue, there was less confidence that the row had not further damaged the prime minister's already battered authority. The three leading Eurosceptics in the cabinet - Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley, and Mr John Redwood - publicly supported the tough line over the bill, which Downing Street insisted had been reaffirmed unanimously at yesterday's meeting. But earlier at least one had voiced his misgivings to journalists. Anger on the backbench Tory right prompted speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, might stand in a leadership contest. Mr Lamont has not commented, but Mrs Edwina Currie, a supporter of the prime minister, said she thought he might be planning a challenge. Opponents of Mr Major are seeking the 34 nominations needed by next Wednesday to trigger a leadership contest. They are still short of the required number, but were claiming a groundswell of anger against Mr Major. Advocates of a contest said potential rebels could choose to back the government in the vote on the EU budget but then indicate they had lost confidence in the prime minister by backing a challenge. That brought acknowledgement from cabinet colleagues that a contest was possible. But one senior minister insisted last night the latest storms had strengthened Mr Major's determination to stay. Mr Major drew comfort from the re-election to the chairmanship of the backbench 1922 committee of Sir Marcus Fox. He had been accused of not representing backbench MPs' views forcefully enough to the prime minister. But he beat off a challenge from Eurosceptic Sir Nicholas Bonsor. The effort to turn the dispute into an attack on the prime minister came as Labour and Liberal parties outlined their tactics for Monday's vote. To win support from Tory sceptics, Labour published an amendment which would delay implementation of the financing until the government had acted to reduce fraud and spending on the Common Agricultural Policy. The Liberal Democrats will vote against as the government had made it an issue of confidence. The cabinet's tough line did not prevent one Tory MP from issuing a public Commons challenge. Mr Christopher Gill, a long-standing sceptic, told Mr Major that he would prefer to resign from the parliamentary party than support higher payments to Brussels. Allies of the prime minister, however, admitted their main concern now was heading off a leadership challenge.

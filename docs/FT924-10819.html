			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / O&amp;Y unveils revised debt shake-up OLYMPIA &amp; York plans to divide its assets between four separate companies under a revised debt-restructuring proposal unveiled in Toronto yesterday by the ailing property developer. The plan, includes selling two O&amp;Y buildings in Toronto and Calgary. It also calls for bank lenders to extend a CDollars 50m (Pounds 24m) loan to help the developer attract tenants to its flagship buildings in Toronto's business district. Creditors reacted cautiously to the plan, with some saying that the company has yet to brief them on its details. But the representative of one group of secured creditors said his group would probably be in a better position if it seized the building pledged as collateral for the bonds. The odds of O&amp;Y obtaining the unanimous approval of its creditors have been lengthened however, by expanding the number of creditor groups from 27 to 34. Under an Ontario court order, O&amp;Y must bring its proposals to a vote by the end of November. The court protection granted last May for O&amp;Y's Canadian operations expires on December 30. Under the plan, the Reichmanns would lose control of O&amp;Y's Canadian properties, but would retain a 51 per cent interest in a new company holding O&amp;Y's US interests. Unsecured and undersecured creditors holding about CDollars 4bn in debt could end up owning 90 per cent of Olympia &amp; York Developments, the present parent company, and 49 per cent of the new US holding company, to be called OYRC Holdings. The Reichmanns' interests would be consolidated in another new company to be known as Reichmann Holdings. The group of international banks holding some CDollars 3bn in loans secured by O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi-Price, Gulf Canada and Trizec would accept debt-service payments based on available cash flow. Four Canadian bank lenders would convert CDollars 131m in loans to O&amp;Y Developments into equity in the flagship Toronto buildings. Project lenders to these properties would extend the maturities of their loans by five years and agree to lower interest rates. But the banks would guarantee a minimum interest rate of 5 per cent. The proposals, which cover two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt, are separate from Reichmanns' efforts to regain control of Canary Wharf in London.</p>

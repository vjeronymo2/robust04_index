			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amrita Nair-Ghaswalla: "Firm Develops Battery </F> for Russian Sub"]    [Text] Bombay, April 13--Standard Batteries Limited (SBL),  an associate member of the diversified Williamson Magor group,  has signed a protocol agreement with the Central Bureau of  Design (Rubin) Leningrad, wherein Rubin has accepted SBL's  newly-developed battery for the Foxtrot class submarine, a  Russian sub.    A Rubin delegation is slated to visit the company's plant  and  witness the manufacturing capacities in mid-May, to further  their interest in the battery, it is reliably learnt. Once the  company receives the stamp of approval from Rubin, the battery  will be offered to the erstwhile Russian states as well as 16  other countries which use Russian submarines.    SBL has been supplying Foxtrot submarine batteries to the  Indian navy since 1975. The Indian navy has seven such subs at  present in its naval fleet. The inclusion of the modified  battery by the Indian navy is expected to save forex to the tune  of Rs 200 crores [rupees], during the lifetime of the submarine,  according to Mr P.R. Natarajan, vice-president, SBL group  associate.    The prototype of the battery has been developed by SBL in  its  own development wing and Indian naval officials are scheduled to  witness its workability, Mr Natarajan added. The company has a  technical collaboration with Hagen Batteries AG of Germany for  its submarine batteries.    The new battery is lighter in weight, has a higher energy  density, less maintenance and a longer usage capability. Each  battery has 240 cells in it, each weighing 800 kg.    The Indian navy has 15 subs of Russian origin in its  fleet--seven Foxtrot's and eight Kilo submarines. Though SBL has  been supplying batteries for both the Foxtrot and Kilo  submarines, India has been importing batteries at a cost of Rs 8  crores per battery. The new technology devised for the Foxtrot  battery is expected to cut down on this cost.    Moreover, instead of phasing out the country's 20-year-old  Foxtrot submarines, since most have exceeded their life span,  the Indian navy is refitting its submarines due to the  constraints of buying a new one at a cost of Rs 300-400 crores.  The new SBL battery is also aimed at cutting down this cost.    SBL recently exported a submarine battery comprising 240  cells to Algeria at a cost of around Rs 10 crores. It has also  received repeat orders for Kilo submarine batteries from  Algeria.    Meanwhile, industrial relations at the SBL signing of a new  5-year productivity-linked agreement between the company's 650  workers and the management. An average hike of Rs 800 has been  granted to all the employees, who have been asked to increase  production by 20 per cent.    The company continues to pay salaries amounting to Rs 4  lakhs  per month, to the 100 workers who have been ordered to remain  outside the company's premises, following the lock-out over a  year ago.    The company is augmenting its financial requirements through  a rights issue slated in mid-May. The issue, which is to be 4:1  at a premium of 10 plus 10, will hike the current equity level  of Rs 2 crores to Rs 10 crores. Last year's turnover has been  placed at Rs 120 crores.</p>

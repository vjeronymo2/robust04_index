			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Gulf war cost Asian countries Dollars 1.2bn THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported yesterday that the Gulf crisis had cost its developing member countries more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m) in lost exports and forgone foreign exchange remittances from migrant workers. Added to that is the higher oil price after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That cost runs into billions of dollars for Asia's many net oil importers, the ADB says in its annual report, released yesterday before the bank's annual meeting in Vancouver on April 24-26. Oil exporters Indonesia and Malaysia benefited in the short run from the higher world oil prices, the report said, but for China, another exporter, 'the loss of remittances and construction contracts wrote off most of the gains'. Before the Gulf crisis there were about 600,000 Asian workers in Kuwait and Iraq. 'A large number of them were later repatriated, considerably reducing the inflow of remittances and adding to the unemployment problem back home,' says the ADB. The South Asian countries and the Philippines were particularly hard hit because of their close economic relations with the Middle East. 'Their problems were compounded by their big budget and current account deficits and relatively high inflation rates and debt-service ratios,' the report adds. The bank estimated that the crisis had reduced India's growth in 1990 by one or two percentage points and increased its oil bill by more than Dollars 1bn. 'The newly industrialising economies (NICs) were in a much better position than other developing member countries to absorb the shock,' the 50-member bank said.</p>

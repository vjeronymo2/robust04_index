			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / British officials regret lack of co-operation British Foreign Office officials yesterday regretted that the Chinese leadership had not co-operated in moves to proceed with electoral reform in Hong Kong. But they said that they could wait no longer before introducing a new round of legislative reform in the colony. A Foreign Office spokesman said that the UK had made 'strenuous efforts' to proceed on the basis of an agreement with the Chinese government on electoral arrangements. He said that the UK had offered revised proposals in the course of the talks, conditional on reaching an overall acceptable package. 'Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese leadership,' the spokesman said. 'It will remain so.' But he claimed that it was necessary for the Legislative Council to begin work on the second Bill as soon as possible, since all primary legislation needs to become law in Hong Kong by the summer recess. The British government also regretted the Chinese leadership's speedy dismissal of the proposals. They stressed the proposals were compatible both with the Joint Declaration made by the UK and China and with the Basic Law, its post-1997 constitution for the territory. Officials said that it was in China's interests to acquire a 'successful Hong Kong' when they assume responsibility for it in 1997. Yesterday's developments came amid signs that British MPs are increasingly uneasy about Hong Kong's future. A survey by an organisation called Access Opinions showed that not a single MP was 'very confident' that the Chinese would respect the constitutional arrangements currently being set up under Mr Patten's direction. It showed that 54 per cent of MPs were 'not very confident' and 27 per cent 'not at all confident' about the outlook for the colony under Chinese rule.</p>

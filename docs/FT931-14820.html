			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM rating downgraded by S&amp;P IBM's senior debt credit rating has been downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's from triple-A to double-A-minus. About Dollars 19bn of rated debt is affected, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. S&amp;P said that the downgrade reflected the 'significantly lower-than-anticipated results' which were projected by the company last month.

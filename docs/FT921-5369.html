			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Minister scraps licensing scheme for holiday groups THE government yesterday abandoned controversial plans to set up an authority to license package travel operators. It proposed instead a self-regulatory scheme to protect holidaymakers against the risk of tour company collapses. Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, said in a Commons written answer that the Department of Trade and Industry had dropped its licensing proposals, published last July, on the grounds of cost and administrative complexity. His decision was welcomed by the Consumers' Association and the government-backed National Consumer Council, which had criticised the plans. But the association said the revised approach still did not go far enough to ensure complete protection for consumers. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said it wanted to discuss with the government how these proposals would be implemented, and particularly the need for a back-up fund to ensure full protection in cases of fraud. Abta operates a protection scheme on behalf of its members. It is concerned about its legal position if these voluntary safeguards were turned into a statutory responsibility. Mr Leigh said the government had decided that tour organisers should make their own arrangements to provide security for refunds in insolvencies. He suggested that three options: Depositing bonds equal to the maximum pre-payments held by tour organisers with an 'approved organisation'. Insurance against insolvency. Depositing pre-payments in an account which could be drawn on only after delivery of the service for which the pre-payments were made. Organisers of tours abroad would have to provide security against the cost of repatriation of stranded holidaymakers. The proposals are intended to comply with a 1990 European Community directive requiring protection for package tourists by the year-end.</p>

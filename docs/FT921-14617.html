			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: CME plans D-Mark/yen currency contracts THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to launch yen-settled D-Mark/yen futures and options on January 26. These are the exchange's first cross-rate currency futures and options not settled in dollars. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said: 'We are responding to the fact that, more and more, the dollar is not the centre-piece of international transactions.' The exchange said it will wait to see how the D-Mark/yen contract succeeds before it launches two other similar cross-rate currency contracts - pound/D-Mark and D-Mark/Swiss franc  - for which is has approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator. The Chicago Board of Trade, the CME's traditional rival, announced it will suspend listing new futures and options contracts in mortgage-backed securities. Four such contracts traded poorly last year. The CBOT said it would move mortgage-backed futures and options to its upcoming local-area network electronic trading system, called Project A. Project A, still under development, is to be used for low volume or non-conventional products during regular trading hours.</p>

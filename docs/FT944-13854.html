			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / First oil produced west of Shetland BP and Shell said yesterday that they had produced the first oil from the Atlantic west of Shetland. In a six-week extended test of their new Foinaven field the well flowed at up to 20,000 barrels a day, with an average flow of 17,800 barrels. On completion of the test a cargo of oil was taken to BP's refinery in Rotterdam. In addition to being the first oil produced and saved from the area, it was the first production from 500m under water, and the highest flow rate achieved in the area. Foinaven and its neighbouring Schiehallion field are among the biggest new oil and gas discoveries in UK waters. The two wells could account for 30 per cent of the UK's known reserves, with production amounting to a similar proportion of the UK's total output when they are fully developed. In August Shell and BP placed contracts with a consortium of McDermott/Golar-Nor for a floating production system for the first phase of Foinaven development.</p>

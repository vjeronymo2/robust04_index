			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: A volatile Don Giovanni - Opera Glyndebourne's new Giovanni, Gilles Cachemaille, never stops stripping. No sooner has he donned one shirt than he yanks it off to be replaced by another which Leporello hands him, or else he struts bare-chested for a while. That suggests that he is perpetually hot, and also that he wants to show it (perhaps that is part of his technique): hot for it, hotter than hell. This last presumptive claim is wrong, as proved by the designer Hildegard Bechtler's final vision of hell as a monstrous, flaming grill-room. That is the only 'realistic' set in Deborah Warner's production - and of course it is not realistic. Otherwise there is just a moveable platform (lowered ever so slowly from the flies onto a pit during the Overture), a high industrial tunnel, a tacky plastic curtain and the occasional staircase. Miss Warner has chosen to stake everything on character and visible action (and Mozart's music, which she leaves intact) while shunning anything picturesque. No palaces, meadows or ballrooms, let alone an equestrian statue; nothing 'period' that might fix the social status of the characters, though Sue Blane's choice of modern gear for them conveys many a sly hint. Many of the Glyndebourne audience loved it (as did I), probably most; some booed. Of the latter, some were no doubt traditionalists who pined for the usual trappings, but others - especially those new to the opera - were foxed, perhaps, by this parade of passions anchored in no solid reality. Knowing more about the opera than Miss Warner wants to show us may be a prerequisite for relishing what she actually does with it. Simon Rattle conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with his usual towering vitality. I was less struck by any special period-instrument colours, perhaps because they have become familiar now, than by how faint some of the witty string-comments sounded. But anything from the pit dwindled against what we heard and saw from the singers; Miss Warner has wrenched terrifically vivid character from most of them (slow though they are with recitatives). Even glum, passive Don Ottavio is at least made vividly glum and passive, and beautifully sung, by John Mark Ainsley. Amanda Roocroft's Donna Elvira is wrong-footed by her first appearance, as a pretty waif travelling with plastic water-bottle and shopping-bag, but she restores the lady's essential dignity in her music later. Hillevi Martinpelto sings Donna Anna with elegance, if without much sense of tragedy beyond melodrama. Juliane Banse's Zerlina, sweetly knowing, throws Roberto Scaltriti's seething Masetto (perfectly defined by his flash suit) into still better relief; they are a splendid pair, with unending explosions clearly indicated for their wedded life post-opera. Though I am not convinced that a live, dinner-jacketted Commendatore can carry the full dramatic weight of a stone statue, Gudjon Oskarsson sings him with measured aplomb. As Leporello, Sanford Sylvan - the memorable Chou en-Lai of John Adams' Nixon in China - is a ripe model of seen-it-all weariness, full of comic touches, and delivered with a quick musical alertness rare in Leporellos. Above all, however, it is Cachemaille's riveting anti-hero who carries the show, and the evening. As if hellbent to prove that he is not just one of Nature's Leporellos (Cachemaille's usual role in the opera), he displays a range of vocal variety and feeling that leaves most Giovannis standing, even to unexpectedly seductive, honeyed tones for 'La ci darem' and the Serenade. Writers sometimes suggest that Don Giovanni is really a failed seducer, on the strength of his failed seductions in the opera; the manic, acharne lust with which Cachemaille invests him gives the lie to that utterly. Beyond it there is a mad, dangerous volatility, a constant threat that he may do anything next, just for the hell of it. There is something absolutely right about that. From now on, Giovannis who lack it, whatever their other virtues, are going to seem a little pallid - decorous persons impersonating a seriously wild man. In repertory at Glyndebourne until August 24.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mexico waits for OECD borrowing benefits Mexico, which was admitted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development last April, has yet to enjoy one of the important fruits of membership. Because of a little-noticed rule change agreed by international bank supervisors in Basle in July, Mexico has to be treated as a non-OECD country by banks and securities traders. This means they must set aside more capital than for other OECD member countries when they lend to the Mexican government and Mexican banks, and when they hold their securities Previously, the rules defined the so-called Zone A countries - those benefiting from the most generous capital treatment - as members of the OECD. The July decision from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision meant that Zone A now 'excludes any country within the group which has rescheduled its external sovereign debt in the previous five years.' Mexico, the only member in that category, signed a debt restructuring agreement in March 1990, which means it should enter Zone A in March 1995. This should help lower the cost of borrowing and of issuing short-term securities and eurobonds by the government, public-sector entities and banks. 'Other things being equal, this change is likely to increase the demand for Mexican sovereign risk by reducing the cost of carrying Mexican assets. This would lead to some compression of Mexico's credit spreads,' said Mr David Lubin of HSBC Markets in London. The shift will mean a zero-risk weighting - that is, no capital has to be set aside - for claims against the Mexican government or its central bank. The risk weighting for short-term government securities and floating-rate notes issued in foreign currency drops to 10 per cent, while that on eurobonds, claims on banks and public sector entities drops to 20 per cent. Previously the risk weighting on all Mexican entities was 100 per cent, implying 8 per cent of the value of the claim had to be set aside in capital. Claims on Mexican corporate entities will remain unchanged at 100 per cent.</p>

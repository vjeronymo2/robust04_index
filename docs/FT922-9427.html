			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Right ways for accountants to be regulated and improve image (1) Sir, Touche Ross is to be congratulated on calling for the regulation of auditors to be shifted from the Institute of Chartered Accountants to an independent body ('Touche attacks ICAEW audit role', May 1). The institute simply cannot be expected to be an effective regulator. Its primary role is that of a trade association; inevitably, its role as advocate of the immediate interest of members will take precedence over its role in upholding professional standards and increasing public confidence. I am glad I am not alone in knowing of cases where the two roles have been in conflict. The article by Geoffrey Holmes and Alan Sugden (Accountancy column, April 30) on 'six ways to improve the profession's image' would have carried more weight if it had endorsed the Touche Ross proposal. The article did, however, underline the importance of asserting the independence of auditors as a step towards better corporate governance. An audit is an integral part of good corporate governance and an independent regulator for auditors is but one of the steps we have to take in the UK to reach the goal of a truly independent audit.

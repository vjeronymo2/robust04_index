			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lev Grebnev, under the rubric "State Support for </F> Entrepreneurs": "European Bank Demands Serious Guarantees"]    [Text] As is known, more than 50 private companies in  Kazakhstan will receive this year loans totaling 100 million ECU  (about $112 million) for production business development. Their  generous sponsor is the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD). The names of these companies and description  of investment projects so far have not been made public, despite  the promises of high-ranking government officials to observe  complete openness in this matter. The guarantee agreement on  loans, on the other hand, which was signed at the end of last  year, is not a secret: Its text was submitted by the government  for ratification to the Supreme Council.    The guarantee agreement is written in terse and tough  language; it is a supplement of sorts to the  main--loan--agreement, intended to dot all of the "i's."    According to this document, Kazakhstan "unconditionally  guarantees as the principal borrower rather than as a guarantor,  the payment in proper and timely manner of any and all monies  due by the credit agreement, both on the indicated repayment  date and before it...."    The bank has the right to request, and the republic is  obligated to supply, various financial and economic information,  including data on the balance of payments, Kazakhstan's foreign  debt, draft decisions affecting the banking sphere, the  mechanism of bankruptcy, and taxation. In other words, the  creditor wishes to protect the project from possible surprises  and demands that a prior concurrence be obtained with respect to  principal reformist steps on the part of the Cabinet of  Ministers and the parliament.    The most delicate point in preparation of such documents is  the issue of collateral that guarantees the repayment of the  loan. Russia, for instance, when agreeing last year to print  "new" rubles for us, set a condition to put up a part of the  republic's gold and foreign currency reserves as collateral for  repayment of this "technical credit." Some agreements entered by  international banks use the principle of "negative collateral":  If you do not repay the loan on time or do not make timely  payments, the creditor has a right to freeze your foreign  currency assets in other countries.    In the case of Kazakhstan, a compromise was found, verbatim  wording of which would take nearly a quarter of a newspaper  page. Kazakhstan undertakes an obligation to grant the EBRD loan  a priority in allocation, use, and distribution of foreign  currency holdings. Should an unforeseen situation arise where  the republic would find itself owing several creditors at once  and short on foreign currency reserves, Kazakhstan is "quickly  and without cost to the bank to back up the loan principal,  interest, and other loan-related fees by an equivalent right of  withholding with respect to OTHER PUBLIC ASSETS satisfactory to  the bank."    "Other assets" mean the property of the "guarantor" or of  subjects owned by it, including gold and other foreign currency  assets. Thus, one way or the other, the bank will have to be  paid on time.    In addition, Kazakhstan is responsible for paying any  professional, banking, transfer, or foreign currency commission  fees and expenditures incurred in preparation of this agreement  and accompanying documents.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Lady Thatcher takes unpaid job at chamber Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister who tends to be held in higher regard overseas than at home, has underlined her special relationship with America by joining the international advisory board of the British-American chamber of commerce. There are plenty of chambers of commerce which are bigger than the British-American Chamber (founded in 1920) but its relatively small size is overshadowed by the composition of its advisory board, which is chaired by Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan. The membership of the 36-strong board ranges from Sir Dennis Weatherstone, president of JP Morgan, and Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate-Palmolive, to Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, and Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer. Apart from being the first ex-prime minister to join the board, Lady Thatcher is also the first woman. Thomas Wyman (right), executive chairman of SG Warburg &amp; Co Inc, has also joined the board. Members of the advisory board are not paid, but the responsibilities are not particularly onerous. The board only meets twice a year, once in London and once in New York. Although some 500 US companies are members of the British-American chamber of commerce, roughly twice the number of British corporate members, there are more British members on the advisory board. Given Lady Thatcher's strong following in the US, her arrival there may help the chamber of commerce achieve its ambition of getting an equal balance on the board.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Kyrgyzstan has adopted a decree on  the state and preservation of state property by Kyrgyzstan's  industrial works, enterprises, agriculture, and transport. It  says: Under the conditions of introducing market reforms and  enterprises gaining their economic independence financial  discipline has fallen down in the Republic and the number of  economic crimes has increased. Ministries and departments are  not exercising control over the preservation of state property.  Embezzlement, misappropriation, and shortages are [word  indistinct] widespread. This is the result of the shortcomings  in the work of the city administrations.    With the aim of eliminating these shortcomings, the State  Financial Inspectorate under the Government of Kyrgyzstan has  been invested with powers to carry out regular checks of the  interdepartmental financial control bodies, and the results of  the checks are to be submitted for consideration by the  government of the Republic.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Changbao (6392 7022 0202), Xie Yiya (6200 </F> 5030 0068) and Lu Wen (4151 2429), CPC Central Committee Policy  Research Office and Ministry of Agriculture Jointly Operated  Permanent Rural Observation Site Office: "Survey of Peasant  Occupational Differentiation"]    [Text] In 1992, the Permanent Observation Site Office  conducted a special survey of peasant occupational  differentiation through 312 permanent rural observation sites in  29 provinces (autonomous regions, or cities) located throughout  the country.  <H5>  1. Current Status of Peasant Occupational Differentiation </H5>   The survey showed that more than a decade of reform has  demolished the peasants' single occupation status of the  people's commune era. Today, the peasants have the freedom to  change their status and select an occupation. The employment  structure has undergone marked changes.    This survey divided peasant occupations into 10 categories  as  follows:    1) Peasant laborers. This category consists  primarily of peasants who contract the use of collective land  for farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and the fishing  industry, all or most of their income coming from agriculture.  They may be further divided into those who work solely in  agriculture, and those who work mostly in agriculture but also  in some other industry.    2) Peasant workers. These are peasants who work  all year round, or most of the time, in township and village  collectively owned enterprises and state-owned enterprise units  doing jobs in secondary or tertiary industries.    3) Township and village collective enterprise  managers. These are plant directors and plant managers, as  well as people who head up laboratories, and supply and  marketing personnel in township and village (or group)  collectively owned enterprises. They are the people who hold  administrative and management authority and decision making  authority in enterprises.    4) Individual or partnership industry and business  workers and business persons. These are laborers engaged in  nonagricultural labor and business in industries,  transportation, businesses, or food and beverage services in  which the means of production or money are individually owned or  owned in partnership. These industries and businesses may have  hired workers, but they have not yet attained the status of a  privately owned enterprise.    5) Operators of privately owned enterprises, i.e.,  owners of privately owned businesses. A privately owned  enterprise is one in which an individual or partners own the  means of production, in which mostly hired labor does the work,  in which all or most after-tax profits go to the owners of the  means of production, and that are rural economic entities of  substantial size. Specifically, a privately owned enterprise: 1)  hires eight or more workers (including apprentice workers); 2)  has fewer than eight worker but has assets (fixed assets and  working capital) of more than 50,000 yuan; 3) is a partnership  in which the number of hired workers is greater than double the  total amount of family manpower put into the partnership, and  whose assets are worth more than 50,000 yuan.    6) Hired laborers. This means laborers who work  year round, or most of the year, as laborers in a noncollective  and nonstate owned enterprise unit such as a privately owned  enterprise, an individual owned enterprise, or a partnership  industry or business. These laborers do not have enough land or  other means of production to make a living by themselves.    7) Township and village cadres. This term applies  to township and village cadres who do administrative leadership  and management tasks year round, or most of the time. For the  most part, they do not have production jobs. Most draw a fixed  wage or enjoy a fixed allowance.    8) Workers in education, science and technology,  medical treatment and health care, culture and the arts.  These are peasants and intellectuals engaged in intellectual  occupations in rural villages.    9) Houseworkers. This term applies to laborers who  do house work year round and who do not engage in production for  the most part.    (10) Other laborers. This means workers other than  those in the above nine categories, such as laborers having no  fixed occupation.    Inasmuch as houseworkers do virtually no work in production,  since other laborers have no relatively fixed occupational  status, and since township and village cadres and workers in  education, science, medical treatment, and the arts are groups  that have not newly appeared since reform, they are not the  principal focus of this article's analysis.    Thus, the current spread of the rural work force is as shown  in Table 1.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Most of the manpower that has left  agriculture has flowed in one of two directions. First, it has  gone into township and village collectively owned enterprises  and state-owned enterprise units. A relatively small 5.2 percent  has gone into nonagricultural work such as in state-owned  enterprise units, while a much larger percentage has gone into  township and village collective enterprises. Second, it has  flowed mostly into the individually or privately owned economy.  This category of laborers is comprised largely of the owners of  the owners of privately owned enterprises, and the owners and  hired workers in individual or partnership industries or  businesses. The number of people who have gone into state-owned  enterprise units, township and village collective enterprises,  and the private economy total 28.3 percent of the  nonagricultural population. The development of township and  village enterprises and the individually and privately owned  economy has played an important role in the shift of  agricultural manpower. Gender plays a definite role in rural  manpower's selection of an occupation. This is manifested  largely in a much larger percentage of females than males  leaving production to do housework. However, except for the old  and the physically impaired, virtually all males are involved  directly in production activity. Among agricultural laborers,  females employed solely in agriculture account for 45 percent of  total manpower in this category, 4.9 percentage points more than  males. However, in the various nonagricultural occupations, the  percentage of males is higher than females.    The occupational situation in the country's three main  regions as shown in Table 2 suggests that the percentage of the  rural work force working as agricultural laborers increases from  the eastern to the central and western regions of the country.  Correspondingly, the percentage of nonagricultural laborers is  largest in the eastern region. The nonagricultural manpower in  township and village collective enterprises (the peasant workers  in township and village collective enterprises, and managers in  township and village collective enterprises) is 31.8 percent in  the east, 26.8 percent in the central region, and 23.2 percent  in the West. In the eastern region, those who have become  owners of privately owned enterprises in the individual and  private economy, or operators and hired workers in individual or  partnership industries or businesses number 31.8 percent of the  nonagricultural work force. It is 23.8 percent in the central  region and 26.8 percent in the western region.    In the eastern region, the peasant occupational structure  shows a fairly marked nonagricultural shift, and the collective  and privately owned economies play an equally important role in  soaking up nonagricultural manpower. In the western region, the  tilt of the occupational structure toward other than agriculture  is reactively slight. The percentage of agricultural laborers is  relatively high, and the percentage of nonagricultural manpower  flowing into township and village collective enterprises is  relatively low. In the central region, the situation is in  between that of the eastern and western regions. By comparison  with the western region, township and village collective  enterprises soak up a comparatively large amount of the work  force; however, the role of the individual and private economy  in soaking up manpower is relatively slight.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

We  can observe this from the village per capita income level (See  Table 3).    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

The percentage of village  laborers having a net per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan  is lowest, and the percentage of those engaged purely in  agriculture is even less, amounting to only 14.6 percent of  rural manpower. However, in the group making a net per capita  income of less than 400 yuan, they number 60.2 percent, the  highest group of all. In the group making between 600 and 800  yuan, they number 50.7 percent. Township and village enterprises  are fairly well developed in villages where people have a net  per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan. These township and  village enterprises employ 52.1 percent of non-agricultural  manpower as peasant workers and managers. Private enterprise  owners, individual or partnership industry or business  operators, and hired laborers account for 27.9 percent of  nonagricultural manpower. In the 600-800 yuan group, township  and village enterprises employ 34.7 percent of nonagricultural  manpower as peasant workers and managers, and private enterprise  owners, individual or partnership industry or business  operators, and hired laborers account for 26.5 percent of  nonagricultural manpower. In the below 400 yuan group, the  percentages are 8.4 and 21.2 respectively. This shows a  relatively high percentage of nonagricultural manpower in high  income villages, an overwhelming majority of which has fairly  stable employment, while in low income areas, the  nonagricultural manpower percentage is very small, and a  substantial percentage of it is not engaged in production  activities. The role of collective enterprises and individually  or privately owned economic components in absorbing surplus  agricultural manpower is very limited, agriculture being the  main occupation.    To summarize the foregoing, the peasant occupational  structure at the present time may be capsulized as follows:    1. Rural reform has freed the peasants from the bondage of  the people's commune system. As the rural economy develops,  bringing steady changes in the industrial structure, some  peasants have left agriculture for jobs in the nonagricultural  sector. The substance of peasant employment has changed with  reform, employment opportunities becoming more varied.    2. The occupational structure today has a marked  transitional  character. On the one hand, because of various limitations, most  peasants remain on the land. Despite the large surplus labor,  they are unable to transfer into secondary and tertiary  industries. On the other hand, the manpower that has transferred  out of agriculture still maintains countless ties with those who  have not. They are still not secure in their jobs, where mergers  are constantly occurring. The survey results show 0.7 persons  per household surveyed as working in other than agriculture, 0.3  of them working there for less than six months each year.  Moreover, each time a change occurs in government policy  orientation, a chain reaction is produced in the percentage of  rural manpower employed in nonagricultural pursuits.    3. Occupational structure reflects an area's industrial  structure, and differences in industrial structure make for  differences between one area and another in peasant employment.  In economically developed areas, nonagricultural industries are  usually also fairly well developed, and the amount of manpower  working in other than agriculture is substantial. However, in  economically backward areas where agriculture still plays a  dominant role, the occupational structure is also tilted toward  agriculture.    4. Township and village collective enterprises, privately  owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial and  business households are the main outlets for surplus manpower.  Collective enterprises are frequently fairly large and soak up  substantial manpower. However, the number of such enterprises is  fairly small, and they are very unevenly distributed. Although  fairly small in size and absorbing little manpower, privately  owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial or  commercial households are fairly large in number and cover a  wide area. Both of these economic components play a major role  as outlets for the shift of manpower today.    5. From the standpoint of the peasants becoming prosperous,  since they have a great radiating effect, township and village  enterprises play a substantial role in bringing about joint  prosperity for whole villages. That more than half of the  non-agricultural manpower is employed in township and village  collective enterprises in villages where net per capita income  is above 1,500 yuan provides good testimony to this. The  radiating effect of privately owned enterprises and individual  or partnership industrial and commercial households is small by  comparison, so their role is not as large as that of township  and village collective enterprises. Their effect on the rural  economy is expressed largely through their demonstration effect  on villagers.  <H5>  Main Reasons for Peasant Occupational Diversification </H5>   The main reason for the diversification of peasant  occupations since the advent of reform has been the shift into  other than agriculture and other than the publicly owned economy  of agricultural laborers who contracted collectively owned land.  Therefore, six occupational changes in the primary industry and  secondary industries should be the main emphasis of this  analysis. Reduction in the number of agricultural laborers is  the starting point for peasant occupational differentiation.    Many factors account for peasant occupational  differentiation. There are both internal reasons and objective  reasons, both historical reasons and practical reasons, and both  general reasons and special reasons. Summation of all the  factors leading to the main reasons for peasant occupational  differentiation today may be understood from the following  several aspects.    (1) Economic Development Is the Basic Animus for  Peasant Occupational Differentiation    Economic development has its own inherent objective  necessity. The contemporary economic development process is a  process of change that has gone from primarily an agricultural  economy to primarily an industrial economy, from primarily a  rural village economy to primarily an industrial economy, from  primarily a rural economy to primarily an urban economy, and  from primarily a natural economy to primarily a commodity  economy. The diversification of peasants occupations is an  important ingredient of this process.    The direct force powering this process is rise in  agricultural productivity. The widespread use of improved breeds  and crop varieties, increase in material inputs such as chemical  fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agricultural plastic  film, a rise in the degree of mechanization, improved capital  construction of agriculture, perfection of the agricultural  services system, etc. have brought a rise in both the soil  productivity rate and the labor productive rate, thereby setting  the stage for a shift in agricultural manpower. This survey  shows that 72.8 percent of villages have centrally organized the  supply of improved breeds and crop varieties, that chemical  fertilizer use totals 84.43 tons per village, or 34.78 kilograms  per mu of cultivated land; that mechanization averages 1,014.58  horsepower per village, meaning that 57 percent of the total  cultivated land area is machine cultivated today; and that 83  percent of villages have centrally organized medium and small  farmland capital construction, year-end effective irrigation and  drainage ditches averaging 6,533.89 meters per village for the  irrigation of 56.4 percent of the total cultivated land area  during the year. Improvement of the agricultural services system  has not only improved working conditions, but has also saved  manpower. Among rural agricultural laborers surveyed, females  already outnumber males, and the educational level of  agricultural laborers is also fairly low; however, neither of  these factors impairs bumper agricultural harvests. On the  contrary, they set the stage for male manpower and manpower of  relatively high caliber to take part in nonagricultural  production.    Agricultural production is characterized by seasonality. The  widespread existence of long periods of surplus agricultural  labor is also a basic factor in the long history of rural  sideline occupations, and it also makes possible the holding of  separate jobs. The survey shows that 30.6 percent of  agricultural laborers hold a second job, and that only 42.8  percent of the rural work force works solely in farming. The  experience of some economically developed areas shows that the  shift of manpower out of agriculture usually goes through three  stages: farming alone, two jobs other than farming, and  concentration on a single occupation. Since China has scant  resources for agriculture, and a large population relative to  available land, surplus manpower exists in every rural village.  This produces inherent pressure for peasant occupational  differentiation. This survey shows only 3.08 mu of cultivated  land per rural capita, and each person engaged in farming  cultivated 5.49 mu. Idle rural manpower runs to 286.45 per  village, or 36.4 percent of total manpower.    Different occupations and differences in income from  different occupations play a guiding role in peasant  occupational diversification. Results of a sampling of 10  percent of the high income families among all peasant families  based on a 1991 ranking by per capita income showed: Forty-two  percent of the high income peasant households were from among  households operating privately owned enterprises primarily; 25  percent came from households engaged mostly in individual or  partnership contracting of collective enterprises; 18.3 percent  came from households engaged primarily in running partnerships;  and 8.6 percent came from households operating family  businesses, for the most part. Clearly, the percentage of high  income households from the operation of family businesses mostly  was lowest. The number of high income households in various  occupations as a percentage of all households was as follows:  4.5 percent in farming (3.5 percent of them from grain farming),  8.7 percent in forestry, 14.1 percent in animal husbandry, 12.5  percent in the fishing industry, 27.4 percent in industry, and  28.6 percent in construction. Very clearly, the percentage of  high income households engaged in farming, for the most part,  was the smallest.    (2) Economic Policy Readjustments Since the Advent of  Rural Reform Have Given Tremendous Impetus to Peasant  Occupational Differentiation    The sidelining of surplus agricultural manpower resulting  from increases in agricultural productivity, the surplus labor  time and the surplus manpower employment pressures resulting  from the shortage of agricultural resources, which characterize  agricultural production, as well as the different occupations  and the differences in income from different occupations are  things guiding the shift of manpower out of agriculture and  inherent causes of economic development, most of which have not  just come into being. However, rural reform brought new changes  and new combinations of these factors that have hastened peasant  occupational diversification.    Before reform, rural villages practiced a highly centralized  planned economy management system in which the peasants had no  right to make their own production decisions and no division of  labor and trades, to say nothing of occupational diversity. The  peasants were shackled to the limited amount of land to produce  enough food to eat. "Taking grain as the key link, cutting out  all else" was a true picture of agricultural production. Commune  members were agricultural laborers virtually all of whom looked  alike. Following reform, the peasants became relatively  independent producers and operators. They had the right to make  their own production decisions. They could choose what they  would farm, how they would farm it, and ways to become rich.  Consequently, more and more peasants devoted themselves to  commodity production, left the land without leaving the village,  headed for cities, and engaged in economically diversified tasks  using different operating methods under different forms of  ownership. The rise of nonagricultural industries and a nonstate  owned economy was the basis reason for peasant occupational  differentiation. As a result of rural reforms approximately  one-half of the agricultural manpower under the traditional  system has changed, or is in process of changing, occupation.    (3) Socio-economic environment Is an Important  Condition Affecting Peasant Occupational Differentiation    Why is it that the degree of occupational differentiation  differs substantially in different areas and different villages  despite the same policies? This can be explained only in terms  of the objective conditions such as socio-economic environment  and availability of resources.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

Agricultural laborers as a percentage of total manpower is  70.8 percent in the western region, 65.6 percent in the central  region, and 57.0 percent in the eastern region. Clearly it is a  result of the socio-economic environment in the different  regions, which causes a stratification in the extent of peasant  occupational diversification. The macroenvironment in open  coastal regions, in particular has an extremely great affect on  peasant occupational differentiation. In addition is the  difference in topography, and differences in social environment  and natural resources, which, generally speaking, affects  peasant occupational diversification. However, it is only in an  appropriate socio-economic environment that natural resources  conditions can become transformed into real productivity.  Peasant occupational differentiation is related to the degree of  economic openness, the degree to which the commodity economy has  developed, and the degrees to which the nonagricultural economy  has developed. Without convenient transportation, and without  the present of important things such as money, markets,  facilities, technology, and information, which is to say that if  the socio-economic environment is not very good, it is difficult  to make most of advantages in plentiful natural resources.    (4) Personal Traits Are the Decisive Element in Peasant  Occupational Differentiation    In the final analysis, peasant occupational differentiation  comes down to peasant personal economic behavior. Ultimately the  inherent force of economic development, the powerful impetus of  economic policies, and the important influence of the economic  environment have to be realized through the peasants. The  peasants personal traits play a decisive role in occupational  diversification. Take the three major areas of China as an  example. In the eastern region, the level of education of rural  manpower is higher overall than in the central and western  regions. It is lowest in the western region. This is consistent  with the progressive decrease east to west in the extent of  peasant occupational differentiation (See Table 4). Using the  same method to survey the average degree of peasant education in  all occupations surveyed, one can see that the peasant that have  differentiated into various occupations all have higher  educations that agricultural laborers, hired employees and  houseworkers who do not engage in production activities  excepted. (See Table 5). Those having a higher degree of  education update their ideas faster, more readily learn special  skills, and have greater ability to adjust to their external  environment.    Changes in thinking lead to changes in behavior. Some  peasants who have skills and ability have separated from the  mass of agricultural laborers to take a road toward riches. This  survey shows that most of those who have become rich first today  have diversified out of agricultural labor. As to how they were  able to get rich first, 56 percent of the peasants feel that  they either had a special skill or they had a head for economics  and business.</p>

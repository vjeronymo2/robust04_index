			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> HOW HATE COMES TO A FULL BOIL;  </P> <P> ANIMOSITY TOWARD THOSE WHO ARE 'DIFFERENT' INCREASINGLY TURNS FROM THOUGHT TO  DEED. ONE CONFRONTATION OFFERS A CASE STUDY IN THE NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF  PREJUDICE.  </P> <P> The encounter at a phone booth on a breezy summer night lasted less than 20  minutes. But it was decades in the making and, more than a year later, is  reverberating still.  </P> <P> Johnny James McCool Jr., 19, was calling a friend from a gas station in the  Montrose section of Glendale when the telephone was snatched, hard, from his  hand. He turned to face the blue-eyed stare of a short, curly-haired man he had  never met before.  </P> <P> The man, later identified as Ralph Tavlian, wanted to know why McCool had  thrown something at him. McCool said he hadn't.  </P> <P> What Tavlian yelled next is recorded in Glendale Police Department report  724-054:  </P> <P> "Nigger, you don't belong in this city. We don't need people like you here."  </P> <P> At the same time, he slapped Johnny McCool. Then he smacked the astonished  young man again and again.  </P> <P> As crimes go, this was a minor case. No one was badly hurt (McCool was bruised;  his striped turtleneck torn). No deadly weapons were involved (Tavlian did not  even make a fist).  </P> <P> But it was just the kind of episode that illustrates the scale and nature of  prejudice today. Increasingly, ill will toward others has crossed the chasm  between thought and deed.  </P> <P> "Hate crimes" have been reported at record rates in Los Angeles County each  year since 1986. Other Southern California counties have not been keeping  separate hate-crime figures, although authorities in Orange County say they  sense an increase there. But wherever such statistics are kept, across the  United States, bigotry cases have become more commonplace, according to Leonard  Zeskind, research director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, which monitors  hate crimes nationwide.  </P> <P> The incidents have ranged from anonymous spray-painting of slurs to cross  burnings to murder. What they have in common is their motivation: fury directed  at those who are "different" because of their race, their religion or their  sexual orientation.  </P> <P> The numbers are small compared to some other crime categories, but authorities  find the direction frightening. In the first half of 1990, the 272 entries in  the county's hate-crime log represented a 32% jump in reported incidents over  the same period in 1989. The surge is "a barometer of increasing tension in  society as a whole," says Eugene Mornell, executive director of the county's  Human Relations Commission.  </P> <P> In late 20th-Century Los Angeles, awash in immigrants, there are plenty of  "different" people around. Each group offers potential victims -- and potential  aggressors as well. None holds a monopoly on bigotry.  </P> <P> Blacks, for example, rank with Jews and male homosexuals as the most frequent  targets in local hate crimes. In that respect, Johnny McCool's experience was  typical.  </P> <P> But last month, a black transient screaming, "I hate Mexicans!" used a cinder  block to bash a Latino to death.  </P> <P> Armenians, too, have been threatened. Last year, a teenager's nose was bloodied  by several dozen taunting Latina schoolgirls. An Armenian man found three  deflated tires on his car and, beneath the windshield wiper, a note warning him  to move out of his apartment. "You stink up our building," the note read in  part. It was signed, "Ottoman Empire."  </P> <P> Ralph Tavlian is Armenian. He says his treatment of Johnny McCool "was the most  shameful thing I've ever done." He was sodden-drunk at the time. He says he  swore off alcohol the morning after, when he woke up in jail, and has not  touched it since -- an account supported by friends and colleagues.  </P> <P> He also has spent some time thinking about the roots of his outburst. He says  alcohol fogged his memory, but concedes that he probably said what he is quoted  as saying and did what he is accused of doing. The sentiment he expressed "was  there, yes. It didn't just come from the blue sky," he says.  </P> <P> The confrontation at the phone booth, he says, really began 20 years ago, when  he was Raffi Tawilian, age 12, a new arrival from Lebanon by way of France and  New York. His family clung to old Armenian ways; he became Ralph, "the  Americanized one." One way to fit in, he found, was to pick up his classmates'  chatter about the need to keep their school as white as the teachers' chalk.  </P> <P> After high school, he says, he fell in with a biker gang called the "Dirty  White Boys." He had the name tattooed across his back. It was a response, he  says, to a black biker gang known as the "Chosen Few."  </P> <P> On television, in movies, in news accounts, he says, the stereotypes and the  ugly names were reinforced. "It's crammed down our throats," Ralph Tavlian  says. "Crammed down our throats, and you can quote me on that."  </P> <P> To hear Johnny McCool Sr. tell it, Johnny Jr.'s first brush with prejudice came  on the day of his birth back in 1969:  </P> <P> "I told my wife, 'Martha, keep gas in the car.' But she didn't and the car ran  out in Glendale at 3 o'clock in the morning. I was walking to a gas station  when a police car pulled over.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Officer, my wife is in labor and we ran out of gas. Could you take me  to get some gas or take us to the hospital?' The officer started asking me some  questions. A black man on foot in the middle of the night. He thought I was out  there stealing or something."  </P> <P> McCool Sr. recognized the attitude. His sensors were always activated. He had  spent a good bit of time going out of his way to avoid racial problems without  giving up his pride.  </P> <P> He grew up in Drew, Miss., in the Delta and "back in that area, all (a black  person) was supposed to have was a weak mind and strong back." He couldn't take  that, but he didn't want to start any incidents either. So he moved to Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> House hunting here in 1960, he says, a Crenshaw District realtor told him:  "Hey, we are not selling to blacks . . . or colored, whatever they said then."  </P> <P> "Why antagonize?" he thought. So he moved to a racially mixed block in Altadena  instead.  </P> <P> Later, he quit his city job driving street sweepers, to open his own mechanic's  shop and located the business in a predominantly black South-Central Los  Angeles neighborhood.  </P> <P> When the three children came along, he resolved to impart certain lessons.  Between water skiing, violin practice, judo and church, his middle child and  namesake received field trips to Skid Row and lectures on race relations.  </P> <P> "It's not what you are. It's who you are," McCool Sr. liked to say.  </P> <P> "It's not what happens to you; it's how you handle it.  </P> <P> "We got to live in the real world among real people and deal with it as it is,  not the way we hope it is."  </P> <P> Some people, McCool Sr. told his son as they watched the television miniseries  "Roots" together, just don't like other races, because of something they saw or  something their parents told them.  </P> <P> "It went in one ear and out the other," McCool Jr. says now.  </P> <P> After all, McCool Jr. was living in a well-integrated world as he grew into a  lanky, soft-spoken teen with a wispy mustache. At Pasadena Christian School, he  met his best friend, a white guy with short blond hair and a dry voice who  lived in affluent La Canada Flintridge. His name was Bond. James Bond.  </P> <P> They stayed close, even though McCool went on to Marshall High School and Bond  attended St. Francis. McCool knew that every couple of months or so, others  asked Bond why he spent so much time with black guys. But he didn't dwell on  that much, because he also knew about Bond's stock reply: " 'Cause they're not  . . . like you." Bond filled in the blank with a descriptive swear word.  </P> <P> It was Bond who got McCool involved with the Crescenta-Canada YMCA, a low,  sprawling brown building on Foothill Boulevard near the Glendale Freeway's  north end. After two years of Bond's coaxing, McCool began playing basketball  there. He coached and refereed as well, then acted as disc jockey for  Y-sponsored dances at local schools.  </P> <P> By the time Bond and McCool enrolled at Pasadena City College, they were Y  fixtures, working as gymnastics teachers and as counselors for junior high  school-age teens.  </P> <P> Sometimes a whole crowd of Y buddies would cross the Glendale city line to the  south for a bite to eat in the Montrose shopping district. The place had a  homey feel. American flags adorned the light standards. The only people  soliciting spare change on the streets were members of the Lions Club.  </P> <P> Nearly everyone there was white.  </P> <P> By and large, McCool felt more accepted than excepted. Once in a while, though,  he could tell that whites in town thought of him as different.  </P> <P> A few kids hailed McCool as "cuz" or "blood," as if he belonged to a gang.  School principals took him aside as he set up for dances, asking him not to  play too much rap music. And the cops seemed to pull his car over every week.  Once, McCool recalls, sheriff's deputies said they'd halted him because he was  driving 41 m.p.h. in a 40-m.p.h. zone. The constant stops ebbed only after he'd  become well-known locally. "I coached some of their kids," he says.  </P> <P> He really wasn't all that bothered. He has, he concedes, some biases of his  own. "When I see a Latino or a Chinese driver and don't like the way they're  driving, you try to blame it on where they come from," he says -- this from a  young man with a long string of his own parking tickets and moving violations.  </P> <P> Still, his father worried that he was spending so much time in such white  precincts. He thought his son was courting trouble. "If you eat," McCool Sr.  says, "you are going to bite your tongue sooner or later."  </P> <P> Ralph Tavlian, the baby in a family of eight children, speaker of Armenian,  Arabic and French, former resident of Lebanon, France and New York, grew  skilled early on in the ways of adapting to a new environment.  </P> <P> By the 1970s, he was absorbing the atmosphere at La Canada High School, where  the prospect of integration was Topic A.  </P> <P> The other kids were always saying things like, "They'll never bring niggers to  our school."  </P> <P> In class, "we learned that blacks were bought and sold . . . they were slaves  (once)," Tavlian recalls. He drew a conclusion. "They must be inferior. That  sticks."  </P> <P> He had nothing in particular against black people, he says. He didn't know any.  But he figured -- he still figures -- "they use the word nigger on TV in this  country. That's what everybody else in this country calls them."  </P> <P> He does not claim to have ever been a saint. He had a drug problem, he says,  though he is not forthcoming with details. He hung out with a motorcycle gang  in Tujunga and did time in Chino for robbery. In prison, he lifted weights with  the black guys. It was his first real contact with the people he'd heard so  much about.  </P> <P> "I felt the resentment they have toward the white person," he says. "And  they're a lot more open about it than whites. We're the blue-eyed devil. . . ."  </P> <P> He returned to what had become his home turf in the foothills. He was a laborer  for a while in Glendale's municipal parks department. Next, he got a mechanic's  job at a local Volkswagen dealership. He shared a home with a fiancee.  </P> <P> Then, in the mid-1980s, his life curdled. His father died. He got fired. His  romance fell apart. He quit smoking and drugs, but he kept right on drinking.  He acquired three drunk-driving convictions.  </P> <P> Six years ago, he rented garage space from McKenna's Auto Parts on Verdugo  Boulevard in Montrose and opened his own business: Ralph's Automotive,  specializing in German cars. He visited the convenience store at the Shell  station next door two or three times a day, buying six-packs as often as  snacks.  </P> <P> The station employees noted that he was bellicose when drunk, which was often.  Minorities were starting to show up occasionally in the area, and Tavlian  apparently was displeased. Once, a black customer dawdled at the register, one  former employee recalls, and Tavlian muttered about his taking so long. "Get  back where you came from," he said. When an Asian of any nationality annoyed  him, he would hiss about "that nip."  </P> <P> But he never confronted anyone face to face. He waited until they were out of  earshot.  </P> <P> "Sober, he's just normal. Alcohol tends to bring out negative traits," says  Tavlian's friend, Jim Winstanley, a Glendale parks maintenance worker. "He's  not a virulent racist. He's a mild racist. He's a racist if he's mad at you."  </P> <P> On July 11, 1989, Ralph Tavlian got mad at Johnny McCool.  </P> <P> McCool and Bond had spent the evening counseling a Y junior high group and were  headed afterward to a young woman's house. A mild wind fluttered. The air was  so clear that the distant skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles lit the horizon  as Bond's car rolled down toward Montrose.  </P> <P> The night did not seem nearly so fine to Tavlian. He'd had a few too many at a  Mexican restaurant and was reeling toward work, on foot because his driver's  license was suspended again. He cursed loudly to no one in particular.  </P> <P> Bond's car was low on gas, so he turned in at the Shell on Verdugo Boulevard.  As he parked by the pump, about 8:45 p.m., Tavlian staggered past. Bond and  McCool exchanged a glance. Check out that drunk, each one thought, but neither  said a thing.  </P> <P> Bond went inside the store to pay the cashier while McCool headed for the phone  to call the friend they planned to visit.  </P> <P> Tavlian, next door at his auto yard, thought he felt something small strike his  chest from the direction of the gas station. He peered over and saw about eight  people, among them the black man on the phone. He had his suspect.  </P> <P> Mark Bontjas, the night clerk at the Shell, was watching. No one threw  anything, he told police later. He saw Tavlian jump over the wall and run to  the booth, then tear the phone from McCool's hand. He heard Tavlian shouting  racial slurs over and over again. He saw Tavlian slap McCool.  </P> <P> "It felt like a movie," McCool says now, "and it felt like a dream."  </P> <P> Bond rushed to McCool's aid. He recalls that Tavlian asked The Question. "Why  are you friends with niggers?" he demanded to know. Bond gave his standard  response. That's when Tavlian tried to knee Bond in the groin.  </P> <P> The two friends held Tavlian to the ground while Bontjas called Glendale  police. In the presence of Officers Eric Sachs and Darrel McEntarffer, Bond  made a citizen's arrest.  </P> <P> "While in the police car," McEntarffer wrote later in his report, "Suspect  Tavlian stated, 'I have $30,000 in tools in my shop. I just get nervous when I  see niggers around.' "  </P> <P> The next morning, Tavlian woke up in his cell at the Glendale City Jail with  only a faint recollection of the previous 12 hours. At 9 a.m., he was led to a  tiny room with a plain table and three chairs. Two detectives waited to  question him.  </P> <P> "In my drunken mind, I singled him out," Tavlian told the detectives. "It was  strange for a black to be there." Then, backtracking: "I've never had any  problems with blacks, I have nothing against him. Why I singled him out, I  don't know."  </P> <P> He appeared sure of himself, almost cocky. But inside he squirmed. "They were  calling me a racist," he says. "I'm seeing myself in a white sheet burning a  cross. It was a degrading feeling."  </P> <P> By the end of the half-hour session, says Detective R. O. (Rusty) Hancock,  "There was no doubt in my mind that the only reason he singled out Mr. McCool  was because Mr. McCool was black."  </P> <P> Later that day, Tavlian was charged with one misdemeanor count of battery and  one felony count of interference with the exercise of civil rights.  </P> <P> Legal maneuvering stalled the outcome until Jan. 26, 1990. On that day,  then-Glendale Municipal Judge Charles Horan accepted a plea bargain.  </P> <P> The civil rights charge was dropped. Tavlian pleaded no contest to the battery  charge. According to plan, Horan sentenced him to six months in the county  jail.  </P> <P> "On the garden-variety battery with this level of injury, they wouldn't have  given jail time. They would say, 'Here's a fine and stay away from him,' " says  Charles Urtuzuastegui, Tavlian's attorney. "Here the seriousness was not in the  injury but was in the ramifications of allegations of racially motivated  remarks."  </P> <P> Tavlian spent 90 days at the county's alcohol rehabilitation center in Acton.  He was released and later served four months in jail for the battery and an  earlier drunk-driving charge.  </P> <P> McCool had no idea that the People vs. Ralph Tavlian was wending its way  through the judicial system. Detective Hancock left a telephone message for him  early on, but they missed connections. No one called again.  </P> <P> He told few others about the incident. "It's pretty personal on my part," he  says. Besides, "I wanted to forget about it myself."  </P> <P> But whenever he passed the gas station, even after it changed hands and became  a Mobil, he remembered. He wasn't deterred from attending the annual  Oktoberfest in Montrose recently, but he joked, a little nervously, with a  black friend "about how we would see how many white people got drunk and how  they act."  </P> <P> He still is best friends with Bond. His girlfriend of 10 months, whom he met at  the Y, is white.  </P> <P> But he is wary of white strangers now. Outside the familiar surroundings of the  Y, he wonders how they expect him to talk, whether they think he must be  stupid, or a thief, or worse.  </P> <P> He wonders, too, what those strangers might do. His first response to a  telephone call from a reporter about the incident was a sudden, sharp intake of  breath. "How do I know you're not just someone trying to get me?" he asked.  </P> <P> For his part, Ralph Tavlian says his life is in the midst of an overhaul. He is  back fixing cars at his bay behind McKenna's. He lives in an apartment nearby  with his mother. He is sober these days.  </P> <P> He remains bitter about his treatment by police and the time he had to serve.  He believes that he was made a scapegoat. "There's a lot of people who do a lot  worse than what I did," he says. He still talks about blacks being "nervy" and  mentions that blacks, not whites, are the ones selling crack on the streets.  </P> <P> But he is also noticing that resentment of his own group has increased in  direct proportion to the size of the local Armenian community, the  fastest-growing ethnic population in Glendale.  </P> <P> His golf buddies have begun to tease him by saying things like, "I see your  homeboys have bought another building in downtown Glendale." He shrugs off such  remarks; these are his friends, after all.  </P> <P> More disturbing was his 15-year-old nephew's report that the kids at school  call Armenians "Armos" and " 'mos."  </P> <P> He knows now where such talk can lead.  </P></p>

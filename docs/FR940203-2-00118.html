The Secretaries will evaluate applications using a two-phase review process. In the first phase of the review process, the Secretaries will use peer reviewers to evaluate applications using the selection criteria and the associated point values. In the second phase, review teams will visit high-ranking States to gain further information and further assess State plans. The second-phase review teams will use the criteria, but not necessarily the associated point values, in their information-gathering and assessment activities. Final funding decisions made by the Secretaries will be based on information gained during the site visits, the ranking of applications during the first-phase review, and such other factors as geographic balance and diversity of program approaches, replicability, sustainability, and innovation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comprehensive Statewide System. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (25 points) Is the School-to-Work Opportunities plan described in the application likely to produce systemic statewide change that will have substantial impact on the preparation of youth for a first job in a high-skill, high-wage career and in increasing their opportunities for further education? Does the plan provide information reflecting the needs of each local labor market area in the designated geographic areas of the State? Does the State propose a feasible plan for expanding the system to ensure that all geographic areas of the State, including communities with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth, will have an opportunity to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs within a reasonable period of time? Is the process for assessing skills and issuing skill certificates likely to lead to portable credentials for students and are the skills adequately benchmarked to high quality standards such as those envisioned in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act? Does the State's process for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces and meet the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations? Has the State described State and local performance standards that should lead to statewide systemic reform of secondary education?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (25 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

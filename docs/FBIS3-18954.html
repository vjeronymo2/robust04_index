			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Secretary General Philippe </F> Vasseur by Sophie Huet; place and date not given: "Presidential  Election: Debate Poisons Political Life"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Huet] There is no question  now that the presidential precampaign has begun. Since the  issue was raised by your own party, are you favorable to the  notion of the UDF [Union for the French Democracy] having its  own presidential candidate, or would you rather have a single  candidate for the majority?    [Vasseur] I think we have been fostering a loathsome  political climate. Let us be cautious: The Left has not lost  the presidential election yet! This is worth a warning, or even  a shout of alarm. The government's authority is being slowly  undermined. And I believe that although people have every right  to discuss what is being done, they have no right to denigrate.  All those who have been almost systematically denigrating the  government are picking the wrong fight. Because if the  government falls, so will the majority.    As for the presidential election, I believe that it is  unwise  to publicly air personal squabbles, and that we all bear some  responsibility for it. In other words, this is a debate that  poisons our political life. We should not be obsessed by the  presidential election. Thinking about it and preparing it is  fine; thinking about it constantly, but not speaking of it at  all. Indeed, what is wrong is bringing the general public into  our quarrels. Let us wait until the vote on the budgetary bill,  that is, until late autumn, before we tackle the problem head  on. Right now, I am opposed to any antagonistic debate on the  matter. I would add that attempting to capitalize on the prime  minister's declining ratings is indicative of excessive haste.    [Huet] When some people call for the UDF fielding its own  presidential candidate, do you think this is meant to increase  pressure?    [Vasseur] In a way, yes. Dealing with the issue in such a  way inevitably causes pressures. There is a definite lack of  calm    [Huet] Are you favorable to a single candidate of the  majority for the presidential election?    [Vasseur] I believe one should be able to mention the  possibility without anyone feeling threatened. The single  candidacy is certainly problematic because what we currently  have is a diverse, many-faceted majority. There is not one  person that embodies the whole of this majority. The very fact  that we have been considering "primaries" demonstrates there is  diversity. The only answer to this is to pursue the logic of  union. And I ask two questions: First, is everyone ready to  play the game when it comes to primaries, or any other procedure  meant to select a presidential candidate; and, second, are we  ready to unite behind whatever single candidate whom would thus  be chosen? I for one am ready for this. But we need to look at  it from a strategic viewpoint.    [Huet] Is it not true that the notion of a single candidate  inevitably leads to that of establishing a single organization  of the majority after the 1995 election?    [Vasseur] This would indeed be in line with the choice of a  single majority candidate. I am a passionate advocate of both  union and the preservation of the identity of political parties  and -- as far as the UDF is concerned -- their various  components. The two notions are not incompatible. However,  should we choose to establish a single organization, it would  have to be a confederation. If we were to high-handedly kill  our various parties, membership would suffer. Being in the same  political family would cause tensions and centrifugal risks, as  some people would have one foot inside the organization and the  other outside. The best way to unite people is not to forcibly  herd them into the same pen. The purpose of the Republican  Party is rather to be the fulcrum on which a single movement  might be established, with every component being given equal  regard. But the issue of a potential "presidential party" will  definitely arise after the election.    [Huet] What do you think of holding "primary elections,"  an idea raised once again by Interior Minister Charles Pasqua in  this paper?    [Vasseur] I always thought it an excellent idea in theory.  Now, we are told that we need to legislate. But is this not a  little late in the day? Will this not exacerbate passions  further, revive tensions? Furthermore, such a system creates an  extra first round, since the first round of the presidential  election already is a kind of primary. This would usher in  another kind of logic. If we want to continue down this road,  we also need to confront the issue of the first round in  parliamentary elections. Because in a way, the notion of  "primaries" calls into question the principle of selecting the  president of the Republic in a two-round election.    Also, if the bill goes through in the spring session -- and  go through it will -- and if we hold primaries in January 1995,  the campaign will take place right in the middle of the  budgetary session. That will hardly make for a healthier  political climate!    To sum things up, I think this is an excellent idea because  primaries are a way to avoid a dogfight between majority leaders  -- but there are both benefits and drawbacks to the exercise. I  do not mind going through with it, but I do have a few qualms,  as some potential candidates may be tempted not to play by the  rules, arguing that the spirit of the Constitution calls for a  vote from the whole population. Therefore there may be a  "boomerang" effect. Once the bill has been voted, the political  game will not be any calmer, and this will inevitably extend the  electoral campaign.    [Huet] What if primaries should prove impossible to  organize?    [Vasseur] If we do not succeed, we will have no choice but  to have two candidates. There is an obvious risk that the two  presidential candidates may be at each other's throat before the  first round of voting. The other risk is that once elected, a  candidate might hoard all the "spoils," that is, appropriate  every single position to be filled, allocate himself all the  seats up for election. To avoid this, it is essential that the  two men enter into a veritable "contract" before the  presidential election. Such a contract would include a  "minimum-service" clause, a code for good electoral behavior, so  that the two men are unable to attack each other overtly, to  criticize each other's policies, and so as to ensure that the  rule of reciprocal withdrawal works properly. The way I see it,  such a contract must go even further: It must delineate the way  the potential president of the Republic intends to govern the  country and with which men. I would also like this contract to  be made public before the first round.</p>

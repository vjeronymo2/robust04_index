			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boualapha Thindoi: "The Campaign in Which the </F> Enemy First Used B-52's in Laos"]    [Text] Although the Redeem Honor campaign took place 20  years ago, nevertheless the fear which this campaign inspired in  those who experienced it as well as those who were adversely  affected by the war, such as the people of Xieng Khouang  Province, will be difficult to forget because everything about  it was very destructive. It brought disaster to the people of  Xieng Khouang as never before in history.    The name of the campaign, "Redeem Honor," does not indicate  how violent and fierce it was. We might think that the meaning  of "redeem honor" was that the imperialists and their lackeys  would concentrate all their forces to redeem their honor and  dignity. In fact this campaign came about after the imperialist  invaders and their subordinates suffered a major defeat in the  "O-D-N" solidarity campaign and other campaigns in Xieng Khouang  Province and throughout the liberated areas. They assembled all  their forces, including modern weapons, and poured them into the  area of the Plain of Jars on a large scale. They hoped to redeem  themselves from their defeats. They used more than 50  battalions, including mercenary soldiers from other countries  which they assembled to wage war. These forces received air  support from the imperialists who flew no less than 300 sorties  per day and some days up to 500 sorties. They brutally poured  bombs on the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang. It was in this  campaign that they first used strategic B-52 bombers to destroy  the liberated areas of Laos and that they first applied the  strategic military theory of their leadership in Laos. This made  the "Redeem Honor" campaign one of the most fierce,  life-or-death struggles between the revolutionary forces and the  enemy in the almost 30-year history of the resistance against  invasion. They used the scheme of total destruction in hopes of  making the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang a white zone [area  with no Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) presence] and  seizing this strategic area. They used all types of aircraft to  drop time-delay bombs, cluster bombs, napalm etc. in conjunction  with artillery in support of a large-scale attack by ground  forces to clear the area. They used aircraft to drop soldiers to  seize the important high areas by threat and encirclement. They  used aircraft equiped with loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda  from the air to threaten the people and revolutionary forces and  make them surrender.    This destructive war brought great losses to the people of  Xieng Khouang. In addition to the loss of life and property,  many thousands of the people of Xieng Khouang suffered the  misfortune of being forced to flee from their home villages and  become refugees living in areas under enemy control. This left  Xieng Khouang an overgrown, abandoned place where it was  difficult to find a house standing.    Nevertheless in this campaign the imperialists and their  lackeys were not able to redeem themselves from their defeats.  The patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang, because of  their patriotism and in order to redeem the honor of Laos, were  brave and willing to sacrifice lives for their beloved  fatherland. They counterattacked fiercely and kept advancing.  From the beginning of August 1969 to 10 February 1970 the  attacks of the patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang  grew steadily fiercer so that the enemy was cornered and his  forces were destroyed. During just 13 days and nights at the end  of this campaign the armed forces and the people of Xieng  Khouang put 7,000 of the enemy out of action, took almost 1,000  who surrendered, and seized and destroyed more than 2,000  weapons. Of these 25 were artillery pieces. They seized and  destroyed 70 vehicles. They shot down and destroyed a number of  aircraft. They seized and destroyed more than 100 [radio]  telegraphs. This campaign ended on 22 February 1970. In total  the enemy lost 6,246 of its forces who were killed, captured or  who surrendered. More than 1,000 deserted, and 2,723 of various  sorts of weapons were seized and destroyed. They seized and  destroyed 121 military vehicles and shot down and destroyed a  number of aircraft. They took back the Plain of Jars in Xieng  Khouang completely. As a result the "Redeem Honor" campaign of  the imperialist invaders was another shameful disgrace.</p>

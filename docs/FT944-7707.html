			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Woolworth says profits outlook 'encouraging' Woolworth, Australia's second largest retailer, said yesterday that sales and profits in the current year were slightly ahead of budget, and that the outlook for the full year's profits was 'encouraging', writes Nikki Tait. It said that the 10.2 per cent same-store sales increase for the first quarter, to end-September, had continued in ensuing weeks. However, Mr Paul Simon, chairman, warned at the company's annual meeting that Australia's current drought could partly offset the benefits of continuing economic growth, both in terms of the supply and price of products. He stressed that the company had no plans to make a big acquisition or move into Asia as a retail force. However, he said Woolworth hoped to build links with Asian retailers via a consultancy role, and as a supplier of fresh food and vegetables.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Renault takes the wheel Given Volvo's waning fortunes in recent years, it is no surprise that its French partner should have come out on top in its automotive merger negotiations. Not only has Renault taken a two-thirds stake in the new company; the merger comes as Volvo's earnings are starting to improve following the Swedish krona's devaluation and a period of rigorous cost-cutting. Renault, now suffering from the downturn in the European car market, has effectively acquired what might be termed a recovery stock, with some exposure, albeit small, to the US car market. The danger is that the new combine will be too ready to believe its own propaganda about cost benefits. Its claim to be able to generate savings of FFr30bn by 2000 can be little more than guesswork. The real test will be how well the companies manage to fuse two different cultures without destroying the value of the Volvo brand, and how the new model development goes. Many of the other supposed benefits were available under existing collaboration. Having decided that it is better to own 35 per cent of a large automotive company than all of a small one, Volvo is in a curious position. Its automotive interests will remain its largest part, but it will have no direct control over them. One assumes that a desire to take charge of its own destiny will inevitably lead it more deeply into its remaining consumer goods activities. In that case, a sale of at least its 17.85 per cent direct stake in the new company would be on the cards eventually. Yesterday's deal would then be seen as just a stage in a longer farewell to the motor industry.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / The era of no-commitment capitalism An executive in a big US insurance group confesses that it throws out unopened the annual reports of companies in which it invests. This group, along with many others, now relies on computers to guide its investment policy rather than analysis. This trend , however, can lead to imprudent investment. The insurance company's investments are largely driven by the pseudo-scientific techniques of group rotation. This involves investors shifting their portfolios from, say, defence stocks to regional banks. All the subtleties and nuances of a particular business escape them. Either they do not care, because they are trading a particular industrial sector as a whole, or they do not know, because their computers miss so many fine-grained distinctions. Those computers suffer from two big handicaps. First, they cannot see what is going on in the world. Being strong on history but weak on current events, they can only reason by analogy from the past. Second, faced with the overload of too many unquantifiable forces at work - the Bundesbank, the collapse of the Soviet empire, to name two - the computer does what any of us with an instinct for survival would do - it ducks. It focuses on one or two factors and makes believe all the other variables will remain constant. Computers, of course, are not the real problem; the problem is us. Rather than attach great weight to matters which are inherently uncertain, we cling to the facts about which we feel more confident, even though they may be less relevant. The increasingly popular alternative to sector rotation and other such active strategies has been to become passive, and track the market indices. By some estimates a third of US pension fund equities are now indexed - they consist of a selection of stocks that match those of a top market index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. For an indexer, there is no need to read financial statements. The asset allocators and the indexers, who now control a majority of US pension funds and other managed equities, may seem worlds apart, yet they have much in common. Active or passive, the focus has not been on particular businesses but always on the market. Beat it by a nanosecond (the actives) or join it (the passives). A more appropriate programme is both simple and difficult. The simple part is to think small and establish whether a company has a well-defined market position, an excellent balance sheet, an ability to weather industry downturns, a good management and a reasonable share price. The difficult part is to buy against the crowd. Keynes wrote to a friend 50 years ago: 'To suppose that safety first consists in having a small gamble in a large number of different directions . . . as compared with a substantial stake in a company where one's information is adequate, strikes me as a travesty of investment policy.' Keynes felt he could not know more than a few companies at a time. Peter Lynch, who ran Fidelity's large Magellan fund for many years, kept track of hundreds, but then he hardly slept. My larger concern is that US institutions, which now manage more than half the country's equities, up from one-third in 1980, are ignoring their social responsibility through computer-driven investing. By focusing, for example, on short-term performance criteria, US institutions sold some big airlines in the 1980s to unsuitable buyers, not caring what happened to the employees or the millions who depended on their services. Officers responsible for corporate pension funds could mitigate these problems by insisting that equity managers hold no more than 20 stocks and that they maintain an average holding period of at least two years. They could also require that the managers put a big part of their personal wealth in the fund they manage. Computers cannot fathom the reach of the human spirit or the depth of our frailties; they are indifferent to social effects. This capitalism of computer analytics, this capitalism without knowledgeable and committed capitalists, lends itself to abuse that the larger community cannot countenance for long.

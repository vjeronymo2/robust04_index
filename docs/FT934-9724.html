			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar disappointment THE DOLLAR failed to rise against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, languishing near the bottom of its DM1.65 to DM1.70 range, writes Emma Tucker. Its performance disappointed dollar bulls, who were hoping to see the currency build on last week's promising performance. With interest rates in Germany set to decline further towards the end of this year, and faster US growth encouraging talk of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, many investors believe the dollar's next move will be upwards. There were no particular reasons for the currency's sluggishness yesterday. Some dealers attributed it to the con-tinued effects of profit-taking that followed the dollar's brief foray through DM1.70 last week. News that German M3 was revised down to an annual rate of 6.8 per cent from a provisional 7 per cent had little effect on the market. But the revision moved M3's annualised growth rate closer to the top of its 4.5 to 6.5 target range and helped to reinforce expectations that rates in Germany will come down towards the year-end, or early in 1994. 'There is a real prospect that M3 will come back within its target range by the end of the year,' commented Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS. 'Then we will see the Bundesbank focus on the real economy rather than monetary aggregates, and that will fuel speculation on interest rate cuts.' Inflation figures in the US today could trigger a rise in the dollar, although Mr Avinash Persaud at JP Morgan said it is still too early for the Fed to consider an increase in rates. 'I think we are in a long term bull track for the dollar, but the markets have to sense that the Fed, when it makes its first move, has plenty of excuses,' he added. He believes that the current picture coming from the US of fast growth but subdued inflation does not provide the Fed with the necessary background for a tightening of policy. The dollar ended in London at DM1.6850, compared with Friday's close of DM1.6915. It finished New York trading at DM1.6851. Trading in European currencies was uneventful. The pound was weaker against the D-Mark, which was marginally stronger virtually across the board. The market shrugged off UK economic statistics showing that prices of manufactured goods are rising at a slower rate than two months ago, while consumer borrowing rose in September for the second successive month. Sterling closed two pfennigs down at DM2.4950. Against the dollar it finished softer at Dollars 1.4805, compared with Friday's Dollars 1.4865. The Belgian franc was slightly firmer against the German currency, finishing at BFr21.26 compared with the close of BFr21.35 at the end of last week. The French franc stood at FFr3.479 against the D-Mark, mildly below Friday's FFr3.475.</p>

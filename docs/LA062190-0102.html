			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> AID TO HOMELESS PROJECTS  </P> <P> The City Council has directed its staff to look into ways of funding shelters  for the homeless and to work with developers of a homeless project that has  been stymied by city regulations.  </P> <P> George Bosy, who with his business partner, Mike Damico, has converted the Four  Aces Motel into a refuge for the homeless, asked the council to cut through red  tape that he said is blocking plans to refurbish and install 10 mobile homes on  their property.  </P> <P> Bosy said 85 people, most of them formerly homeless, already are living at the  motel and he would like to use the mobile homes to expand the program.  </P> <P> City officials said Bosy's plan violates city ordinances and would require an  amendment to the General Plan, new zoning regulations and environmental  studies.  </P> <P> Bosy said he does not plan a full-scale mobile home park with all the amenities  that the city would require, but instead is seeking permission to provide basic  housing for homeless people while they get their lives back in order.  </P></p>

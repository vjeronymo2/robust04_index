			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden savours delights of devaluation  -Many believe that the revival has much further to go Nothing does more to get a stock market going than an unexpected devaluation, as Sweden has become the latest European country to demonstrate. Swedish equities have climbed by 13 per cent since the krona was floated last Thursday, and such was the excitement on Friday that turnover more than doubled to SKr2.7bn (over Dollars 400m), some five times its level of a week earlier. It slipped back to SKr916m yesterday. Many believe the revival has further to go. They suggest that in the next two months the Affarsvarlden General index, which closed at 841.3 yesterday, may yet be able to climb back to the 912 level at which it began the year, or even to the 1,000 mark which it touched briefly in May. Even for foreign investors, this would be adequate compensation for the effective devaluation of the krona against the dollar of 11 per cent to date. The atmosphere of sudden hope marks a dramatic change from the mood of late summer and early autumn when high interest rates, gloom about the state of the domestic economy and the general world recession saw the Affarsvarlden sink 37 per cent in just under five months to October 5. The major beneficiaries of the recent rally have been the export-orientated multinationals, the weaker krona improving their competitiveness sharply. No sector has performed better than forestry, now felt to be back on level terms with rivals which benefited from the weak dollar and a devalued Finnish markka earlier in the year. The forest index has soared more than 30 per cent since the krona floated, climbing by a massive 19 per cent on Friday alone. Yet if Friday saw virtually all shares swept higher in an indiscriminate buying spree, more selective buying has since become the pattern, and profit-taking has set in. Some companies are not beneficiaries of a devaluation, such as the clothing chain Hennes and Mauritz (down 6 per cent since Wednesday), while the banks remain overshadowed by concerns about the size of their credit losses and have rallied only marginally. In the short term, the market may well see a correction. There has still been no formal relaxation of interest rates and the impression is growing that Sweden is going to maintain a tight monetary policy to protect its currency from weakening further and to hold down inflation. Indeed, the central bank's overnight lending rate remains at 12.5 per cent, one percentage point higher than last Wednesday. There could also be an adverse effect on sentiment if Finland goes ahead with a planned general strike on Thursday. But the feeling persists that December and January will be good months for the bourse. One reason is past experience has shown that a devaluation is a good time to buy shares. Another is that there was a lot of pent-up demand after the gloom of the summer and early autumn - hence the record volumes which the bourse has seen in recent days. Swedish buyers are now strongly back in the market, and foreign institutions have become net buyers again after a summer lull. 'The Swedish stock market has decoupled itself from the state of the domestic economy, because we are seeing foreign investors buying shares in internationally-orientated companies,' says Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share Promotion. He notes that share prices were already starting to move upwards, even before the flotation took place, because of the weight of foreign buying in the market. For the pessimists, however, there is still plenty to worry about. Economic fundamentals have not altered, with 1993 expected to be the third consecutive year during which Swedish GNP falls. The budget deficit continues to grow and further austerity measures are expected. The banking system remains in crisis. Internationally, currency instability persists while Germany, Sweden's largest export market, is facing an economic downturn. In other words, the mood of buoyancy is all too prone to a setback until there is firmer evidence of Swedish and world economic recovery.</p>

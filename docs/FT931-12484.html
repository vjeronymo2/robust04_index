			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charity in fashion / A look at Benetton's latest campaign and finds style more evident than substance Benetton's advertising chief, Oliviero Toscani, relishes controversy and for much of 1992 seemed determined to attract it. The Italian clothes company, after all, has been roundly attacked for what many consider its obscurely gloomy or just plain tasteless campaigns. Following newly-born babies, dying Aids patients and oil-slicked seabirds, Benetton has now returned to an earlier cheeky advertising style. The company's latest press and magazine ad features Luciano Benetton - group founder and vice-president - naked but discreetly veiled by large black type. In the ad, Luciano Benetton calls on customers to donate their unwanted clothes - all brands, not just Benetton's - to his 7,047 worldwide stores. Here they will be taken by Benetton trucks for redistribution to Africa, Asia and Yugoslavia by charities such as the Red Cross and Caritas. For a fashion company like Benetton it is important to keep at the forefront of style, be it in the design of clothes or advertising. Many have accused the company of meretricious advertising which was indifferent to human feelings; indeed, one year ago Luciano Benetton said 'making charitable contributions . . . isn't our job'. He said then that Benetton's advertising was neither intended to offend nor to sell knitwear, but to 'raise social awareness' by simply provoking people into a reconsideration of the world they live in. To some extent what Benetton is doing is a reflection of industry confusion over the future of brand advertising. Some of the world's largest manufacturers of consumer products - including Heinz and Nestle - are currently debating whether it makes sense to plough hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising, when the connection with sales performance has become increasingly difficult to establish. Nestle, for instance, is now showing considerable interest in direct marketing, sending out 50,000 UK mail shots - including pasta samples - to promote its Buitoni brand, a different and cheaper approach to the conventional, expensive TV advertising campaign. But there is no overall pattern; multinationals in other sectors - particularly motor manufacturers in the US and Europe - have announced, through the course of 1992, heavily increased television advertising budgets. By proclaiming the splintering and changing nature of advertising, Toscani may therefore be pushing at open doors. Where he differs from mainstream advertising bosses is by maintaining that what Benetton is doing is partly an attempt to subvert the nature of advertising. In his decade at the top, Benetton's advertising has made no reference to jeans, jumpers or jackets; when published, each photograph has just carried the small 'united colours of Benetton' green and white logo. Toscani is hostile to what he regards as the conventional form of advertising, the promotion of branded products by means of massive expenditure. He asserts that such advertising is redundant, in a world where, he feels, 'people take it for granted that all products of a certain type are more or less of the same quality'. Rather than continue to use it as a perhaps inadequate sales tool, Toscani says it should instead be the means whereby a company communicates its core philosophy to a wider audience, prodding people into a sometimes uncomfortable awareness of their surrounding world. Benetton's offbeat marketing strategy means that Toscani has been liberated from any concern about boosting Benetton's sales, which nonetheless increased by 7 per cent to L 1,233bn (Pounds 586.3m) in the first half of its current financial year, up to the end of September 1992. Benetton restricts its advertising budget to 4 per cent of its annual revenue; from that relatively small spend it has attracted a disproportionate amount of public awareness, by no means all adverse. Toscani even suggests that spending large sums on advertising may well be seen as morally questionable: 'We spend on advertising in one year in Italy what Fiat spends in one day. With the amount large multinationals spend on advertising they could make the best campaign in the world against drug abuse, for example.' To be fair, multinationals like Unilever and Mars are trying to sell individually branded consumer products; Benetton can perhaps afford to occupy the high ground because it is in a different game, that of trying to sell a company image inextricably linked to fashion accessories. Nevertheless, Toscani intends trying to explode further the whole basis of advertising, paradoxically using his influential position with Benetton to try to develop more open attitudes. 'Advertising people have done a lot of social damage by telling us a lot of lies, using fake images and fake dreams to sell us their products, so that today if you are a girl you really are a nobody if you don't look like Isabella Rosselini and if you are a boy you are nothing if you haven't got at least a 16-valved engine.' Benetton's latest campaign, featuring the semi-naked Luciano Benetton, can thus be seen on one level as another finely-calculated contortion. Once again it eschews conventional branding; it simply flings a provocative image in the face of 1,000 magazine and 150 newspaper readers, startling them into awareness of the company. Yet far from exhorting people to go out and buy Benetton clothes, the advertisements ask readers to give clothes to Benetton for deserving causes. Hardly advertising, in the conventional sense. Benetton is first and foremost a fashion company, and fashion is notoriously full of contradictions. Last year, charity was not for Benetton; this year it is. It is perhaps as great a mistake to look for consistency in Benetton's advertising as it is to seek it in other aspects of the fashion business.</p>

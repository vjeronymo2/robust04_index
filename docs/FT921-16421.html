			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Management: How to sell raincoats to Russians - Anthony Robinson on the problems encountered by Littlewoods in setting up shop in St Petersburg The Christmas day dissolution of the Soviet Union and New Year's liberalisation of prices have dramatically changed the rules of the game for foreign investors. The myth of 280m strong 'Soviet' consumers as the last great untapped market has been laid to rest. Instead investors have to face the new reality of a jig-saw of republics which are all virtually bankrupt and of hyper-inflation which is rapidly destroying what remained of rouble purchasing power. Trade has been reduced largely to primitive barter - both internally and with the outside world. It was not what was expected by Littlewoods, the British mail order and department store group owned by the Moores family of Liverpool, when it embarked 21 months ago on a plan to enter the Soviet market. But, unlike other investors who have been deterred by recent events, Littlewoods has pressed ahead, building on its hard-earned experience. Philip Abbott, the man chosen to run the first store in St Petersburg was plucked from running Littlewoods' Harrogate branch. An enthusiastic and energetic Yorkshireman, he says the company had a lot of learning to do as it looked for local partners, examined all aspects of hard and soft currency trading and sought appropriate premises. Finding reliable Russian partners with the right contacts and a desire to learn western methods is a pre-condition for success. Littlewoods paired up with Alexei Abramov, managing director of Gostiny Dvor, a pre-revolutionary complex of small, bazaar-type shops, a mini-version of Moscow's famous GUM complex on Red Square. Littlewoods has chosen a yellow two-storey neo-classical building on Nevsky Prospekt, the main shopping street of the former imperial capital, a broad boulevard lined with classical and art nouveau buildings from the turn of the century, which cuts straight through the faded elegance of the city. Given the shortage of virtually everything, Littlewoods - or any other western retailer - is assured of unlimited demand for its products. The problem is how to find a rouble-based supplier capable of delivering the right quality and on time. Littlewoods found such a supplier in Sergei Petrov, chairman of the Mayak textile company which he rents from the state and manages. Mayak now has a 10 per cent stake in the three way joint venture, while Littlewoods has a 60 per cent and Gostiny Dvor, the remaining 30 per cent. Petrov's biggest problem is finding enough high quality cloth to produce the quality demanded by Littlewoods. The British company, which has invested around Pounds 1m in its Russian venture, supplies Mayak with some textiles and also uses its St Petersburg store as a useful outlet for last season's unsold stock. Given the hyper-inflation of the rouble, foreign investors have to find ways of protecting themselves. Littlewoods carefully separates its store into two departments, one for rouble sales and the other for hard currency. One of the key management objectives is keeping the hard currency component of sales in the rouble store to a minimum - about 95 per cent of rouble sales come from locally sourced products. The hard currency section sells mainly imported products to anybody able to pay in any of 12 convertible currencies. Most of the customers are from the new class of Russian entrepreneurs and fixers who have access to hard currency and like to display their new wealth by wearing imported designer clothes. Some are local racketeers who control the hard currency prostitution rings and other activities now left alone by a demoralised police force. In addition to imported goods, which are often held up by supply and transport difficulties at the tiny airport and overloaded docks, the hard currency store also sells high-quality raincoats made by Mayak and a small range of other rouble sourced products. Any increase in the number of successful joint ventures would raise the supply of locally sourced high-quality goods capable of sale for hard currency and make life a lot easier both for Littlewoods and other foreign retailers. Meanwhile, access to the hard currency section is controlled by guarded turnstiles. Simple possession of hard currency opens the door. Access to the rouble store, guarded by a large policeman, is actually more difficult. In practice it is by invitation only. In this city of once powerful defence plants fallen on hard times, local plant managers compete to be allowed the privilege of letting their best workers shop at Littlewoods. 'We have a quota of between 300 and 400 rouble customers a day,' says Abbott. Used to endless hours of queuing, customers wait patiently in line before being allowed to enter the warm, well-lit and empty store to chose no more than two garments. 'Given the high rouble inflation rate we are seriously considering a less orderly approach,' says Abbott. 'If we opened the store to everybody we would sell out of stock within hours and would then have to keep the store closed for a week. The advantage to us is that we would take in roubles and then immediately exchange them for dollars on the St Petersburg stock and commodity exchange.' During December alone the rouble fell from Rbs99 to the dollar to over Rbs130. Against this sort of background 'the quicker we convert roubles into dollars the better,' Abbott adds. Foreign investors like Littlewoods also have the option of taking the long view and re-investing rouble profits in real estate or other assets. Anatoli Sobchak, the radical mayor of St Petersburg, continually urges potential investors to re-invest their rouble profits by purchasing assets in the City. But this is another tricky area given the still unclear nature of existing property laws and general legal confusion which surrounds the extraordinarily complex task of re-creating a capitalist framework after more than seven decades of state ownership and authoritarian central planning. The solution usually depends on the status and contacts of the Russian joint venture partner, an increasing number of whom are former army and naval officers or managers of military factories, desperate to become 'biznessmen' as the armed forces shrink and the military factories run out of orders. But Littlewoods' choice of Russian joint venture partners gives it the opportunity to invest rouble profits in expanding its operations and this is what it is about to do, Abbott said. 'The opportunities for 1992 are tremendous. We are looking at six new stores. It took us 21 months to open our first store, but we were learning all the time. Finding and opening new stores will be a much easier business.'</p>

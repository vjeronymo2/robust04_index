			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / US job figure dents hope of fast growth THE Clinton administration's hopes of a strong US economic recovery were dented yesterday by far weaker than expected employment figures for June. The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose only 13,000 last month, about a tenth of the increase predicted by Wall Street analysts. The figures  -the latest in a string of recent weak statistics - prompted heavy selling of shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 26.57 points at 3483.97. President Bill Clinton said the economy was moving ahead but only in 'fits and starts'. He said shaky job creation reflected the adverse domestic impact of military base closures as well as lack of investment spending. The international economic slowdown was also undermining job prospects in the US. Manufacturing employment fell 53,000 in June, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The manufacturing workforce has contracted by about 1 per cent since February and by nearly 10 per cent since the last peak reached in January 1989. The decline in factory jobs last month, however, was more than offset by higher employment in retailing and other service industries. Officials said the June employment figures might have been misleadingly weak because the survey of the workforce was conducted earlier in the month than usual. On several previous occasions this has led to an erratically low employment count. Last month's figures should also be set against substantial gains in payroll employment of 255,000 and 215,000 in April and May respectively. Figures for both months were revised higher in the latest report. For the second quarter as a whole, the average monthly increase in employment was 162,000, against 161,000 in the first quarter and an average of about 80,000 last year. On Wall Street, analysts differed sharply in their analysis of the figures. Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said the June data were 'clearly an aberration'. Following a substantial increase in both employment and hours worked in the second quarter 'the economy was poised for solid gains.' There was no reason to revise the bank's forecast of growth at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the second half. Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said the employment figures fitted a recent pattern of 'gravely disappointing' economic news. Cuts in defence spending and planned tax increases threatened to create a vicious circle of declining confidence, weak demand and falling incomes.</p>

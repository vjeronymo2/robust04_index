			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Pay off Every penny's now under scrutiny at Control Securities, what with newly revealed negative net assets of Pounds 31.8m as well as debts exceeding Pounds 250m. So the property company may well be regretting a certain Pounds 5,000 outlay in its last financial year. The money was donated to the election fund of Labour MP Keith Vaz who has championed the cause of depositors of collapsed bank BCCI. And who can forget that on the last day of Control's 1992 financial year its then chairman Nazmu Virani was arrested in connection with the BCCI affair? But at least Control was fairly even-handed. It gave Pounds 1,750 to the Liberal Democrat party too.</p>

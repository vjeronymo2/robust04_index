The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Trust is a closed-end diversified management investment company whose shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). In accordance with NYSE rules, the Trust holds annual meetings of shareholders. LAMCO, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. From its inception in 1986 through May 27, 1994, the Trust's sole investment manager and administrator was Growth Stock Outlook Inc. (``GSO''). On May 27, 1994, following shareholder approval, the Trust entered into a fund management agreement with LAMCO. Under the terms of that agreement, LAMCO provides a ``multi-manager'' methodology of portfolio management with respect to an initial amount equal to 20% of the Trust's total net assets (the ``Multi-Managed Assets''). The remainder of the Trust's assets are managed by GSO acting under a separate investment advisory agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Multi-Managed Assets may be increased or decreased as a result of investment income, gains or losses on such assets, and dividends, distributions and operating expenses payable on such assets. In addition, under the terms of an Asset Acquisition and Fund Management Transition Agreement dated February 9, 1994, among LAMCO, GSO and GSO's principal stockholder, it is contemplated that, subject to certain conditions that must be met prior to the Trust's 1996 annual meeting of shareholders, a new fund management agreement may be entered into with LAMCO with respect to all the assets of the Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. LAMCO has allocated the Multi-Managed Assets on an approximately equal basis among three independent investment management firms (the ``Sub-Advisers'') acting under identical sub-advisory agreements with the Trust and LAMCO approved by shareholders at their May 27, 1994 meeting. LAMCO selected and recommended the Sub-Advisers using certain specific criteria. In that regard, each of the present and future Sub-Advisers must consistently employ a distinct, identifiable investment style that differs from those of the other Sub-Advisers. Further, the range of styles must be sufficiently broad so that at least one of them may be expected to be in favor in all reasonably foreseeable market conditions. Finally, each Sub-Adviser's longer-term investment performance must be satisfactory when compared to other investment management firms employing a similar style. The goal of this multi-manager methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets is to produce better investment performance over time with less volatility than that of the average single-manager fund with the same investment objective and policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. LAMCO continuously reviews the performance of the Sub-Advisers to identify the presence of factors or conditions that would tend to neutralize the effect of the multi-management methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets, such as a departure by a Sub-Adviser from its investment style, a deterioration in its investment performance relative to that of other investment management firms employing similar styles, or an adverse change in its personnel or organization. Based upon its review, LAMCO recommends appropriate changes in Sub-Advisers. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

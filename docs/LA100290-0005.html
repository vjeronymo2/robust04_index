			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA PRESIDENT DE KLERK  </P> <P> Once again we're inured with Jessie Jackson's dogmatic love of rhetoric ("Why  Then Embrace De Klerk?" Commentary, Sept. 27).  </P> <P> By propping up Iraq President Saddam Hussein and trying to make a feeble  comparison between two very different circumstances, Jackson shows his very  selective racial preferences, i.e., anyone who is not white.  </P> <P> Jackson states: "The world acknowledges that South Africa is a racist state."  Jackson's mind is a "racist state," and I challenge him to show me one nation  free of racism.  </P> <P> Jackson thinks we should "talk it out" with Hussein. If Jackson were held at  gunpoint by a thief, would he talk it out?  </P> <P> He informs us that (South Africa President Frederik) "De Klerk's security  police are now implicated in the current violence among black South Africans."  No, Jesse. Black tribes fight among each other like Crips and Bloods -- yet I  trust you will continue to believe that all black peoples' sufferings are  caused by whites.  </P> <P> A die-hard liberal. I always thought that a black U.S. President would show our  love of liberty and equality. But honestly, I have black friends who are more  qualified for the office than this habitual demagogue.  </P> <P> FREDERICK CLEVELAND  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

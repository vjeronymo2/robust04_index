			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures were enlivened yesterday by the appearance of a US house as a buyer of more than 200 of the December contracts and also by extensive rolling-over of December positions into the March contract, writes Terry Byland. December moved up sharply to regain the 2,000 mark, albeit briefly. Traders interpreted the move to roll-over positions into the first of the 1993 contracts as 'very bullish.' In early trading, December showed a premium of around 20 points against the cash market - 2,805 was the high water mark for the contract. Pressure eased off later but at the close the December contract was still showing a comfortable premium of about 4 points above its fair value premium of 5 against cash. Open positions of around 35,000 December contracts imply substantial roll-over requirements of at least 20,000 contracts before the end of the month, indicating that daily volumes will move above yesterday's level, according to strategists. Traded options were busy, recording 32,955 contracts against 22,510 in the previous session. Business in the FT-SE contract increased from 9,715 to 10,374. Individual stocks were headed by Asda with 6,673 contracts. Also active were stocks featuring in the day's list of corporate reports. Hanson recorded 1,427 contracts and Grand Metropolitan 952.</p>

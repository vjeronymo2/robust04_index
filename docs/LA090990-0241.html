			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANTING IN NATIVE SOIL MAY BE BEST BET;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: SOME EXPERTS FEEL THAT ORGANIC AMENDMENTS MAY BE HARMFUL WHEN  THEY LOWER THE SOIL'S WATER-RETENTION CAPABILITIES.  </P> <P> Planning a water-wise garden, may begin with how you prepare the soil.  </P> <P> There is a growing body of evidence that adding organic amendments to the soil  may not contribute anything and may, indeed, be a bad idea -- at least in some  cases.  </P> <P> Said a leading proponent of xeriscape -- Randall Ismay of Landscape and Water  Management Consultants in Los Angeles and Laguna Niguel: "We recommend planting  in 100% native soil."  </P> <P> Caltrans is trying this idea on some sites, planting in what they call an  "unprepared hole."  </P> <P> According to the latest thinking, not only do organic amendments not help, they  may hurt, because they diminish the soil's ability to store water -- by  lowering its water-retention qualities.  </P> <P> Even in poor or rocky soils, proponents of "no amendments" prefer picking  plants suited to the soil and the site. "Change what you plant, not the soil,"  they say.  </P> <P> The organic amendments we are talking about are things like processed wood  shavings or sawdust. They are not fertilizers, but are designed to make a soil  more manageable by physically separating the soil particles.  </P> <P> Research carried out in the Midwest suggests that planting in unamended soil  also makes for healthier plants that are less likely to topple years later --  plants that grow stronger, longer.  </P> <P> In many soils, amending the soil that goes back in the planting hole produces  an unacceptable interface between native soil and amended soil. This interface  turns back roots, so they tend to circle and not move out into the surrounding  soil.  </P> <P> If the surrounding soil is a heavy clay or other relatively impermeable soil,  the planting hole filled with amended soil might also become a "bathtub," as  one soil scientist calls it. Water will collect in the planting hole, killing  the plant by suffocation.  </P> <P> This new thinking does not mean that there is no use for organic amendments,  but Ismay recommends that they be used as a mulch, "on top of the soil, not in  it."  </P> <P> He suggests that they work better on the surface, where they can break down  into the form most useful to plants and then slowly work their way down into  the soil. A 3- to 4-inch layer is usually recommended.  </P> <P> "No organic amendments" applies mostly to good, valley-bottom soils -- sandy  loams and clay soils, even clay soils that "you could throw on a potter's wheel  and fire," Ismay said.  </P> <P> Clay soils are composed of very tiny particles that pack together. Water  penetrates this mass slowly, but exits it just as slowly. It may take hours to  get a clay soil wet, but it takes weeks for it to dry out.  </P> <P> Getting clay wet is the trick, and amending a soil helps water soak in, but it  also exits quickly. The secret here is to use drip irrigation or any of the  other "low-flow" devices that put water on slowly so it can soak in.  </P> <P> Clay is also naturally stubborn, unyielding and intractable, if a soil can be  said to be so. This means that in flower beds and vegetable gardens, where one  is constantly working in and with the soil, amendments are the heroes, making a  clay soil manageable.  </P> <P> "No amendments" applies mostly to trees and shrubs -- permanent plants with  far-reaching roots. Some also think it wise for drought-resistant ground  covers, and even lawns, but not flowers or vegetables.  </P> <P> Mike Henry, turf and landscape adviser with the UC Cooperative Extension in  Orange County, said "delicate plants such as vegetables and bedding plants that  don't have a tough, vigorous root system can't penetrate a heavy soil. This is  one case where organic amendments can help."  </P> <P> "And in very rocky soils or very sandy soils, there may be times when organic  amendments are called for because the soils can be very porous."  </P> <P> But even in these cases the amendments are used not to hold onto water so much  as they are used to hold onto nutrients -- fertilizers you add to the soil,  which otherwise might wash right on through.  </P> <P> "You can't make a general statement and cover all the bases," Henry said, "but  in most instances, on level land that has not been bulldozed out of the side of  a hill, it is not necessary to add organic amendments, and may indeed be a bad  idea."  </P> <P> George W. Schmitz, soil scientist and former chairman of that department at Cal  Poly Pomona, and now a consultant with Donald Eberhard &amp; Associates of  Fullerton, consulting agronomists, said in hillside soils we are "obligated to  amend because these are not soil."  </P> <P> Cut from the sides of hills, or brought in as fill from some other construction  sites, he likes to call these "formations" because they have little or no  qualification as soil, but may be solid rock, loose rock or very sticky clay  subsoils. And they all need amending, he said.  </P> <P> Schmitz recommends getting a soil test if you are not sure what kind of soil  you have. "All sorts of interesting things might turn up," he says, such as  very poor fertility, unusual minerals or high salt concentrations.  </P> <P> "A soil test can explain all sorts of problems in gardens," he said.  </P> <P> Kellogg Supply Co. has soil text kits available at nurseries -- the Soil Test  Box costs $29.95, or $32.95 for the version that also tests for salts in the  soil.  </P> <P> You fill the box with soil and they have a soil lab run the tests. You get back  figures and recommendations on what to do. Or call the County Cooperative  Extension. If you are pretty sure you have an ordinary clay soil, even a heavy  clay, or a nice loam, here are the new recommendations for plantings trees and  shrubs:  </P> <P>  -- Dig a shallow hole, only as deep as the nursery container or root ball, but  make it three to four times as wide.  </P> <P> Break up and pulverize the soil as you dig it out. No clods allowed. Set the  plant in the hole and fill the hole with the pulverized native soil, tamping it  down as you go.  </P> <P> It helps if you thoroughly water the ground three to four days ahead of time.  This makes digging a whole lot easier, and the damp clods will shatter when hit  with the back of the shovel.  </P> <P>  -- Use the extra soil to build a watering basin around the hole and put a 2-  to 3-inch mulch of organic amendment inside the basin, keeping it away from the  very base of the plant.  </P> <P> Water by flooding the basin or with drip emitters installed in each basin. The  basin is necessary in clay soils to hold the water long enough for it to soak  in. Sprinklers will not work on plantings that have not been amended because  they apply the water too quickly and it cannot soak in.  </P> <P> Lydia Deets, an assistant transportation engineer with Caltrans, said this last  trick -- the watering basin and mulch -- is a "winning combination." Very  simple, it has nonetheless cut the mortality rate of new plantings  considerably.  </P> <P> For ground covers (even lawns, say some), one would simply rototill the soil to  loosen it so roots and water can penetrate easily while the grass or other  plants becomes established. For flower gardens and vegetable patches, look on  the back of the packages of soil amendments at nurseries to see how much to add  to the soil.  </P> <P> Usually, you can add up to 50% by volume, though a 4-inch layer tilled into the  top 12 inches of soil usually does the trick.  </P> <P> One final note: Planting with no amendments does make for slower growth  initially, and one must be careful not to overwater, but after a few years,  plants in native soil will become larger and stronger than those in amended  soil.  </P> <P> Robert Kourick, distributor of Water Cycle, the device to recycle "gray water"  mentioned in the first of the water saving series Aug. 19, may be contacted at  P.O.

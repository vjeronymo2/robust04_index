			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Trust shows little change at halfway EDINBURGH Investment Trust, the second largest investment trust in the UK, yesterday announced an unchanged interim dividend of 2.85p and reported a modest 0.4 per increase in net assets per share. Portfolio performance lagged the FT-A All-Share Index, which posted a 2.9 per cent gain in the six months to September 30, but was ahead of the FT-A Investment World Index, which fell by 0.5 per cent. Investment income fell by 13.8 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 24.3m) reflecting the reduced exposure to the UK in the early part of the year, as well as sales of foreign bonds and dividend cuts by some UK companies. This decline was partly offset by higher interest on deposits which grew to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds 2.4m) and total revenues slipped by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 24.8m (26.8m). Pre-tax revenues fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 19.1m) while earnings per hare dipped from 4.69p to 4.57p. In the past six months the group said further funds had been invested in both the UK equity market and the gilt market in anticipation of lower interest rates. At the end of September the geographical split of the equity portfolio, which was valued at Pounds 777.4m, was as follows: UK - 65.8 per cent; North America - 9.4 per cent; continental Europe - 12 per cent; Japan  - 7.6 per cent; other Far East - 5.2 per cent. Net assets at September 30 were Pounds 749.1m, equivalent to 254.9p per share, against an adjusted 253.9p at the end of March and 273.6p at the end of September 1991.</p>

Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki  Kumano  told a press conference that the Japanese side will seek the  understanding of their U.S. counterparts by explaining the  circumstances surrounding a recent fall in the share of foreign  microchips in Japan.    Although the ratio has dropped the absolute quantity of  foreign microchips sold in Japan has increased, Kumano said.    The foreign share of Japan's microchips market during the  July-September period of 1993 fell below 20 percent for the  third consecutive quarterly drop.    Dissatisfied with the results, U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor asked Japan for an emergency meeting on the matter  in January.    The 20 percent is cited in a 1991 bilateral semiconductor  trade pact as the share level of foreign-made microchips in  Japan expected to be achieved by the end of 1992.    Under the pact, emergency meetings are provided for if the  objectives of the arrangement are not being achieved. No such  consultations have been held so far.    The share of foreign microchips in Japan, as calculated by  the U.S. formula, reached 20.2 percent in the last quarter of  1992, heading off U.S. sanctions, but has fallen since, to 19.6  percent in the first quarter, 19.2 percent in the second  quarter, and 18.1 percent in the third quarter of 1993.</p>

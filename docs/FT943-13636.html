			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Scotland faces new charity rules Pressure to extend some controls on English charities to Scotland will be generated by the report tomorrow of a Department of Trade and Industry taskforce set up as part of the government's deregulation exercise. The taskforce has been seeking ways to reduce accounting, fundraising, trading and other burdens on charitable activities and its report will make a number of recommendations in these areas. But as far as Scotland is concerned, it will have the effect of arguing for more regulation. In Scotland the charitable sector is less strongly policed than in England and Wales. There is no Scottish equivalent of the Charity Commissioners and the 1992 Charities Act, designed to tighten up on potential abuse, does not apply there. This has given rise to concerns that enforcement of the act in England and Wales is likely to encourage a growth in dubious fundraising and other abuses north of the border. The taskforce report is likely to accept the case mounted by the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations that there should be common standards throughout the UK, governing issues such as the regulation of fundraising and the role of charity trustees. More than a third of nearly 200 recommendations in the report have been accepted by the government, and further studies will be commissioned in some other areas. Voluntary sector representatives told the taskforce that one of the most effective ways of reducing tax burdens on charities would be freeing them from value added tax on their activities, but this is unlikely to be agreed by the government.</p>

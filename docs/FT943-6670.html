			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses spurred by revision of US GDP European bourses picked up strongly after news that the upward revision in second quarter US GDP to 3.8 per cent, compared with an expected 4.2 per cent, took the pressure off the Fed for a further move to tighter monetary policy. FRANKFURT staged a strong post-bourse rally, after an uncertain official session. The Dax index picked up from a low of 2,140.34 to finish 9.33 higher at 2,161.54 for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week, before pushing through resistance to an Ibis-indicated 2,188.22. Volkswagen, in the doldrums earlier in the week after its chairman forecast lower German car orders in the second half of the year, rebounded to close DM10.50 higher at DM490.50 and DM493 in the post bourse. Deutsche Bank also put in a strong performance, rising DM13.50 to DM726. Shares in Viag showed little reaction to news of a rise in first-half earnings, falling DM2.20 to DM492.50. Hoechst profited from news the group planned to cut more than 1,000 jobs at three plants near Frankfurt by the end of next year, rising DM5.10 on the day to DM358.50 in the post-bourse, and compared with its floor close of DM354.80. PARIS took its cue from the US GDP figures and after a lacklustre performance put on a sprint at the end of the day. The CAC 40 index advanced 36.22 or 1.8 per cent to 2062.75, for a rise on the week of 3 per cent. Euro Disney caused some excitement when it was suspended for 15 minutes after it shares fell by more than 10 per cent to below FFr9.30. The stock closed down FFr 0.80 at FFr 9.50. The decline was prompted by a Paribas sell note and reports that the bank's leisure analyst had valued the share at FFr 1.60. Accor jumped FFr 11 to FFr691 after it said that it had handed in a new bid for part of Air France's stake in the Meridien hotels group. Its rival is Forte of the UK. Danone, unchanged at FFr 846, said after the close that its first half net income slipped to FFr 1.68bn from FFr 1.82bn but added it was confident it could reach targeted profit growth in the full year 1994. AMSTERDAM was spurred by the US news in later trading with the AEX index ending up 3.10 ahead at 420.83, an increase of 2 per cent on the week. Earlier in the day the market had retreated as some investors took profits, hitting a low of 416.11. The US figures, however, acted as a pick-me-up lifting shares which for much of the week had benefited from some solid company results. Following the trend, ABN Amro reported strong first-half net profits which took the shares Fl 0.50 higher to Fl 62.80. Aegon, the Dutch insurer, which unveiled a sharp profits increase and bullish forecast, saw its shares rise Fl 2.80 to Fl 104.60. ZURICH put on 1.2 per cent although trading was largely confined to professionals. The SMI index rose 30.2 to 2,581.3 for a 1 per cent rise on the week. The rising dollar added to positive market sentiment. Roche certificates, SFr95 higher at SFr5,845, led the active list. Nestle rose SFr27 to SFr1,229 and UBS added SFr17 to SFr1,126. Zurich Insurance, under pressure earlier this week, rose strongly with the bearers up SFr20 to SFr1,249 and registered shares SFr28 higher at SFr1,252. Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, fell SFr37 to SFr718 amid news that Swiss exports of plastic watches had fallen in the first six months of this year. Swissair rose SFr28 to a new high for the year of SFr888 in response to Thursday's news that the airline's load factor had reached a record high. MILAN drifted higher amid growing optimism that the government would unite behind a deficit cutting budget and present it ahead of schedule. The Comit index rose 0.88 to 685.60, for a 3.7 per cent rise on the week as the cabinet met for the first time after the summer recess and Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, said he expected the full 1995 budget to be unveiled by mid-September, two weeks ahead of the end-of-month deadline. Banks performed strongly amid rumours that the limit on share ownership for the privatised companies would be lifted from 3 per cent. BCI ended L134 stronger at L3,798, IMI rose L384 to L10,586 and Credito Italiano put on L107 to L2,209. MADRID also staged a recovery at the end of a generally dull session. The general index rose 2.4 to 310.54, wiping out earlier losses as a recovery was seen in Spanish bond markets. The market rose 1.4 per cent over the week.

The state defined this sector as one of the main domains on  which efforts should be concentrated in economic construction  from the beginning of the year and increased investment in the  metal industry.    Continuous roughing processes were newly built in the  Chollima steel complex and the Hwanghae iron and steel complex,  and the ferro-alloy workshop of the Puryong ferro-alloy complex  was reconstructed on an expansion basis.    As a results, the production of steel and pig iron increased  27 percent, and that of rolled steel 33 percent last year  compared with the previous year, taking the Ministry of Metal  Industry as a whole.    The Kim Chaek iron and steel complex, a leading iron  production base, kept production on a high level by introducing  many valuable technical innovation proposals.    At the Hwanghae iron and steel complex technical control of  the metallurgical equipment was improved and advanced work  methods were introduced to markedly increase iron and steel  production while reducing fuel consumption.    Ferro-alloy production last year increased 55 percent above  the previous year at the Puryong ferro-alloy complex.    The Musan mining complex, a gigantic ore supplier, turned  out  450,000 more tons of iron headings in the period than the  preceding year through massive excavation, transport and  processing.    All the iron and steel works are effecting a greater upsurge  in production from the beginning of the new year to carry out  tasks advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his  New Year address.</p>

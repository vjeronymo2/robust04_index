			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Warning of loss hits Owen &amp; Robinson shares Shares in Owen &amp; Robinson tumbled 60 per cent to 10p as the jewellery chain and footwear retailer warned it would report a loss for the year and would not be able to pay the preference dividend which was due yesterday. Mr Tom Forsyth, finance director, blamed the 'Ratner factor' for the group's exceptionally bad Christmas. December sales were Pounds 2m down on expectations of Pounds 10m. The price-cutting campaign launched by Ratner, the high street jeweller, which introduced reductions of up to 25 per cent, had decimated margins, Mr Forsyth said. 'He (Gerald Ratner) shot himself in the foot and the ricochet hit us,' he said. Owen &amp; Robinson is now likely to report losses of less than Pounds 1.2m for the year to January 31. The second half had produced profits, although far less than expected.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Leaders of the pack 'PEOPLE IN cash-and-carrys in England looked at me as if I had three heads when I said I was going to open a supermarket in Moscow,' says Michael Coughlan. 'They thought I was a complete lunatic.' Eighteen months later, in spite of Russian hyperinflation and political turbulence, the business appears to be doing well. ON A JANUARY 1992 trip to Moscow to investigate a warehouse deal for his Irish freight business, Coughlan was offered a prime site for a new supermarket. With his partner, Brendan Flannery, and Richard Pratt, owner of a Cork-based insurance firm, Coughlan formed an investment company, CFP, to put up the money to open an Irish food store in Moscow. The Garden Ring supermarket - named after the Moscow ring road on which it is located - opened last August. Colm Fitzsimon, the manager, says sales are increasing at around 6 per cent a week - the kind of growth that an Irish-based supermarket would expect in a year. The store's success has been helped by its central location on the site of an old Soviet state food shop, an enormous advantage in a market where good real estate is scarce. Coughlan and his partners may now be what Fitzsimon describes as 'three very happy individuals,' but the road has not been easy. It is almost impossible for a foreign business to set up alone in Moscow, since it can take a potential investor years to disentangle Russian red tape. Reliable Moscow contacts are invaluable. 'You can't just get off the plane and start a business here,' says Coughlan. CFP's path was smoothed initially by the Irish-Russian joint-venture Irlasto/IVK, which provided the hard-to-get but essential licence. IVK, the Russian side of the venture, supplies the vital convertible-currency bank account which enables the supermarket to transfer money out of Russia, and is difficult for foreigners to obtain. For its services, Irlasto / IVK has taken a 15 per cent share in the enterprise. Running the shop would be impossible without Russian input. The director of the old state food shop, Sergei Novikov, and four senior deputies will eventually own the store. They are an equal partner in the Garden Ring, responsible for Russian employees and supervising utilities and transport. CFP has refurbished the shop and provided all the supplies and top-level management. 'A good Russian partner is essential,' say Coughlan and Fitzsimon. Financing the project, according to Coughlan, was the biggest obstacle. Equipping the supermarket cost Dollars 750,000. Stocks had to be brought in from abroad and 24 contractors were flown in from Cork to do up the store. Finding the money was hard. Coughlan says that banks in Ireland 'simply wouldn't give anyone a loan for a business venture in the CIS.' Eventually, CFP had to secure every penny of every loan and put up a lot of cash itself. Coughlan says banks remain wary, in spite of the set of accounts CFP can show them. The lesson is that until Russia's economic and political climate stabilises, would-be investors in Moscow have to be self-funding. Another hurdle was adjusting to the taste buds of Moscow's hard currency shoppers. Prices in the Garden Ring, as in all foreign-owned food shops in Moscow, are in US dollars, although customers can pay in Irish punts and other convertible currencies, as well as Russian rubles, albeit at a high exchange rate. As a result, shoppers are foreigners - business people, diplomats, journalists - and rich Russians. The disparate nationalities eat differently from the residents of Limerick, as Fitzsimon, who has six years' supermarket experience in Ireland and three years' business experience in Russia, found out after a slow start. Irish cheeses did not sell well, and CFP expanded the range to include more Dutch and French cheeses. The Garden Ring reduced its percentage of Irish supplies from 90 per cent to 70 per cent in the first eight months and ships in produce from elsewhere in Europe. Russians make up 60 per cent of the clientele, and Fitzsimon says they are keen on fish products and exotic fruit, regardless of price. The small pineapples he sells for Dollars 14.95 are snapped up by Muscovites. Americans are the largest group of expatriate customers. They flock to the Garden Ring for cheesecakes and granola. Irish entrepreneurs operate several businesses in Moscow. 'It has something to do with Irish business acumen,' says Coughlan. 'The Irish are bigger risk-takers.' Fitzsimon has eight Irish staffers working with him, including an assistant manager, an accountant and a butcher. Not everyone likes it. The first butcher went back to his village in County Cork as soon as he could get a flight home. With the help of two translators, the Irish and the 35 Russian staff have adjusted to working in an environment which is foreign to both. The Russian workers have had to learn to smile when they are tired, and to open a new till when customers are waiting. The Irish have had to get used to seeing the eight Russian accountants work out sums on abacuses. Coughlan, as the managing director of CFP, spends one week per month in Moscow, and Flannery and Pratt travel to Russia every three months. Fitzsimon is in daily contact with the Cork office, and Coughlan takes decisions that need to be made on the spot. 'It's the great advantage of having a small company,' he says. 'I can react quickly and make a decision, and it pays off. A lot of our competition in Moscow is semi-state owned, and decisions have to go back to a boardroom.' Running a business in Moscow is never simple. The Garden Ring is at the mercy of foreign suppliers. If the fruit and veg lorry does not leave the Netherlands on schedule, the shelves can be bare all weekend. In spite of the pitfalls, and the high risks that Coughlan, Flannery and Pratt have taken, Coughlan remains confident. 'When the uncertainties are over and the big guns start moving in,' he says, 'we'll be well ahead of the posse.'</p>

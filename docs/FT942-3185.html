			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK 'must push for total test ban' Britain has this week made a welcome shift in its attitude to stopping nuclear tests but should go much further, according to a group of US arms control experts visiting London to lobby for a comprehensive test ban. The experts criticised US handling of the North Korean crisis, saying it had raised the stakes too quickly and left Pyongyang with no way to back down without losing face. 'We are pushing the North Koreans into a corner,' said Mr Paul Warnke, the US government's former head of arms control talks. The shift in British policy was indicated by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, in a parliamentary answer. He made it clear Britain would no longer insist any test ban treaty must contain loopholes that would allow small-scale explosions in the interests of safety. 'We now aim to use and develop alternative technologies,' the minister added, indicating Britain was confident computerised simulations could substitute adequately for nuclear explosions. Arms control advocates are lobbying hard for the five nuclear powers to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty at their negotiations in Geneva this year. They believe a test ban will help persuade smaller countries to agree to extension and consolidation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for renewal in 1995. Mr Warnke and his colleagues urged Britain to become an advocate of an early test ban, as opposed merely to following the US lead. They said Britain was wrong to insist that as many as possible of the world's potential nuclear 'miscreants' should sign up before any test ban treaty entered force. This stance could lead to fatal delays in installing a new non-proliferation regime. The Korean crisis had driven home the need for some internationally agreed arms control system, even if not all countries wanted it, because otherwise there would be no mechanism to isolate and punish wrongdoers. China wants to complete a series of nuclear tests before agreeing to a ban. In France, President Francois Mitterrand is a strong advocate of a ban, but right-wing opponents have reservations.</p>

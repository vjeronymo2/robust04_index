			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Quito -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen has signed  into law a controversial amendment to the Agricultural Reform  Law, despite the Indian communities' threats to demonstrate  until the amendment is repealed. The bill proposed is meant to  modify agrarian reform to increase the country's agricultural  production. The Indian and peasant communities, however, think  the new measure is harmful because it offsets the agrarian  reform's increased benefits and empowers the government to  confiscate land presently owned by Indians and hand it over to  wealthy landlords.    Before the bill was approved, Indian organizations closed  roads and organized marches to the Congress. Now that the bill  has been signed into law, the Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador [CONAIE] threatens to intensify the  protests until the law is repealed. Traditionally, the Indians'  protests have been marked by the closure of highways and  confrontations with the police but without excessive violence.</p>

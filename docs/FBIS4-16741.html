			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russia "should not hasten to join  NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] program," Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told reporters today.    The main thing in joining is "the reciprocity of partnership  and a clear mechanism for implementing decisions," he said,  stressing that the recent air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs,  "when the decision was made not even by NATO but by the U.S.  command, showed that a mechanism of this kind does not exist  even at the level of the United Nations and the Security  Council."    Shumeyko drew particular attention to the need for a  mechanism "that will emphasize that all states in the  partnership are absolutely equal."    "Further developments will show how the peace process will  evolve," Vladimir Shumeyko said.    Under the Russian Constitution, it is the Federation Council  that is responsible for the use of troops outside the country.</p>

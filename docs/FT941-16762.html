			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Rene Barbier de La Serre new chairman of CBV The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the French stock market watchdog, has appointed Mr Rene Barbier de La Serre, chief executive of the Credit Commercial de France (CCF) banking group, as its chairman, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. He will replace Mr Bruno de Maulde, who resigned last week to join the newly independent Bank of France's monetary policy council. Mr de La Serre, 53, has spent most of his career in banking but has for some years been a member of the CBV. France yesterday announced it had chalked up another healthy trade surplus in October, confirming it is well on its way to a record surplus for 1993, Reuter adds. Provisional customs office data showed a seasonally adjusted trade surplus in October of FFr8.7bn (Pounds 1bn) against a revised surplus of FFr9.91bn in September.</p>

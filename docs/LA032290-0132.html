			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> E. EUROPE ARRESTS THE POLICE STATE;  </P> <P> COMMUNISM IS GONE, BUT THE HUGE SECURITY FORCES IT SPAWNED REMAIN AS A DEADLY  LEGACY FOR THE NEWLY FREE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EAST BLOC.  </P> <P> Communism in Eastern Europe may have failed in most ways, but in one respect  its success was undisputed: It produced some of the most comprehensive,  efficient secret police networks in modern times.  </P> <P> Dismantling them looms as one of the most formidable challenges facing the  region's newly free governments.  </P> <P> Murky, aloof and left remarkably intact by the sudden collapse of their Marxist  creators and masters, the secret police apparatuses of Eastern Europe remain  rogue institutional time bombs that inexperienced interim governments spent  weeks trying to unearth before starting the delicate job of defusing them.  </P> <P> In numbers alone, the problem is huge.  </P> <P> East Germany's dreaded Ministry of State Security -- known to Germans as the  Stasi -- was the country's second-largest employer (next to the army) and kept  active files on one-third of the country's 17 million people.  </P> <P> East Germans last week were reminded again how far the Stasi's tentacles  reached into their society when Wolfgang Schnur, the leader of a conservative  political party and a man who made his name defending dissidents, admitted  having worked with the agency.  </P> <P> "It was a state within a state," conceded former East German Communist Party  leader Egon Krenz.  </P> <P> Only in January did East Germany belatedly move to cut the Stasi's pervasive  powers by disarming its members and ordering its size cut to 10,000 from 85,000  by the end of March. An independent citizens' committee now presides over the  de facto dissolution of the apparatus, while some of the unknown hundreds of  thousands blackmailed by the Stasi into informing on others have established  encounter groups to try come to terms psychologically with their plight.  </P> <P> In Romania, the Securitate once nurtured plans to operate 10 million  microphones at a time, so that "every single family could be periodically  monitored during each calendar year, with suspect ones continuously covered,"  Nicolae Ceausescu's former intelligence chief, Ion Pacepa, noted in his book,  "Red Horizons."  </P> <P> By all accounts, the Securitate didn't fall far short of its goal.  </P> <P> Moves to neutralize internal security forces are under way throughout Eastern  Europe as fledgling democratic forces ponder safeguards that would prevent such  a massive erosion of human rights from ever occurring again.  </P> <P> Only in Romania and Bulgaria, according to area specialists, is there any  prospect that the secret police could recover power significantly.  </P> <P> Those who have monitored the collapse of Eastern Europe's dictatorships predict  that a few senior secret police officials will face trial and imprisonment as  revelations of their activities are made. In Czechoslovakia, such fears have  triggered a rash of suicides.  </P> <P> Most observers, however, discount wholesale witch hunts.  </P> <P> "All a nation needs is two or three big trials and then it becomes repetitive,"  commented Alex Pravda, a noted Oxford University Sovietologist. "These networks  are all so big and diffuse, they can't get everyone."  </P> <P> It is even possible that individuals whom the new governments consider both  trustworthy and competent might be asked to help build smaller, more benign  counterespionage groups, while those security figures with darker pasts are  quietly retired. The vast majority, however, seem destined to search for new  lives in new, more open societies.  </P> <P> Some have even joined the free-market spirit of the time and gone private. In  Poland, Interior Ministry officials report between five and 10 applications  daily from former colleagues registering to set up private detective agencies.  </P> <P> Frequently, however, the transition is not easy. Tomaj Barsi, chief spokesman  for Hungary's Interior Ministry, noted that more than 100 members of his  country's secret police resigned in disgust after refusing to swear allegiance  to the country's new constitution, which omits any reference to communism's  leading role.  </P> <P> More often, though, the animosity is from the public, now displaying flashes of  anger pent up for years.  </P> <P> Angry East Germans have trashed the Stasi's offices, and potential employers  frequently reject an applicant if the agent's past is discovered. One  Czechoslovak groused that members of the secret police should take the  janitors' and boiler tenders' jobs that they once forced on political opponents  as the price of dissent.  </P> <P> "At this point, emotions are running so high, nobody wants them at all,"  commented one Prague resident.  </P> <P> While anger is dominant, there is also a distinct fear remaining among the  generations who have known no walls without ears and still glance instinctively  over their shoulders. It was members of the Soviet secret police, the KGB, who  first established Eastern Europe's pervasive internal security networks in the  late 1940s and early 1950s and stayed on, first as advisers, then as liaison  officers, to keep tabs on their proteges.  </P> <P> Until their collapse, these networks generated the fear that made them  communism's prime instruments of power.  </P> <P> The ruthless, bloody defense of the totalitarian state mounted by Romania's  Securitate may have been the exception in the otherwise peaceful collapse of  Communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe, but it is also a lingering nightmare  of what could have happened elsewhere. And, so long as there are remnants of  these security networks, the region's new governments will remain jittery.  </P> <P> In Czechoslovakia, rumors of a security police-led coup so paralyzed routine  activity in Prague that Interior Minister Richard Sacher simply abolished the  country's 18,000-strong secret police apparatus, ordered its agents to stay  home during the day, then led reporters on a tour of the empty headquarters  buildings.  </P> <P> "Members of these departments have ceased all functions," Sacher declared, as  the civilian police tried desperately to take over rudimentary internal  security tasks.  </P> <P> In Bulgaria, Communist Interior Minister Atanas Semerdziev announced on  national television in February that the country's secret police had been  disbanded, and he signed a declaration that opposition offices and telephones  were no longer tapped.  </P> <P> There is evidence that this public nervousness was warranted.  </P> <P> Two months after Erich Honecker's neo-Stalinist regime fell in East Berlin,  Stasi agents were still hard at work bugging political activists. And nearly a  year after Hungary formally severed secret police links with the Communist  Party and ended the political role of the police, agents were discovered  reporting on opposition political meetings. That affair triggered the  resignation of Hungary's interior minister and the chief of internal security  and led to a parliamentary investigation.  </P> <P> "These people just went on doing what they'd always done, and no one stopped  them," said G. M. Tamas, an opposition member of the Hungarian Parliament and  one of those investigating the scandal.  </P> <P> Despite these incidents, area specialists believe the greatest threat to  stability from old-guard secret police remains in Romania, where uncertainty  about the Securitate hangs like a dark cloud over the country's democratic  future.  </P> <P> The Bulgarian Communist Party's continued power has also unsettled people in  that country, who fear a possible secret police revival despite government  pledges to the contrary.  </P> <P> But, with a string of democratic elections on the horizon, the notion has begun  to dawn that it would require more than a handful of disenchanted security  police officers to reverse the tidal wave of change that has swept through the  region.  </P> <P> Combining to reduce the threat, according to those familiar with the region,  are the severing of Communist Party ties with the security police, the upcoming  elections and the lack of support, either within the military establishments or  among popular politicians, for short-circuiting the path toward democracy.  </P> <P> "For a putsch (uprising) to succeed, you need political figures and the army,"  said Vladimir Kusin, a senior analyst at Radio Free Europe in Munich who  recently compiled a status report on secret police groups in Eastern Europe.  "Those conditions don't exist in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia or East  Germany. In whose name? For what purpose? There may be a desperado or two, but  not more."  </P> <P> Added Hungarian lawmaker Tamas, a former dissident and target of secret police  harassment: "I'm not afraid any more; I'm really not. Who is going to risk  something like that (a coup attempt)?"  </P> <P> Although every country maintains some form of internal security organization  (in the United States it is the FBI), several factors point to smaller and more  benign counterintelligence corps: a softening political climate, strong public  resistance and the fact that funds for secret police work will likely have to  be defended in the newly elected parliaments of financially strapped Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> "The dissidents are now in the government; our enemies are now our friends,"  summed up Tamas. "A big security force will be hard to justify."  </P> <P> East German Communist Prime Minister Hans Modrow found that out the hard way in  January. His attempt to justify a large new internal security force to combat  neo-Nazi activities so enraged and dismayed his country's citizens that he  immediately dropped the idea.  </P> <P> Many governments in the region are only beginning to consider what democratic  controls should be placed on new internal security networks. But if initial  signs are an indicator, those controls will be extremely tight.  </P> <P> All but Romania are committed to place their revamped secret police forces  under some form of parliamentary supervision.  </P> <P> Hungary has introduced one of the tightest systems anywhere. The secret police  here must obtain the justice minister's written permission to tap a telephone  -- the maximum time is 30 days. In addition, after the tap is removed, the  justice minister will report to Parliament the names of those bugged. If no  evidence for prosecution is uncovered, the secret police can be sued by the  target of its surveillance for violation of rights.  </P> <P> "We need a system far stricter than those in well-established democracies,"  Tamas insisted. "We have to watch our step."  </P> <P> Among the nations fresh out of dictatorship, only Romania has done little to  dismantle its secret police. The ruling National Salvation Front has placed the  Securitate under military control, but there is little evidence that  Ceausescu's private army is a spent force.  </P> <P> Reflecting mounting unease in Bucharest, a group of 46 prominent intellectuals  recently signed an open letter contending that the Securitate still holds  considerable power. They demanded that the government back up its claims that  telephone tapping and other surveillance have stopped by publicly destroying  the Securitate's centers.  </P> <P> "Can we talk about the victory of the revolution when fear, physical and  psychological threats go on?" they asked.  </P> <P> Hungary's Tamas, who was born and raised in the Romanian city of Cluj, recalled  his own experience during a trip to his old hometown that provided a hint of  the Securitate's grip on power.  </P> <P> Tamas recounted how, shortly after the new year, a Securitate major who had  interrogated him years before suddenly telephoned from a local prison where he  faced a possible trial. The major wanted to know if Tamas would testify that he  had not been physically tortured during his interrogation -- a point that Tamas  indicated he would be willing to confirm.  </P> <P> "An hour later, he phoned again, asking if I would agree to accept a case of  French champagne with his compliments," Tamas said. "French champagne. In  Romania. Ordered from a jail cell.  </P> <P> "That's influence."  </P></p>

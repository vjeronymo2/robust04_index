			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall sharply on futures expiry Wall Street HEAVY selling related to 'triple-witching' (the quarterly expiration of equity derivatives contracts) sent share prices tumbling in extremely heavy trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.61 at 3,613.24. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.56 lower at 458.87, while the Amex composite was down 0.87 at 452.81, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.31 at 740.11. Trading volume on the NYSE was well above normal levels at 370m shares. Stock markets ended a trying week on a downbeat note, although the early losses were primarily the result of technical, not fundamental, pressures on prices. Yesterday was triple-witching day, when stock and stock index futures and options contracts all expire on the same day. Traditionally, triple-witching creates substantial volatility in prices, often biased toward selling. Yesterday was no exception, and was in fact busier than most such days. The sell orders piled up before the opening, creating order imbalances in scores of leading stocks. When trading started, prices tumbled, leaving the Dow 17 points lower within minutes. At 10am, trading volume stood at 159m shares, making it the busiest half-hour in the New York Stock Exchange. Although prices often recover at the end of the session on triple-witching day, analysts warned that the mood of the markets was sombre and that prices could stay at their lows for all of the session. Declines in bond prices did not help sentiment, and although bonds recovered slightly in mid-afternoon, equities did not follow suit. Among individual stocks, Westinghouse tumbled Dollars 1 to Dollars 13 7/8 in volume of 3.2m shares after the company warned analysts to expect a 50 per cent drop in its third quarter earnings, and said that it did not foresee an early improvement in its business outlook. General Motors slumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 in volume of 2m shares on newspaper reports that Ford's wage agreement with employee unions is not good news for General Motors. In contrast, Ford was up Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 54 3/4 , and Chrysler was unchanged at Dollars 45. Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 in volume of 3.2m shares after Turner Broadcasting confirmed that it is interested in making an offer for Paramount, which is already the subject of an agreed Dollars 8.2bn bid from Viacom. Turner 'A' shares ended down Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 25 3/4. Drug stocks also bucked the trend, primarily because they were hard hit by selling earlier in the week. Schering-Plough rose Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 , Merck held steady at Dollars 31 3/8, Johnson&amp;Johnson Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 1/8 and Bristol Myers-Squibb firmed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 58 3/8. Canada TORONTO stock prices closed lower in moderate trading, finishing out a see-saw week on a negative note. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index fell 9.75 points to close at 3,978.31. Declining issues outnumbered advances 337 to 333. On the week, the index lost about 23 points. Volume today was 64.976m shares, down from Thursday's 86.632m shares.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event deviations from proper QAP procedures are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected by the PPB during the reliability verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, the handler will be informed of the problem and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action required. If corrective action is taken,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the QAP continues in operation. Continued deviations may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in suspension of QAP approval. The suspension may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent or temporary and may only be restored upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrence by the PPB. During any suspension, the handler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to use continuous in-line inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishing a QAP inspection procedure meets marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order inspection requirements, and provides handlers with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to continuous in-line inspection (which requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the presence of a PPB inspector during final processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the packaging of olives). To effectuate this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of &sect;932.152, Outgoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, are revised to add authority for handlers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use either the QAP process or continuous in-line inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 932.52 authorizes sizing of whole pitted olives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon count-per-pound designations (the actual weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of individual fruit) or modifications recommended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee and approved by the Secretary. Section 932.152  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently specifies that all processed olives must be sized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the count-per-pound designations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for canned whole ripe olives, and further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that such sizing be done prior to pitting. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule provides an alternative method for sizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole pitted olives to provide handlers with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility in their operations while ensuring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate size standards are continued for whole pitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges (section 52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately 22 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diameter ranges provided in the Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standards also provide allowances for size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variances for whole pitted olives in &sect;52.3756. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olives that are most uniform in size, the diameter of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olive by more than 4 millimeters. These variances will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their pitted olives sized by diameter, after pitting. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pitted olives are sufficient and that no additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications relating to size are needed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, paragraph (f) of &sect;932.152 is revised to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;932.152 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pitting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The outgoing regulations contain a table pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size certification of limited size olives for limited use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> styles at &sect;932.152(g)(1). In 1991, the committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended and the Secretary approved modifications in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sizes of limited use olives. While such modifications were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected elsewhere in the regulations, a conforming change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not made in Table II of &sect;932.152(g)(1). This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrects the table, bringing it into conformance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules as they were modified in 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported into the United States are subject to comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size requirements as established for domestically grown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olives under the order. Those requirements are found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Olive Regulation 1 [7 CFR 944.401].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation are based upon those established for canned whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olives under the California olive marketing order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously explained, this interim final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes size requirements for canned pitted olives under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the order in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges, and size variances which are set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards. Thus, in accordance with section 8e of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conforming changes are made in the minimum size requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for imported canned pitted olives so that such requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are applied in a manner similar to that under the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that this rule will not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including information and recommendations submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee and other available information, it is hereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

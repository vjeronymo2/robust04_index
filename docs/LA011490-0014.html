			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: FALL FROM GRACE: THE FAILED CRUSADE OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT  BY MICHAEL D'ANTONIO (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $19.95; 242 PP.)  </P> <P> This account by former Newsday religion writer Michael D'Antonio of the  Christian Right's brief bid for political power in the figure of Pat Robertson  is worth perusing for the rapid Chapter 1 overview alone, in which the writer's  trenchant style makes short work of the absurdities in the movement.  </P> <P> But that is an easy target. The main body of the book contains case histories  of born-again Christians and scenes from D'Antonio's travels around the country  to various born-again and charismatic congregations. The stories here are  wonderfully revealing, even if D'Antonio's comments are equally revealing of  his disdain for the sort of people who fall for Jesus talk. He visits Jimmy and  Tammy Bakker's Heritage USA as well as Oral Roberts' City of Faith (where he is  told that security guards will identify him because he sports that common  journalist's eccentricity: a beard). As he looks at the reasons for people's  conversions, D'Antonio lays bare the curious connection between the born-again  Christian life and American conservative political ideas. A chapter on the  pageant celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution at the massive Second  Baptist Church of Houston explores the peculiar rewriting of history for  emotional effect that dovetailed beautifully, D'Antonio maintains, with the  Republican strategy in the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns.  </P> <P> The collapse of the religious right as a political force, D'Antonio says, was  "eerily familiar from such works of fiction as 'Elmer Gantry' . . . Big-time,  moralizing evangelists had always been undone by the sin of greed and the sins  of the flesh." The spectacular fall and media feeding frenzy that followed the  televangelist scandals finally allowed the Republicans to criticize the  Christian groups without fear of being labeled suppressors of religion. When  the Bush campaign attacked, D'Antonio says, "it became clear that the Christian  Right was less a juggernaut than a man of straw."  </P> <P> D'Antonio portrays the turn to the right as a logical but short-lived backlash  against the gains made by the civil-rights and women's movements, which he  unequivocally describes as "inevitable." His account leaves open no doubt that  the Christian Right has evaporated as a political force. This is a comforting  thought if one is not suspicious enough to look with a watchful eye at events  outside of American borders. Religious fundamentalism may not have won the  Republican presidential nomination in 1988, and the televangelists' empires may  indeed have crumbled beyond repair, but it still seems overly optimistic to  say, as D'Antonio does, that "Bush's election ensured the death of a movement,  as he returned the nation to the professional politics of Nixon and Ford and  abandoned the anomalous populism of Reagan and Falwell."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Omar Behman, ambassador of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina, by staff correspondent Karimlu in Tehran;  date not given]    [Text] Q. What is the present situation in Gorazde?    A. It is tragic. The aggressors are committing crimes using  their full military strength. Fortunately the Muslims and the  Bosnian forces are defending the city. But if no step is taken  Gorazde will certainly fall and the lives of 65,000 to 70,000  inhabitants of the city will be at stake. We should not forget  that Gorazde is only one example of the Serb crimes and  aggression. There are other places in Bosnia which are currently  under the boots of the Serbs. A fresh force of 10,000 has just  been dispatched to areas around Gorazde from Serbia. Some other  Serbian troops who have evacuated areas near Sarajevo, have come  to Gorazde. And despite all the crimes they are committing, the  Serbs are constantly receiving oil and food in violation of the  UN economic sanctions. This is under conditions that the UN  forces would not allow Muslims to receive even a single bullet.  The main responsibility of the UN is to defend Bosnia but the  organization has failed even to stop the aggressor Serbs to the  extent that we can claim the UN itself is an accomplice in this  aggression and is helping the Serbs to violate the rights of the  Bosnian people.    Q. What is your opinion about NATO?    A. At the outset it seemed that they wanted to help, but  later it became clear that they have no intention to defend the  wronged party. NATO is not an independent force, it carries out  the instructions it receives from the UN and its Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    Q. What is the current situation in Sarajevo? What about  the people's demonstration in the city?    A. It is getting worse and worse every day. The enemy is  sniping at the city and in some cases they even launch artillery  attacks. The UN forces have returned the heavy arms and  artilleries collected from the Serbs earlier.    Concerning the demonstration, the people suddenly poured  into  the streets and voiced their hatred of international  organizations and called for assistance. The Serbs are being  allowed to commit more and more crimes and this has made the  situation very critical.    Q. Would you comment on the use of chemical weapons by the  Serbs?    A. The aggressors used chemical weapons in their first  attacks on the bunkers of the Bosnian forces outside the city  (Gorazde) and thus succeeded in breaking the defense line of the  city. I am not sure about the precise number of the martyrs and  wounded of the chemical attacks. Military sources have put the  number of the casualties after the Serbs broke into the city, at  400 killed and 1000 wounded. But the point is that the  populated villages near Gorazde are also under the control of  the Serbs and it is not known how many people have been killed  and wounded there. In view of the fact that there is no link  between Gorazde and outside, it is very difficult to have an  exact number of casualties at this time.    Q. What do you think about the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    A. It is very hard to say. As we know the war is going on.  Our enemies are determined to exterminate the Muslims in this  region and it is very difficult to counter them with empty hands.    Q. Following the letter sent to Butrus-Ghali by Mr.  Izetbegovic, is there any hope that the UN would help?    A. The UN and the Security Council exist only in appearance  but the decisions are made behind the curtain and by the  superpowers. The UN has in fact no role in the decision-making  process. Furthermore, Mr. Butrus-Ghali has proved that he has no  determination of his own and has failed even to fulfill the  simplest obligations of his organization. He is only waiting  for the big powers to instruct him what to do, acting like, a  slave. But we remember that the previous chief of the UN stood  against Russia and the U.S. several times and carried out what  it wished to do.    Q. What are your expectations from the Islamic Republic of  Iran [IRI]?    A. The IRI, its government and people have been on our side  from the beginning of the war and helped us as far as they  could. We think them all and we are confident that they will  continue to be with us in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks with the Croatian delegation on the  implementation of the constitution of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina are continuing in Vienna. Talks are being  held on the borders, the number of cantons, the distribution of  the ministries in the government, and the posts in the  federation. The course of the talks has so far been marked by  rapprochement in all spheres, but, considering that these are  very sensitive issues, they will require longer and more patient  talks. A more specific agreement on the distribution of  ministries in the government and the posts in the federation is  expected after the conclusion of the talks on the cantons.</p>

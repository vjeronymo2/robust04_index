			<p>BFN     [Text] The newsroom of the National Radio of Cambodia has  just received a letter from the ministers of the interior  concerning the deadline for the departure from Phnom Penh by  representatives of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]. The  letter reads:    From: The Ministers of the Interior    To: The Representatives of the PDK Accredited to Phnom  Penh    Subject: Deadline for the PDK Representatives' Departure  From Phnom Penh    The Ministry of the Interior requests that all  representatives of the PDK and their staff immediately leave  Phnom Penh before 19 June 1994 because the roundtable between  the legal representatives of the Royal Government of the Kingdom  of Cambodia and the PDK on 15 and 16 June 1994 at the royal  palace in Phnom Penh did not produce any positive results  regarding a cease-fire, which long has been wished for by all  the citizens of the country; because no other meetings have been  scheduled; because the Ministry of the Interior has learned that  the indignant public is planning to conduct various activities  against your group; and because the Ministry of the Interior  cannot stop the people from being indignant, cannot forever  ensure your security, and cannot bear full responsibility for  any eventual accidents against your persons.    The Ministry of the Interior will provide safe escort for  your group from the office to Pochentong Airport. You, however,  must inform the Ministry at least one day before your departure.  Beyond the above deadline, the Ministry of the Interior will  not be held responsible for your security.    Please, accept our high regards.    Phnom Penh, 17 June 1994    [Signed] His Excellency Sar Kheng, His Excellency Yu  Hokkri, ministers of the interior</p>

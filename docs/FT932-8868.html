			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Economics: Markets await UK unemployment data after recent fall in jobless THE MARKETS will be on tenterhooks this week for Thursday's UK unemployment data. A third consecutive monthly fall in the jobless total may convince economists - unsure of how to interpret falls in February and March - that unemployment has stopped rising. The consensus forecast for a rise of 15,000 month-on-month reflects widespread scepticism that unemployment has turned the corner so early in the recovery. Most economists dismissed the seasonally adjusted falls in February and March as 'a freak'. Incomes Data Services the independent pay and employment research group says there will be a sharp drop in the actual increase in average earnings in March. IDS's observation is based on the significant boost to earnings in March last year when fear of an incoming Labour government's plans for higher rates of tax prompted payment of a large amount of extra bonuses and salaries.

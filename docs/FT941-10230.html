			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dedicated to taming a less than 'soft' option - A look at Sema's role in packaged software Mr Pierre Bonelli, managing director of Sema Group, listed four reasons why the Anglo-French computing services company is in the packaged software business and added with a laugh: 'I know this speech very well because I have given it to the board so many times. Come back next year and I will have ten reasons.' Mr Bonelli describes Sema's performance in packaged software as only 'moderately successful' despite millions of pounds spent in research and development. By comparison, the group, Europe's third largest indigenously-owned computer services company, has demonstrated both strength and depth in systems integration and facilities management over the past few years. Next month it is expected to publish results for 1993 showing growth in both revenues and profits. In 1992 pre-tax profits increased by 39 per cent to Pounds 19.4m, on revenues of Pounds 416.7m. Analysts predict strong growth in 1994. Sema seems, therefore, to be successfully navigating the choppy waters of the recession and the slowdown in the computer industry, while many of its competitors are bailing furiously. Mr Bonelli attributes the company's sustained profitability to strategic decisions made in 1989, the year following the merger of CAP Group of the UK and Sema Metra of France. The group decided to concentrate on three sectors  -systems integration, facilities management and software packages. It was an unusual move: 'In the 1980s, few computer services companies thought about strategy; times were good and business was plentiful. There was no reason to pick and choose,' Mr Bonelli says. The plan was to earn 60 per cent of revenues from systems integration, 25 per cent from facilities management and 15 per cent from packages. Today, the ratio is 70:20:10, indicating that the company has failed fully to achieve its ambitions in packages. Mr Bonelli claims the company is the European leader in systems integration, which he defines as building complex systems for large customers. 'This is our most profitable activity, our basic livelihood. We are a key player in combat management systems, where our customers include the Royal Navy, in control systems for nuclear plant, in stock exchange back office systems and in banking systems. 'Now we are seeking new niches in which we can achieve some kind of dominance.' The wish list includes air traffic control, airline reservation systems, global distribution and telecommunications. Sema is jealous of its reputation as prime contractor for large projects of this kind. It is seething over suggestions that it is responsible for delays to the Schengen free-travel computer system in Strasbourg. It is prime contractor for the central system only. Mr Francois Dufaux of Sema said the problem was that no single contractor had responsibility for managing the overall project. Sema has also enjoyed success with the second leg of its strategy - facilities management. FM involves taking responsibility for part or all of a customer's computer systems, providing an agreed level of service for a fee. A weak spot, however, is France. Sema and International Business Machines had merged their FM operations in a joint venture called Axone. IBM bought out the computing services company last year: 'We got a good price, but it left us with nothing in France,' Mr Bonelli complains. The UK is a second problem area. Sema has won some good contracts, but it is having difficulty persuading the government that it is capable of managing the largest of the market-testing contracts - the Inland Revenue computer systems contract which went to Electronic Data Systems, for example. 'If we can handle BP world-wide, we can handle the Inland Revenue,' Mr Bonelli sniffs. He thinks the company's credibility with governments should be enhanced by its Pounds 20m purchase last year of the information technology operations of the Swedish state-owned SKDforetagen. Packaged software remains the chief problem. Sema moved into packages because it was a fast growing market sector. It was also anxious to expand business with multinational manufacturing companies which are big package users. But packages companies and systems integrators are culturally very different. Sema bought a German packages company, ADV Orga, to bridge the gap, but with only partial success. It is continuing to spend several million pounds a year, in co-operation with IBM, to refine I-Linie, a large scale industrial management package. Mr Bonelli agrees that the strategy has been expensive. 'There has always been a temptation to get out, but I believe the effort is worthwhile. As long as our board and shareholders go along with us and we continue to do well in systems integration and facilities management we ought to apportion that amount of our resources to get a strong position in the package market.' Abandoning packaged software would have an immediate effect on the level of earnings per share, but Sema has never favoured short-term solutions.</p>

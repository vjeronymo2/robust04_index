			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> United States of America, Plaintiff, v. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Defendants. Civil No. 94C50249. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Complaint <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, brings this civil action to obtain equitable and other relief against the defendants named herein, and complains and alleges as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Jurisdiction, Venue, And Defendants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. This complaint is filed under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 4, in order to prevent and restrain violations, as hereinafter alleged, by defendants of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Bayer A.G. (``Bayer''), a German corporation with its principal place of business at 5090 Leverkusen-Bayerwerk, Germany, is made a defendant. Bayer wholly owns and closely controls Miles, Inc., an Indiana corporation that maintains an established place of business at 9801 West Higgins Road, Rosemont, Illinois, in the Northern District of Illinois. Bayer, through its subsidiary, Miles, Inc., is found and transacts business in the Northern District of Illinois. Venue as to Bayer is proper under 15 U.S.C. 22 and 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (``Johnson''), a Wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business at 1525 Howe Street, Racine, Wisconsin, is made a defendant. Johnson is found and transacts business in the Northern District of Illinois. Venue as to Johnson is proper under 15 U.S.C. 22 and 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Trade And Commerce <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Defendant Bayer and its subsidiaries receive large amounts of money in the form of payments from manufacturers for the sale of active ingredients for use in household insecticides in the United States, and defendant Johnson and its subsidiaries receive large amounts of money from the sale of household insecticides to retailers and consumers throughout the United States. Defendants' business activities and operations, as hereinafter described, involve or affect the interstate and international flow of funds and are within the flow of, and have a substantial effect upon, interstate and foreign commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Household insecticides are chemical products that are sold in a wide variety of forms ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , aerosols, baits, powders, and traps) for use by consumers to trap or kill ants, roaches, crickets, and other undesirable insects that invade and infest houses, apartments and other dwellings. Because of their low cost, superior efficacy, and ease of use, there are no good substitutes for household insecticides, and thus they constitute a relevant product market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The relevant geographic market for the sale of household insecticides is the United States. Annual retail sales of household insecticides in the United States exceeded $450 million in 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The United States market for household insecticides is highly concentrated. Johnson is the largest manufacturer of household insecticides in the United States, with total sales between 45&hyph;60% of the market. Johnson's two next-largest competitors in the sale of household insecticides each have sales of no more than 12% of the market, and the shares of Johnson's three other major competitors range from 6 to 10% of the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Successful new entry into or expansion within the United States market for household insecticides is difficult. To be successful, a new entrant must demonstrate that its household insecticide has superior safety and efficacy, attributes that are solely dependent upon the active ingredient chosen for use in the product. Active ingredients must comply with state and federal government regulations for safety and efficacy prior to sale in the United States. Compliance with such laws and regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process that often takes more than three years and costs over $10 million to complete. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

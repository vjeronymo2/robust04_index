Kropotov (MosNPO  [Moscow scientific production associatio] ``Radon''); UDC  621.593]    [Abstract] Membrane distillation is a promising method for  deep water demineralization and purification. Its attraction for  processing of liquid radioactive waste is in its capability of  deep water purification and concentrating all impurities in one  flow. The article presents results of studies aimed at  determining the effect of various surfactants on the efficiency  of water demineralization by membrane distillation, and  determining the depth of radioactive water purification from [.sup]137[/]   Cs, [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]90[/]Y. It was  found that membrane distillation was inefficient in purification  or demineralization of water solutions containing surfactants  unless surfactant molecules had been eliminated by some other  means. It was also found that the use of membrane distillation  made it possible to achieve a fairly high coefficient of  purification of liquid radioactive waste and get a more  concentrated brine. The article suggests implementation of the  proposed method in a mobile unit for processing of liquid waste.  Figures 3, tables 2, references 7.</p>

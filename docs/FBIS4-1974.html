			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Two Yemeni gunmen  kidnapped this morning two members of a Chinese technical team  supervising the execution of the Jahanna-Maereb Road  construction project.    The two Chinese technicians were kidnapped 49 kilometers  away  from Jahanna.    The two Yemeni kidnappers claimed they would release the two  Chinese hostages only on condition that the work on the road  project should be stopped completely, threatening to kidnap  other members of the Chinese team supervising the construction  of the project unless their condition was met.    It is the fourth time that members of the Chinese technical  team were kidnapped since May, 1991.    Three members of the same team were kidnapped on February 12  and were set free after they had been detained for 10 days.    The situation in Yemen has been deteriorating in recent  years  and there has been recurrent abductions of accredited foreign  diplomats, tourists and employees of foreign companies operating  in Yemen.</p>

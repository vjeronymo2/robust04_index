			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME  </P> <P> American parents want safer, affordable child- care programs. The U.S. Senate  is now debating legislation that might deliver programs that meet that  description. But the question of how best to provide this care remains in  doubt. So is the fate of the bill, broadly cast as it is. As fast as its chief  sponsor, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), takes care of one objection, opponents  offer up another. His bill is even more sound now than when it started out, and  the Senate should vote it on its way.  </P> <P> The Dodd bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and supported by  Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine), would expand the amount of  child care available and provide subsidies for care of children when their  parents cannot afford it. Working with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), the  sponsors have reduced the original bill's direct federal funding for services  and subsidies, proposing to pay some of the costs through dependent care and  child health-care tax credits. The total bill remains $2.5 billion a year.  </P> <P> Last year the bill foundered on concerns about federal money going to  religiously affiliated child- care programs. Churches and synagogues provide  much of existing day care; backers wanted to preserve those services without  violating constitutional questions of church-state separation. The dilemma has  been resolved with a provision that churches and synagogue programs may receive  federal money as long as they do no discriminate against children whose care is  publicly subsidized and do not offer religious instruction.  </P> <P> Some governors did not want Washington to write health and safety standards for  the states. The new bill gets around that by having states set their own  standards. But it creates an advisory panel to draft model standards that  states could adopt if they chose. States that adopted model standards would  qualify for extra grants; states that did not would not. The National Governors  Assn. now supports the bill.  </P> <P> President Bush and some Republican senators want Congress to pass only a tax  credit for child care. But "tax credits standing alone simply do not address  the need for affordable, quality child care for parents in the work force,"  says Marion Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund and a key  architect of the bill. Bush's proposal would pay an average of $20 a week;  minimal child care costs at least $75.  </P> <P> Republicans charge also that the Dodd-Hatch bill will prevent parents from  deciding who will care for their children. The charge is unsupportable.  Families can use subsidies for care at day-care centers, at churches or  synagogues or in private homes. It is entirely up to them. The bill actually  would widen options by encouraging development of more day-care centers.  </P> <P> The day-care bill is a splendid expression of an idea whose time has come. It  should pass now.  </P></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / South Africa election decision 'in six weeks' A DATE for South Africa's first multi-racial election could be set within six weeks, the chief government negotiator in democracy talks said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cape Town. But Mr Roelf Meyer also said four issues needed to be resolved first in talks due to resume in Johannesburg on Monday. These were: the transition process, the composition and powers of an interim government of national unity, the powers of regional authorities during the transition, and ways to contain political violence and control security forces. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, widely expected to emerge as the largest party after democratic elections, has demanded early agreement on an election date and on joint control of the security forces. It has called for six weeks of mass protests across the country to press its demands. Mr Meyer said President F W de Klerk had set an agenda similar to the ANC's demands, but an election date could not be fixed until there was agreement on the mechanisms for transition.</p>

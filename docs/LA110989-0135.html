			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FOLSOM;  </P> <P> SEWAGE FROM PRISON DRAINS INTO RIVER  </P> <P> Folsom Prison reported that an estimated 13,500 gallons of raw sewage drained  into the American River last week. Warden R. G. Borg said inmates in the old  section of the prison apparently clogged a sewer line with plastic wrap, bags,  towels and torn sheets. The sewage came up out of a manhole just inside one of  the gates, ran down a street, out the gate and into a sewer drain. Borg said  blueprints showed that the drain led to a sanitary sewer, but that was wrong.  An interceptor line drained to a storm sewer that ends at the river. It was the  third raw sewage spill from the prison this year. A fourth spill was of treated  sewage.  </P></p>

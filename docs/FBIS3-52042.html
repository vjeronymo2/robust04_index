Taking a break during the presidential  visit to Leticia, [a Colombian city] on the Brazilian border,  Correa stressed: "There is a nationwide phenomenon, seeking  purity and clarity in public affairs." He mused: "The Judicial  Branch judges citizens. If they were to conduct an  investigation, an inquest ..."    In Brasilia, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive  Renewal Party-Para State], the chairman of the budget CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee], endorsed the idea of a  "self-examination" by the Judicial Branch, but reminded that  this branch has considered such a proposal offensive.    Passarinho noted: "If we want Brazil to bathe in ethics, it  should not just take place in the Legislative Branch." He added  that the Judicial Branch auditing office [corregedoria] should  operate more clearly and thus facilitate monitoring by public  opinion. He complained: "The Brazilian judicial system operates  like a corporation."    Minister Mauricio Correa stated that the three branches are  independent and that the formation of a commission to  investigate probable irregularities in the Judicial Branch would  have to be decided by the courts themselves. Recalling the  irregularities committed the INSS [National Social Security  Institute] judges, Correa said: "Such an initiative would be  welcomed by society." Mauricio Correa emphasized that, as a  senator, he favors the formation of a commission outside the  Judicial Branch to control it, adding that he has not considered  it in the name of the government.</p>

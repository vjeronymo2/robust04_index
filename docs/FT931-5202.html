			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Sport: A law unto themselves - Soccer SOCCER fans, officials, and even players and coaches agree that their game is not what it was. Yet every time Fifa, world soccer's governing body, tries to solve the problems by tweeking the laws, the response is outrage from those fans, officials, players and coaches. Fifa is ruining the good old game, they cry. Its recent obsession with the laws dates from the 1990 World Cup finals. The competition is Fifa's pride and joy. In Italy, Argentina reached the final after winning only two of their six games in normal play (they won their quarter-final and semi-final on penalty shoot-outs). On the way, they scored only five goals and accumulated 20 yellow cards and one red card. In the final, they barely attacked. The balance of the game had tipped too far in favour of defence. Furthermore, Fifa's statistics showed that, during the finals, the ball was in play for an average of just over 50 minutes a game and sometimes much less; far too low. Fifa decided to act. As is so often the case, though, the effects of its attempted reforms have been rather less dramatic than expected. Both Fifa and its critics have under-estimated the wit and resilience of players and coaches. The first change was a law introduced last season which meant defenders who stopped a goal attempt by foul play would be shown the red card. Sendings-off in the English league rose 21 per cent, from 202 to 245 - or just one extra offence punished every 47 games. There was little noticeable change in the quality and style of play. By last August, professionals had something else to moan about. Fifa had made it illegal for goalkeepers to pick up back passes. This change was intended, says Fifa's Andreas Herren, to eliminate time-wasting and to force defenders to try to create attacks. Despite its good intentions, the change drew predictable criticism. One is that - heaven forbid] - it forces goalkeepers to play football. Another, common in England, is that it has speeded a game that was too fast already. But this was Fifa's intention. In any case, it depends what you mean by 'fast.' In English soccer, nobody is running any faster: they were at top speed already. There are just fewer gaps in the helter-skelter. An amateur referee told me that the back pass penalises defenders when there is no foul play: but the same could be said of off-side and the rules that limit goalkeepers to four steps with the ball. He also said that while he was happy to see the long back pass eliminated, it was unfair to remove a defender's only option when facing his goal in tight situations. In truth, the sight of highly-paid professionals making idiots of themselves has added greatly to the joy of soccer this season. Fifa is still not happy. Its international board met last Saturday in Hertfordshire, England, to kick around the idea of replacing throw-ins with kick-ins. Afterwards, Sepp Blatter, Fifa's general secretary, admitted disarmingly that he did not have a clue what effect this change might have. Herren says Fifa have made no final decision on whether kick-ins will be direct or if players can be offside from them. It proposes to experiment with the change in two youth tournaments. If it works, there will be another trial in the Hungarian league. If not, it will be dropped, which is why the whingers are moaning now. They may not have the opportunity later. Purists blame the proposal (like so many things) on the Americans, even though the change will not affect the 1994 World Cup in the US. Anyone who has taken Americans to soccer games will know that one thing they always ask is: 'If it's football, why do the players throw the ball in?' Good question. The answer is that, originally, the ball was kicked in; the rule was changed to limit the range. That is why the mechanics of the throw-in are so complicated. There are amateur teams without a single player able to throw in the ball legally, and foul throws are irritatingly common even at the highest levels. Now that Fifa wants to find extra ways of getting the ball into the goalmouth, restoring the kick is a logical move. Critics complain that a kick-in would 'devalue a corner.' But the goal standard is soccer's only meaningful currency. In any case, English soccer is packed already with players who can hurl throw-ins 30 yards into the goalmouth. The truth is that this reform would have far less effect than critics suggest. Meanwhile, the Argentinians collected all those cards in Italy by persistent foul play and Fifa has not addressed that problem. Defenders can still give attackers a good kicking and get away with it. The laws demand that the referee must be a mind-reader. He must assess a player's 'intent' to commit a foul. Defenders have become masters of the 'unintentional' collision. In practice, referees are often prepared to judge by appearances. David Elleray, a top referee, suggests that the laws should make it a foul 'if a player makes contact with an opponent without or before making contact with the ball.' That might eliminate some of the bone-crunching, tendon-severing collisions that some consider one of the more attractive elements of British soccer. It would, however, give attackers a better chance of making it through a defence, through a match or even through a season, in one piece.</p>

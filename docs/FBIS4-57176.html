			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Politburo member Nelson Torres, who is also  sugar industry minister, congratulated workers at the Jose Maceo  bulk sugar terminal in Boqueron, Guantanamo Province for the  terminal's designation as the most efficient in Cuba since the  beginning of the sugar harvest.    This terminal, located right next to the Yankee naval base,  had profits of $125,000 during the first four months of 1994 as  a result of its prompt dispatch of ships. To date, the  terminal's port workers have loaded some 20 ships from different  countries, and have earned $1.05 in profits for every ton moved,  which is more than twice the income earned during the last such  identical period.</p>

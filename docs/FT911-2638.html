			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 31m provisions leave Clayform Pounds 39m in loss CLAYFORM PROPERTIES, the property developer, saw a sharp reversal in its fortunes last year as the fall in property values necessitated heavy exceptional provisions against the group's development portfolio. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.03m in 1989 turned into a loss of Pounds 39.14m in the year to December 31, largely as a result of Pounds 31.56m in provisions stemming from a reappraisal of the group's development portfolio. The reappraisal resulted in a substantial write-down of the group's developments in Bristol, Cannon Street and Sheffield. Turnover was up to Pounds 83.90m (Pounds 82.42m). The loss per share was 101.0p (earnings 36.7p) and net assets per share were halved to 201p (410p). No final dividend is recommended (6.5p) bringing the total for the year to 2p (10p). 'This country has been experiencing the worst property recession in my experience,' commented Mr Bryan Burletson, chairman. Although the market now appears to have hit bottom, 'I don't see any early rise,' he said. The group's borrowings, which shot up when Stead &amp; Simpson was acquired for Pounds 120m in 1989, have been reduced from a year-end figure of Pounds 125m to Pounds 85m, chiefly through disposals, which, since January last year and through to after the year end, amounted to Pounds 30m. A sharp fall in net assets, from Pounds 150.69m to Pounds 75.83m, however, means gearing was at 112 per cent.</p>

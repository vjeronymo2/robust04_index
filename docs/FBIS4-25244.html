			<p>BFN     [Text] The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)  has denied speculation that Liu Hongru will resign as chairman.  Although no official statement has been issued, a commission  spokeswoman said the State Council, China's Cabinet, had denied  reports of Mr Liu stepping down from the job he has held since  the CSRC was created in 1992. "We confirm that there is no news  of Mr Liu's resignation. And this confirmation is from the  State Council," she said, referring to the State Council  Securities Policies Committee (SCSPC). The CSRC is an executive  agency of SCSPC.    Reports of Mr Liu's departure have been in the Hong Kong  media in the past few weeks. "Such reports will have an adverse  impact on the stock market and they should not be issued without  our confirmation," she added.    As the man most identified with China's stock markets, Mr  Liu  is instrumental in laying the groundwork for the historic  listing of mainland corporations in Hong Kong. Another feather  will be added to his cap when five of the 22 companies in the  second batch of enterprises slated for overseas flotation head  for Wall Street next year.</p>

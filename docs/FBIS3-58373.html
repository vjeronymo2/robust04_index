			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Charles Pasqua, minister of state for </F> Interior and Terrritorial Development, by Franz-Olivier  Giesbert, in Paris--live]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Charles Pasqua, good morning.    [Pasqua] Good morning.    [Giesbert] You are the deputy prime minister of the  government. So far, everybody agreed that you had not made any  mistakes. You have changed quite a lot.    [Pasqua] Do you think so?    [Giesbert] Yes. You have become quite consensual.    [Pasqua] No, not especially.    [Giesbert] In any case, two affairs have tarnished your good  image recently, one after the other. First of all, the Kraouche  affair. One of the documents found at the home of the Algerian  Islamic activist is alleged to belong to the French counter-  intelligence services. It is not very nice. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Let us now talk about the Iranians affair. In  1986, you promised you would terrorize terrorists.    [Pasqua] And so I did.    [Giesbert] Yes. We are now under the impression that the  terrorists are the ones terrorizing.    [Pasqua] When I arrived at the Ministry of Interior in 1986,  bombs were going off in Paris and we had 10 being held hostage.  We did what we had to do. We do not feel any misplaced vanity  about it, but you will notice that at the time, we did not  explain what we were doing either. You can now see the results.    [Giesbert] You sent two suspects back to their home country  in order to enable them to escape from the Swiss judiciary,  didn't you?    [Pasqua] The issue is not to enable them to escape from the  Swiss judiciary. The issue, when one is faced with this type of  situation, as I explained yesterday -- [pauses] the role of the  interior minister is first and foremost to guarantee the  security of people and property in France and to see to it that  threats coming from abroad do not damage French interests, in  France or elsewhere.    [Giesbert] The Americans have asked you for explanations.    [Pasqua] I do not have to give any explanations to the  Americans. I am not an employee of Mr. Clinton's. I know that  the Americans have on their territory one of the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front] leaders abroad, Mr. Anouar Adnan. We  protested, and they answered that they could not do anything  about it.    [Giesbert] Didn't you deport these Iranians suspects to get  Tehran's help against Algerian FIS Islamic fundamentalists?  This is what everyone thinks.    [Pasqua] It is typical of journalists to speculate.    [Giesbert] When the state interest is put forward, we have  no  choice but to find out what the state interest may be.    [Pasqua] Indeed, it is only normal; it is totally logical.  However, should we give you an explanation, I am convinced that  it would not satisfy you and that you would think there was more  to it.    [Giesbert] It is our job.    [Pasqua] It is indeed. You may calculate, speculate,  prophesy, do. But when national interest is at stake -- and I  believe that the prime minister said clearly that it was the  case -- some things cannot be said. [sentence indistinct]    [Giesbert] Despite all this, you have cause for  satisfaction:  crime has decreased by 0.6 per cent since April, when you  arrived at Place Beauvau [Interior Ministry]. Do you think that  it is due to the fact that you frighten deliquents?    [Pasqua] No, I do not believe that it is due to the fact  that  I frighten deliquents. [passage omitted]</p>

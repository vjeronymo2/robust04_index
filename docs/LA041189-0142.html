Gates announced today.  </P> <P> Gates said the suspects are "top-level people" in the distribution of drugs  shipped in from overseas. He said a major share of the cocaine confiscated had  probably been destined for shipment to other cities across the United States.  The arrests late Monday culminated a two-month investigation, Gates said.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Utilities could sue over reactor Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, acknowledged yesterday that the government could be sued for up to FFr18bn (Pounds 2bn) by French, Italian and German utilities as a result of its decision to use their Superphenix fast breeder reactor for research into nuclear waste rather than producing electricity. Explaining the government's controversial decision, Mr Longuet said: 'There is no good financial solution to this problem - stopping the reactor costs money, starting it costs money.' He said France was not abandoning its lead over other countries in fast breeder reactor technology, but for the time being it was more important to use the Superphenix for research into destroying plutonium waste than creating it. Superphenix was conceived in the 1970s, and commissioned in 1986, to produce more plutonium byproduct than it took in from French nuclear power stations, in order to make France self-sufficient in nuclear fuel. But the subsequent fall in uranium prices, availability of plutonium from de-commissioned Russian nuclear weapons and the growing problem of plutonium waste from France's 56 reactors have pursuaded the French government to try to turn Superphenix into a destroyer, not a creator of plutonium. Last month the French nuclear safety inspectorate said Superphenix, shut down since a July 1990 accident, coud be restarted, but only at low power and provided work on its sodium cooling system was finished. This decision appeared to have forced the government's hand, because the three partners in the Nersa consortium which runs Superphenix - Electricite de France, Enel of Italy and SBK of Germany - might have sued it for continuing the shutdown on political grounds. But anticipating unhappiness among the Nersa partners that they now face no prospect of generating electricity from the reactor for some time, Mr Longuet said he hoped they would stay in the consortium to draw useful research from Superphenix's new use as a waste disposal prototype. Dismantling the reactor entirely would cost the consortium FFr8-10bn in addition to losing them their original FFr278bn in the ill-fated plant, Mr Longuet said. EdF and Enel yesterday said they were still considering their reaction to the government decision. Ministers could put no figure on the cost of the new research programme, but said the CEA, the French atomic energy authority, would bear much of the research costs itself.

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK orders Sudan ambassador out Britain yesterday ordered Sudan's ambassador to leave the country within 14 days in retaliation for Khartoum's decision last week to expel the British ambassador, Reuter reports. Britain had given Sudan until yesterday to reverse its decision to expel the British ambassador, a move triggered by a visit by the Archbishop of Canterbury to mainly Christian areas in rebel-controlled southern Sudan. Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, junior foreign office minister, summoned Sudanese charge d'affaires Abdurrahman Bakhit and told him Britain was expelling the ambassador, Sayed Ali Mohammed Osman Yassin, with regret and disappointment, the Foreign Office said. The expulsion was a consequence of the Sudanese government's unsatisfactory explanation for its action in expelling Mr Peter Streams, the British ambassador. Mr Yassin is also Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, and is now in New York.</p>

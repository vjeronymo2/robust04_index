			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Porsche plunges into the red PORSCHE, the troubled German luxury sports car maker, warned yesterday of a further deterioration in its business position during this year as it confirmed that losses in the six months to the end of January totalled DM120m (Dollars 73m) compared with a first-half profit of DM3m in the previous year. Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chief executive, who had given a hint of the extent of first-half losses in January, said sales and profits for the full year to the end of July would be down significantly. He gave no figure for the scale of the full-year loss but said sales were likely to be between DM1.7bn and DM1.9bn, down about a third from DM2.68bn in 1991-1992. The loss last year was DM65.8m. At the company's annual meeting near Stuttgart, Mr Wiedeking said the number of cars produced this year would be 15,000 to 17,000, down from 23,000 last year. Units sold fell 39 per cent in the first six months of the year, down to 6,620. Sales in Germany tumbled 43 per cent to 2,907 units. Turnover for the six months was down 35 per cent from DM1.255bn to DM820m. Mr Wiedeking, appointed chief executive in September, reiterated the company's determination to remain independent. He predicted that with a revival in the world economy together with the introduction of planned new models, unit sales would be back to more than 30,000 a year from 1996-1997. Sales reached a peak in the mid-1980s when units sold exceeded 50,000. Porsche intends to cut the cost base by 30 per cent by 1995. It is to shed 1,800 jobs in the current year.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Persecuted Indians attack ghost of Columbus: Latin American groups find nothing to celebrate 500 years after explorer's arrival CHRISTOPHER Columbus would not have approved. The anniversary of his arrival in the New World 500 years ago today has been expropriated by the very Indians whose subjugation followed his arrival. Celebrations have turned into protests by Indian groups at the miserable conditions and discrimination under which they live. Indian activists in Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico have staged street marches. In Nicaragua, indigenous groups from 24 countries are converging for a conference: 500 years of indigenous resistance, black and popular. 'There is nothing to celebrate,' says Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Indian and human rights activist leading the conference. 'The rights of the Indian peoples continue to be violated,' says Ms Menchu, a candidate for this year's Nobel peace prize. Latin nations, faced with the choice between celebrating with Spain and Portugal or sympathising with oppressed indigenous groups, have chosen the latter, or stayed silent. One hundred years ago, the same creole elites ruling the continent faced no such inhibitions: the Guatemalan government forced 20,000 Indians to march through the capital to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' arrival. In Mexico, while the government has been virtually silent, hundreds of Indians have converged on Mexico City, where they will gather today in the capital's central square. Genero Dominguez, an indigenous activist on hunger strike there, says the campaign is to 'remind the world of the crimes committed against us in the name of progress and discovery'. The mobilisation of indigenous groups across Latin America in part reflects the repression and deterioration in living standards they suffered in the 1980s in particular. Anti-Columbus campaigning has provided a focus for their concerns. 'Everyone is talking about Indians,' says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in exile in Mexico City. 'It is the first step in our fight to be recognised.' In the cities of Mexico, Indians are 'poor, often extremely poor, and have the lowest, most vulnerable, precarious conditions,' according to a government report. Inevitably, their cultural identity is threatened: 'The culture of the Maya is based on land, corn, the family and communal life.' says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in exile in Mexico City. 'When you come to the cities this changes.' Government policy across Latin America has systematically favoured urban over rural areas where the majority of indigenous peoples live. Some 70 per cent of Mexico's 8m Indians live in rural areas. Even in the countryside, the Indians are the poorest: 97 per cent of Mexico's rural Indians live in 'impoverished' counties, against 23 per cent of rural Mexicans in general. No one knows the exact number of Indians killed in land disputes or by security forces in the 1980s, but Amnesty International concluded in a report released last week that mass killings may have reduced in scale in the past 500 years, but 'they have never stopped.' In Guatemala alone tens of thousands of Indians were murdered in the 1980s by state security forces in the campaign to eliminate leftist insurgency groups. Those celebrating the quincentenary appear slightly embarrassed. In the Dominican Republic, a visit by the Pope threatened to become a public relations disaster. He was to have inaugurated the light-house on land Colombus first spotted, but the Vatican became embarrassed at criticism that it would take a large slice of the country's electricity and infrastructure spending. The lighthouse was opened last week before the Pope arrived. The discrimination, and poverty in which most Indians live means it will take time before any new concern leads to results. Mr Guillermo Espinosa, head of Mexico's National Indigenous Institute warns: 'The indigenous peoples will keep on protesting, but I am very sceptical the general public will change their opinion. There may now be a sentimental reaction but there is not an analytical or objective understanding of their plight.'</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Government split over control of education A split between the prime minister's office and the Department of Education opened yesterday over future local government control of education. Mr Graham Bright, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John Major, appeared to tell his local county council in a letter that local government re-organisation in England would mean the abolition of local education authorities. He said: 'I very much hope that Bedfordshire County Council will recognise that the introduction of grant-maintained status for schools is permanent and that its own imminent demise signals the end for local education authorities.' But the education department said that it had no plans to abolish local education authorities 'in the lifetime of this parliament'. Local government re-organisation is due to take place in 1995 and 1996, before the next general election is due. Education ministers have, however, strongly encouraged schools to opt out of local authority control, and instead take their funding directly from Whitehall. Labour seized on Mr Bright's comments as an admission of a Tory 'hidden agenda'. Education is a county responsibility in non-metropolitan England, and counties are due to be split into smaller all-purpose authorities under the government's guidance to the Local Government Commission. It had been assumed that the new unitary councils would inherit responsibility for education, the largest single item of local government spending. County education officers oppose re-organisation, saying that it would weaken services. Mr Bright attacked 'the re-creation of the old local authority empire over schools', saying this would favour 'the most hidebound vested interests in education'. Bedfordshire, which has no overall political control, said that 13 of the county's schools had opted out, while 277 remained in county control. It added that Mr Bright appeared to have prejudged the outcome of the review, which could still, under government guidelines, recommend that the two-tier system continue. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the comments were 'a mixture of admission of the government's hidden agenda, and a sign of desperation that the grant-maintained schools are not catching on in anything like the way the government intended'. She added that the practical problems of abolishing local education authorities would be too great, as the government would not be able to run schools in the country.</p>

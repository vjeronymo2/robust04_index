			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Hill farming grants fall Pounds 25m in fresh round of cuts - Agriculture Hill farmers will take the brunt of cuts in agricultural spending for a second year running, under plans announced by the Ministry of Agriculture yesterday. The ministry said that hill livestock compensatory allowances (HLCAs), paid to 67,000 farmers in difficult areas covering half of the UK's farmland, would be reduced by Pounds 25m to Pounds 105m next year. This follows a cut of Pounds 20m in the current year. Ministry officials argue that hill farmers' net incomes have risen on average by 70 per cent in real terms over the past two years, thanks largely to the devaluation of the 'green pound', the artificial exchange rate used to translate EU subsidies into sterling. This has pushed up the value of those subsidies sharply and also increased British meat exports, raising domestic prices. Some hill farmers will receive as much as Pounds 27,000 in direct subsidies this year, the ministry estimates. National subsidies are being reduced as support from Brussels rises. The National Farmers Union said that the boost from devaluation had merely taken real incomes back to the level of 1988. Average hill incomes were still less than Pounds 10,000 or 60 per cent of the national average wage, it said. 'It's a body-blow for farmers in what is an extremely difficult sector,' said Mr David Naish, the union's president. 'Selective cuts of this kind will not only have a devastating impact on the working of hill farms but also on the landscape and rural economies.' Overall domestic agricultural spending will be Pounds 40m lower than last autumn's plans of Pounds 1.08bn, compared with Pounds 1.11bn this year. The Common Agricultural Policy portion of the Budget will be Pounds 130m higher than planned at Pounds 2.64bn. Apart from the HLCAs, about Pounds 12m will be cut from a grant scheme to help farmers dispose of waste. Agricultural research funding will also be cut. A Pounds 30m three-year programme to encourage environmentally friendly farming will be launched as planned next year, but with a delay of several months in payments to farmers.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: European cars The European car market is set to recover from last year's cyclical trough. But much of this year's growth - expected to be 4 to 5 per cent - is due to government-sponsored sales incentive schemes in France and Spain. In Germany, election nerves are limiting the pace of recovery. The rebound in the UK market reported last week disguised a fall in the number of cars bought by consumers, the growth coming exclusively from fleet buyers. All this points to a long, slow recovery. General Motors predicted at the Paris motor show that European car production would not reach the previous cyclical peak of 1989-90 until the end of the century. The path back will be dogged by mounting competition, between the major US and European manufacturers as well as from Japanese producers. It is thus unlikely that margins will ever be restored to the levels achieved in the late 1980s. Shares in European manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Peugeot have risen strongly over the past 18 months in anticipation of a pronounced recovery in earnings, but the scope for recovery in Europe is hampered by social and political impediments to rationalisation. The measures taken by Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen to cut costs look feeble in comparison with the root-and-branch restructuring pushed through by the US majors. European car manufacturers may experience a bounce in earnings from current levels, but the cyclical upside for investors is likely to be less pronounced than it has been in the US.</p>

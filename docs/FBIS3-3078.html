The meeting, to be held March 26 and 27 in Bangkok,  Thailand,  will focus on reviewing some of the progress the city has made  since it was chosen to host 1998 Asian Games.    The site of the 2002 Asian Games is expected to be decided  during the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan this October.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee has selected  the southern port city of Kaohsiung to represent Taiwan in its  bid to host the 2002 Asian Games.    Kaohsiung beat out Taipei 12 to 7 with one absentation  during  voting Monday [14 March].    The Olympic Committee' decision will be sent to the Ministry  of Education and the Executive Yuan to await final approval.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bernt Conrad: "Disturbed Relationship"] </F>   [Text] The formerly smooth Franco-German cooperation has  been disturbed. Bonn's irritation at the fact that Helmut Kohl  has not been invited to the victory celebrations in Normandy and  ill-feelings in Paris regarding the fact that the allied troops  in Berlin will be sent off without a parade, are symptoms of  disrupted communication.    This is particularly disadvantageous in view of the latent  insecurity about the new role of the united Germany that can be  felt among our Western neighbors. Will Germany's regained  central position change anything about the Western orientation  in our foreign policy, particularly about the Franco-German  friendship as the European axis?    One ought to discuss these things openly with our neighbors  on the Seine. Yet, despite the general assertions by the  federal chancellor, this is obviously virtually not being done.    Yet, as one expert on French politics stated, the  Franco-German friendship is not a natural river, the course of  which can be neglected. It has to be cultivated.    The extension of the European Union [EU] toward the east,  the  position toward Russia, containment of the conflict in the  Balkans, and, in particular, the restructuring of the  decisionmaking process in the EU, which will be enlarged by the  EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, requires a  Franco-German relationship that is intact. Only when Paris and  Bonn/Berlin continue to stand trustfully side by side, will it  be possible to ban the many specters of the past that are  darting in and out again.</p>

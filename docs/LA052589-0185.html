			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY ANOTHER RESIGNED  </P> <P> John Hemer, former director of housing and economic development, said Wednesday  that one of the reasons he resigned in April was the City Council's growing  involvement in day-to-day city affairs.  </P> <P> "From my perspective, this is a blurring of the distinction between  establishing policies versus day-to-day administration of the city," Hemer  said.  </P> <P> He said he does not question the council's right to become more involved.  "That's their prerogative," he said, adding that it's hard to say whether the  council's growing involvement is a more effective way of running the city.  Hemer added that the main reason he decided to leave was that his new job as  director of real estate for the Los Angeles Redevelopment Agency was a very  attractive career move.  </P> <P> Last Friday, City Manager Ralph Webb resigned under pressure from the council.  The council has appointed Administrative Services Director Michael Yelton as  acting city manager.  </P></p>

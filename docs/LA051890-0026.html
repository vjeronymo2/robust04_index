			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'STRAPLESS': THE PLOT JUST DOESN'T HOLD UP  </P> <P> "Strapless," written and directed by David Hare, is supposed to be a romantic  movie for literate grown-ups. In other words, there's not a whole lot of  yelling and hair-pulling and laughter -- there's not a whole lot of life.  </P> <P> All this dull anomic melancholy is nevertheless meant to signify the currents  of cultured passion. Hare, best known as the playwright of "Plenty," is  indulging in a subtle, snobby high-art game here. By stifling the messiness of  romantic emotion, he's aiming for a "higher" truth cleansed of "common"  feeling. The educated bourgeois sufferers in "Strapless" (at selected theaters)  indulge their sorrows as if they were expensive pets.  </P> <P> Blair Brown is Lillian, an American working for the past 12 years in London as  a hospital physician. Vacationing abroad for a week, nursing the breakup of a  long-term relationship with an actor, she finds herself being romanced by  Raymond Forbes (Bruno Ganz), a mysterious, well-tailored gent who doesn't blink  very much. Her retreat from his advances only sparks his ardor; he traces her  back to London and proceeds to court her shamelessly, buying her everything  from flowers to horses to BMWs. His hand-dog mooniness finally gets to her,  even though she knows precious little about him except that he's some kind of  bullion entrepreneur and that he speaks his heavily accented English  exceedingly slowly, in complete sentences.  </P> <P> Raymond's otherworldly passion is meant to contrast with Lillian's pinched  reserve. Even though she's an able doctor, she doesn't draw much emotional  sustenance from her work. Her career has closed off her life; she gives and  gives and, in the film's narrow terms, gets nothing back. When Raymond cajoles  her with a marriage offer, asking her if she's ever wanted to do something  "that didn't entirely make sense," she's primed to respond.  </P> <P> "Strapless" (rated R) has a super-sophisticated veneer but it's really just an  artsy variant on the  lonely-spinster-on-vacation-finds-love-with-a-mysterious-stranger scenario.  It's "Summertime" with British damp. Hare wants us to recognize that, despite  Lillian's professional role as healer, she's in need of emotional repair  herself. It's too neat a formulation. Lillian's romantic renewal seems  preordained; it's like the working out of a theorem. In any case, since she  doesn't seem to be banking too many fires, her Raymond-inspired "release" has  no heat. She's still the same vaguely happy, vaguely sad woman at the end as  she was at the beginning. And Raymond is the same cipher.  </P> <P> No doubt Hare intends all this to be a more modern and adult version of what  love is really like. No fireworks, just a few spluttering sparklers. But the  cultivated high tone of these quasi-lovers isn't necessarily so realistic; by  dampening their passions, Hare is foisting his own version of "Invasion of the  Body Snatchers" on us. Lillian and Raymond are such tony sufferers they're  practically pod people.  </P> <P> The only member of the cast who creates a stir is Bridget Fonda, playing  Lillian's younger sister. Fonda's Amy, an aspiring clothes designer who camps  out in Lillian's apartment with an assortment of mod friends, has the life  force that Hare denies the rest of his characters. Fonda has a sequence in  which she recoils before her sister's wrath, and another when she returns that  wrath, that are so finely felt that it's as if we were watching the emergence  of a major actress right before our eyes. Amy is in the movie to give the film  a classic balance. She and Lillian, so different on the surface, share the same  plight. They're "strapless," at large in a world where their faith is not soon  repaid.  </P> <P> Fonda's ferocity upsets this too-neat balance. If only the film belonged to  her.  </P></p>

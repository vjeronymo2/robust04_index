			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raj Mohan Vajpayee: "No Solution to the Kashmir </F> Problem Will Be Had From Headsupmanship"]    [Text] There has been a major change in the U.S. attitude.  During the cold war it used its destructive military might as a  medium for political victories, however, this policy was not  successful. Vietnam is a prominent example of this failure. The  U.S. viewpoint changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. It is  implementing a policy of having various parties hold talks in  order to maintain its dominance. Examples of these efforts are  the Arab-Israeli talks and talks among the Serb, Croat, and  Muslim communities in Bosnia.    The United States may have its own interests in holding  these  talks. We would be ignoring facts if we believe that this police  work being done by the United States to establish law and order  at international level is an unselfish deed. Have these policies  succeeded in establishing peace in the nations involved? Has the  fighting and the mutual destruction changed? We can surmise the  answer to these questions by reviewing the present world  situation.    The statements issued by President Clinton and his  administration over India-Pakistan relations have created a  controversial situation. If we look at former President Bush's  term, we will find that there is a major difference between the  two. It would be wrong to believe that the role of bilateral  talks in the U.S. policy, especially in foreign policy or  international relations, is not important. It has helped various  nations depending on their interests and their having  cooperated--be it Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel, or Pakistan. The  fact that it did not help them because of altruistic reasons is  a different issue.    The Jammu-Kashmir question has an important place in  India-Pakistan relations. It would be ignoring facts if we think  that the bitterness between India and Pakistan will end if the  Jammu-Kashmir issue is resolved. There are many chasms between  the two countries, and it would not be appropriate to say that  if one chasm is filled up the other chasms will not cause  problems.    If we say that the United States is very worried over  Kashmir, then it must be shedding crocodile tears or it is the  change in its foreign policy affected after the fall of the  Soviet Union. Why did not the U.S. attitude change when Pakistan  gave away Aksai Chin region to its then-declared enemy China?  The United States continued to be Pakistan's supporter and  adopted a harsh attitude toward India.    There is no doubt that Pakistan used aggressive lobbying to  keep its position strong in the United States, and India has  been laggard in this area. India has recently been expressing  its reactions to various developments. It is clear from India's  spending about 8 billion rupees for lobbying that our policy is  very myopic and ineffective. The results are in front of us; the  United States is not influenced by the Indian side.    A while ago, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel declared the  1947 merger of Jammu-Kashmir with India to be totally  disputable. Earlier, the almost-appointed ambassador to India,  Solarz, had also disappointed the Indian government with his  statements. It is not true that Siddhartha Shankar Ray, the  present Indian ambassador to the Untied States, has been  successful in presenting the Indian side effectively to the  United States. Therefore, the wrong impressions that the United  States has about India will remain for some time.    We cannot deny that after the Robin Raphel statement, there  has existed an anti-United States attitude among all Indian  opposition parties, intellectuals, and the media. The United  States did not express any reaction to Raphel's statements in  the beginning. However, seeing the increasing Indian reaction,  spokesmen and officials in the Clinton administration issued  statements declaring the Jammu-Kashmir related announcements to  be personal opinions, that there has been no change in the U.S.  policy on India and expressed happiness at the India-Pakistan  talks at the secretary level.    The words of Woodrow Wilson Center's Mitchell Reese about  India-Pakistan relations seem to be very realistic. According to  him, the Kashmir issue cannot be used to hinder resolution of  other problems. He believes that resolution of various minor  problems will create an atmosphere conducive of resolving larger  issues. Before the 2 January talks at foreign secretary level,  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had said that India-Pakistan  relations will not improve until the Kashmir issue is taken care  of. The foreign minister of Pakistan also announced in  Parliament that Jammu-Kashmir would become a part of Pakistan  within the next five years because India would have fallen by  then. We can call these statements efforts by Pakistani rulers  to impress the Pakistani people or to shut up the opposition.  However, why is the United States ignoring such statements by  one side when efforts are being made to improve India-Pakistan  relations? Does the United States think that Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto has the right to declare in the United States  that Pakistan will never suspend its nuclear program? Pakistan  will continue to expand its program despite all the pressure,  and pressure will be put on India to sign the NPT. Clinton is  talking about removing the various restrictions imposed on  Pakistan. What can we infer from such American thinking?    There is no doubt that Pakistan, Kashmiri militant  organizations, and their supporters have retained the services  of such companies as Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly for  powerful and effective lobbying. This not only spreads their  ideas and statements, but also influences important people. It  is believed that an organization of non-resident Kashmiris, the  Kashmiri-American Council, that supports a plebiscite in  Kashmir, has hired the expensive lobbying firm of Stone and  Kelly. One major result of this effort is President Clinton's  ten-line long letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, the executive director  of the Kashmiri-American Council. We find that the  Washington-based organization Kashmiri-American Council is  strongly opposed to Maharajah Hari Singh's merger of  Jammu-Kashmir with India. This organization has challenged  Jammu-Kashmir's merger with India from the very beginning. There  is no doubt that this organization receives all kind of support  from Pakistan, other Islamic nations that agree with it, and  various so-called human rights organizations.    President Clinton told Ghulam Nabi Fai in his letter that he  would like to work with people like him to establish peace in  Kashmir. He expressed his agreement with Fai and wrote that the  human rights aspect should have a strong place in his policies  in the changed world situation after the Cold War. It is  possible that Clinton's letter was just expressing hope for the  future. However, Ghulam Nabi Fai, the Kashmiri-American  Council, and its members will not only propagate it as U.S.  agreeing with them, but also prove a major headache for India by  amplifying the effect of this letter. If we look at the events  prior to this letter, it should be clear that Assistant  Secretary Robin Raphel's opinion about Kashmir and the feelings  hidden in President Clinton's letter complement each other. A  third party has been added to the Kashmir problem.    If we look at the Jammu-Kashmir issue and India-Pakistan  relations, we will learn that White House residents before  Clinton had repeatedly said that India and Pakistan should  resolve this issue according to the Shimla agreement of 1972.  There is no mention of a third party in the Shimla agreement.  The UN resolutions call for the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and  Laddakh to decide whether they want to stay in India or  Pakistan. The question arises whether the present situation is  appropriate for holding a plebiscite. Is there a specific  deadline for such an atmosphere? What will the situation be like  in Jammu-Kashmir when an appropriate situation is created?    If we look at the U.S. President's opinions as these appear,  it seems that there have been major changes in the foreign  policy and the thinking of the influential people in the  administration after the end of the cold war. From the Indian  perspective, especially within the framework of India-Pakistan  relations, this change does not agree with the Indian view  point. The United States, despite its open denial, does want to  establish its supremacy here. It seems that the events related  to Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti have not taught a lesson to the  U.S. policy-makers. The strong U.S. desire to dominate the talks  in Jammu-Kashmir will not resolve this issue because both India  and Pakistan do not want the Kashmiri people to make a decision  against them. In addition, even when we grant that India and  Pakistan may change their Kashmir-related policy under  international pressure, will it help a move toward permanent  peace?  *</p>

The Abkhazian Supreme Soviet press centre informed ITAR-TASS  that the decision was necessary due to the suspension of the  deployment of CIS peacemaking forces into the confrontation zone  on the Inguri river, in compliance with the agreement on  ceasefire and disengagement of troops which was undertaken in  Moscow.</p>

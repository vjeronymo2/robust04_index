			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): ISS goes for a local clean-up ISS International Service Systems, the Danish office cleaning group, has hired a local man to head its North American division, the market leader in the US cleaning business, writes Hilary Barnes. Dennis Spina, 50, president and chief executive of Suburban Propane, the second largest retail distributor of propane gas in the US, has replaced Henrik Slipsager. Slipsager quit after he was passed over this summer in the battle to succeed the group's veteran chief executive, Poul Andreassen, when he retires in 1996. Spina's arrival at ISS coincides with the Danish firm's decision to get its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and raise Dollars 80m of new capital. ISS's profits have grown rapidly over the past four years and North America now accounts for 44 per cent of the group's revenues. Roughly 45,000 of ISS's 120,000 employees are based in North America. Suburban Propane is part of Hanson Industries which acquired it when the UK conglomerate took over Quantum Chemical in September 1993. Spina is being replaced by the group's chief financial officer Salvatore Quadrino. Quadrino, 47, will be based in Whippany, New Jersey. William Crosby, 73, one of the grand old men of the US life insurance industry, is stepping down after 27 years as chief executive of US Life, the New York-based insurance company which has Dollars 132bn of life insurance in force. Crosby, who entered the life insurance industry immediately after he was discharged from the US Navy, started in business as an insurance agent in Tennessee before moving to New York where he helped set up the state's first life company. William Simpson, 55, who was chief operating officer of Transamerica Occidental Life before he joined US Life in 1990, takes over as chief executive on January 1. Crosby will continue as chairman of the board and the executive committee.</p>

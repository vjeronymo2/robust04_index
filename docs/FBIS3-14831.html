			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "First Responses to the President's </F> Message"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Russian Federation  president's message to the Federal Assembly "contains a  sufficiently powerful potential charge for the main areas of  domestic and foreign policy -- which represent the president's  constitutional duty -- to be carried out by him now," Aleksandr  Yakovlev, the president's representative in parliament, stated.    As is noted in the president's message, laws establishing  clear rules pertaining to the functioning of state organs and,  above all, the organs of executive power should be drafted and  adopted in the very near future. They should provide effective  mechanisms of control and accountability which make it possible  to adopt legal acts which can actually be carried out, that is  to say, do not allow arbitrary interpretation, and which are  economically sound and include specific sanctions for their  nonfulfillment. These include laws on the government, on the  federal executive bodies, on normative legal acts, on the  federal state service, on the bases of the organization of  government and executive bodies in the components of the Russian  Federation, and on the status of deputies of the State Duma and  members of the Federation Council.    The Russian Federation president's Message "On Strengthening  the Russian State" raises the most topical problems. This was  stated by Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy of the State Duma and  minister of the economy.    The president's message as applied to the economy "should be  used to establish the normal mechanisms of market relations," he  stressed.    He emphasized that first and foremost "the state should  learn  how to collect all the taxes which now exist and establish  strict currency, financial, and banking control."    The Russian Federation president's message to parliament  contains answers to the questions which are being thrown up  today by the time and the actual situation, according to Vasiliy  Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for the  Affairs of the Federation and the Policy of the Regions. He  suggested that "deputies and voters received in the Message what  they expected to hear." The main point is that Boris Yeltsin's  program "is based on the firm conviction that the democratic  state's new Constitution should work." Each of his arguments is  backed up by specific articles of the Constitution, Vasiliy  Tarasenko explained.</p>

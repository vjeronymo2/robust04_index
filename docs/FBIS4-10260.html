			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" column: "New </F> Ministry, Old Problems"]    [Excerpts] Provisional Measure [MP] No. 434 is gone, and  No. 457 has come; and the new finance minister still faces the  same problems his predecessor had, as Congress still wants to  modify the MP so as to distort the economic plan. This matter  was the main subject of analysis during the first workday of  Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. In meeting with some of the  members of the congressional committee that will give an opinion  on MP 457, Minister Ricupero verified that obstacles still  exist, and with a further aggravating factor: After the exit of  Fernando Henrique Cardoso, political interests are still  hindering the approval of the economic plan.    Congress does not consider itself defeated by the executive  branch triumph in having MP 434 reedited. The electioneering  congressmen insist on introducing three modifications to the MP:  a recovery of salary losses, a minimum salary increase, and the  inclusion of a certain kind of price freeze. The only objective  of these changes is to make the economic plan not feasible.  [passage omitted]    The problem is that the new finance minister does not have  Cardoso's ability to convince the congressmen to approve the  economic plan. The fact that Cardoso is a candidate for  president of the Republic has increased the number of  congressmen interested in the failure of the economic plan.</p>

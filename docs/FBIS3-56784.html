Our participation in the search for reconciliation will be most  active, vigorous, and practical," ITAR-TASS was told by Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, who headed the Russian  delegation to the second round of Georgian-Abkhazian  negotiations, held in Geneva from January 11-13.    "The three-day intensive debates were rounded off by a joint  communique, outlining the priority measures to settle the  problem of refugees and to strengthen confidence and security.  One more important step was made towards a full-scale  settlement of the conflict," the Russian representative said.  He believes that the mutually confirmed commitment of the sides  not to resort to force or to threats to use it was among the  main results of the meeting.    "Both sides are now even more aware that stable peace cannot  be ensured without international observers and peace-making  forces. The sides, involved in the conflict, have expressed  their common consent to see a Russian military contingent as  part of the peacekeeping force. Russia will discharge  peace-keeping functions if a corresponding decision is adopted  by the Security Council and the Russian leadership. The number  of the needed servicemen will be determined by the mandate  issued by the U.N. Security Council," Pastukhov stated.    "Agreement was reached that a team of experts would discuss  in Moscow the key problem of the settlement -- the future  political status of Abkhazia. As to the position of the United  Nations, Russia and CSCE, they urge the sides in the communique  to proceed from the need of ensuring Georgia's territorial  integrity and to fully guarantee the interests of the entire  multinational population of Abkhazia.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY ETHICS PANEL URGES LOBBYING CURBS  </P> <P> Top Los Angeles city officials, including all elected officials and department  heads, should be banned from City Hall lobbying for a year after leaving their  posts, a city ethics panel report said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The panel's report also called for greater restrictions on the lobbying  activities of former lower-level officials and fuller public disclosure of whom  lobbyists represent and the specific projects they are promoting.  </P> <P> "Allowing people to pass too readily between public and private employment . .  . presents opportunities for personal relationships to be exploited,  confidential information to be used inappropriately, and may encourage  self-serving individuals who are only looking to make contacts for future  employment to become part of the government," the report said.  </P> <P> The report is one of a series prepared by the staff of a commission that is  drafting a new ethics code for city government. The panel was formed by Mayor  Tom Bradley last April, the day after he won an unexpectedly narrow election to  a fifth term amid a growing controversy over possible conflicts of interest in  his personal business dealings.  </P> <P> The panel's work has become part of broader reevaluation of City Hall ethics  regulations and enforcement triggered by the current city attorney's probe of  Bradley, particularly fees he accepted from two financial institutions that had  dealings with the city.  </P> <P> Several City Council members have proposed reform packages of their own and the  council's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee, chaired by Councilman Michael Woo, is  expected to recommend its own reforms in the months ahead.  </P> <P> The city's current ethics code has been widely criticized for being vague and  toothless.  </P> <P> Susan Estrich, a Harvard University law professor and former campaign manager  for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, told the Los Angeles  Ethics Commission Wednesday that City Hall's current lobbyist regulations  "leave too many areas for conflicting loyalties." Estrich is serving as unpaid  special counsel to the mayor's commission and helped write the latest report.  </P> <P> The report called for:  </P> <P> * A one-year "cooling-off" period in which the mayor, City Council members,  department heads and salaried members of the Public Works Commission could  engage in no lobbying -- or advising clients -- with any branch of city  government. Currently, those officials may return to City Hall to lobby  immediately after leaving office.  </P> <P> * Restricting other commissioners and city employees from lobbying the  departments they worked for for at least one year. Currently, such officials  are restricted only from lobbying on specific matters in which they were  personally involved.  </P> <P> * More detailed disclosure by lobbyists, particularly by lawyers, of the  clients they represent, the contracts or projects they are working on and the  fees they collect. Currently, lawyers often list their law firms as the party  they represent.  </P> <P> Former city Planning Commission President Dan Garcia, now a successful lobbyist  for developers, took exception to some of the recommendations. Garcia told the  panel that the regulations do not recognize the significant political clout  that organized homeowners, who also have a vested interest in developments, can  wield.  </P> <P> He also argued that it would be "unconscionable" to force him to report all of  the fees he collects from clients with city business.  </P> <P> "Most of what I do is not lobbying," he said, describing meetings with  architects and reviews of city ordinances. "It makes it appear I'm being paid  thousands and thousands of dollars."  </P> <P> But another prominent lobbyist, Maureen Kindell, Bradley's former Public Works  Commission chairman, told the panel that she generally supported the proposals  and believed that they clarify the ground rules.  </P> <P> Woo, who also testified, endorsed most of the proposals, some of which he has  proposed himself. But he said lobbyists should not have to disclose their fees,  which he said are merely an object of curiosity.  </P></p>

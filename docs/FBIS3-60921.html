			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina yesterday  accused Muslim separatists of planting a landmine on a railway  line in retaliation for govemment "accusations" that they had  torched southern schools last year.    Den said he had received reports that two separatist groups  -- the Pattani United Liberation Organization (Pulo) and the  Barisan Revolusi Nationale (BRN) -- had earlier met and planned  the abortive bomb attack.    The landmine, a 4 x 15-inch pipe containing dynamite, was  found and defused at about 10 p.m. on Saturday by army officers.  It had been placed on the railway track about 500 metres from  Joh-airong station in Narathiwat.    "The two groups had planned to carry out sabotage over the  New Year holidays to take revenge for authorities' allegations  that they had torched southern schools," Den said "We later  found the bomb on the railway tracks, prompting me to believe  the reports."    Den and his New Aspiration Party have several times disputed  reports by police and the southern army that Muslim separatists  were responsible for the arson attacks against 35 schools in the  Muslim-dominated deep South last August.    Den's elder brother had been alleged to be former leader of  a  Muslim separatist group. New Aspiration is known to want to  expand its political base in the southernmost provinces.    A few suspected arsonists have been arrested over the school  attacks but deny the charges. They have yet to be prosecuted.    Den once said the suspected arsonists were scapegoats.    Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-Araya  said he had instructed the administrative centre for the four  southern border provinces to be more alert for possible acts of  terrorism.    Ari said the separatists had to stop their terrorism because  their fellow Muslims could be affected.    Also yesterday, 4th Army Region Commander Lt Gen Kitti  Rattanachaya said the situation in the deep South was under  control because soldiers had intensified their crackdown on the  separatists.    "There should be nothing to worry about," Kitti told  reporters in Bangkok.    "Soldiers and police can handle (the situation) and we are  launching operations to root out the separatists."    He said the intensified crackdown was working because more  separatists had been pressured into surrendering.    The southern army chief said there were very few people  still  supporting or sympathizing with the Muslim terrorists.</p>

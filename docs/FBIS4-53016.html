			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The members of a  delegation of the Turkish Association for friendship with the  People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were  interviewed during their stay here. They said though threat and  pressure of outside forces against the DPRK have been  intensified, the Korean people have registered tremendous  achievements in socialist construction.    Member of parliament Ali Ibrahim Tutu said after visiting  the  construction site of the Rungna suspension bridge:    "I was deeply impressed by the sight of soldiers engaged in  peaceful construction with safety helmets and welders, not  military helmets and rifles. Though the mass media of the West  are alleging that Korea is making war preparations on an  extensive scale, they can never cover up the truth."    He said he was deeply moved by the strong spirit of the  Korean people, who were doing their business with courage and  composure even in a serious confrontation with the imperialists.    Mayor Gurbuz Capan of Esenyurt City, Istanbul, said after  visiting the Mangyongdae school children's palace that he could  see the happiness and the bright future of the Korean people  through the beaming faces of children.    Noting that the Korean people without worries about food and  clothing are granted excellent benefits and conditions by the  state in educating and bringing up children, he stressed that  Korea is an earthly paradise, a country of the people.    Female lawyer Senal Sarihan said Korea that has successfully  built socialism is the ideological support to her.    Pointing out that Korea is a model for the world people  aspiring after a new life, she stressed that the press circles  of the West captive to prejudice must regain reason and  properly look at and represent the reality.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed and Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Excerpt] Wide-ranging security measures have been taken  around the country for fear of retaliatory terrorist attacks in  the wake of the Hebron massacre.    IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources warned the secretariats  of settlements belonging to the Mate Binyamin Regional Council  [between Jerusalem and Ramallah] of terrorist plans to  perpetrate a spectacular attack against one or more of the  settlements there. A very high state of alert was declared in  the Mate Binyamin settlements, and the IDF has dramatically  beefed up its forces in the region.    A particularly sharp pamphlet published yesterday by the  Palestinian command in the territories, which includes PLO  representatives, said: "The Zionist enemy must be aware that no  crime goes unavenged. Those who spill the blood of our people  will not go unscathed. We will set the ground under the feet of  the Nazi occupiers on fire."    The Palestinian leadership in the territories has renewed  the  activities of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah,  in cooperation with Fatah, and called for the resumption of  intifadah activities, including violence against IDF forces and  settlers, in order to cause as many casualties and as much  damage to property as possible. As will be recalled, the  command was disbanded after the signing of the Washington  agreement in September, but it was reestablished on Sunday.    Sources in the territories noted that the command was  reestablished with the cooperation of Fatah representatives and  that its demands are a signal to 'Arafat that conducting  negotiations does not mean control on the ground. The sources  said that as a result of the erosion in 'Arafat's status, he has  no choice but to radicalize his positions and to accept the  demands of the leadership in the territories.

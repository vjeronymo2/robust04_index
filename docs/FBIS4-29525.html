			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The government will hold  ministerial meetings to take prompt and appropriate steps toward  South-North economic cooperation, which is expected to expand  rapidly with the prospective summit between the two Koreas'  presidents.    Relevant authorities said Monday the government would  probably start consultations among related ministries this week  to accelerate internal economic exchanges that have ground to a  standstill because of the row over North Korea's nuclear program.    A government official said the first stage of meetings would  involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the Economic  Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and Energy  Ministry, but more detailed consultations would come after the  summit and an ensuing premier-level meeting.    "After the summit and premiers' meeting," he said, "the NUB  will map out the overall framework for the political, social,  economic and cultural fields and then the issue of internal  economic cooperation will be discussed intensively."    Southern business circles, which have been skeptical about  internal cooperation because of the nuclear wrangling, will soon  resume their investment programs for North Korea as well as  indirect and processing-on-commission trade.    If the presidential summit is realized and obstacles to  South-North economic cooperation are removed, the private sector  in particular is expected to accelerate direct internal trade,  joint investment and visits to North Korea by businessmen and  technicians.    Detailed projects in North Korea that have been planned by  South Korean business circles include an advance into the  industrial zones of Rajin and Sonbong, construction of the Nampo  industrial complex, and investment in the Kimchaek iron and  steel factory.    Earlier the government disclosed a three-stage economic  cooperation program, with the first phase pushing such  demonstrative projects as construction of the Nampo industrial  complex. The second stage was designed to activate exchanges in  the mineral, agricultural, fisheries and communications sectors.  The third stage was intended to organize a South-North Korean  economic community on the basis of the previous stages.    If the South-North meetings can agree on mutual opening of  economic offices, the government is expected to expedite  institutional means of expanding internal economic cooperation  such as protection of industrial property rights, an investment  guarantee accord, a dual-taxation prevention agreement and  establishment of open accounts to settle trade balances.    In addition, talks on opening more direct sea routes are  likely to support such economic cooperation. Last April, a  direct sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin was formally opened  and Inchon and Nampo ports were utilized as a virtually direct  sea route between the two Koreas. At the same time, other  direct routes linking Sokcho and Chongjin, and Pusan and Rajin  are likely to be opened formally.    In the meantime, the government is expected to resume  preparations for restoring rail lines that have been cut off  since the 1950-53 Korean war. The railways under study include  lines linking Seoul-Uiju and Seoul-Wonju.    With the expansion of mutual exchanges, opening of air  routes  between Kimpo and Sunan will become a vital project.</p>

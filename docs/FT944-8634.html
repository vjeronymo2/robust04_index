			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (6): Commercial life returns - A guide to Riga for the business visitor Riga has changed greatly in the 1990s. Its beauty had been hidden and decayed; it was comfortless for the traveller; and the points of contact were grimly official. Independence has not yet brought it wealth, but it has begun to open the city up as local and foreign entrepreneurs revive its commerce and cafe life. The city is fuller with restaurants, bistros and cafes than any other in the former Soviet Union. The old town streets are now bright with newly-opened shops and eating places. Its culinary traditions were damaged by the Soviet period but have not disappeared. If there is nothing of the first rank, there are, nevertheless, places to eat which are pleasant and generally quiet. Hotels are reasonable and courteous. The two big Soviet era hotels - the Riga and the Latvia - have been substantially remodelled and offer basic business services. For luxury, there is the Hotel de Rome, just on the old town's borders. The city has retained orchestras, an opera house (currently under repair) a musical theatre and many cinemas, which mainly show US films. It has some 20 museums including a splendid motor vehicle exhibition which includes one of Leonid Brezhnev's many cars. The Riga Circus is one of the oldest permanent shows in the world and has very funny clowns and great trapeze and balancing acts. The animal acts are indifferent. All the main countries have embassies in Riga and all appear anxious to assist the visitor who wants to do business. In addition, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and USAid all have active offices and programmes. The European Union's Phare programme is particularly active. The Latvian Development Agency is the government institution created to assist the business visitor. It publishes a Latvian Business Guide, an Export Directory and a monthly newsletter called Business with Latvia. It is a good place to start. It will soon have new offices, but its present numbers are (3712) 288842 phone and (3712) 282524 fax, and its enquiries manager is Ms Maira Vesmane. The government has created a department for working with foreign donor organisations, headed by an energetic young minister, Ms Indra Samite. She has developed a National Indicative Plan, which seeks to order ministries and departments' priorities and to make them communicate their needs to the donors. Initial assistance was often misdirected and even harmful - especially grain credits, which were given to prevent a supposed famine which was never remotely likely. This must now be repaid. Latvians are used to speaking other peoples' languages: nearly all speak fluent Russian, and many speak some German or English. French and Spanish are less known. Interpreters are available through hotels. The airport, until recently a wreck, has been partly modernised and is adequate. Latvian Air operates a range of services; SAS, Lufthansa, Finnair and CSA each have several flights weekly; Aeroflot is less evident, but still runs flights to and from Moscow, as does the new Russian airline Transaero (which has a Riga-London flight). Taxis usually run on a meter but some do not, and tend to overcharge. The main religion is Lutheran, followed by Russian Orthodox. There is a large colony of Old Believers. The Roman Catholic community is large enough for the Pope to have made a visit. There is an Anglican Church, and a synagogue in the old town attests to what had been a large Jewish community, while a vast memorial at the concentration camp outside Riga and the mass graves in the forests show what happened to a large part of that community - and to thousands of Latvians, Russians and others.</p>

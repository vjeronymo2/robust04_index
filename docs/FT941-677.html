			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Observer: Feathered friend Good news for Rotherham's Liberal Democrats, now gearing up for a by-election; they are guaranteed acres of media coverage. The bad news is - they may not appreciate all the fuss. Their choice of candidate is David Wildgoose. We haven't seen his manifesto yet but any references to 'chase', 'ducking issues', 'flat-footed opponents' and the like should be winged immediately and sent for roasting at No 1 Southwark Bridge.</p>

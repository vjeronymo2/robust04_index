			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Miners hope to create 900 jobs in recycling joint venture THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers has joined forces with Vista Partnership, a private consortium, in a venture aiming to create up to 900 jobs for former miners in environmental projects. The two announced yesterday that they had formed a company, Vista-UDM, which will build domestic waste recycling and disposal facilities on the sites of abandoned pits - initially those of Cotgrave and Silverhill in Nottinghamshire. The schemes involve the creation of a plant to convert unsorted waste into an absorbent aggregate used in industry, construction and land reclamation, as well as a car recycling business in collaboration with BMW, the German carmaker. The company estimates it will produce annual net exports worth about Pounds 50m. Formal negotiations on the projects are scheduled to begin with British Coal on May 13. Informal talks have already been held with Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, which the UDM said had been 'extremely positive'. The union expects to secure grants from the government and the European Community to establish the business. Meanwhile, it emerged that more than 13,000 miners have left British Coal since October, 2,600 of them in the past week. The latest voluntary redundancies leave British Coal with less than 25,000 blue-collar employees. British Coal has already achieved more than half the 25,000 manual job cuts it sought through mine closures last October in spite of the scaling-back of the mine- closure programme from 31 to 19 pits. The redundancies are being taken on a voluntary basis and represent a setback for unions which are still fighting closures. Disputes over British Coal's closure consultation procedures are expected to return to the High Court in the next few weeks. This, however, is unlikely to save any of the pits. Miners at some collieries, including Shirebrook, Rossington, Houghton Main, Markham Main and Easington have already voted to accept local deals on improved redundancies. British Coal says this signifies approval for closure. Under the local deals, negotiated in the past few weeks, some miners will gain up to Pounds 8,000 more than under the national deal. This is lifting the average payment to above the previous Pounds 26,000.</p>

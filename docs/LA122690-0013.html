			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE NEED A POLICY, NOT A FIRE  </P> <P> With disturbing regularity, novels and textbooks are yanked from school  classrooms across the nation, because someone somewhere finds them  objectionable. Yet a recent survey found that nearly one-quarter of the school  districts in California have no formal policies to deal with such objections.  </P> <P> Attacks upon great literature for young adults and children are nothing new --  from "Catcher in the Rye" to "Little Red Riding Hood." The advocacy group  People for the American Way documented 244 book challenges in the 1989-90  school year, and California accounted for almost one-third of those.  Unfortunately, it's such fertile ground for controversy that each school  district in the state now needs to have a clear and well-defined policy of how  to handle, (and fend off most) objections to school reading materials.  </P> <P> A nonchalant attitude about preserving precious freedoms too often creates an  atmosphere that encourages censorship. The most pressing danger is that school  officials will simply remove a book from a library or a class curriculum rather  than debate its merits.  </P> <P> The lack of formal policies likely results in "preemptive" censorship, said  Louise Adler, an education professor at Cal State Fullerton who conducted the  recent survey. "It means that either a district will not give someone a fair  hearing, or someone will just remove a text without really considering what  should be done," she said.  </P> <P> An example of such a "preemptive strike" was cited in People for the American  Way's annual censorship report. A school official in La Puente requested that  Edgar Allan Poe's "The Black Cat" be removed from a ninth-grade classroom,  because the official was afraid that someone would object to a picture of a  hanging cat that accompanied the famous short story. So in a move to avoid  controversy, the book was removed.  </P> <P> Such a chilling incident is all the more reason why every school district  should have clear procedures for logging objections to school reading  materials. That way, protesters can be heard -- but their angry voices alone  will not be enough to cower supporters of the intellectual freedom on which  this nation was built.  </P></p>

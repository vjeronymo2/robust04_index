			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With regard to the Japan-U.S. summit talks  scheduled in Washington in February, U.S. Under Secretary of  State Wirth stated on 11 Janaury that "the summit talks would be  held on both 11 and 12 February," and that "the talks would  probably be also held in the late hours of 10 February."  According to the accord reached last July, the summit talks  would be held on 11 February only. A Japanese Foreign Ministry  source has stated that "no proposal has been made for extending  the schedule for the talks." However, it is observed that due  to the rough going at the Japan-U.S. new economic consultations,  the U.S. Government has strengthened its position of "arranging  sufficient time for the summit talks so as to bring the  consultations to a conclusion."    At the news conference held on 11 January, Under Secretary  Wirth stated: "Our most urgent objective is arranging the  Clinton-Hosokawa talks on 11 and 12 February so that they may  discuss the economic consultations currently under way between  Japan and the United States. We hope that the results of these  consultations will be announced on these two days. (Depending  on the political itinerary of the Japanese side,) the summit  talks may even start in the late hours of 10 February."    It is observed that the U.S. side intends to extend the  summit talks, which were orignally scheduled for only one day,  to over two days so that the summit talks themselves -- rather  than prior talks at the vice ministerial level as originally  scheduled -- would become the final stage for consultations.</p>

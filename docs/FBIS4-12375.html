			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Failure of the Meeting of </F> the Two 'Ali's Increases War Possibilities"]    [Text] London -- Pessimism prevails in both Sanaa and Aden  about the chances of an early settlement of the Yemeni crisis.  Political observers expect a divisive war between the armed  forces of the north and the south this month because the talks  held the day before yesterday in Salalah in the Sultanate of  Oman failed to resolve the differences between the General  People's Congress [GPC], led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  and its ally the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] on the one hand  and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], of which Vice President  'Ali Salim al-Bid is secretary general, on the other.    The YSP, however, has made a point of underscoring the  importance of the Omani role and the continuation of efforts to  find a solution to the Yemeni problem. A YSP official source  has denied that al-Bid played down "the positive and effective  role played by Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id." The source reaffirmed  the importance "of the mediation of the brothers in Oman to  preserve Yemen's unity."    News agencies quoted one of the delegation members  accompanying al-Bid as saying that "the mediation of Sultan  Qabus brought nothing new and the Yemeni crisis is still  continuing." He expressed appreciation for the Omani role, of  which all Yemenis are proud.    Yemeni political sources attribute the failure of the  meeting  to the "lack of adequate preparation for it" because the Omani  leadership simply seized the opportunity of President Salih's  visit to Oman and asked al-Bid to stop over on his way back from  the United Arab Emirates [UAE] at the end of his visit to  Abu-Dhabi. Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf  Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah said that the meeting succeeded in  achieving some relaxation at the personal level between Salih  and al-Bid but that this remains to be translated into a  relaxation between the ruling coalition parties in Yemen.    The Omani minister said that the efforts were focused on  preventing any military confrontations or civil war in Yemen.  Yemeni sources, however, say that the meeting confirmed the  conviction of both sides that "any move by one side toward the  other to ease the crisis would be futile" and that military  confrontation cannot be avoided.    The sources said that the Joint Military Committee has begun  to terminate its task of separating the northern and southern  armed forces and that the Jordanian and Omani officers are  currently considering returning home, having themselves failed  to accomplish their mission. They confirmed that the two  parties to the conflict, namely the YSP and the GPC, imported  $200 million worth of arms and ammunition between them during  the month of March. The sources also said that the Yemeni  president left the Salalah meeting angry and threatened to use  force.    The two parties to the conflict are now trading accusations  about the failure of the Oman meeting. YSP sources say that the  cause of the failure was the intransigence of President Salih  and his aids and also of their ally in the ruling coalition  (meaning the YRG, led by House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh  'Abdallah al-Ahmar), whereas GPC and YRG sources say that the  failure to resolve the crisis was a result of disagreement  within the YSP itself, preventing the party from taking specific  stands.    Although YSP sources deny such a disagreement, it seems that  meetings such as the ones held in Amman and Salalah have  minimized the chances of using the Jordanian and Omani cards  again to settle the crisis. That only leaves the Egyptian card  with Syrian participation and Gulf support.    It is hoped that this card will be used very carefully  through submission of specific plans for the settlement of the  crisis acceptable to all Yemeni parties within the framework of  the state of unity, even if that means applying the federal  system. The Yemeni president and Shaykh al-Ahmar still oppose  such a system but may find no alternative to it in the end.</p>

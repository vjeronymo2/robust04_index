			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Major rules out Emu in vision of wider EC MR JOHN MAJOR today sets out a vision of a wider, free trading European Community in which power is shifted back to national capitals and monetary union is put into abeyance. In an article published in The Economist magazine, the prime minister rules out a British return to the exchange rate mechanism in the strongest terms yet, and warns EC member states that the struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty has fundamentally changed the EC. Officials confirmed that the UK government was drawing up plans for a more flexible alternative to the ERM. The proposal is expected to concentrate on inflation targets and might be open to countries outside the EC. Mr Major's comments represent a British attempt to pre-empt further discussion of economic and monetary union at the special EC summit planned for next month. His remarks are also intended to reassure Conservative Euro-sceptics that the government shares their desire to reduce the influence of the EC over national parliaments. The prime minister's advisers hope that the tone of the article will help to marginalise the handful of hard-right backbench MPs who have threatened to force a divisive leadership election in the autumn. Officials said Mr Major's main aim was to encourage the summit to concentrate on achieving a workable Gatt agreement, rather than seeking to reopen the debate on monetary union. Mr Major says there can be 'no question of Britain going back into the ERM in the foreseeable future'. He says 'economic and monetary union is not realisable in present circumstances, and therefore not relevant to our economic difficulties'. He adds: 'I am not prepared to sit down in Brussels in a few weeks' time and pretend that Humpty Dumpty is whole and well. I care too much about the European Community to pursue Sellotape policies - patching together the unmendable - or to play the politics of illusion - pretending it was never broken.'</p>

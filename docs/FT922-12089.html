			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: IBM and Thomson-CSF unveil technology accord INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the US computer giant, and Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, yesterday announced a technology and marketing accord for a new generation of chips. They have reached agreement in principle for Thomson-CSF to be licensed to make a new chip being developed by IBM and Motorola, the US electronics group. Thomson-CSF will then customise the chip, known as a Power PC microprocessor, for its own products: high-speed computers, working in real time, for space, military and industrial use. The Power PC is being developed with Motorola, the US electronics group, as part of the partnership between IBM and Apple, the personal computer maker, announced last summer. The new chip, to be used in IBM and Apple's future personal computers and workstations, is based on IBM's reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology, which enables computers to execute instructions faster. The Thomson-CSF deal helps IBM to enlarge the potential market for computers using Power PCs, against rivals such as Hewlett Packard and Digital Equipment, which had also been courting the French company for a technology accord. IBM will market versions of Power PC developed by Thomson-CSF for real-time computing, a sector where IBM is absent, and which is used for a range of professional applications from software engineering to guiding missiles. Cetia, Thomson-CSF's real-time computing unit, will also market some IBM workstations and use them for its own applications. Cetia said it expected to launch the first prototypes of workstations using Power PCs by the end of the year, for sale up to six months later. The chips themselves will be made by another subsidiary, Thomson Composants Militaires et Spatiaux. Thomson-CSF approached IBM last July, as soon as it licensed Motorola to build the Power PC, said officials of the French group. The French group has been Motorola's biggest European components customer for the past 10 years and was therefore keen to cement links with its supplier after Motorola's accord with IBM. This is the latest example of IBM's eagerness to form partnerships and its most recent link-up with French state-owned industry. The US computer group formed a far wider ranging accord at the end of January with Bull, which also gets access to Risc technology. IBM is also negotiating to take a minority stake in the computer-aided design unit of Dassault, the partly government-owned aircraft group.</p>

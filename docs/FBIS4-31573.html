			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party and prime minister-designate, in the ORF studio  in Innsbruck by Robert Hochner in the ORF studio in Vienna; date  not given -- recorded; Horn speaks in Hungarian with  superimposed translation into German]    [Text] [Hochner] You had a car accident prior to the  elections and are wearing a support cast. How can one make  politics with such a straitjacket around one's head?    [Horn] To formulate what you said more precisely, let me say  that I had the accident at the end of the election campaign, but  it did not affect our election opportunities, and I am  continuing my work with undiminished intensity. We are very  busy and are now continuing our coalition talks with the Free  Democrats.    [Hochner] For a Western European party it would be unusual  to win the absolute majority and then insist on a coalition  partner. Do you want a coalition partner because you do not want  to bear responsibility alone for the possibly tough economic  measures that Hungary may have to face?    [Horn] Perhaps this plays a certain role, but what is most  important is the fact that Hungary needs a broad national basis  and national consensus. We must put an end to the past practice  of political parties attacking one another, instead of assuming  joint responsibility for the country's difficult situation. We  are convinced that we should form a coalition with the Free  Democrats, and we hope that such a coalition will come about.  This may mean that an entirely new relationship between the  parties will develop. In 1989, the Hungarian Socialists and Free  Democrats were virtually enemies, and now we have a chance to  form a coalition. This is very important, has a symbolic  significance, requires essential political activities, and may  be a signal for other Central Eastern European countries.    [Hochner] Are you planning to pursue a radically Western  economic policy, as has been represented by Czech Prime Minister  Klaus and was practiced in Poland for a long time, or will you  try to pursue a central course to keep the sacrifices of the  people, above all the lower social classes, within bounds?    [Horn] Look, there are no worn-out roads, neither for the  Czech Republic, nor for Hungary, nor for any other country.  Here in Austria, the system developed over the centuries,  whereas we must tear down the former system within a very short  time. This is an unprecedented effort. Privatization in  Central Eastern Europe is unprecedented in world history. We  will, of course, follow the Western example.    We would like to reach the status reached by Austria or the  other Western European countries. However, we will pursue  specific policies, and in so doing, we must consider the  people's capacity for tolerance. We must not allow the  transformation and democratic development to take place in such  a way that the people's living standard continuously  deteriorates. A line must be drawn somewhere, and I think the  program of the Socialists, which can be coordinated relatively  easily with the program of the Free Democrats, promises this,  and most voters believe in our program.    [Hochner] Your party is the successor party to the Hungarian  Communists; it reconstituted itself. Aren't there in your party  also representatives of the trade union wing, for instance, who  would rather opt for a concept from the past and would perhaps  prefer to return to the planned economy?    [Horn] I do not know any politician in Hungary who was born  after the spring of 1990. Somehow every politician was involved  with the former system, including the opposition and the trade  unions. But the trade union leaders, the whole trade union  movement, underwent a transformation, and trade unions in  Hungary today, including the large trade union federation with  which we have an alliance, correspond to their Western European  counterparts.    The influence of the trade unions was represented only in a  small segment of parliament. I do not think a government can be  successful without having concluded a social partnership, a  partnership with the representatives of employers and employees.  If such a consensus does not come about on all problems of  social policy, Hungary will face many social explosions. It is  an existential problem for us to achieve consensus not only with  trade unions but also with employers.    [Hochner] In Austria, there is currently much talk about its  possible EU [European Union] membership. In your view, when  will Hungary be a member of the EU -- irrespective of the  outcome of the referendum here?    [Horn] First of all, I would like to say that I envy the  Austrians. I envy them for several reasons, but above all  because they can already vote this Sunday [12 June] on whether  or not they want to become EU members. I wish Hungary were in  this situation. I am convinced that Europe is facing specific  challenges, and Europe is advancing on the road to integration,  and those who stay outside and do not take part will be  disadvantaged. As for Hungary, I am convinced that, if these  four countries become EU members in 1995, we may realistically  assume that we can start talks with Brussels on membership of  the Central Eastern European countries, the so-called Visegrad  states, early in 1997. Regrettably, we cannot expect membership  before the end of this century, or this millennium. I would  like to accelerate it, and if we could exchange some Austrian  problems for our problems, we would readily take over your  problems in exchange for our problems. But what is important is  that we are both heading for a united Europe.</p>

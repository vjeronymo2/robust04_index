One of its indicators is resistance to fungi, which  can be examined in direct relationship to properties of a  material and their changes under the effect of various factors,  including extreme ones (Astafyev, 1966; Flerov, 1972;  Gerasimenko, 1984; Lugauskas et al., 1987). There are virtually  no data on fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of  microassemblies used extensively in electronics (Blagnik,  Zanova, 1965; Andreyuk et al., 1980; Gerasimenko, 1984;  Kanevskaya, 1984; Zaikina, Yelinov, 1985; Koval, Sidorenko,  1989). Yet the structure of assembly materials and data on low  fungus resistance of some of them warrant the assumption that  microassemblies are vulnerable to fungi, particularly when used  in regions with high humidity, as well as in tropical and  subtropical climates.    This article deals with a discussion of the results of  studying fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of  microassemblies under model conditions.    We tested fungus resistance of microassemblies consisting of  thick-film elements based on various pastes -- resistance,  condenser, conductor, dielectric insulation and condenser, as  well as thin-film elements based on resistance and dielectric  alloys listed in the table.

Viability of conidia: applied conidia showing no  growth on specimens. Condensate rating: 1) few large drops that fall off readily; 2) numerous  medium-sized drops, almost stationary; 3) small drops over the entire specimen, stationary.      The tests for fungus resistance were carried out in  accordance with GOST 9.048...9.053-75 (with 1986 supplements).  We used fungus strains isolated from specimens of analogous  composition that had undergone field tests in different climate  zones. Isolation, identification, determination of lag phase and  viability of conidia of tested fungi were carried out by  conventional techniques (``Methods of Experimental  Mycology...'', 1982). The tests were repeated 3-5 times. The  findings were submitted to statistical processing. We assessed  reliability of difference between experimental variants  according to Student's criterion at 95 percent level of  significance.    It was impossible to assess unequivocally the fungus  resistance of the tested thin- and thick-film elements of  microassemblies in all test variants; it differed and depended  on a number of factors.    The principle of establishing the extent of growth of fungus  colonies and giving it a score on the 30th day of the experiment  served as the basis for determination of resistance of the  materials to fungi (GOST 9.048...9.053-75). There is no special  GOST [State standard] for microassemblies; however, the  distinctions of fungal growth on them enable us to discuss the  need to create one.    Microassemblies are a combined substrate consisting of  variable ceramic or polymer materials in the form of an  underlayer on which there are metal parts. The two elements of  this substrate are not quite equal in accessibility to fungi due  to the physicochemical properties of their surface. Evidently,  this is what caused the differences in growth processes of  micromycetes that were noted on the microassemblies.    Microassemblies are a specific substrate that does not  contain the basic agents of mycodestruction essential to vital  functions: carbon, nitrogen and available water. In this  respect, metabolic processes of mycodestructive agents have not  been sufficiently studied, which makes it difficult to analyze  and assess their growth, and also delays development of  protective measures. While in bacteria such substrates are  interpreted as ``nongrowth'' elements and a detailed explanation  of the possibility of functioning of different species on them  is available, for fungi a classification of substrates according  to this criterion has not been developed (Okorokov et al., 1974;  Malashenko et all., 1982).    Investigation of the metabolism of mycodestructors requires  new, modern approaches that permit deeper examination and  explanation of the functional capacity of the fungal cell on  substrates of anthropogenic origin that contain no organic  matter but permit normal metabolism of heterotrophs (Forster,  1950; ``The Life of Microbes....,'' 1981). This has become  particularly urgent at the present time, when basically new data  are appearing to explain the specific metabolism of  mycodestructors similarly to what has been established for  bacteria (Cascelton, 1976; Zonneveld, 1988). For the time being,  however, it is not deemed possible to explain the growth of  mycodestructors on microassemblies, and we must limit ourselves  merely to stating the facts on fungus resistance.    In assessing fungus resistance of the tested  microassemblies,  we observed differences in fungal growth as a function of the  structure of their components. Three types of mycodestruction  can be distinguished: 1) both the underlayer and elements are  sensitive to fungi, 2) only the underlayer is sensitive to  fungi, 3) only elements are sensitive to fungi. Most  fungus-sensitive microassemblies are characterized by fungal  damage to both components. Fungus growth was observed only on  the underlayer in elements based on dielectric material DO  14-30. In resistors based on polymer paste 0650, only the paste  was subject to mycodestruction.    Of all the fungal cultures used to infect microassembly  specimens, the following formed a film and sporulated normally:  Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, Paecilomyces  variotii, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. funiculosum, Trichoderma  viride. Damage caused by only one fungal species was noted  in 11 out of the 23 tested specimens, and incidence of fungi  varied: Aspergillus terreus and Paecilomyces  variotii developed only on one specimen; Aspergillus  flavus on three, and A. niger on five. Combined  damage by two fungal species was observed in five specimens, and  by three species on one, but we were unable to detect any stable  link in formation of these complexes. The most eurybiontic  species also prevailed: A. flavus and A.  niger. Multicomponent colonies did not differ either  structurally or in sporulation time. Usually, A.  flavus was the main background in the film, whereas  A. niger was arranged in islets in its center. An  analogous film structure was noted in variants with complexes of  A. flavus + Paecilomyces variotii, A. flavus + Penicillium  funiculosum, A. niger + Trichoderma viride. It is only in  the variant of formation of a two-component film by the A.  terreus + Penicillium funiculosum complex that their  colonies were distinctly circumscribed with lumina of 1-2 mm  between them, which did not disappear with age. This finding can  be interpreted as a manifestation of antagonism on a certain  level, which is known for many mycodestructors (Andreyuk et al.,  1980). It is much more difficult to interpret the vulnerability  of microassemblies to 1-2 fungal species, since joint presence  of a rather considerable number of species, between which  syntrophic interactions are established, is more often observed  when fungi grow on inaccessible substrates (Blagnik, Zanova,  1965; Koval, Sidorenko, 1989).    We were unable to establish any pattern whatsoever or to  explain the selectivity of fungi in relation to the  corresponding series of tested specimens. In spite of the fact  that assessment fungal growth in terms of rating the underlayer  and microassembly did not always coincide, they were stricken by  the same species of fungi. However, it must be noted that the  underlayer played the leading role in manifestation of fungal  growth in all variants of the experiment. Even in those cases  where assessment of fungal growth in points almost coincided for  both microassembly components as, for example, specimens of  resistance ruthenium pastes 4413, 4451, 4461, conductor 3701,  dielectric insulation 8031 and dielectric condenser 8021, the  difference between underlayer and elements with respect to time  of colony formation and conidial viability was distinctly  demonstrable. The lag phase was shorter for all tested fungal  species on the underlayer, whereas maximum growth rating was  observed at earlier stages.    A correlation between fungal growth rating and nature of  condensate was observed in all specimens. This can be explained  if we compare the hydrophobic properties of the underlayers  used. In this instance, the textolite underlayer was highly  hydrophobic. This was confirmed when we carried out tests  following a somewhat altered protocol, as compared to GOST,  according to which the tested microassembly specimens were kept  in a desiccator for 24 h at 98-100 percent humidity and  temperature of 15-18, following by heating at 26-28C.  In all specimens, the condensate differed in droplet size,  quantity and mobility: 1) a small number of large drops, over  1-1.5 mm in diameter, that rolled off readily; 2) numerous  droplets 0.5-1 mm in diameter, virtually stationary; 3) numerous  drops 0.1-0.3 mm in diameter, stationary. The nature of  condensate distribution on the specimens was analogous to the  nature of drop formation when the specimens were innoculated  with conidial suspension. Since moisture is the main factor  affecting fungal function, in this instance too it was easy to  track the relationship of fungus resistance to formation of  condensate and hydrophoby of the microassembly surface. In the  case of high water repellence of the microassembly surface, the  drops of condensate or applied conidial suspension were notable  for larger size and high mobility, which prevents adhesion of  fungal conidia and, consequently, does not permit their further  growth. Fungus resistance of resistors based on polymer paste  0630 with a textolite underlayer indicates that use of  hydrophobic underlayers can be one of the methods of producing  microassemblies that are impervious to mycodestruction.    Distortion of working parameters of microassemblies was  observed not only with growth of conidia and formation of fungal  colonies, but also in the case of a considerable level of  contamination when the number of conidia exceeded  10[.sup]6[/]/mm[.sup]2[/]. This can be attributed to the  effect of metabolic products of conidia that are produced in  trace amounts even when conidia were in an anabiotic state  (``Biology of Conidial Fungi,'' 1981). The observed destructive  processes differed, depending on structure of the underlayer and  microcircuit, analogously to the experimental variants in which  colonies were formed. Evidently, evaluation of resistance of  microassemblies to fungi must be made with consideration of  several criteria characterizing the physicochemical properties  of the surface (hydrophoby, porosity, moisture condensation,  electric charge, etc.), and the assessment should be expressed  as a fraction, which would correspond to the fungus resistance  of the underlayer and fungus resistance of the microcircuit.    Since the methods used to determine fungus resistance of  microassemblies do not provide reliable estimate and do not  permit prediction of reliability of using them under diverse  ecological conditions, the need arises to develop new models  that conform better to naturally occurring contamination and  mycodestruction processes.

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Serbs have faith in their new saviour: Ebullient bank chief has brought inflation under control Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the Yugoslav National bank, crowed that his economic programme had virtually defeated sanctions, after he managed to reduce inflation from 300,000 to zero per cent overnight. At a recent dinner in Belgrade, Mr Avramovic said economic expansion was under way despite nearly two years of UN sanctions, which include an oil embargo. Across the table, Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of Yugoslavia, appealed for the lifting of the crippling sanctions, which he said, repeating a common official refrain, were 'unjust and genocidal'. The contradictory statements reveal the collision of two political roles. Mr Jovanovic tries to convince his foreign colleagues that peace cannot be won without lifting sanctions, while Mr Avramovic, who is believed to be in his late 70s, is responsible for boosting public confidence in the new Yugoslav dinar, which is pegged at one-to-one with the D-Mark, and the rebirth of the Serbian economy. In fact, people seem to believe in Mr Avramovic, Serbia's newest saviour. In Belgrade, people thank him because they no longer have to count out billions of dinars to buy a loaf of bread. Their monthly wage has risen from DM30 (Pounds 12) to DM100. Goods have returned to store shelves. Even though petrol costs DM3 a litre, there are more cars on the streets than at any time since sanctions, imposed on Belgrade for the violent partition of Bosnia. The 10m inhabitants of Yugoslavia have breathed a sigh of relief that they no longer have to race against hyperinflation. 'We have actually overcome the blockade. Yugoslavia can no longer be blackmailed with sanctions, the problem of sanctions and blockade is now secondary,' said the ebullient Mr Avramovic, a former employee of the World Bank, in a recent interview. But gloomy Belgrade economists and businessmen say the sanctions and the price of nearly three years of waging war have devastated the Yugoslav economy. They fear that economic recovery cannot be sustained without lifting sanctions and foreign loans. They trade predictions on when the programme will collapse. The ebullient Mr Avramovic says production was expected to grow by 30 per cent in April in relation to the month before. It grew by 24 per cent in March, according to official statistics. Mr Ivan Vujacic, an economist at Belgrade University, says: 'This is no miracle. After hyperinflation is stopped, it is always followed by a 10-15 per cent jump in production. We have not even reached that percentage.' He says the new dinar has enabled people to calculate their expenditures, but he fears that huge taxes will wipe out any small private enterprise. Further, economists worry that the inflation will soon reappear. Mr Milutin Mitrovic, editor of Ekonomska Politika, an independent economic magazine, points to hidden inflation. 'Businessmen have taken out credits but are unlikely to pay them back, which will mean a return of inflation.' 'The black market has disappeared because of the harsh penalties from three months to three years in prison for selling hard currency. But there is no real basis for ascertaining the value of the dinar,' he adds. Mr Avramovic laughs, saying his programme has left the black marketeers of hard currency out of work. He says the country's currency reserves have increased by DM450m since the progamme was implemented at the end of January. Most economists say the budget deficit of DM2.5bn represents an awesome obstacle to recovery. While Mr Avramovic has succeeded in stopping the printing presses of the national mint, so far he has not eliminated the enormous demands on the budget. For example, Serbia alone reportedly supports a 100,000-strong police force. Mr Avramovic claims to have discovered a new model for economic recovery, which he admits was in part due to luck public acceptance fo the new dinar. But economists have little confidence in the official statistics which try to put a gloss on the bleak prospects. They predict that by September, the programme will cave in, unable to meet all the demands - from the army to the farmers. Mr Mitrovic says: 'It will reach the point where the statistics cannot disguise the real situation.'</p>

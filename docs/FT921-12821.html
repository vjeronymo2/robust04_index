			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Labour's market see-saw - Shares did famously in 1968 and 1975 but, as Review readers hardly need to be told, past performance is no guide to the future LOVE HAS never really blossomed between the Labour party and the City, but the two eventually establish some kind of working relationship when Labour is in power. It cannot be said that stock markets have prospered greatly under Labour. Of the three post-war periods of Labour government, only one (1964-70) saw a real rise in equity prices, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. To be fair, the decline in share price performance during the 1974-79 Labour administration was almost entirely concentrated in its first year of office. That bear market was due more to the oil crisis and the mistakes made by the previous Heath administration. And Labour governments have also produced the all-time peak for equity prices in real terms (back in 1968) and the single best year for share prices in both real and nominal terms (1975). There is no certainty that this historical pattern will be repeated if Labour wins this year's general election. It could well be that Britain's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and a narrowing of policy differences between the parties, means that the effect of the choice of government on the stock market may be much reduced. On the other hand, the market perception is that a Labour government means higher inflation and the risk of devaluation. If that perception leads to a run on sterling, then Labour could be forced to raise interest rates - which would depress bond and equity prices. A clue to the short-term effect on prices might be found in the behaviour of the market before the 1983 and 1987 elections. On both occasions the markets rose sharply on expectations of a Thatcher victory, but did not do so well after victory was achieved. In 1983, equities went sideways for the rest of the year; in 1987, the market peaked one month after the election, and plunged later in the year. This is another example of the stock market's 'White Queen syndrome', named after the Lewis Carroll character who screamed in anticipation of pricking her finger, and then barely reacted to the actual event. The corollary might be that markets will fall before the election if Labour looks like winning, but might then stabilise if investors decide that a change of government is not the end of the world. But the effect of a Labour government is unlikely to be the same right across the economy. There will be winners and losers among the stock market sectors. Winners Engineering companies: Both County NatWest and Barclays de Zoete Wedd argue that the engineering industry would benefit from Labour's plans to reintroduce tax allowances for capital expenditure. Some companies in the aerospace industry, however, would be hit by likely cuts in defence expenditure. Pharmaceuticals: BZW says these companies, which are listed in the quaintly-named health &amp; household sector, should benefit from Labour's plans for tax breaks on research and development expenditure. Two defensive factors might also help pharmaceutical shares. Their strong cash positions will be a plus point if interest rates under Labour are pushed higher (because of the need to support sterling in the wake of foreign exchange market nervousness). And investors might also buy pharmaceutical stocks because of their exposure to overseas economies Losers Consumer companies: These may be affected in two ways. The first is by the minimum wage - wages form a very high proportion of the costs of sectors such as pubs and hotels. Many store groups might also be affected. The second hit could be suffered by those companies producing luxury goods. Demand for such products may face an adverse impact from the increased taxes on high earners. Contracting &amp; construction: Traditionally, this sector has been perceived as a beneficiary of a Labour government. But County Nat West argues that 60 per cent of it is exposed to private housebuilding, and that loss of activity in this high margin area would not be compensated for by increases in lower margin public construction projects. BZW, although believing Labour's effect on the sector will be neutral, points out that construction companies would be hit by plans for increased training expenditure and a minimum wage. Conglomerates: Dick Barfield, of Standard Life, believes tighter controls on corporate activity could damage sentiment towards acquisitive conglomerates such as Hanson. Utilities: Increased government involvement, through tougher legislation or a tighter regulatory stance, would have an adverse impact on the privatised utilities, thinks Mr Barfield. The water industry is an eventual candidate for re-nationalisation. Financial services: BZW argues that, if a Labour government leads to higher interest rates, this will have a negative impact on financial groups. The reversal of some of the Conservative savings reforms, such as the abolition of Peps, could also hit the fund management industry.</p>

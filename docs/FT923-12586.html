			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Observer: Orthodox move If the Department of Trade and Industry needs a chief economic adviser, Walter Eltis is probably as good a choice as any. It is not the first time that the DTI has had a top economic guru. After all, Hans Liesner did the job for 13 years until he left to become deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1989; and the Foreign Office and the Department of Transport, among others, have similar boffins. Even so, Eltis's appointment is bound to raise eyebrows. Is President Heseltine just finding a job for an out-of-work director general of the axed National Economic Devel- opment Office, or is he putting in place his own powerful team to challenge established Treasury thinking? On the surface at least, HM Treasury seemed relaxed enough when Observer check- ed out the possible deeper significance of Eltis's move. It noted that Alan Budd, the Treasury's own chief economic adviser, also heads the government economic service, and is several rungs above Eltis. In addition, Eltis's record as an economist suggests he is much more supportive of the government than a doom- and-gloom merchant like Wynne Godley. Surprisingly, he is not an interventionist. So if Hezza is after alternative thinkers, Eltis isn't one. Indeed, perhaps the people who ought to feel most miffed about the appointment are Eltis's old colleagues at Nedo. To date he is the only one who has been given a job.</p>

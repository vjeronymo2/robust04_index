			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Nuclear Electric to shed 800 more jobs NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned generator for England and Wales, is to shed a further 800 jobs this year, Mr John Collier, its chairman, said yesterday. The company now employs 12,600 people after shedding 1,600 jobs in the past two years. Nuclear Electric plans a programme of cost savings by 1998, when it will cease to receive the nuclear levy - a Pounds 1bn charge on electricity consumers to compensate for the higher cost of generating power from non-fossil fuels. The EC has ordered the end of the levy on the grounds that it is an unfair subsidy in a free market. Mr Collier said the number of power stations operated by Nuclear Electric was likely to fall from 12 to between six and eight - all pressurised water reactors - by 2015 or 2020. Sizewell B in Suffolk, Britain's first pressurised water reactor station, is due to be commissioned in 1994. From the mid 1990s Nuclear Electric will begin closing its ageing Magnox reactors. Mr Collier said he hoped after the government review of nuclear economics in 1994 to be given the go-ahead to build two further stations using the Sizewell B design. He is to meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, next week. One of the stations would be Sizewell C and the other Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Planning permission has already been obtained for Hinkley pending the outcome of the government review. Mr Collier expected an agreement by the year 2000 between the UK, France and Germany on the design of an advanced pressurised water reactor.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Lebanon impasse resolved Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, signalled the end of a debilitating week-long political impasse over a proposed cabinet reshuffle by calling an extraordinary cabinet meeting for today. His decision ends a week in which Mr Hariri 'withdrew' from his duties as prime minister in protest at opposition, predominantly from Mr Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's president, to his proposals for enlarging Christian influence in the cabinet. It follows a weekend trip by Mr Hariri to Syria, Lebanon's powerful neighbour, which retains 35,000 troops in the country, during which he held talks with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president. Lebanese officials would not say what resolution had been reached to persuade Mr Hariri to end his 'strike', but said a solution to the crisis would be discussed at today's meeting. Mr Hrawi and Mr Nabhi Berri, speaker of Lebanon's parliament, had objected to Mr Hariri's proposal to introduce two senior Maronite Christians into the cabinet and had complained at his appointment of close aides. The impasse hurt confidence in the Lebanese pound, requiring the central bank to spend an estimated Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m) to steady the currency.</p>

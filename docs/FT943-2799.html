			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Fast growth for Chinese groups Market reform in China is producing an expanding corps of fast-growing conglomerates which will be in the forefront of foreign trade initiatives and industrial restructuring, according to a new survey. The assessment - conducted by the Development Research Centre under the government's State Council, the State Statistics Bureau, and Management World, the Beijing magazine - found China's largest companies recorded higher growth and efficiency in 1993 and were evolving into industrial groups that will set the pace for reforming the loss-ridden state sector, the magazine said. The Chinese corporate evaluation shows sales volume in 1993 increased 61.2 per cent over 1992 to Yn1,023bn (Pounds 77bn). Profits and taxes rose 37 per cent in 1993 to Yn156bn. The top 500 companies represented only 1 per cent of Chinese enterprises but accounted for 40 per cent of profits and tax payments, the survey said. The number of companies with sales in excess of Yn1bn totalled 287, up from 254 in 1992. The smallest of the 500 reported sales of Yn570m, reflecting sharp growth from 1992, when the smallest recorded sales of Yn370m. The 500 are located mainly in the city of Shanghai, Guangdong and Liaoning provinces and several other fast-growing coastal provinces, and are are concentrated in metallurgical and industrial and transport machinery sectors. The top ten companies and their sales volumes are: Shanghai Automotive Industry, Yn30.7bn; Daqing Petroleum Administration, Yn27bn; Anshan Iron &amp; Steel Group, Yn21.7bn; No 1 Automotive Works, Yn21.6bn; Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel Group, Yn20.2bn; Dongfeng Automotive, Yn20bn; Capital Steel Complex, Yn17.5bn; Shenli Petroleum Administration, Yn14.6bn; Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Group, Yn14bn; Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical, Yn11.4bn. China is showing new flexibility on trade issues Australia wants resolved before it will agree to China's admission to Gatt, the Australian trade minister said yesterday, AP reports from Beijing. Mr Bob McMullan met his Chinese counterpart, Mr Wu Yi, in concluding a visit to Beijing, Shanghai and Canton. Australia's main concern is that China lower or eliminate tariffs on wool. Talks on trade issues concerning Australia had been frozen, but the tone of his meetings in China convinced him there was 'room for flexibility,' Mr McMullan said. China wants to be a Gatt member before January 1 so that it can be a founding member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation.</p>

Effective 1 January 1994, all trade and other types of  organizations, regardless of form of ownership, and bank  institutions will accept from the populace only sum-coupons as  payment for goods and services, all other types of payments,  crediting to settlement accounts, deposits, letters of credit,  and remittances on the territory of the republic.    Any acceptance on the part of trade employees or employees  of  other organizations of 1993-issue banknotes of the Bank of  Russia will be considered a violation of existing legislation on  currency transactions and will entail all applicable  consequences proceeding therefrom.

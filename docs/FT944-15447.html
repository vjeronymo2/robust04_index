			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch agriculture urged to act on competitiveness and quality Dutch agriculture must go on the offensive if it is to maintain its leading position in European and world exports, according to Mr Jozias van Aartsen, agriculture minister in the new Dutch government. Mr Aarsten's call for action, made last week, follows the publication of a report showing that farmers, horticulturists and livestock breeders are losing their reputation for quality and failing to respond to changes in European demand. The minister urged farmers, agricultural produce boards and other organisations in the sector to come up with ideas for a response to the report's findings by the end of the year. The report, compiled by the consultants AT Kearney at the ministry's request, concludes that the agricultural sector - a key motor of the Dutch economy, accounting for 26 per cent of exports - is lagging competitors in countries such as France and Denmark. 'In the mid-1980s the Dutch agri-sector was a textbook example of efficiency and quality. Since then it has changed into a bulk producer with low product variety,' the report said. The Netherlands' competitive position in cut-flowers and seeds remains strong, but this is not enough to compensate for weaker performances in the dairy, vegetable and pork sectors. The consultants argue that the Netherlands' relative decline in European market share has been masked by continued increases in the value and volume of agricultural sales. One of the main factors behind the decline is the failure by Dutch agriculture to respond effectively to the demand for a greater range of products and product specifications, particularly from Europe's increasingly powerful food retail groups. In the dairy sector, for example, the report cited criticism by retailers of Dutch cheese-makers, which have scored just one success over the past 15 years: the launch of Leerdammer cheese. By contrast, the Danish and the French have turned their attention to feta and mozzarella cheeses to take advantage of the popularity of Mediterranean products. The Dutch, unlike the Germans and French, also seem to have missed the growth of European demand for new desserts. One reason for the lack of innovative skill seems to be a conflict of interest within the Netherlands' agricultural co-operatives. At dairy co-operatives, the owners - the farmers - want high prices for their milk. But the co-operatives would be able to make more long-term investments in research and development of new products if raw material prices fell, the report said.</p>

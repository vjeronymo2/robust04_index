			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A MOVER AND A SHAKER;  </P> <P> WELL-TRAVELED GLENN MARX INTENDS TO MAKE A LASTING IMPRINT ON REVAMPED  BASKETBALL PROGRAM AT MIRA COSTA HIGH  </P> <P> Relaxing in his government class at Mira Costa High, away from his duties as  boys' basketball coach, Glenn Marx typifies the laid-back image of the  Manhattan Beach school.  </P> <P> Trim and tanned, he looks younger than his 38 years. His casual attire of white  polo shirt and gray slacks is consistent with the beach life style.  </P> <P> But looks can be deceiving.  </P> <P> "Somebody once said I make Bobby Knight look like Snow White," said Marx,  revealing a side of himself that contradicts his personable demeanor.  </P> <P> Coaching colleagues and former players are familiar with Marx's darker side.  They describe him as demanding, disciplined and driven.  </P> <P> Perhaps that explains how Marx, at 27, earned South Bay Coach of the Year  honors in 1979 after guiding St. Bernard to the Southern Section 4-A semifinals  and laying the foundation for a dynasty that continued through the '80s.  </P> <P> His background might explain why people believe Marx can turn around a Mira  Costa basketball program that has experienced more failures than successes in  the past decade. The Mustangs were 18-47 in the past three years under three  different coaches.  </P> <P> Marx, a graduate of North Hollywood High and Cal State Northridge, acknowledges  that it will take more than a strong personality to build a winner.  </P> <P> "The brash, egotistical Larry Brown image is something I'd rather not be stuck  with," he said, referring to the nomadic coach of the San Antonio Spurs. "I'm  more interested in what we're trying to do."  </P> <P> Although he has been a coaching maverick, working at four high schools and  three Division I colleges in the past 11 years, Marx says he has no intention  of making a quick exit from Mira Costa.  </P> <P> He left an assistant coaching position at the University of Hawaii to take over  the Mustang program last October, two months before the season started. Since  then, he has worked diligently to implement a state-of-the-art conditioning  program and persuade as many boys as possible to come out for basketball.  </P> <P> Marx is already beginning to see dividends this summer. The Mustangs split two  games in the L. A. Games and opened the St. Bernard summer league last week  with a victory over Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "I think he's had a good impact," Redondo Coach Steve Shaw said. "I think  they're going to have a solid program in the next couple of years. He has some  good young kids and he's doing good things with them."  </P> <P> Shaw witnessed a giant leap in Mira Costa's improvement last February when the  Mustangs upset Redondo, 43-42, on a last-second, three-point shot in the  regular-season finale. The loss knocked Redondo from second to third in the  Ocean League and left Mira Costa with a 7-15 record.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever been more thrilled in my life than when we beat  Redondo," Marx said.  </P> <P> This from a man who has coached and scouted on the major-college level and,  through his affiliation with all-star teams, has worked with many of the  nation's finest young players.  </P> <P> After years of chasing the gold ring, Marx says he's settling down.  </P> <P> "I want to get tenure," he said. "I want to buy (property) in the South Bay  area. I've seen. I've traveled. I've coached basketball in three different  countries. I've coached on most levels. I'm the best teaching coach I've been.  I have the best perspective I've had and I'm really enjoying myself."  </P> <P> Bob Mandeville, who played basketball for Marx at Notre Dame High and is now  the school's baseball coach, says it is difficult not to have an opinion about  his former mentor.  </P> <P> "Glenn Marx was always in the spotlight as far as controversy," he said.  "Either you liked him or you disliked him. There's no happy medium with the  guy."  </P> <P> Marx is still trying to live down an incident that occurred during his first  season at Notre Dame in 1980.  </P> <P> After a win at Daniel Murphy High, Marx confronted a referee and was assessed  six technical fouls, according to Jay Privman, who covered the game for the  Daily News. Murphy's best shooter made 11 of 12 free throws (two per technical)  to reverse the decision.  </P> <P> Notre Dame protested the game and was eventually awarded the victory. But  publicity from the incident proved damaging for Marx. He was suspended for the  remainder of the season pending an investigation by the Catholic Athletic Assn.  Notre Dame, ranked second in the Southern Section 4-A Division behind Inglewood  at the time, finished a disappointing third in the Del Rey League.  </P> <P> "I know he went after the referee to voice his opinion," Mandeville said. "I'm  a referee, and it happens (to me) after every game. I believe to this day that  the referee overreacted."  </P> <P> Marx said the incident, which was distributed over the news wire services, was  blown out of proportion by the media. He said the junior varsity coach was  assessed three technicals, but that Marx was credited with all of them because  he refused to talk to reporters after the game.  </P> <P> "I had no comment," he said. "So they figured I got them all."  </P> <P> Marx admits he has always been an emotional coach during games, although he  says he has mellowed over the years.  </P> <P> "I'm kind of aggressive. It's kind of a Rick Pitino-type of enthusiasm," he  said, referring to the fiery coach who recently took over the Kentucky  basketball program. "I don't sit there with my legs crossed when I coach."  </P> <P> Redondo's Shaw was only aware of Marx's reputation before last season.  </P> <P> "I had heard that he was pretty wild and could really go off," he said, "but he  was very calm and under control."  </P> <P> Mandeville says Marx struck an intimidating figure when he took over the Notre  Dame program after coaching St. Bernard for three years.  </P> <P> "At first you fear what's going to happen to you," he said. "Then you realize  he's making you a better player. I remember him coming down on Saturdays and  working with me. He showed quite a commitment. I was very appreciative for what  he did."  </P> <P> Marx returned to Notre Dame in 1981 and coached the team to the Del Rey League  championship and the second round of the playoffs. The Knights were led by  Nigel Miguel, who went on to play at UCLA.  </P> <P> Two years earlier, Marx worked with another talented group of players at St.  Bernard. The Vikings featured four future Division I players -- Butch Hays  (Cal), Lance Washington (Utah State), Michael Gerren (South Alabama) and Billy  Knox (St. Mary's) -- and they helped put St. Bernard on the basketball map by  reaching the 4-A semifinals at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune, an assistant under Marx at the Playa del Rey  school, remembers the transition the players had to make when Marx arrived.  </P> <P> "I don't think the kids had ever played for anybody as demanding as Glenn," he  said. "It was a period of adjustment, but I really think that the kids  responded to him.  </P> <P> "He was a very demanding guy to work for. We had our run-ins, but I think the  best testimony is that we're pretty good friends now after 12 years."  </P> <P> Looking back, Marx says he might have put too much emphasis on winning early in  his career.  </P> <P> "When I was starting out, I thought basketball was the only thing that existed  at the school I was at," he said. "A lot of times people play on your ego. They  say, 'Oh, you've done such a great job.' One of my biggest regrets at St.  Bernard is that I think I was given too much credit for the rather quick  emergence of the basketball program."  </P> <P> He says that it gave him a false sense of importance.  </P> <P> "I appreciate what I have now," he said. "Before, I didn't realize."  </P> <P> The last time Mira Costa boasted a big-name player was in 1984, when 6-foot-10  Eric Leckner blossomed under the tutelage of former Coach Jim Nielsen.  </P> <P> Leckner went on to star at Wyoming and now plays for the Utah Jazz of the  National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> Marx doesn't know if he has any players of Leckner's caliber, but he says the  cupboard is no longer bare at Mira Costa.  </P> <P> "I predict that in two years we'll have seven players over 6-foot-5," he said.  "We have many young kids who are 6-2 and 6-3 with size 15 feet."  </P> <P> The best of the youngsters is Chris Davis, a 6-foot-6 1/2 forward who will be a  junior next fall. Davis blocked seven shots in the first half of Mira Costa's  win over Mayfair in the L. A. Games and will be a mid- to high-level Division I  prospect by the time he is a senior, Marx said.  </P> <P> The coach is also excited about the futures of two other juniors -- 6-foot-4  Scott Letourneau and 6-foot-5 Brent Cashin -- and several promising sophomores.  </P> <P> There seems to be no end to Mira Costa's sudden wealth of young basketball  talent. But Marx says that helping his players improve physically and  academically is just as important as seeing them develop on the court.  </P> <P> Under the supervision of Marv Marinovich, a well-known strength and muscle  development coach who has worked with professional athletes, Marx has  implemented a conditioning regimen that incorporates the latest techniques in  weight training, running and jumping. Marinovich has used the techniques with  his son, Todd, a candidate to replace Rodney Peete as quarterback at USC.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of 14- and 15-year-old skinny kids who, if they were to play  against a Morningside or somebody in our league, would be marginally  competitive right now," Marx said. "But continuing this program for a period of  time, they'll all of a sudden be 6-6 17-year-olds who have been through two  years of intense weight training."  </P> <P> Marx predicts that Mira Costa, which finished sixth out of eight teams in the  Ocean League last season, will contend for a playoff berth next year and the  league title the following season.  </P> <P> Another reason for optimism is the cooperation between the basketball team and  Mira Costa's highly successful volleyball program. Marx says there was one  volleyball player competing in basketball when he started coaching at the  school. Now there are nine.  </P> <P> Canyon Ceman, a forward for the basketball team and an All-Southern Section  setter in volleyball, has noticed a difference in the basketball program since  Marx replaced Bruce Colin, who did not return after the Mustangs went 4-16 in  1988.  </P> <P> "There's a lot more intensity and desire to win," the 6-foot-5 senior said .  "We're taking more steps toward conditioning and improving our athletic  ability. (Marx is) more dedicated to victory. He knows how to run practices and  get the most out of his players."  </P> <P> Marx also wants his players to get the most out of their studies.  </P> <P> "We have tutoring within our program, where our seniors have tutored our  sophomores and freshmen," he said. "We have a brand new team room that Jim  Nielsen developed and we've furnished. I'm encouraging the players to use it  for studying."  </P> <P> Marx said a Scholastic Aptitude Test preparation video will be available to the  school's athletes next year.  </P> <P> "What we did at St. Bernard is what we're trying to do here," he said. "Those  kids not only went on to do well athletically, but do well in college. And  that's been a big focus here. We want to get the kids who are dedicated  basketball players to concentrate on their academics."  </P> <P> Why Mira Costa?  </P> <P> Marx says he is frequently asked that question.  </P> <P> It is a natural inquiry, considering the other schools where he has worked.  After his stint at Notre Dame High, he got a taste of the Ivy League as a  full-time assistant for one season at Brown University in Rhode Island.  </P> <P> He returned to the Southland upon the death of his father and served as coach  for three years at Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley. Next he became an  off-campus assistant under George Raveling at USC while he taught at Mira Costa  in 1987.  </P> <P> When an assistant position at Hawaii opened up the following year, it gave the  bachelor yet another opportunity to expand his coaching horizons.  </P> <P> He has coached 19 players who have gone on to the NBA.  </P> <P> So, why come to basketball-poor Mira Costa?  </P> <P> "There are some stereotypes about Mira Costa and certain beach schools that I  think are invalid," he said. "Corona del Mar (in Newport Beach) this year made  the CIF finals in basketball, football, volleyball and tennis. What we would  like to see here is a Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes-type of program where every  year we are very competitive.  </P> <P> "The first thing you have to do is get the kids in your school out for  basketball. I think a lot of people recruit from the outside and have success  with that, although I hate to say it. But I think what you really need to do is  recruit from within. Get a volleyball kid out. Get a water polo kid out. Get a  football kid out. And then coach them."  </P></p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Highland profits up but demand is down HIGHLAND DISTILLERIES, which reported yesterday an increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 38.8m from Pounds 28.7m for the year to August, said that its malt whisky distilleries were working at only 40 per cent capacity. Against the background of falling demand, the industry could take two to three years to eliminate its surplus stocks, estimated Mr John Goodwin, chairman. Blenders were already adjusting stocks to meet lower estimates of future sales, causing a 25 per cent drop in Highland's new whisky sales in the latest year. This offset gains on sales of its best-selling brand, Famous Grouse, which has been increasing market share abroad, following the distribution arrangement with Remy-Cointreau. Thanks to the continuing success of Famous Grouse, Highland's increase in profits, however, was in marked contrast to lower profits at other distillers, ranging from big producers such as Guinness with premium brands to smaller producers such as Invergordon and Burn Stewart Distillers. COMMENT Highland continues to outperform the Scotch whisky industry. Its partnership with Remy-Cointreau has generated consistent export growth for the past three years and shows every sign of continuing to do so. There is a lot of untapped potential left in Famous Grouse; only 40 per cent of its sales are overseas compared with overall industry exports of 87 per cent. In the UK, the brand has held market share and maintained its premium price despite increased competition from commodity brands. That augurs well for its ability to withstand any further bout of price-cutting this Christmas. Analysts expect only a slight reduction in the rate of growth, forecasting pre-tax profits for this year of Pounds 41m. On a prospective p/e of 15.6, the shares stand at a 2 point premium to the sector.</p>

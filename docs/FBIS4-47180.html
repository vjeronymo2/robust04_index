			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["A Declaration by the Lithuanian Periodical Press </F> Publishers Association (LSA)"]    [Text] The state enterprise for press distribution  "Lithuania's Press" (not included in the list of specific state  enterprises), which as a monopoly set prices unjustified by  economic considerations for its services in connection with the  selling of the press, increased its joint stock through excess  profits, and on 24 March 1994 registered with the Vilnius city  government as a joint stock company.    A privately owned company has become an organization  controlling a critically important service, the retail trade in  newspapers and magazines.    "Lithuania's Press," which has been dictating unfavorable  terms to the periodical press (a faulty system of settling  accounts, in which the sellers are compensated for only 12000060100f  the loss from unsold periodicals, limits placed an the  distribution of new periodicals, etc.), is now escaping  government control.    Since there is no alternative system of distributing the  press -- to create it requires large capital investments -- the  privatization of this enterprise changes in an essential way the  situation of the press in our country.    Not only hundreds of press kiosks in the best locations in  Lithuanian cities and small towns became the shareholders'  property, paid for from residual profits, but also one of the  largest buildings in Lithuania -- the multistory house on  Laisves Prospectas in Vilnius -- another large piece of state  property. A group of people now has the right to decide which  periodicals to disseminate and which ones not to. Newspapers and  magazines are left unprotected against arbitrary actions by the  distributors, dividing periodicals into "good" and "bad,"  creating a precondition for censorship of the press; the press  may lose the common equality under which it operates in the  marketplace. There is no guarantee that one fine day we won't be  left without newspapers -- it is the intent of the stockholders  to change the profile of the enterprise's activities (the heads  of "Lithuania's Press" have explained more than once that it is  more profitable to sell beer and cigarettes than periodicals).    The newspaper and magazine publishers are uneasy about the  fact that a monopoly service is given over to private hands. The  distribution of the press in our country is becoming  unpredictable. A threat has appeared to the economic and  political freedoms of the press, to the entire free press, the  guarantee of democracy and stability of the country.    [Signed] Rimantas Sukys, president of the Lithuanian  Periodical Press Publishers Association.</p>

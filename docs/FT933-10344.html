			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A firm New York opening enabled the London robusta COFFEE market to shrug off an early setback and back towards the 2 1/2 -year highs achieved on Monday. The November position slipped to Dollars 1,065 a tonne during the morning as fears of further frost in Brazilian growing areas receded. But amid quiet trading the price recovered to close at Dollars 1,085 a tonne, up Dollars 9 on the day. Although London COCOA prices continued to be held back by sterling's strength the market managed to add a couple of pounds to recent gains. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices built on Monday's firmness as dealers became more hopeful that the downtrend had bottomed out. The three months position closed at Dollars 1,241.25 a tonne, up Dollars 10.75 on the day. GOLD surrendered most of a modest early rise after the New York opening failed to provide support. The London bullion market fixed a price of Dollars 404.95 a troy ounce in the morning, but by the close it was down to Dollars 403.65, up 40 cents on the day. Dealers suggested that the market may have become a little overbought. Compiled from Reuters</p>

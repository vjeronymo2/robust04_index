			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has started  working on measures to be taken against North Korea on a  step-by- step basis in view of the need to overhaul its North  Korea policy in the wake of Pyongyang's refusal to undergo full  international inspections of its nuclear facilities and the  rupture of inter-Korean talks.    Under the measures, the government will consult with  Washington about when the conditionally-suspended "Team Spirit"  military exercise with the United States should resume, while  strengthening cooperation with Washington in pressing  continuously for full International Atomic energy agency (IAEA)  inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities.    On Monday, President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of  security- related ministers to discuss measures against North  Korea's open threat of war and examine the defense system in the  face of the North's provocation of war.    Regarding the North's threat to pull out of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the government decided to  cooperate [as received] the United States and other friendly  nations, as well as with the IAEA, in taking countermeasures for  such a threat, seeing the need for hardline measures against the  North.    It was also decided that during his state visits to Japan  and  China in the last week of March, President Kim should explain to  the Japanese and Chinese leaders about the need for gradual  steps of action against North Korea, such as re-asking North  Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections, warning of UN  sactions and imposing the sactions, and ask for their  cooperation in this action.    President Kim, noting the North Korean nuclear issue has  reached a critical point of its development attracting the  attention of not only the Korean people but also of many nations  of the world, said he had called the meeting to have an in-depth  discussion of the matter.    National Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok said the  government  would keep the door of dialogue open to the North, while waiting  for change in the North's position on inter-Korean dialogue with  a firm principle and policy in dealing with the North.    He thus suggested the government would suspend inter-Korean  dialogue until the North changes its position.    Also attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Agency for National  Security Planning Director Kim Tok.    It was decided at the meeting to strengthen the defense  posture, including strengthening the early warning network,  during Kim's visits to Japan and China.    The policy of continuing diplomatic efforts to solve the  North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue until the United  Nations takes sanctions against North Korea was confirmed at the  meeting.</p>

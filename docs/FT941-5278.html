			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / EU moves on night work The European Commission yesterday threatened Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Portugal with legal action over their restrictions on night work for women when a ban did not exist on night work by men. The commission said it had written to all five governments requesting that they change their legislation to bring it into line with a 1991 EU ruling which judged that banning night work by women, but not by men, was discriminatory. If the governments do not comply, it will take them to the European Court of Justice.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Good first half for S African fruiterer Improved sales and rising pineapple prices helped Del Monte Royal Foods (Delfood), the South Africa-based international fruit products company, to achieve a 9.5 per cent rise in first-half attributable earnings to R90.1m (Dollars 24.7m) against R82.2m for the corresponding period last year. Although conditions remained difficult in the first quarter, sales volumes rose significantly in the second quarter and turnover rose 8 per cent to R701.1m from R651.3m. However, operating income at R110.75m was only slightly up from R110.23 a year ago. A dividend of 8.5 cents, up from 8 cents, was declared. Interest charges rose to R27.9m from R20.5m due to temporary working capital requirements, but this was offset by a substantial drop in tax to R1.47m from R17.52m. Delfood says it anticipates further improvement on last year's figures due to the growing economic recovery in main markets, and it has expanded into new products and new geographic regions over the past six months. New projects have included entry into Spain and Portugal, expansion in France and the UK, and licensing agreements to launch a full product range in Israel and fruit juices in Saudi Arabia.</p>

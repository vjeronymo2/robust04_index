			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Total profits stagnant at FFr2bn in first six months Total, the French oil and chemicals group, yesterday announced almost unchanged first-half net profits of FFr1.98bn (Dollars 356m), in spite of weak crude prices and refining margins, compared with FFr1.93bn a year ago. Mr Serge Tchuruk, president, said that given the volatility of petroleum and currency markets, he could not forecast how full-year results might compare with last year's FFr3.1bn profit. However, he claimed increasing financial strength for the group, which in the first half improved its cash flow by 4 per cent to FFr6.1bn. Net investment was cut by FFr1bn to FFr4.6bn and net debt-to-equity gearing ratio reduced to 20 per cent, compared with 23 per cent at end-December. Turnover rose slightly to FFr68.7bn in the half year because increased sales volume was offset by lower prices. The main sectoral improvement was in chemicals, where operating profits rose 16 per cent on the back of higher demand from the European car and packaging industries. Mr Tchuruk said Total had not only showed a better return on capital over the past four years than rival oil groups, but that the French company was replacing oil reserves at a higher rate and at a lower cost than others. Total's goal is to produce 1m barrels a day by the end of the century, or more than it will be refining, as a correction to its previous over-dependence on downstream activities. Its main prospecting areas for oil are in the Middle East, where Mr Tchuruk confirmed that Total 'like every other company' was talking to Iraq but would do nothing until United Nations sanctions were lifted. In chemicals, gas production and oil refining, Total was investing in Asia. Mr Tchuruk said that although Elf-Aquitaine had been privatised, there had been 'relatively little restructuring' in the European oil industry, partly because much of it was in state hands. He added that 'there are too many actors and a great many needs for restructuring in the European market,' which he forecast would remain difficult. In terms of financial acquisitions and industrial accords, 'we are open to opportunities', he said.</p>

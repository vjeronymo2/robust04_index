			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is expected to end its session  this evening after five days of deliberations, which dealt with  the internal organization of the party, the country's  development strategy, and the Angolan peace talks. MPLA Central  Committee spokesman Norberto dos Santos said:    [Begin Santos recording] We think that our negotiating team  is doing good work. It is defending the interests of our  country and the government and we encourage it to continue on  this path. The government has made an offer. It has already  expressed its stand on UNITA's participation in the government,  the special status for Jonas Savimbi, and the mandate of the UN  Angola Verification Mission. These issues are on the  negotiating table, waiting for UNITA to adopt a stand. Our  delegation will therefore continue to deal with these issues.  The MPLA Central Committee has restated that it is necessary to  find a just and lasting peace in Lusaka that will defend the  interests of the Angolan people. [end recording]</p>

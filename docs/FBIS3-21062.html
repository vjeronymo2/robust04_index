Ten years of research into  forest damage have not yielded any strategies for stemming the  tide of damage. In addition, criticism of the methods for  surveying the damage is growing.    To summarize the results of the new damage survey, the State  of the Forests Report needed only one short page. According to  this report, 24% of the trees in Germany show clear  damage,  40% show slight damage, and 36% show no signs of  damage. The  forest in northwest Germany is relatively well off. In this  area, the portion of trees showing clear damage is 16% on  average. In southern Germany on the other hand, every fourth  tree shows clear damage. In the new Federal Lands, this figure  is 29%. In Thuringia, every second tree is dying.  Different  types of trees react differently. One fifth of both the spruces  and pines show clear damage. However, this is the case with  45%  of the oaks and 32% of the beeches.    The data show little that is new. The rates in the  individual  damage stages have changed little since 1991. Accordingly,  2%  to 2.5% of the trees have lost at least 61% of  their needles  or leaves (damage stage 3) or have already died (damage stage  4). Also, 22% to 25% exhibit needle or leave  losses of 26 to  60% (damage stage 2), 40% still have at least  three quarters  of their original needle or leave mass (damage stage 1), and 32  to 36% have been declared healthy because they have lost a  maximum of 10% of their needles or leaves. "The forest  continues to be in a difficult situation," comments Jochen  Borchert. He is the Federal Minister for Agriculture and said  this during the presentation of the report at the beginning of  December in Bonn. "However, we are not ready to ring the  disaster alarm."    Indeed, sick trees do not frighten anyone any more. One  reason is that the forest is dying more slowly than believed ten  years ago. The chronology since 1984 shows that, in northwest  Germany (former Federal Lands), the rate of trees "showing clear  damage" (damage stages 2 to 4) increased from 10% to  16% by  1993. The rate of "healthy" trees (damage stage 0) dropped from  62% to 50% in the same time. In southern Germany,  the portion  of sick trees increased from 20 to 25%, the portion of  "healthy" trees fell from 45 to 33%.    For the survey, the individual Lands first covered their  forest areas with a grid. Depending upon the size of the forest,  this grid was between 4 km by 4 km and 16 km by 16 km. At the  points of intersection of the grid, the crowns of 24 marked  trees at each point were assessed from the ground in July and  August. The leaf or needle loss of these trees was estimated.    Numerous associations and environmentalists, however, warn  against overrating these data. On the one hand, the broad mesh  of the measuring network only permits the assessment of trends  over an entire Land, differentiated only according to the types  of trees and age groups. Soil composition and the annual  increase in biomass are important indicators for the progress of  damage. Data on these items have not yet been included in the  survey and will not be available until 1994. Merely counting  leaves or needles is not very suitable for assessing forest  decline, points out the study group of the Association of German  Forest Owners. A slight recovery of "trees showing clear damage"  as indicated by this year's report is, according to information  of the forest owners, not to be attributed to improved air  quality, but rather to a summer with growth-promoting weather.  In addition, the results are distorted in that about 2%  of the  test trees die and are felled annually. Also, environmentalists  criticize that even young trees that are scarcely knee high are  counted in the survey just like old, mature samples. In  addition, larger areas where the trees have died off no longer  appear in the statistics as former forest areas.    The declining forest still generates a number of questions  for science. Why do different types of trees react so  differently? Why do many forests grow at a greater rate now than  50 years ago in spite of a reduced mass of needles and leaves?  What portion of the decline can be attributed to air pollutants  such as sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, ammonia  and ozone, what portion to weather, what portion to insect pests  and disease-causing agents? The "Forest Decline" advisory  committee had already determined in 1989 that "in the face of  the numerous relationships of location, composition, management,  and pollution factors, there cannot be a simple explanation of  the causes for the new type of forest decline valid uniformly  for all forests."    The scientist have not advanced their knowledge much further  at this time. In the meantime, the Federal Research Ministry  (BMFT) established forest ecosystem centers at the Universities  of Bayreuth and Gottingen. Here, research should change its  emphasis from the previous study of individual pollutant effects  to the analysis of the entire forest ecosystem. The annual  budget of about 33 million Deutsche marks, however, appears  rather meager when compared to the 477 million Deutsche marks  that the Federal Government and its Lands have expended since  1984 for so-called accompanying forest measures -- 175 million  Deutsche marks for liming and compensation fertilizing of the  forest soil and 170 million Deutsche marks for reforestation.    The many question marks in forest decline research should  not  prevent politics from acting. Environmental associations have  been demanding this for years. "In reality, there is still no  such thing as forest preservation policy," criticizes Dr. Helmut  Klein. He is from the Association for the Preservation of the  Environment and Nature of Germany. Just how difficult it is to  provide concrete political measures to preserve the forest is  shown by the example of the Fertilizer Use Ordinance. Besides  air-borne sulfur and nitrous oxides, agricultural fertilizers  containing nitrogen throw the forest ecosystem out of balance.  An ordinance prohibiting excessive fertilization has been kept  in the wings for years.    Another important question is still on ice. Should forest  owners be compensated for the dying trees? An inter-ministerial  study group was to calculate what economic damage was done to  the forest by which air pollutants. In the meantime, this study  group has stopped work. "There is no money available for such  compensation," fears Assistant Secretary Peter Splett from the  Forestry Management Department of the Federal Ministry for  Agriculture. If forest owners are compensated for their sick  trees, the owners of monuments or public buildings would also  have to be compensated for the loss in value caused by air  pollutants. The question of compensation is about to be  clarified by the Federal Constitutional Court. If the justices  decide in favor of compensation, "That would become a bottomless  pit," says Splett.</p>

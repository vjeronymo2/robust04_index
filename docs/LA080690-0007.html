			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD TO OFFER FREE RIDES ON TARDY BUSES  </P> <P> In response to "RTD to Try a Novel Lure: A Free Ride if Bus Is Late," July 26:  </P> <P> Anger is the only way to express my feelings about this article. Anyone who has  to take his or her car into the dealership for repair and dares to try a ride  back to the office or home on an RTD bus -- or a Santa Monica Blue Bus -- is  going to run into frustration: At most bus stops, you find absolutely no  information about the buses, where they go, and when they arrive. You would  have to make a trip to the public library first and do some research about the  bus lines in the area, because the phone numbers are busy most of the time, the  drivers are too busy and oftentimes no help at all; if you need a transfer to a  different bus line to get to your final destination, that means instant  trouble.  </P> <P> Lateness is a problem too, but, of course, if you want to be fair, you cannot  always blame the drivers or the company if buses get stuck in Los Angeles'  chaotic traffic. No matter how you cut it, anyone who has to work for a living  simply cannot afford to waste time playing the RTD game, unless he or she takes  the same bus line every day, is extremely familiar with the system and can risk  arriving late -- 15 to 20 minutes or more. In European cities, where public  transportation is much more common, you find information about times and routes  at each and every bus stop! Why not in Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Furthermore, RTD might even be dangerous to your well-being or even your life  after dark. Unfortunately, the only thing you can do in this city to ensure  your personal safety and punctuality is ignore the urge to use buses and get  yourself into a car or at least a taxi wherever you go.  </P> <P> If RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras wants to know why daily ridership has  fallen from 1.8 million passengers to 1.3 million in the last five years, there  is only one question to ask: "Have you ridden a bus lately?"  </P> <P> ARMIN AMLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

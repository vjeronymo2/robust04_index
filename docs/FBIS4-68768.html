			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Randers: "The Impact of Unemployment on </F> Internal Politics and Crime"]    [Text] State Labor Minister A. Berzins submitted a report  to Prime Minister V. Birkavs on the impact of unemployment  on the stability of internal politics in the state and the  necessity of initiatives to reduce unemployment.    The report states that in many areas of Latvia, especially  in  the Latgale rayons, the unemployment rate is two to three times  higher than the national average, and that such areas are  becoming increasingly more numerous. The problem primarily  affects the small cities and rural districts of Latvia, which  contain a large majority of Latvians (according to the 1989  census data -- 74%). These are areas where enterprises  based in  major industrial centers had established branches at one time,  but have now ceased their activities, for the most part.    Under these conditions, the situation cannot be improved  through unemployment compensation nor by extending the period  for receipt of such (the Cabinet of Ministers has compiled a  list of such cities and rural districts in the rayons of  Aluksne, Balvi, Dobele, Jekabpils, Kraslava, Madona, Preili, and  Rezekne, where unemployed workers have the right to extend their  unemployment compensation for up to 12 months -- I.R.).    The increase in the number of those unemployed has created  economic problems (nonpayment of rent and communal services, an  increase in the number of those requesting and receiving social  assistance, etc.), promotes a polarization of the political  views of the inhabitants and, overall, promotes crime in the  state.    In Western nations, there is an assumption that each  percentage increase in unemployment, on the average, increases  the rates of crime by 4% and suicide by 5.6%.  While not  attributing this assumption to Latvia, in its entirety, the  State Labor Minister mentions these facts: the start of  unemployment was recorded at the end of 1991, and the crime rate  per 1,000 inhabitants rose from 129 in 1990 to 235 in 1992 (an  increase of 82%). The suicide rate (759 cases in 1991) in  1993  has increased to 1,088 cases (43%).    In order to stabilize the internal political, economic and  crime situation in rural Latvia and its small cities, the  following is proposed: first, create a state commission which  would develop a special program for rayons with a high rate of  unemployment, in order to promote commercial activities, secure  existing enterprises or reorganize former branches, and also  attract the interest of businessmen to start, continue or expand  their businesses; second, in the Privatization Agency, create a  division which would examine enterprise privatization projects  from the standpoint of saving jobs, and only after this has been  accomplished, propose a selling off price for these projects.</p>

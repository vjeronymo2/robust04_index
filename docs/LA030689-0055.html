			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> YOAV TALMI CONDUCTS L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> Giving a nod to new music and tipping its hat at an old Art Deco theater, the  Wiltern, the peripatetic Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra hit on an appealing mix  Friday -- thanks largely to its guests, conductor Yoav Talmi and violinist  Frank Peter Zimmermann.  </P> <P> A West Coast premiere, Michael Gandolfi's "Point of Departure" turned out to be  an ambitious, intricately wrought work that moves cunningly from agitated to  lyric to mournful states, one that filters its various motifs and materials  through a high-definition structure of extraordinary polish. Talmi and the  orchestra seized the opportunity, answering its challenges to refinement and  clarity.  </P> <P> It seemed, in fact, a deliberate continuation of musical thought when the  ensemble, with Zimmermann, next launched into Prokofiev's First Concerto -- for  here was an echo of winds chirping over high tremolo strings, sounding the same  aerial tension of Gandolfi's piece. The soloist, a1847616888th the placid  shimmer of the music. Adding Ravel's dark and throaty "Tzigane" merely broke  themood.  </P> <P> But Talmi redefined it, along with Beethoven's First Symphony, to which he  brought equal parts gracious warmth and driving exuberance.

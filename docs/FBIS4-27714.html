			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Media Love Khmer Rouge"] </F>   [Text] "Tourist arrivals have been drastically reduced as  a result of escalated fighting". "The Khmer Rouge are making  further inroads into government areas". "The Royal Cambodian  Armed Forces are demoralised after two heavy defeats".    These are some of the headlines on news items churned out by  the international press. Hence, the question on everyone's lips  is: Is Cambodia safe? Is it wise to travel to Phnom Penh? Is  it not a dangerous place where banditry is rampant and security  is virtually nonexistent?    The answer lies very much on what the media reports. In this  case, sadly, it is the negative aspects of life in Cambodia. As  the adage goes, it is news when man bites dog but it isn't when  dog bites man.    In this Kingdom, sensationalism is the key word as far as  most journalists are concerned.    Journalists, largely western and even some locals, just  thrive on the negative aspects of news reporting. There is no  bright side as this either is not worth the paper it is typed on  or will not be used by the international media.    Each day, private business deals are being clinched, both  with the government or with major local business houses. Road  restoration projects are seen while some form of sanity is  slowly but surely returning to the city.    Given this situation, it may seem wise for the international  media to harp on fighting which is taking place three to four  hundred kilometres away.    They give innuendos that the city itself and the Royal  Government might come under siege as a result of recent  battlefield victories by the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge guerilla  faction.    The same incident, for example a mortar attack on Heathrow  airport, only managed a single column in some newspapers.  Negative news on this nation is blazed on the front page of  newspapers, particularly in a neighbouring country.    However, the positive side is seldom reported or heard of.  Week after week, press conferences at the Ministry of  Information is often monopolised by certain journalists intent  only on getting more details on the Khmer Rouge.    Questions evolve around this guerilla faction so much, it  has  even been said that press briefings are for an insight into the  Khmer Rouge, not other aspects of this nation as the press  conference is intended for.    For the nation to shrug off this negative image, attitudes  must change, both within the government machinery, the public  and in neighbouring countries.    If one were to recall, a neighbouring nation which had faced  the same situation as this nation approximately 30 years ago,  roped in the media to wage a psychological battle against the  terrorists.    The media, the common people and the government were one in  this battle. The government propaganda machinery went on the  offensive to win the hearts and minds of the masses.    Negative reporting about terrorists attacks were played down  while business, investment and government projects and  activities were highlighted.    This should be a useful lesson for the Royal Government and  the powers that are in this nation. The masses restored  democracy with the assistance of the international community.    The Government owes it to the masses and with the undivided  assistance and co-operation of the masses, it can certainly  reverse the negative battlefield disasters and highlight the  increasing number of businesses waiting to kick off. This would  be the start of better things.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Weak prices hit Rio Algom WEAK commodity prices, poor metals distribution markets, and declining uranium output reduced Rio Algom's revenues and earnings sharply in 1991, writes Robert Gibbens. Revenues dipped to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m) from CDollars 1.3bn in 1990, and net profit was CDollars 24.5m, or 51 cents a share, against CDollars 87.3m, or CDollars 1.93. in The results include special losses of CDollars 20.2m, against CDollars 30.3m, mainly related to the Nova Scotia tin mining operation finally closed on January 3, 1992. Rio has temporarily suspended efforts to sell its metals distribution business, which has annual sales of about CDollars 700m. No acceptable offers were received mainly because of the recession.</p>

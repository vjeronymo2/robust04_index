			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Victor Zuleta from Potosi -- live] </F>   [Excerpts] Peasant Francisco Cruz Talavera, who was  believed to be dead, came forth yesterday afternoon to explain  that he had been mistaken for the person who was taken to the  local morgue on 2 May. As is known, Potosi peasant federation  leaders first insisted that the dead person was Francisco Cruz,  whose name was among those who were reported missing on 30  April. Francisco Cruz's relatives and friends were confused by  the features of the face and body of the remains that were  found. [passage omitted]    Dozens of people insisted that they could recognize the body  as belonging to Cruz, as there was an extraordinary resemblance  between our fellow journalist and the features of the body that  was found. In view of this reasonable piece of evidence, the  mass media reported Cruz's supposed death.    In his first statement, Cruz said he had been at the site of  the roadblock until they were forced into the hills of (Ocoruru)  on 30 October. He said he decided to leave for (Pisuri), his  home town, because of security reasons and because his wife was  about to give birth to their seventh child.    In view of persistent reports of his death, Cruz decided to  leave for Potosi at dawn yesterday, marching along with others  who cheered him. Radio [name indistinct], which like other  media reported Cruz's death, considered it necessary to issue a  bulletin which in its main points reads: We have been able to  ascertain that Francisco Cruz is alive, and that he is in Potosi  to clarify reports disseminated by the mass media. In view of  this, and as we have publicly expressed our firm willingness to  help achieve peace in the country, we are hereby issuing this  explanation so that the truth can prevail, in compliance with  the teachings of the gospel that the truth will make us free.

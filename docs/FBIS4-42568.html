			<p>BFN     [Text] Upon his 1430 return at Ellinikon Airport today,  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed his satisfaction  with his visit to Moscow. The foreign minister talked about  full exchange of views with the Russian side on the Yugoslav  issue, and pointed out that the two countries continue to  support free navigation in the Canakkale Straits, as provided by  the Montreux Treaty.    Responding to a question on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, Mr. Papoulias said he does  not expect much from the visit by President Clinton's special  envoy Matthew Nimetz, and made the assessment that Mr. Nimetz  will not bring anything new to the current phase.</p>

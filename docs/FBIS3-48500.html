The committee, to be made up of government officials  and private businessmen, is a follow-up measure discussed at the  summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Chinese President  Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November. The committee will be  formally launched in late March when President Kim pays an  official visit to China.    Under the committee, the two countries will set up a  subcommittee on automobile, electronic telephone switching  system and aircraft industries, officials said.    In this connection, officials from the Economic Planning  Board, Foreign, Trade, Industry and Resources and Communications  Ministries will convene a meeting soon to select South Korean  members of the committee. The Korean-side chairman of the  committee is expected to be a vice or assistant minister.    With the establishment of the committee, the two countries  will be able to form a systematic framework for medium- and  long-term cooperation for the expansion of bilateral trade, one  senior Foreign Ministry official said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Leaders of the 12  member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  today ended their one-day summit here after signing a package of  documents on political, economic and military cooperation.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters at a joint  press conference at the end of the summit that the CIS leaders  adopted a statement on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and  Russia agreed to send its peace-keeping troops there to join the  U.N. observers.    Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze believed that the  statement covered several important points, including an urgent  appeal to the U.N. Security Council to start a peace-keeping  operation in Abkhazia, a breakaway autonomous republic of  Georgia.    Asked why Ukraine chose to join the CIS' economic union as  an  associate member, its President Leonid Kravchuk replied: "the  question is whether integration is to be accomplished on equal  or unequal terms."    The Ukrainian leader pointed out that the unification of the  Belarus and Russian monetary systems signifies deeper  integration than the Euro-Asian Union proposed by Kazakh  President Nursultan Nazarbayev.    Kazakh Vice-President Yerik Ansanbayev disclosed that "a  comprehensive program for the formation of the Euro-Asian Union  will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS summit."    Moldovan President Mircea Snegur believed that ordinary CIS  citizens will receive plenty of economic benefits as a result of  the Moscow summit.    Yeltsin also announced at the press conference that the next  CIS summit meeting will be held on December 9.</p>

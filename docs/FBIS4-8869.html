			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D.C.: "We Need a More Efficient Economy"] </F>   [Text] Ohrid, 16 April -- "Our economy is undeniably in a  difficult situation. However, we must recall that the reason for  that does not come from a year ago, but has its roots 10 years  back, when we had a system that could not match the model of the  western economy. It does not mean that we have to succumb to  apathy and hopelessness now, but we have to restructure the  economy and find a way out." This is what the Prime Minister of  the Macedonian Republic [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] stated in Ohrid today at his meeting with  Ohrid businessmen, when they discussed the current economic  situation and the Stabilization program of the Republic of  Macedonia.    "It is very important," the Macedonian Prime Minister  recalled, ``to state the reasons for such a situation. First of  all, the Macedonian economy was designed for a market of 22  million people, and this no longer exists. The economic  blockades gave rise to great expenditures, such as for  transport. We estimate that we have incurred more than $3  billion of damage over the past three years. We have no  illusions that anyone will give us that money as a gift, because  there are a lot of interests in the world, and little justice.    "In these conditions," Branko Crvenkovski said, ``we were  exposed to great pressure, whether to wait for better times or  apply the reforms. We decided to do the latter, although we are  aware we shall have to pay the costs. Our stabilization program  was assessed positively by famous international institutions,  but we must understand that it will not give the expected  results unless we make structural changes, because we need an  efficient economy. I mean here transformation of the state  companies, changes in the banking system, and so on.    "We had to start this process, because we had no other  choice. It hurts, it costs, but I wonder whether we have to  undertake measures similar to those of our northern neighbor,  and pay a high price for returning to the reforms. I want to  remind you that our inflation is below the expected level, the  exchange rate is stable, our businessmen can plan in a more  tranquil manner. At this moment, my special concern is the fall  of productivity and the proper use of capacities in the economy.  Many companies have the problem of disposing of their goods,  which means they will have to look for new markets."    Branko Crvenkovski also talked about the huge effects  suffered in Macedonia by the Greek blockade, and he mentioned  that Greece was under great international pressure, suffering  attendant damage, nevertheless he pointed out that this did not  imply that we would be able to use Thessaloniki harbor. "If  there is any logic, that should happen, but it seems that this  does not apply to these territories," Macedonian Prime Minister  Branko Crvenkovski said.    The President of the Chamber of Commerce Dusan Petrevski  also  spoke on some economic problems at the Ohrid meeting, while  Minister Jane Miljovski spoke about the transformation of state  companies and privatization.</p>

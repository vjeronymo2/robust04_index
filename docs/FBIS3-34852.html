			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] London, Amman, Beirut, Tripoli, Political  Studies Center, news agencies -- Lebanese security authorities  announced yesterday the names of the Palestinians held in  custody on charges of assassinating the Jordanian diplomat Na'ib  'Imran al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. Meanwhile Jordan announced the  arrest of the members of six "Afghan Arabs" cells in the context  of its investigations to uncover those who carried out the  bombing operations in Amman and to determine the extent of their  link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination.    Sources have said that members of the Fatah-Revolutionary  Council who are said to be responsible for al-Ma'ayitah's  assassination, are living normally in Jordan. Libya has denied  any link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination as reported in Amman.  However, reports that Libya was behind the assassination have  started a crisis in Jordanian-Libyan relations. [passage  omitted]    Reports in Amman linked Libya's support of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council to the extent of its involvement in  al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, especially as the Jordanian  monarch, King Husayn, pointed to the role of an Arab capital in  the incident. But Libya hastened to deny any link with the  incident, stressing its good relations with Jordan. A Libyan  source said that these reports are designed to harm these  relations.    Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to  resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe  that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would  weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis.  At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the  clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the  information available has not indicated that Jordanian security  services have taken any actions against members of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this  connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all  clues in the light of the investigations with those suspected of  carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon,  and to determine whether they have any link with members of this  organization in Jordan.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Rapid growth adds to rate rise pressure Fears that UK interest rates may have to rise further were fuelled yesterday by signs that recent rapid economic growth is creating new inflationary pressures. Official figures showed that inflation and average earnings are edging up. Meanwhile unemployment is falling at an accelerating rate, suggesting that with fewer people out of work, wage demands may rise. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday downplayed the inflationary dangers by stressing that the overall economic picture was 'extremely good', with plenty of spare capacity. '(Inflation) is not a risk for the economy at the moment,' he told the Treasury and Civil Service parliamentary select committee. However, the Treasury yesterday said the inflation data provided a further demonstration of the pressures that had prompted the  1/2 point rise in interest rates this month from 5.75 per cent to 6.25 per cent. 'We have probably seen the trough of low inflation for now,' an official said, pointing out that the Treasury forecast assumed inflation would rise to 2.5 per cent by late next year. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the retail prices index rose by 2.6 per cent in the year to November, up from 2.4 per cent in October. The government's targeted inflation measure, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose by 2.3 per cent in the year to November, from 2 per cent in September and October. The increase was boosted by unusual factors such as a sharp rise in milk prices after the recent reform of the milk marketing board. But price rises also occurred in the clothing and household goods sectors which had seen severe discounting earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the underlying rate of average earnings growth edged up to 4 per cent in October, from 3.75 per cent in September. The Department of Employment said overtime and bonus payments, rather than higher pay settlements, had led to the rise. However, the rise in average earnings has yet to have an effect on UK manufacturing competitiveness, since productivity is outstripping wages growth. In the three months to October, manufacturing unit labour costs were 1.7 per cent lower than in the same period of 1993, the sharpest fall since records began in 1970. Unemployment fell below 2.5m for the first time in three years, with the number of people claiming benefit dropping a seasonally adjusted 43,400 in November to 2.47m, or 8.8 per cent of the workforce. Employment, as measured by a survey of employers, rose by 146,000 in the third quarter, the highest quarterly increase since 1989. Previous surveys had shown it static, or falling.

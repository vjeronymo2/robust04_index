			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Premiums for three market newcomers There were premiums for all three of yesterday's newcomers to the stock market. Shares in DFS Furniture, the specialist upholstery retailer, ended their first day's trading at 271p, compared to the 260p issue price. Some 17m shares were traded. The rise increases the value of the 51.7 per cent stake retained by Mr Graham Kirkham, chairman, by about Pounds 6m. He raised Pounds 129m by selling 47.7 per cent of the group's shares in the flotation. The public offer of 17.5m shares was 1.3 times subscribed, and allocations were skewed towards smaller investors. This may have created some demand for shares yesterday from larger investors disappointed by the allotments. Azlan Group, the networking products distributor which came to the market this week, saw its shares close 11p up on the 230p offer price. Some Pounds 6m, net of expenses, was raised in the flotation. The proceeds will be used to increase its market share and expand internationally. Shares of Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer, recovered from an early low of 235p to close 1p above the issue price at 251p. Analysts said trading had been buoyant, with good two-way business. The group raised a net Pounds 18m through the placing of 11.2m ordinary shares, half of which were subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The offer was 2.1 times subscribed. The company will be using Pounds 5.4m of the proceeds to redeem existing preference shares and Pounds 8.5m to repay bank and shareholder loans. The balance will provide working capital.</p>

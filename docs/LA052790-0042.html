			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: LIFE CHANGES IN THE FACE OF DEATH  </P> <P> If I were Lee Atwater, I'd want to read bad things about me once again.  </P> <P> I'd want to read how I was "the most evil man in America" (U.S. Rep. Patricia  Schroeder), "a nervous little devil's helper . . . a bug-eyed gnome with a  perpetual smirk and an uncanny ability to patronize blacks" (Spy magazine),  "sinister . . . viciously demagogic . . . nefarious" (Michael Kinsley), and how  "Atwater would kidney punch a Girl Scout" (GQ).  </P> <P> You have not seen stuff like this written about Atwater lately and you are not  likely to see it written in the near future. That's because Lee Atwater has a  brain tumor.  </P> <P> And the press does not speak ill of the dying. It is one of the last great  taboos.  </P> <P> Nothing shows this more clearly than the flip-flop The New Republic was forced  to perform.  </P> <P> Early reports -- and these were conscious smoke screens -- were that Atwater  had "fainted" during a speech on March 5. In reality, he had had a violent  seizure and lost control of the left side of his body.  </P> <P> He was diagnosed as having a non-malignant brain tumor, but the word was put  out that everything was going to be all right. So when Atwater gave a phone  interview to Lee Bandy of Knight-Ridder, some people were confused. Because  there now emerged an Atwater nobody had seen before.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine me getting back in a fighting mood," he said. "I don't see how  I'm ever going to be mean. It's going to be hard for me to be as tough on  people."  </P> <P> Atwater said he would now view life differently. "I have a better sense of  humanity," he said, "a better sense of fellowship with people than I've ever  had before."  </P> <P> Mentioning a longtime political foe, Atwater said: "If I saw him right now, I'd  hug him around the neck. I'd give him the warmest hug I could give him."  </P> <P> Naturally, everybody thought this was pure hogwash. Pure Atwater. This was  straight out of the heavily underlined copy of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" that  Atwater always traveled with: "Without deception, you cannot carry out  strategy, without strategy you cannot control the opponent."  </P> <P> Which is how The New Republic viewed it. "Leave it to Lee Atwater -- now on the  mend, we're glad to say -- to spin-control his own brain tumor," the magazine  wrote. "He's been telling reporters that his bout with illness has turned him  into a kinder, more mellow Republican National Committee chairman.  </P> <P> "To paraphrase a comment of Evelyn Waugh's, doctors appear to have found the  only part of Mr. Atwater that isn't malignant. Let's hope they don't have to  remove it."  </P> <P> Not a bad line. Except that soon afterward, the true seriousness of Atwater's  illness became known. His tumor was deadly and he was pursuing a very daring  method of treatment: Radioactive material was being injected directly into the  tumor in an attempt to kill it.  </P> <P> And stories began quoting doctors saying the survivability rates of this kind  of tumor were not good. In other words, Lee Atwater might be dying.  </P> <P> So The New Republic suddenly did not look wry and witty anymore. It looked mean  and cruel. And so a few weeks later it said:  </P> <P> "We apologize for making light of Lee Atwater's illness. . . . Our objections  to the campaign he managed for George Bush still stand, but we sincerely wish  him well in his struggle for health."  </P> <P> Then the magazine went on to say that others in his party were even worse than  Atwater and concluded with: "Get well, Lee. Your party needs your comparative  decency and intelligence."  </P> <P> Atwater must have gotten a smile out of that "comparative." One wall of his  rather grand office at Republican National Headquarters is devoted to political  cartoons that depict him as a racist, a liar and a scoundrel.  </P> <P> "Doesn't bother me," he said when I asked him about them once. "I'm a  professional lightning rod. I ain't never gonna run for office. But when I call  the cartoonists to ask for the cartoons, a lot of them don't know how to  react."  </P> <P> The whole point of the wall was to show that Atwater knew how to take it. It  was to tell people: "I can take any punch you can throw."  </P> <P> Now, however, Lee Atwater has been thrown a curve. He is a man used to  controlling lives, events, even the destiny of a nation. And now he cannot  depend on controlling even his own body.  </P> <P> It must be a terrible, frightening thing. And I believe Atwater when he says  his life has changed.  </P> <P> I don't think you can go through what he is going through and emerge the same  person. Who would want to? Facing the end of life teaches you something about  the life you have led.  </P> <P> It teaches you something about hate and love and the relative value of things.  Since he was 20, Atwater wanted to work in presidential politics. He is 39 now  and I wonder what he is thinking about today. Surely, he still thinks about  politics and about winning seats for Republicans. That is his job.  </P> <P> But I bet he thinks about other things too: about one more day with his  children, one more moment with his wife, one more conversation with friends,  one more opportunity to tell people what they mean to him.  </P> <P> Lee Atwater is fighting his illness in the most active and aggressive way he  can. Nobody who knows him would expect anything less.  </P> <P> And I sincerely hope we start reading once again about what a bug-eyed gnome he  really is.  </P> <P> It'd be a good sign.  </P></p>

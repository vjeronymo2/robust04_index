De Molina said that Guatemala is facing difficult moments so  the austerity policy will continue to increase fiscal revenues  by improving the efficiency of the functioning of the Ministry  of Finance.    President Ramiro De Leon Carpio thanked the outgoing  minister  and deputy ministers for the work done and the cooperation given  to the president during the seven months working for his  administration.    Meanwhile, Richard Aitkenhead made a brief recapitulation of  the evolution of the Guatemalan economy during the time he  served as minister of finance.    Regarding economic stabilization, during the three years  Aitkenhead served as finance minister, the overall government  public debt with the Bank of Guatemala was reduced from over 3  billion quetzals in 1990 to approximately 2 billion quetzals  until January of 1993; while the level of deposits went from 300  million to 900 million quetzals.    Regarding economic growth, Aitkenhead expressed that in the  last three years the economy grew by 4 percent, which means that  during this period the economy grew more than during the 1980's.  Aitkenhead explained that the greater macroeconomic stability  permitted an increase in investment and confidence in the  economic agents, which coupled with the growth in public  investment from 600 million quetzals in 1990 to about 1.5  billion quetzals in 1993 has allowed a new cycle of improvement  to begin in the per capita income of Guatemalans.    Another accomplishment was that, through the Tax  Modernization Program, tax revenues went from 2.360 billion  quetzals in 1990 to 5 billion quetzals in 1993. The new  minister confirmed the appointments of Estuardo Mendez Herbruger  and economist Arnoldo Escobedo, who resigned his post four  months ago, as first and second deputy finance ministers,  respectively.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Guizhou, a mountainous  province in southwest China, which used to suffer from very poor  communications, now has a highway network covering 95 percent of  its townships, a density higher than the national average.    The total length of the highways in the province has reached  32,000 kilometers and there are more than 3,200 highway bridges.  Among the highways are five high-grade ones, including the  Guiyang- Huangguoshu highway. Construction of some other  high-grade highways, such as the Guiyang-Zunyi highway and the  Anshun-Zhijin highway, is well ahead.    There was no highway in Guizhou until 1927, when Zhou  Xicheng, the then governor of Guizhou, bought a "Chevrolet" car.  It was the first automobile to get to the province, and had to  be taken apart, making eight pieces, to be carried by manpower  to the center of Guiyang, capital of the province.    Since the founding of New China in 1949, the central  government has consistently implemented favourable policies to  encourage Guizhou to build highways.    In the past decade, the central government has given large  subsidies for the purpose. Last year alone, a total of 256  million yuan (nearly 30 million U.S. dollars) was invested in  construction of highways in the province.    Under the national development program, Guizhou Province  will  concentrate on building three express highways in the next ten  years.    The first starts from Guizhou's border with Hunan Province  and runs westward to end at the border of Guizhou and Yunnan  Provinces via Kaili, Guiyang and Anshun.    It is a 760-kilometer section of a national arterial  highway,  the Shanghai-Kunming-Wanding highway.    The other two both begin at the border of Guizhou and  Sichuan  Provinces and run southward to enter Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region, respectively via Zunyi, Guiyang and Duyun and via Dafang  and Anlong.    Mo Shiren, vice-governor of Guizhou Province, said that to  speed up construction of highways was an important part of the  province's overall strategy for economic development.    Only by accelerating the development of communications and  transport can the province further exploit its rich mineral  resources and develop its production and processing of farm  produce.    He noted that among all the provinces, municipalities and  autonomous regions in the country, Guizhou is top in top-grade  phosphate deposits and second in the reserves of bauxite. It is  also in the top five in reserves of 25 other minerals.    The province also produces fine-quality apples, walnuts and  peanuts.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: GASOLINE RIP-OFFS ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT  </P> <P> It's surprising how many people suspect their gas station of "watering the  gas." Others suspect that they were cheated because their gas gauge should have  moved further for the amount of gas pumped. Still more drive away from stations  offering discounts for cash with a sum of money that just doesn't seem right.  </P> <P> Could be. Nobody really "waters" gas, but there are other possible abuses,  including falsified octane ratings, short measures of gas, inflated charges.  Inherently complicated, gasoline sales involve multiple pumps, multiple prices,  and arithmetic that requires a calculator. Only later, given receipts and time  to check them, can the consumer catch the fact that his station charged $17.70  for 12.4 gallons of unleaded at $1.399, when the total should have been $17.35,  and $17 (not the correct $16.69) for 12.1 gallons at $1.379.  </P> <P> The tradition of adding .9 to every price adds complication, as does an  unusually large spread between self-serve and full-serve prices (service  shouldn't cost 40 cents a gallon, say insiders), and instant cash discounts.  "The consumer could get ripped off right and left," says Steve Shelton,  executive director of the Southern California Service Station Dealers Assn.,  "but he has the power to police the marketplace."  </P> <P> Not always. The consumer can't really analyze the content of his gas,  particularly the octane rating that distinguishes regular from premium  gasolines. Indeed, a recent report from the General Accounting Office found  octane rating misrepresented in about 9% of gas samples nationwide and in more  than 50% of samples from some states.  </P> <P> Under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act of 1978, the EPA and FTC are  responsible for making sure consumers get accurate information about octane  ratings, but if they ever started testing and enforcing, they stopped some  years ago, says the GAO. It may even be understandable: Mislabeling is less  likely to occur at refineries or bulk terminals, where it's constantly tested,  than at wholesale or retail outlets; enforcement must, therefore, be local.  </P> <P> But local action isn't guaranteed: Only 20 states have their own octane-testing  programs. In California, for example, the state Food and Agriculture  Department's division of measurement standards has gasoline-testing labs in  Sacramento and Anaheim. The bureau picks up samples in response to consumer  complaints, does some random sampling, and every five years, does a statewide  survey of stations.  </P> <P> Local authorities do more regular station inspections, checking everything from  the accuracy of the price signs to the anti-drain valves on nozzles. At that,  they cover large areas. Los Angeles County's Department of Weights and Measures  inspects 3,400 stations and 42,000 "nozzles," with six inspectors. New York  City's Consumer Affairs Department covers all five boroughs, its five  inspectors checking over 14,000 pumps last year at 1,600 gas stations.  </P> <P> It's a myth that sophisticated inspectors can judge octane rating just by the  color of the gas. Those they inspect are also sophisticated: "They get wise to  us and compromise the color," says Bob Kelley, deputy director of enforcement  for New York City's Consumer Affairs Department. But given complaints, or their  own suspicions that "the price isn't right, and the color's off," they take  samples for lab testing.  </P> <P> The measure of gas pumped and the charge are another problem. "People  automatically assume the amounts on the pump are going to be right," says  Joseph Jamora, division chief at Los Angeles County Weights and Measures.  </P> <P> But many pumps are still mechanical, even when the remote console at the  cashier's booth is electronic, and both the measure and the charge have to be  set manually -- every time the price changes. Given the likelihood of manual  error, one pump off out of 12 is considered forgivable, but 3 out of 12 would  be unacceptable.  </P> <P> Inaccuracies in the volume of gas pumped are usually just "sloppy  housekeeping," says Kelley, and 65% of those inaccuracies actually come out in  the consumer's favor. But "when the charges are off," he says, "it's never in  favor of the consumer."  </P> <P> Inspectors generally visit unannounced, but are almost immediately  identifiable: Few consumers pull out 5-gallon calibrated measures and start  drawing off gasoline. California's inspectors take 10 gallons worth to check  the volume measure, then check the accuracy of the charge by multiplying the  unit price by 10 and seeing if the price on the pump agrees with the answer.  </P> <P> The consumer could duplicate some of this routine, protecting himself at least  against overcharges -- one reason, perhaps, that in Kelley's experience,  overcharges are much rarer than octane misrepresentation. But few consumers are  that methodical about their suspicions: They tend to go by the gauge, says  Jamora, complaining that they seemed to get less than they paid for. And those  who are least suspicious -- a station's loyal, regular customers -- probably  have most cause to be: "Smart people only steal from their known customers,"  says Kelley.  </P> <P> Consumers can certainly guard against today's most common cheat -- by all  accounts, a failure to give the promised cash discount. Some pumps register  both cash and credit prices, but most show only credit price, leaving it to an  attendant to calculate and hand back the difference. An inattentive customer  may be handed the wrong change or be told that the stated price is already  discounted, and a very inattentive customer may be told nothing at all.  </P> <P> But the gambit is easily foiled. Consumers (as if they didn't have enough to  watch for) need only ask.  </P></p>

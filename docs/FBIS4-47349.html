The turbines were studied at the department of steam and gas  turbines at the Moscow Energy Institute. A set of programs has  been developed to determine the stress on turbine elements, in  particular, shaft line vibration. The programs also formulate  recommendations for design modification to increase vibration  resistance. Examples are presented. The recommendations have  eliminated the problem of self-exciting vibrations (at low  frequencies) and in some cases have made the turbines more  economical. The lifetime of turbines can be determined. Fatigue  and corrosive fracturing can be evaluated. Figures 9.</p>

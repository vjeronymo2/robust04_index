			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Wrong track on insiders THERE IS a widespread perception, in and out of the financial markets, that Britain's present legislation on insider trading does not work. So much the better, it might be thought, that the government is about to seize the opportunity presented by an EC directive on insider trading to overhaul the earlier domestic legislation. Yet many in the City fear that the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill will fail to deliver a significant improvement on the much criticised status quo. One of the chief shortcomings in the existing law which contributes to a high rate of acquittals in insider dealing cases is that the definition of an insider has been too tightly drawn. Those who have escaped criminal sanctions despite profiting from inside knowledge have often done so because they were at one remove from the company whose shares were traded. Equally problematic has been the difficulty of proving intention; that is, demonstrating that people made their profits knowingly from privileged information. And the Treasury itself has recently been irked by indications that insider dealing was taking place in the gilt-edged market, where the legislation did not operate. On the basis of preliminary drafts of the proposed legislation circulated all too briefly around City institutions in the summer, the government is now seeking to widen the definition of an insider to ensure that those who are not necessarily close to the company are no longer immune from criminal sanction. It will even be illegal, if the present drafts find their way into law, for a broker to encourage people to deal in a company's shares, where they are not given the inside information to which the broker has had access. The proposed legislation also shifts the onus of proof onto the defence to prove that a given transaction was not prompted by inside information. The problem of proving intention would thus disappear. And the Treasury will have its revenge on those who penetrate its defences by introducing the gilt-edged market to the offence of insider dealing. The legislation seems well designed to secure a higher level of convictions in insider dealing trials. The questions concern the risk of overkill and the possibility that the flow of information from companies to the markets will be impeded under a regime that also widens the definition of inside information. The Treasury is anxious that City analysts should not be deterred from diligent investigation. Yet it wants them, perversely, to confine their work to publicly available information. Equally worrying for analysts is a proposal that the definition of inside information should be widened to include data that is not specifically about the company whose shares are being traded. Unpublished industry information, for example, will qualify as inside information. And there are more technical concerns about the impact of legislative detail on underwriting practice. The more fundamental criticism of the draft proposals, however, is that they fail to address the real problem. The reason why there have been a mere 28 insider dealing trials in 11 years is that the process of investigation and detection is not effective. Yet the government is not proposing to remedy the weaknesses of an unduly fragmented investigatory system. Nor is it looking into the appropriateness or otherwise of introducing civil remedies for insider dealing. Nor, again, at the abuse of Chinese walls in the post-Big Bang City. A wider opportunity is undoubtedly going by the board.</p>

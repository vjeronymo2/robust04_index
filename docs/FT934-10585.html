			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: TWA out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection TRANS WORLD Airlines, the US carrier formerly owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US financier, yesterday emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to become a new public company under the same name. Under a plan approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court in August, shareholders' equity has been split between its employees, in return for wage concessions, and its creditors, in return for debt forgiveness. Employees have pledged labour cost savings of Dollars 660m in return for 45 per cent of the company, while creditors have written off Dollars 1bn worth of debts in return for a 55 per cent stake. TWA, which serves 105 cities in the US and 19 cities in Europe and the Middle East, went bankrupt in January 1992 after seven year under Mr Icahn's ownership. Its emergence from Chapter 11 follows a similar rescue from bankruptcy for Continental Airlines in April.</p>

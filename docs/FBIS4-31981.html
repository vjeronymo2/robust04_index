			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- Stressing once more  Bulgaria's position of noninterference in the Yugo-conflict in  any form whatsoever, Georgi Dimitrov, leader of the Bulgarian  delegation to the 27th regular meeting of the Committee of  Senior Officials of the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe in Prague, stated that Bulgaria was the most badly hit  by the embargo on the former Yugoslavia, BTA learned from the  Foreign Ministry spokesman.    Referring to the decisions of the CSCE Council of Foreign  Ministers' meeting in Rome on "continuous control of the  observance of CSCE standards and principles for human rights  improvement and protection of minorities in Yugoslavia (Serbia  and Montenegro)," Mr. Dimitrov praised the results achieved by  the meeting of representatives of the Bulgarian minority in  eastern Serbia and officials of the embassies of the CSCE  participating countries held at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade  in May. The leader of the Bulgarian delegation insisted on  ensuring the conditions which would enable the Bulgarian  minority in Serbia exercise their legitimate rights and freedoms  in full in compliance with the CSCE standards.</p>

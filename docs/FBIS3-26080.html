In a message to President Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said the  treaty, scheduled to be signed on Thursday [3 February] at the  summit between Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze  in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, would destabilize the situation  in the Caucasian region.    Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia form its armed  forces and supply it with military technology, the report said.    The Georgian parliament's deputy speaker Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili said his nation expected "much from Yeltsin's  visit," adding that the visit would mark the beginning of a new  stage in relations between the two countries.    However, Sokrat Dzhindzholia, leader of the secessionist  Abkhazia region of Georgia, Tuesday expressed his opposition to  the Russian- Georgian treaty.    He stressed that such an agreement should be signed only  after the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is completely  settled and the latter's political status determined.    Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its  independence from the central government in July 1992. Since  then, the two sides have been involved in a bloody conflict.    Meanwhile, leaders of South Ossetia, another autonomous  region of Georgia, accused Russia today of "inconsistency" in  its approach to signing the treaty with Georgia.    South Ossetia has had a long-time military conflict with  Georgia since it declared independence from Tbilisi in November  1991.    South Ossetian leaders complained that Georgia still refused  to hold talks with South Ossetia on its political status.    They feared that Georgia would use the treaty with Russia  against South Ossetia and Abkhazia.    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who arrived in  Tbilisi today for preparations for Yeltsin's visit, stressed  that the future of the military and political cooperation  between Russia and Georgia partly depends upon the settlement of  the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA GAMES;  </P> <P> DESPITE PAIN, FATIGUE, WAITE FEELS GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOLD  </P> <P> He had only two days rest after the nationals. He couldn't move his right arm  over his shoulder, and he was just coming off two 200-meter heats.  </P> <P> It sounded as if 24-year-old John Waite of Huntington Beach was making excuses.  But this was after winning the gold medal in the kilometer event at the San  Diego Velodrome during the opening day of the California State Games.  </P> <P> Despite a piercing pain shooting through his right shoulder on the start, Waite  got out to the early lead an maintained it. He won in 1:14.61, nearly two  seconds ahead of San Diego's Arnie Baker (1:16.03). Peter McCurdy, Baker's  teammate at Cyclo West, placed third at 1:16.60.  </P> <P> And about those excuses? Turns out Waite claimed the gold in the same event one  year ago in 1:10.03 -- more than four seconds quicker.  </P> <P> "My start was slower than I would have liked because of my shoulder," Waite  said. "I tried to ignore it and tell myself to go all out for three laps and  let it hurt later, but that first pedal stroke, it felt like my arm was coming  off."  </P> <P> Waite, who builds racing bikes, also qualified first in the 200-meter time  trial and 200-meter quarterfinals, putting him in today's semis.  </P> <P> At the nationals last weekend in Seattle, he placed among the top 12 before he  was knocked out in the 200 meters.  </P> <P> "This is fun because the program itself is a little more relaxed," Waite said.  "It's just that the way they promote the thing is conducive to going fast  because you have a relaxed state of mind."  </P> <P> Members of the Mount Helix Cycling Club swept first through fifth in the junior  omnium for 13-16-year olds. The order of finish: Marc Valencia, Richard Ludiam,  Jeremy Chappell, Tony Cariola and Mark Caporale.  </P> <P> TENNIS  </P> <P> Seth Boen, the No. 1-seeded player in the men's open division, cruised past  opening-round opponent Gary Anderson, 6-1, 6-2. Boen, of La Jolla, was the team  captain for the University of Arizona in 1984 and last year was ranked No. 1 in  the Middle Atlantic region.  </P> <P> In boys' 16s, Brandon Halm, who was voted most-improved at Coronado High School  each of the past two years, defeated Siri Appa, 7-5, 6-3.

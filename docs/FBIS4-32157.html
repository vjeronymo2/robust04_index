			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 17 (CTK) -- A new deputies' bill on  elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate was  officially submitted to the parliament today, CTK has learnt.  The bill was drafted by thirteen deputies from the coalition  Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance  (ODA), and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and from the  Liberal Social Democratic Party (LSNS). The new bill was  submitted two weeks after the Chamber failed to pass on June 2 a  government bill complete with some changes and additions  proposed by deputies.    Elections to the Chamber are to be held in 1996, elections  to  the yet unformed Senate were planned for the autumn, along with  communal elections. But as the law was not passed, the  Senatorial elections will probably be postponed.    The new bill has been drafted on the basis of the original  government bill, but includes almost all the changes and  additions proposed by deputies and approved at the parliamentary  session on June 2. But it does not include the proposal by  Miloslav Vyborny (coalition Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) that the first  Senatorial elections be held in 81 constituencies, but the  following elections in only 27 constituencies formed by merger  of the original 81. The Senators' term is to be six years and  one third of them is to altered every two years.    In discussing the government bill the parliament approved  Vyborny's proposal, which resulted in the bill's rejection  particularly by ODS deputies. The ODS has resolutely insisted  on all Senatorial elections to be held in 81 one-mandate  constituencies for which it has been criticized by both  coalition and opposition parties. They claim that through this  the ODS wants to ensure its dominance of the Senate.    Marek Benda, chairman of the KDS group, told CTK on June 9  that the preparation of a new bill "is an expression of our  effort to pronounce our conviction that the Senate must be  filled and that it is not possible to pretend as if everything  was in order after the failure to pass one law. It is simply  not a correct attitude to say that we will not implement the  Constitution and will start considering how to re-write it."    Since the failure to pass the law, various proposals have  been made to delete the Senate from the Constitution and to  divide its powers between the government, parliament, and  president.</p>

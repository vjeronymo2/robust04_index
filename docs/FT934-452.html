			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Excellent day for exercise - Monday This looks like an excellent day for some exercise, a long game of bridge, a trip to the cinema . . . almost anything rather than watching television. If you simply have to watch the box it may be worth switching on at 3.15 for Movie Crazy, part of Channel 4's Harold Lloyd season. This one is a talkie, said to be Lloyd's best, though his great films were all silent. He plays an aspiring actor who is 'discovered' as a comedian while auditioning as a great lover. BBC2's opera this afternoon, The Queen Of Spades, was recorded at Glyndebourne in July 1992, the last before the old theatre was demolished. Set in St Petersburg at the end of the 18th century, it tells of the love of Herman, a young officer, for Lisa, granddaughter of the old countess, once a gambler known as the Queen Of Spades, who is supposed to know the secret of winning at cards. It is tragic, of course (4.10pm). Channel 4 offers a radical re-telling of the Cinderella story called Prince Cinders. In this 30-minute animated version, the persecuted sibling is a boy, and the bullies are his big hairy brothers. Prince Cinders is small and scruffy and on the night of Princess Lovelypenny's birthday disco is moping about at home with his jeans all messed up by his brothers, when a dirty fairy falls down the chimney . . . well, you get the picture (7pm). Having Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer present the entire evening on BBC2 in the form of an At Home With Vic And Bob (7pm) is one certain way of ensuring that I will not watch. Had these two latterday sub-Goon figures not been involved I would have been tempted to watch the Dad's Army Christmas Sketch, repeated at 7.40 for the first time since 1972; and Mike Leigh's 1976 drama of embarrassment, Nuts In May (9.35).</p>

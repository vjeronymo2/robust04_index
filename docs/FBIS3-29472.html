			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Salim Osman in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto said yesterday he was  pleased with the current state of bilateral relations with  Singapore and suggested that both countries expand their  cooperation in the field of tourism. Because of Singapore's  strategic location and excellent facilities such as its  international airport, he said, the Republic could serve as a  distribution point for tourists going to Indonesia.    He made these points when he received Singapore Foreign  Minister Prof S. Jayakumar, who called on him at the  presidential office, Bina Graha, yesterday.    The Indonesian leader expressed keen interest in getting  Singapore's contribution in promoting tourism.    Prof Jayakumar told THE STRAITS TIMES after the meeting that  "we agreed that this was an area for further cooperation for the  mutual benefit of both countries."    Singapore receives an average of six million visitors a  year,  compared to Indonesia's three million.    Mr Suharto also noted the progress made in the development  of  Bintan, Batam and Karimun in the Riau province, in which  Singapore had a role under the Growth Triangle that includes  Johor.    With such a development, he said, there would be more  opportunities for Singapore investors to invest here.    Prof Jayakumar is in Jakarta for a two-day official visit at  the invitation of his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas, with  whom he had an hour of talks on Monday.    During his meeting with Mr Suharto, they also discussed the  preparation for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum which Indonesia is hosting here in December.    "We noted that both Indonesia and Singapore shared common  interests in the value of APEC and how it would be of benefit to  ASEAN countries," he said.    Mr Suharto, who is currently chairman of the 110-member  Non-Aligned Movement, took over the chairmanship of APEC after  the heads of government gathering in Seattle last November.    APEC comprises the six members of ASEAN, the United States,  Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, China,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico and Papua New Guinea.    On bilateral relations, they noted that there were good  personal ties between leaders and officials.    They agreed to look for ways to strengthen ties between the  new crop of ministers and officials.    Prof Jayakumar, who is also the Law Minister, was  accompanied  by Singapore's Ambassador to Indonesia Edward Lee. He also  called on his counterpart, Utoyo Usman, at his office yesterday.    Summing up his impressions of the visit before flying home  yesterday afternoon, he said: "It has been a very good trip".    His visit is part of the traditional series of courtesy  calls  made by newly-appointed ASEAN foreign ministers on their  counterparts.    Prof Jayakumar, who has already visited Kuala Lumpur and  Bandar Seri Begawan, will be going to Bangkok and Manila as well.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / World of ritual awaits princess CLAD in a beautiful but constraining gold kimono, Ms Masako Owada yesterday hobbled in traditional shoes towards her future as a bride to Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito, heir to the Chrysanthemum throne. Since her engagement became public in January, Ms Owada has been at the centre of a fierce debate over whether she is a symbol of a new era of openness for the imperial family or a career woman who has sacrificed herself to the home. Yesterday's engagement ceremony suggested the career diplomat's future would be ruled by ritual and formality. The imperial household agency, famous for its tight control over royal affairs, also indicated it would stick to tradition by holding next week a ceremony to notify the Owadas of the June 9 wedding date - a fact most Japanese have known for months. Meanwhile, Japanese executives are still waiting for the 'Masako boom' to spur consumer demand and lead the economy out of its downturn. When the engagement was announced, some analysts said a royal wedding could spur an extra Y3,300bn (Pounds 19bn) in retail spending. Their prediction was based on a rise in consumer confidence ahead of the wedding of Akihito, the current emperor, and empress Michiko in 1959, when consumers rushed to buy television sets to watch the wedding and triggered a 'Michi boom' for electronics manufacturers. Today, most Japanese households already own more than two television sets. But while Japanese corporations could be disappointed, many Japanese have been pleasantly surprised by the prince's recent comments vowing to 'protect' Miss Owada. Empress Michiko, who was also a commoner, is known to have been tormented by the antagonism and pressures of the imperial palace.</p>

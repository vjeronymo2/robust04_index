These include a treaty on legal aid, accords on ecological  problems and on the transit of special cargoes through Latvia,  and a trade agreement for 1994. In addition, Vyacheslav Kebich  and Valdis Birkavs signed a document on forming commissions  designed to demarcate the border between the two countries and  ease the rules for its crossing for those who live in the border  areas.    As Prime Minister Kebich said at the news conference given  after the meeting, the document on the transit of special  cargoes through Latvia "is very useful for Belarus," since it  grants Minsk the opportunity to transport through Latvia its  weapons exported to different countries.    According to Kebich, the document also makes it easier to  resolve problems connected with oil imports from the United Arab  Emirates and other countries in the Middle East. "Belarus will  buy the oil which is cheaper," the prime minister stressed. In  his view, Belarus should not get tied to the Friendship oil  pipeline.    Prime Minister Birkavs told the news conference that ethnic  Belarusians living in Latvia will be guaranteed all human  rights, even though dual citizenship will not be introduced in  his country.</p>

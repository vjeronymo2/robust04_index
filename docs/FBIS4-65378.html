			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 16 (CNA)--Cyprus called on Turkey here  Monday [16 May] to withdraw new regulations on the navigation in  the Bosporus Straits which fall under the jurisdiction of the  international law.    In an intervention at the 63rd session of the Maritime  Safety  Committee in London, Adhamos Adhamidhis, minister of  communications and works of Cyprus, emphatically stated "Cyprus  as a major maritime country, fully understands the concerns of  the international maritime community on this issue."    He said Cyprus strongly objected to the Turkish regulations  for passage of vessels through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles  Straits adopted earlier this year.    The minister said the Cypriot objections were based on  reasons of both substance and the way Turkey was trying to  impose these regulations.    "We consider that a lot of these rules do not correspond to  the provisions of the 1936 Montreaux convention on the regime of  the straits, as well as other international instruments such as  the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, existing practice  and customary law," he said.    Adhamidhis added many articles of the Turkish regulations  violated the principle of freedom of transit and navigation in  the straits which was recognised and affirmed in the Monteaux  convention.    He pointed out that if a country, such in the case of  Turkey,  "unilaterally decides to change the existing rules then the  world order, which took the international community so many  efforts and sacrifices to establish, will be confronted with  many perils and multilateralism will suffer a fatal blow."    The minister said Cyprus had a bitter experience from  Turkish  decisions taken according to Turkish law in violation of  international law and practice.    "Further to the illegal and arbitrary embargo on Cyprus  ships  to call on Turkish ports, the recent Turkish behaviour regarding  the collision last March of two Cyprus flag vessels, Nassia and  Shipbroker, in the Bosporus Straits, is indicative of the  dangers of placing such matters at the whim of a single  country," he told the London meeting.    Regarding last March's incident, the minister said the  Cyprus  government in conformity with the obligations under the solas,  loadlines and marpol conventions, immediately approached Turkey  both bilaterally and through the secretary general of IMO  [International Maritime Organization] for permission to  investigate the causes of the accident.    "Regrettably the Turkish authorities refused our legitimate  request for access to the ships and the surviving members of the  crew, some of whom are still in Turkish prisons... in line with  its ulterior motive, the Turkish administration has deliberately  and unreasonably prolonged the closure of the straits, on  account of alleged hazards resulting from the collision of the  two vessels," Adhadmidhis added.    The minister added "Cyprus is of the opinion that if any  rules for the navigation in the straits are to be considered  then the IMO's procedures should be adhered to and the justified  concerns of the states bordering the Black Sea, the landlocked  ones, whose livelihood mainly depends on the sea-borne trade and  those who are among the frequent users of the straits should be  taken into account."    Adhamidhis concluded calling on Turkey "to withdraw their  regulations, which will cause serious damage to the interests of  the international community and set a bad precedent" and  appealing for respect of international treaties and legality and  avoidance of unilateralism.    Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion.  Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's  territory.</p>

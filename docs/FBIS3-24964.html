			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government will this year introduce and implement  land reform legislation. It will also begin the spade work for  the Presidential and National Assembly elections.    This was announced by President Sam Nujoma at a State House  news conference on Wednesday. Many Namibians have complained  about the availability of land and the disproportionate  distribution of available arable land. A Land Conference was  held in Windhoek in 1991, to find solutions to the land hunger.    The President vowed to pursue closer cooperation in conflict  resolution to ensure stability for the common interests of the  region. "Although our country enjoys relative peace and  stability, we cannot be indifferent to the sufferings of  others," President Nujoma told the press conference.    Nujoma reviewed development progress in the past year and  said the government would continue to consolidate and strengthen  the foundations of political, economic and social development.  He declared that education would take priority in his  government until the day he died.    "We have now embarked upon an irreversible path towards  national building, a step that has led to sound investment  opportunity and socio-economic upliftment of our people."  President Nujoma highlighted successes in road infrastructural  development, oil and gas exploration, fisheries and regional  cooperation.    He welcomed the reintegration of Walvis Bay, stating that  the  port town would become a major centre for regional cooperation  and would give great impetus to the growth of the Namibian  economy. At independence, the government initiated the  formidable task of turning Namibia's transport network towards a  much more favourable east-west direction.    Five major road projects have been implemented and some of  the new links are to be completed within the next three years.    On petroleum exploration and production, remarkable progress  has also been achieved. Realising that the petroleum industry  is a hazardous one, the government has established an emergency  plan. It is developing oil and gas regulations regarding  health, safety and the protection of the environment, during  exploration and production activities. Pre-feasibility studies  for Epupa hydro-electric scheme have been completed and the  feasibility study phase is to commence soon.    President Nujoma expressed satisfaction with the growth of  the fishing industry, which he described as the second largest  industrial employer. The President noted that industrialists  had made substantial foreign exchange earnings the past year and  there would be no deterioration in the country's balance of  payments. He said he foresaw greater investment and job  opportunities being created by all these developments.</p>

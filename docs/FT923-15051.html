			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / France's boy-next-door finds himself offside: The publicity is turning sour for Bernard Tapie, the unusually popular businessman and politician For the past few weeks it has been difficult to find a French newspaper or magazine which does not feature the suntanned, smiling face of Mr Bernard Tapie. The smile was Mr Tapie's signature during his rise in the 1980s as one of France's most flamboyant businessmen and politicians. It now seems out of place, given the gloomy nature of the latest round of Tapie news. There was a barrage of publicity last month over his resignation from the French cabinet, and another this week about the problems of Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his ailing business empire. And there will be another stream of stories after a French commercial court today considers the fraud charges brought against him by Mr Georges Tranchant, his former business partner. On any objective analysis it is extraordinary that Mr Tapie should attract so much attention. He styles himself as a successful entrepreneur. But BTF is struggling for survival. He is also presented as a crusading politician. But his political record has been distinguished mainly by the rarity of his appearances at the National Assembly and by the brevity of his seven-week cabinet career. Why then does the chairman of a middle-sized company with a short stint as a junior government minister generate so much publicity? The answer is that Mr Tapie is a populist and populists are rare in French business and politics. 'He is the boy next door who has made it to the top,' says Mr Michel Gonod, political editor of Paris Match, one of France's biggest selling weekly magazines. 'Bernard Tapie is brash. He has a big mouth. He speaks the same language as the blokes in the local bistro.' Mr Tapie, 49, has played his 'boy next door' ticket for all it is worth. He is the son of an engineer who was raised in a small house - no hot water, no inside loo - in the insalubrious Paris suburb of Bourget. He made his fortune in the 1980s as a wheeler-dealer by buying bankrupt businesses and quickly selling them, until in 1990 he bought Adidas, the German sporting goods group. At the time Adidas looked like the coup of Mr Tapie's business career. It may yet prove the death-knell. Mr Tapie bought Adidas for FFr2.2bn (Pounds 223m) funded by short-term loans. He has since had to sell a string of Adidas subsidiaries, a chunk of his own holding and most of BTF's original businesses to pay off the loans. Mr Tapie is about to make the final FFr615m payment for Adidas. But BTF still has its own long-term debt - which stood at FFr3.64bn at the end of last year. It is questionable whether Mr Tapie can afford to hold on to Adidas. Under his ownership it has been racked by industrial disputes and has failed to regain its lost momentum in a competitive market. It reported a fall in profits from DM90m (Pounds 31m) in 1990 to DM44m in 1991. There is no shortage of suitors: BTF is considering three offers for its 55 per cent controlling stake. His political career is also in the doldrums. He entered politics in 1989, standing as an independent but siding with the Socialists. He made his mark at the end of that year by trading insults in a television debate with Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the pugilistic head of the extreme rightwing National Front. This media success sealed Mr Tapie's friendship with the French president and Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, both of whom championed his cabinet appointment. Mr Tapie has now left the cabinet because of the Tranchant court case. The case itself is relatively minor: it is a civil, not a criminal suit. But it gave Mr Tapie's Socialist critics the excuse to squeeze him out. They dislike him for the same reason the people like him - his personal style. Mr Tapie revelled in his fame. He appeared on television crooning with Mr Sacha Distel, the veteran singer. He bragged about his business exploits in a book entitled Gagner] (Winning]). He became chairman of the Olympique Marseille football club in 1986. He posed for the press, a gold medallion gleaming on his chest, beside his Porsche or on his yacht. In short, he behaved as Mr Gonod's 'blokes in the local bistro' would if they were millionaires. Such behaviour is unremarkable in the US or UK, where self-made men are common in corporate and political life. But in France it is difficult for outsiders to get to the top. One reason is the preponderance of family-controlled companies. Many of France's most famous corporations - Michelin, Peugeot, Pernod-Ricard and Club Mediterranee - are in family hands. Another factor is the influence of the state, which not only controls many of the biggest companies but also appoints their chairmen. The appointees tend to have had a classic civil servant's education at the elite grandes ecoles, notably the Ecole Nationale de l'Administration (ENA). Ms Leslie Mitchell de Quillacq, writing in Powerbrokers, her recent book on the French financial elite, found that half of the 124 most powerful people in French finance went to ENA, and two-fifths attended one of three Parisian lycees. The personalities of France's top businessmen reflect their backgrounds. The role models include Mr Michel Albert, chairman of the AGF insurance group, who has published philosophical treatises on the future of French capitalism. Even the handful of self-made men, such as Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group, and Mr Francois Pinault, architect of the Pinault distribution company, conform to type. Mr Arnault likes to stress his interest in classical music. Mr Pinault is fond of quoting his philosopher friend, Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, in interviews. Such traits may help them to make themselves acceptable to the French establishment. But a mainstream magazine like Paris Match is more interested in Mr Tapie's football triumphs, than Mr Albert's ideas on capitalism. Mr Tapie stands out in the political sphere for the same reasons. A string of senior socialists went to ENA, including Mr Laurent Fabius, Ms Elisabeth Guigou and Mr Michel Rocard. Almost all the rest come from the public sector or the professions. Mr Tapie is a rare businessman. 'There is no tradition of mixing business with politics in France,' says Mr Serge Raffy, senior editor of Le Nouvel Observateur, the weekly news magazine. 'Politics is seen as something clean and classical, which should be as remote as possible from the grubby world of business.' The Socialists fall into two camps: the bohemian gauche caviare, led by Mr Jack Lang, the arts minister; and the austere Enarchs, the graduates of the ENA, typified by the cerebral Mr Fabius. 'They are so elitist, all from the same bourgeois background and the grandes ecoles,' says Mr Gonot of Paris Match. 'Mr Tapie does not fit in. That is why the French people like him.' Mr Tapie seems aware of this. A few weeks ago he went to give a speech at Saint Cloud country club on the outskirts of Paris. The club's staff asked him to leave, because he was not a member. He roared with laughter, saying the incident proved that he was not, and probably never would be, a member of any club.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Don't laugh when the penny drops - Tightwad's tips / Even if we have no need to watch the coppers, it's fun. Here's a primer You know me, or someone similar. My Christmas cards last year carried generic 2nd class stamps - the blue ones last sold on October 31 1993. I suspect I have enough, bought at 18p, to get me through next Christmas too. But, you may object, what's the point of saving a penny each time you send a letter? The way I see it, each stamp is a discounted security which, if used 12 months after I bought it, will have given me a 5.5 per cent tax-free return. Yes, I'm a tightwad. Like many FT readers, I can afford not to watch every penny, but I do. Part of it is involuntary - inherited from parents who haven't forgotten the 1930s - but a large part of it is a mixture of fun and sheer cussedness. Why should you pay more for something than you need to? Why not save on small things to justify splashing out on big ones? Watching the pennies is still no substitute for making the pounds in the first place, but the skills honed in scrimping do not go amiss when much larger sums are at stake. Mean, perhaps, but not mean-spirited. We are certainly not talking about asking 'who had the peas?' when paying the restaurant bill. In fact, many of the tightwads I know are also the most generous people around. They get their kicks from making 'victimless' economies, from beating the system rather than being cheap with their friends and family. Here are basic tips for the tightwad: Make the most of 'free' cash. Use it for as long as you can without paying for the privilege. The credit card - used wisely - is your main weapon here. Make purchases with cards at every opportunity, and pay the bill off in full just before the due date. You not only will write fewer cheques, but the account statements give a concise summary of your expenditure. Make the most of your own cash. If it is going to lie idle, even for a short period, make sure it's earning as much as possible. Have your salary paid into a higher-interest account, rather than a current account. Arrange a regular transfer of your foreseeable monthly outgoings just before the largest payment (perhaps the mortgage) is due to be paid. Keep an eye on competing savings rates, but remember that chasing the last penny can backfire. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester depositors who had seen the building society's savings rates slip in league tables might have been tempted to shift their money elsewhere. Those who did would have missed the sweeteners originally proposed under the Lloyds Bank takeover. Don't pay an annual fee for a credit card, unless you can guarantee sufficient volume to make worthwhile the collection of Air Miles (National Westminster Visa) or Profiles (Barclaycard). Certainly, if you're paying an annual fee and not getting a perk like that, apply for a free card now. Every tightwad should have one of the Co-operative Bank's free-for-life Visa cards as the ultimate insurance against having to pay a fee. The downside of the Co-op cards is that they have a considerably shorter period during which you can pay off your bill in full and avoid interest charges. So the tightwad strategy would be to use the Co-op card only often enough to meet the annual requirement, and make other free cards your workhorses. If you have the self-discipline to use credit cards only as a free means of deferring payment, you should go for as many as you can get. This provides a buffer against the creeping introduction of annual fees  - although the entry of transatlantic giants GM and MBNA into the UK market seems to have spiked the clearing banks' confident assertion a few years back that the free card was doomed. Multiple cards are also a protection against an unforeseen adverse change in your financial circumstances. They also, however, allow you to take the tightwad strategy a step further, by using the cards in rotation to gain the greatest advantage of each one's interest-free period. Obviously, once you exceed two or three cards, there are diminishing returns both in terms of money (a postage stamp can wipe out your 'savings', so pay free by bank giro) and the time involved to keep all this straight. Pay attention at the supermarket check-out. You might be surprised how often the price in the scanner's computer does not tally with the one posted on the shelves. In less than two years, I have caught errors on six separate occasions. And, yes, it is worth calling the manager and complaining over pennies. It may not make any financial difference to you, but think of the pensioner who is being similarly ripped off. It is illegal to charge more than the posted price, and trading standards officers are very interested in evidence of this practice, especially when there appears to be a pattern. The satisfaction of 'gotcha' and 'gotcha again' is usually enough for me, but when one local supermarket was fourth time unlucky (and I was getting to know the manager and his team very well indeed), he insisted that I take a Pounds 5 gift voucher. Know your rights. If anyone tries to levy a surcharge for payment by credit card without having that policy clearly posted, as required by law in the UK, inform them that you will be notifying the trading standards officers. The surcharge should evaporate. Stock up on unperishable staples when they are on sale. Share special offers. I don't want these 'free hamburger' coupons, but someone will. The same applies to petrol station tokens, supermarket receipts, newspaper vouchers etc. Be charitable tax-efficiently. Use give-as-you-earn, Gift Aid and covenants. Let the government top up your gift. Remember, above all, not to take penny-pinching too seriously. Your life will almost certainly run out before your money does, so enjoy them both.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Mirror editor to see staff on cuts DAILY Mirror journalists are to hold talks with Mr David Banks, their new editor, shortly on a range of issues, including the sacking of 100 casuals. The agreement to negotiate follows a consultative ballot, in which 101 Daily Mirror journalists voted in favour of industrial action. Although there was a clear majority in favour of action, 69 voted against. A further ballot needs to be held before industrial action is taken. If the National Union of Journalists calls for industrial action it appears it will be for a work to contract instead of a strike. NUJ representatives will meet Mr Banks to negotiate three issues: The reinstatement of casuals who were summarily dismissed. The terms of new a contract drawn up for those who work on the Sunday Mirror and The People. People being moved to different departments without consultation. Mr Trevor Davis, an NUJ official at the Daily Mirror, said last night: 'We hope that something positive will come out of these negotiations.' Apart from re-hiring the sacked casuals, Daily Mirror journalists are concerned about new personal contracts for the Sunday editions. Mr Paul Vickers, assistant managing director and company secretary of TV-am, will become company secretary and group legal director of Mirror Group Newspapers.</p>

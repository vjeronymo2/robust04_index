Cuba's official news agency, PRENSA LATINA, said  vice-president of the air charter company Pedro Manduley  confirmed that the copilot of the plane chose not to return to  Cuba and was detained by the Caribbean island immigration  authorities.    The DC-3, with 11 tourists aboard, flying the Havana-Great  Cayman-Havana route, was bound for the capital during the next  hours, said the Cuban official.    After the incident occurred Tuesday [4 January], the captain  of the aircraft and three crew members called the main offices  of the Aerocaribbean Tuesday night to ask for authorized return  flight.    According to international rules, no aircraft can fly  without  a copilot. As a result, the return was postponed until today  after another copilot was flown in a company plane to Great  Cayman, said Manduley.</p>

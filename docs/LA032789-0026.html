			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SIMPSON BREAKS 4-YEAR SLUMP WITH VICTORY  </P> <P> Tim Simpson, winless for four years, worked out with a putting aid, consulted a  sports psychologist and made the shots that counted Sunday, regaining his  confidence and pocketing the $135,000 winner's check at the USF&amp;G Classic  at New Orleans.  </P> <P> "I'm really, really thrilled," Simpson said. "For the past two years, I've been  struggling with my confidence, wondering if I'd ever win again."  </P> <P> After a round of 70 on Saturday, which left him "so frustrated I could pull my  hair out," he worked Saturday night and Sunday morning with a putting aid  designed by New Orleans club pro Jimmy Self and talked to sports psychologist  Bob Rotella on the telephone.  </P> <P> "He told me to stay focused -- focus all of my attention on the hole and let  nothing bother me. That's what I did, and it worked," Simpson said.  </P> <P> The $750,000 tournament was played over the 7,106-yard, par-72 course at  English Turn. It was the first professional event at the course designed by  Jack Nicklaus.  </P> <P> Simpson shot a three-under-par 69 Sunday and had a tournament total of 274,  14-under par.  </P> <P> It was only the second professional victory for Simpson in a career that began  in 1977. He won the Southern Open in 1985, won $200,748 last year, 56th on the  money list, and had won $84,418 in nine tournaments this year.  </P> <P> Simpson started the final round a stroke behind Greg Norman.  </P> <P> Norman finished two strokes back, tied with Hal Sutton at 276, worth $66,000  each. Norman shot 72 Sunday, and Sutton shot 70.  </P> <P> After 66 holes, Simpson and Norman were tied at 13-under par.  </P> <P> Simpson took the lead for good with an eight-foot birdie putt on No. 13 and  made it a two-stroke lead with a birdie putt on No. 15.  </P> <P> Simpson bogeyed No. 17, but so did Norman.  </P> <P> Norman had a 35-foot putt for an eagle on No. 15, but that rolled three feet  past the hole, and he missed the second putt, too, before tapping in for par.  </P> <P> He missed a nine-foot putt for a birdie on 16, and missed another shot at a  birdie on 17.  </P> <P> Tom Kite failed in his bid for a third straight tournament title, shooting a 73  Sunday.  </P> <P> Allison Finney shot an even-par 73 on a rain-soaked course and took advantage  of Beth Daniel's lone mistake -- a double-bogey on the second hole -- to win  the $400,000 LPGA Turquoise Classic at Phoenix.  </P> <P> It was the first tournament victory in seven years on the tour for Finney,  whose previous best was a second-place tie at the 1985 Mazda Hall of Fame  Championship.  </P> <P> Finney, 30, finished with a 10-under 282 total to take the $60,000 top prize.  </P> <P> Daniel, who started the day one shot ahead of Finney, parred every hole except  the par-3 second, where she four-putted for the double-bogey. She had a  two-over 75 for a 283 total and settled for the $37,000 second-place check.  </P> <P> Defending champion Bob Charles of New Zealand won the $370,000 Fuji Electric  Grand Slam seniors title at Narita, Japan, by four strokes with a  nine-under-par 207.  </P> <P> Charles shot a final-round 69 and won $75,000.  </P> <P> Americans Don January, Charles Coody and Larry Mowry finished in a three-way  tie for second at 211. January had a final-round 69, Coody 68 and Mowry 70.  </P> <P> American Holly Hartley of Oceanside, the L.A city champion in 1976, shot an  even-par 72 to score her first victory in Japan, a one-stroke triumph over  Hiromi Kobayashi, who beat her in a sudden-death playoff two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Hartley finished with a 215, and Kobayashi, with a 74, ended at 216 in the  $308,000 Kibun Classic ladies golf tournament at Higashmatsuyama. The victory  was worth $55,400.  </P></p>

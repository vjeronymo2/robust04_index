			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Finns firm for Maastricht President Mauno Koivisto yesterday said Finland would meet all its obligations under the Maastricht treaty, including possible participation in a common European defence force. In contrast to Denmark's equivocations, including this week's demands for opt-outs on a common currency and defence force, Mr Koivisto said Finns intended to be 'honest members' of the Community. He was speaking at the end of a trip to Brussels to talk about pending negotiations on full EC membership. Finland's economy faces another difficult year in 1993 but competitiveness is improving sharply, according to the Ministry of Finance, Christopher Brown-Humes writes from Stockholm. The ministry yesterday predicted GNP would increase next year by 2 per cent, following a fall of 2 per cent this year. The lower markka has boosted exports, leading to a 10 per cent rise in volumes this year and an expected 13 per cent increase next year. The current account is expected to be in surplus in early 1994. Unemployment isexpected to more than double to 322,000 (nearly 13 per cent of the workforce) this year before peaking at 350,000 in late 1993.</p>

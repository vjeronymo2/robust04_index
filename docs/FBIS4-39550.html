			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who  left Tallinn at lunchtime today, stated at a briefing he gave at  the airport that, if the will is there, 31 August is not at all  an unrealistic deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops.  According to Churkin, a firm basis by way of a firm agreement is  required, however, to (?resolve) issues in such an energetic  manner. According to Churkin, a realistic agreement on Russian  military pensioners must be concluded so as to eliminate  tensions in Estonian-Russian relations.    During his two-day visit to Tallinn the Russian deputy  foreign minister continued talks begun in Geneva with Raul Malk,  the deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, on  Saturday [4 June]. Churkin also met with Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, and President Lennart  Meri.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. expert on data  networking, today described China's "Golden Bridge" project to  build up an information superhighway as a powerful tool for  promoting administrative efficiency, fostering improved  communications and co- ordination between the government,  companies and people of the whole country. Concurrently  chairman of the American Electronics Association's National  Information Infrastructure (NII) task force.    At a seminar on building information superhighway for the  next century, Eric Benhamou, president of the U.S. 3COM  Corporation, delivered a keynote speech to Chinese officials and  engineers drawn from relevant ministries and research institutes.    "A golden bridge that spans both government and private  sector will elevate China to a major economic player on the  world stage," said Benhamou, who is concurrently chairman of the  American Electronics Association's National Information  Infrastructure (NII) task force.    He added that as information increasingly becomes the  currency of international trade, the golden bridge will enable  China to tap into global information flows, further integrating  China into the global economy.    Benhamou believes that by using the golden bridge to provide  database access and facilitating electronic data interchange,  China's society will rapidly enter the information age. It can  also inform and educate by liberating resources and bring  healthcare, scientific, commercial and financial data to the  individual.    He suggested that China should choose the best scheme in  constructing an information project, so as to avert the setbacks  that have been experienced by Western countries. At the same  time, China should rationally balance the rules for  informational market competition -- allow competition while  maintaining macro control.    He revealed that the 3COM Corporation will shortly set up a  representative office in Beijing, in a bid to help develop a  pool of networking expertise in China.</p>

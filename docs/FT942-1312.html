			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: CPC Intl to shed 2,600 jobs in cost cutting plan CPC International, the US-based food company whose brands include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, is to shed 2,600 jobs from its international workforce of 39,000 over the next two years as part of a cost-cutting plan. It said the restructuring would bring a pre-tax charge of Dollars 227m to second-quarter profits, equivalent to Dollars 137m after tax or 92 cents a share. About two-thirds of the charge represented the non-cash costs of writing off assets, including some plant closures, it said. CPC has been increasing efficiency over several years by consolidating production. Past moves have included the closure of six plants in North America and substantial relocation of production within Europe. Yesterday, however, Mr CR Shoemate, chairman and chief executive, said the action already taken was not enough. 'The charge announced today represents a longer-term, more aggressive view. We are taking actions now for competitive advantage in the major world markets at the end of the decade,' he said. A large proportion of the job cuts will fall in Europe, where unification is increasing cross-border competition. CPC is responding by transferring production of its various brands to the plants where they can be produced most efficiently - for example, by moving production of its Knorr products for the Nordic market from Switzerland to the Netherlands. CPC is taking similar action to increase the efficiency of its consumer food businesses in North America. It said it was also taking steps to strengthen its competitive position in its Latin American corn refining business. In the first quarter, volume gains and lower financing costs helped CPC report a 9 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 98.1m on turnover 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.74bn.</p>

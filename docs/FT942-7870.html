			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / US groups face ban by aid banks European countries are threatening to bar US companies from bidding for contracts financed by the multinational development banks in reprisal for the US's repeated failure to honour its funding pledges to these institutions. Mr Rene Legrand, a director representing Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland at the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, warned recently that the countries he represents might seek measures to prevent countries in significant arrears of payments, principally the US, from bidding on ADB projects. 'One might say that bearing the moral burden of one contributor is beginning to exhaust the patience of some of the others,' Mr Legrand said. The US has accumulated a total of Dollars 847m (Pounds 562m) of arrears on money it has promised to the World Bank and the regional development banks, with the Asian Development Bank accounting for a large portion of the total, as Congress has often proved reluctant to fund the promises made by the administration. But at the same time, the US is usually the most vociferous member in calling for management reforms and greater transparency at the multilateral development banks. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has complained repeatedly of the embarrassment of being so far in arrears. 'You know, we go into these meetings and we bang our fists on the desk and insist that we are a major stockholder and we think our policies should be put into effect. But we don't even keep up with the rent. We have a past-due notice on the door,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday. The treasury had proposed an allocation of Dollars 87m in this year's budget towards paying off past arrears, but the House of Representatives appropriations committee has trimmed that to around Dollars 20m. The House also eliminated a promised Dollars 100m contribution to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, through which the International Monetary Fund lends money at subsidised rates to the very poorest countries.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: For dedicated followers of fashion - Television Investors are obviously keen on the prospects for the new television transmission systems: the flotation last week of BSkyB, Britain's leading satellite operation, was over-subscribed. The company (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake) was, until quite recently, losing large sums of money and now has a market value of Pounds 4.4bn. Many people, it seems, have faith in the profitability of satellite systems, even if their share of the business remains relatively small. That confidence rests, presumably, on the realisation that subscription, and eventually pay-per-view, services can make a lot of money at the margins even if satellite and cable operators attract only a minority of the population. So far satellite and cable remain irrelevant to the great majority of British viewers. Most homes continue to have access only to the four terrestrial networks. Between them those four (BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4) conceded only one per cent more of their audience share to the new boys in 1994, slipping from a 94 per cent share to 93 per cent, just as they slipped from 95 to 94 per cent in 1993. Thus all the dozens of satellite and cable channels combined are still managing to win only a seven per cent share of the audience. In terms of programme influence the small size of that fraction could be unimportant if the cable and satellite companies were innovators or setters of benchmarks; Le Gavroche sells far fewer lunches than McDonald's but there seems little doubt about which is gastronomically more interesting. In television, however the opposite is true: the smaller, 'specialist' suppliers, satellite and cable, provide programmes which (leaving aside sport and movies, and considering the material actually made by television) are cheap, derivative, and inferior to what you find on the terrestrial networks, albeit arranged differently. Indeed, vast quantities of satellite time are filled with old programmes bought from the stockpiles of the terrestrials. There is just one exception, one satellite network which wields an influence far greater than its viewing figures in Britain would suggest: the music network, Music Television. MTV has become for the 1990s what the colour supplement was to the 1960s, the setter of trends and arbiter of fashions. If you see something new and bizarre in street culture, pop music, or yoof television, odds are that it turned up first on MTV. Moreover the influence is not merely on teenagers: check any office in the media industries - advertising, facilities houses, independent television companies - where a television is kept on all day and you will find that most are tuned to MTV. It is unlike any other network on television or radio. Other networks strain to ensure that you know when one programme ends and another begins; loud signature tunes call you from the kitchen, expensive credit sequences make urgent visual signals to mark the junctions. At MTV, while there is no lack of expertise in the graphics department (in fact their logos are some of the best anywhere, as good as those of Globo Brazil, world beaters in this category in the 1980s - watching 15 minutes of MTV logos would be more entertaining than most 'entertainment' programmes) no effort is made to highlight the junctions. Most slide by invisibly because MTV consists very largely of pop videos and these long ago became the dominant influence in the world of commercials. The two forms, and their directors, are now so indistinguishable that on MTV it is often difficult to know which you are viewing. So the junctions are imperceptible. Watching Kylie Minogue's 'Confide In Me' it is hard to believe it is not a commercial . . . and in a sense, of course, that is just what it is. All other networks, whatever their specialisation, are now subject to the hegemony of the news; you cannot escape it even on Classic FM or Radio 3, let alone Radio 1. But at MTV 'The News' often contains just three or four items, such as singer George Michael's court case against Sony, the renaissance of the vinyl LP, and Garth Brooks' second album selling 10m. By-election defeats do not darken MTV's horizon. Others talk about the ideal of European unity but MTV got there ages ago: not only do they broadcast right across Europe (MTV Europe being a separate outfit from the American MTV) they casually run commercials in German for their British audience, and the presenters must be the most polyglot anywhere in television. Most speak English with Dutch, German or Scandinavian accents. The way in which they all, male and female, ogle and flirt with the cameras and hence the viewers (not the easiest trick to manage without looking naff in the unromantic confines of a studio, yet the MTV people almost always achieve it) has had a clear, wide, and still growing effect on habits in terrestrial television. Of course much of the content is enough to drive an adult up the wall. Watch at any time of the day or night for more than 25 minutes or so and you will almost certainly be subjected to 'rap', the monotonous, unmelodic, chanting of doggerel by charmless young people in baseball caps, often worn back to front. All stage concerts now seem to look identical, with lighting systems linked via computer to the amplifiers (I assume) so that the lighting endlessly flickers to the beat. Moreover, refreshing though it is to come across some modern monochrome photography on television, the fashion for black and white videos has become over dominant. Most irritating of all is the inability of directors - whether of concert or video - to hold a shot for more than (literally) a split second. The frequent assertion that dislike for this sort of frenetic cutting is merely a reflection of age seems odd: surely young people want to get a proper look at the famous bottoms of their idols, whether Madonna or Prince. There are countervailing strengths and attractions. Screen dancing is now more widespread, expert and exciting than at any time since the great days of Astaire and Kelly, thanks almost entirely to MTV, though admittedly there is also much that is inept. The combination of music and image in pop videos, while it can be pretentious, can also be beautiful and fascinating. This is no small thing in a medium which - amazingly, since it relies so heavily on pictures - is usually so dreadfully inferior to cinema in its use of images. And if you doubt that the English have a particular flair for this odd four-minute form of multi-medium artistry, spend a couple of hours watching MTV and pay particular attention to the occasional French effort. They are either ponderously sexy as in 'Tandem' by Vanessa Paradis, or sub Magic Roundabout as in 'Mangez Moi' by Billy Ze Kick Et Les Gamins En Folie. Many grown ups will feel they have had enough of MTV after only a few minutes, but it holds the attention of children, from the age of about eight upwards, like no other network. And that is the point: watching MTV is nothing like watching BBC1, BBC2, ITV or Channel 4, and there are precious few satellite or cable services which can say the same.</p>

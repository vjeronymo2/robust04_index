			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India confident of near-record tea crop INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, is now confident of harvesting a crop of about 740m kg this year, up from 703.9m in 1992. The country's record crop of 741.7m was achieved in 1991. By the end of September the harvest was already 36.5m kg ahead of last year's first nine months and industry officials say preliminary production reports for October are highly encouraging. In the year to September north Indian production was 424m kg, 18.3m kg ahead of the corresponding period of the previous year, while south India's, aided by congenial weather, was more than 18m kg up at 130.16m kg. The latest figures show that the shift in production emphasis from orthodox to CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea, demand for which is growing both inside and outside the country, is continuing. In the first nine months of the current year CTC production was up nearly 41m kg to 462m kg, but that of orthodox tea was down by more than 4m kg to 88m kg. Production of green tea was maintained at 4.4m kg. By the end of September the government had issued export licences for 116m kg of tea, compared with 107m kg in the same period last year. While exports to the UK were maintained there was a strong revival in demand for Indian tea in Russia. Libya and Egypt also bought more. Poland, however, cut its purchases. Industry officials point out that the current season is witnessing a strong growth in the domestic demand for tea, particularly for the better varieties. This explains the impressive rise in tea prices at the Calcutta auction. The average auction price of Assam CTC leaf so far is Rs52.15 (Pounds 1,11) a kilogram, compared with Rs41.43 a kilogram last year. The average for Assam orthodox leaf is Rs56 a kilogram, up from Rs43.82 in the same period last yea. Darjeeling tea is fetching an average of Rs96.38 a kilogram, compared with Rs83.87 last year.</p>

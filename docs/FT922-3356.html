			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tapie in dispute over disposal price BERNARD Tapie Finances (BTF), the holding company of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman who recently resigned from the French cabinet because of a fraud case, yesterday suffered another blow when a dispute flared up over a disposal. Lugdunum Finance, which has agreed to buy the La Vie Claire chain of health food shops from BTF, is now arguing over the price of the deal. BTP claims that the price was set at FFr110m (Dollars 20.5m), whereas Lugdunum says it was set at just FFr100m. BTF, which last week announced it had fallen from net profits of FFr47.97m in 1990 to a loss of FFr294.9m in 1991, is taking legal action to try to recover the remaining money. La Vie Claire is one of several businesses that BTF is selling to raise capital to cut debts incurred in its acquisition of the Adidas sporting goods group two years ago. BTF, which later this month is to make the final FFr730m payment on its Adidas loans, recently put its Testut-Terraillon weighing machine business on the market. The financial problems of BTF have intensified speculation that Mr Tapie, who resigned as minister of urban affairs after only two months in the post, may be forced to cede control of Adidas.</p>

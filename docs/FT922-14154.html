			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Commerzbank profits soar 75% at two months COMMERZBANK, Germany's third biggest bank after Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, yesterday said that its total operating profits for the first two months of the current year rose by 75 per cent. Group profits excluding trading results - the so-called partial operating profits - rose by 45 per cent in January and February, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, said. For the whole of last year operating profits climbed 33.5 per cent to DM1.83bn (Dollars 1.10bn), the bank announced yesterday. Mr Kohlhaussen acknowledged the rate of growth in January and February in part reflected a relatively poor start to 1991. But compared with two-twelfths of last year's total profits, operating profits still rose by 25 per cent and partial operating profits by 14 per cent, he explained. These figures suggest that there has been little slowdown in the demand for credit which buoyed the profits of all the leading banks last year. Commerzbank said partial operating profits climbed 29.8 per cent to DM1.8bn in 1991. Total business volume rose by 5.1 per cent to DM229bn while interest income rose 22.3 per cent to DM4.20bn. The dividend will remain unchanged at DM10 per share. Commerzbank's profits grew faster last year than those at its two bigger competitors: on Monday Dresdner Bank reported operating profits up 23 per cent to DM2.5bn, while on Thursday last week Deutsche - hit by high costs and provisioning in the final quarter of the year - announced an increase of 16.5 per cent to DM5.97bn. Despite the high profitability, Commerzbank has the weakest balance sheet ratios of the three and will be obliged to hold a rights issue later this year or early next year. Mr Kohlhaussen confirmed that the bank would be making an equity issue but said he would not give any more details until the bank's autumn press conference. The bank last held an equity issue in 1986 when the shares were offered at DM300, higher than the price which was around DM260 per share yesterday. Analysts say it is likely that the bank will wait for its shares to rise above this level before launching at the very minimum a 1-for-10 issue. After the meeting Mr Ulrich Ramm, the bank's chief economist, said that a separate issue of profit-participating certificates was likely this summer. He added that the lively start to the present year was not simply due to an upturn in the bank' own account trading. Without giving details, he said that the bank had also benefited from an improvement in interest income, better interest margins and a lower rate of provisions, as well as better market conditions in the early part of the year. Mr Kohlhaussen disclosed that the bank has taken its stake in DBV Versicherungen, one of Germany's top ten life insurance companies, to 48.3 per cent from just over 25 per cent. This was in order to support the life company's shares which have sunk below the level at which they were sold when Commerzbank brought the company to the stock-market in 1990. Mr Kohlhaussen said it planned to reduce its stake - acquired at the cost of several hundred million D-Mark - when possible.</p>

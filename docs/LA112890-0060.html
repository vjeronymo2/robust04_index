			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL TO PAY $280,000 FINE IN TOXIC WASTE CASE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: A COMPANY OFFICIAL SAYS THE PAYMENT IS 'JUST TO SETTLE THE THING AND  PUT IT BEHIND US.' STATE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS AT SANTA SUSANA AND CANOGA PARK  SITES.  </P> <P> Rockwell International has agreed to pay a $280,000 fine to settle a state  lawsuit alleging hazardous waste violations at the firm's Santa Susana Field  Laboratory west of Chatsworth and its main Canoga Park plant, according to  documents filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> The agreement was filed simultaneously with a 31-page complaint in which the  attorney general's office, on behalf of the California Department of Health  Services, accused Rockwell of 27 violations of state and federal hazardous  waste rules at the two sites. The sites are operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne  division.  </P> <P> Each violation, if proven in a trial, could have brought a penalty of up to  $25,000.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Ken Alex characterized the $280,000 settlement as "a  significant and substantial fine," but said it was "not in the top 10 of fines"  meted out by the state for hazardous waste violations.  </P> <P> "The conduct that was alleged and found . . . was also not in the top 10," Alex  said, adding that Rockwell had been guilty of "serious but not extreme  violations."  </P> <P> In agreeing to the settlement, Rockwell did not admit guilt and said in a  prepared statement that "a number of allegations in the complaint were without  legal merit."  </P> <P> "None of the counts constituted any type of danger whatsoever to employees or  the neighboring communities," said Jennifer Crone, manager of water and waste  programs for Rocketdyne. "We're settling with the department, without guilt,  just to settle the thing and put it behind us," she said.  </P> <P> However, the agreement allows state officials to treat any future violations by  Rockwell as repeat offenses for the purpose of assessing penalties.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was long expected. It was based on the results of a series of  inspections conducted between June, 1989, and January, 1990. Some of the  findings were publicized previously.  </P> <P> Most of the charges did not involve waste releases but rather Rockwell's  failure to obtain state permits for various waste storage, treatment and  disposal operations.  </P> <P> Alex said these were "serious violations" because "the permit is how the  department controls the hazardous waste world, in essence." He said  nonpermissible waste operations are difficult for the state to "control . . .  because they don't know of their existence."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Alex said he did not believe any of the violations posed a direct  risk to public health.  </P> <P> The Santa Susana lab, which occupies 2,668 acres of a rugged plateau in the  Simi Hills southeast of Simi Valley, has been embroiled in controversy over the  shutdown and cleanup of former nuclear operations there. However, most of the  property is devoted to rocket testing for the government, and the lawsuit  addressed the management of chemical rather than radioactive waste.  </P> <P> Among other things, the complaint accused Rockwell of failing to meet deadlines  at Santa Susana for closing former hazardous waste ponds; burning explosive  waste without a permit; contaminating soil, which constituted improper  disposal; failing to promptly report discovery of contaminated soil; and  failing to provide the state with manifests for off-site shipments of hazardous  wastes.  </P> <P> At the Canoga Park plant at 6633 Canoga Ave., where Rockwell manufactures  rocket engines, the company was accused of storing drums of hazardous waste for  more than 90 days without a permit; failing to label several hazardous waste  tanks; not maintaining adequate aisle space in the hazardous waste area; and  improperly managing toxic beryllium-contaminated air filters.  </P></p>

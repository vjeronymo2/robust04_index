			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Rodier to take helm at Pechiney Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, a 47-year-old board member of the Franco-Belgian Union Miniere, is likely next week to become president of Pechiney, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group. Mr Rodier, named to the board of Pechiney by decree on Saturday, is expected to be endorsed at next week's cabinet meeting as the group's president. He will replace Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's long-serving president who has resigned in a bid to become the head of the Patronat employers federation later this year. The government chose Mr Rodier over several more senior candidates, because of his experience, with Union Miniere since 1991 and before that with Metaleurop, in the volatile non-ferrous metals industry. His main challenge will be to prepare for the privatisation of Pechiney, which last year lost FFr980m (Dollars 180m) on falling sales but hopes to break even this year with the recent firming in the world price of aluminium, which had been hit by cheap Russian supplies. The government's political dilemma with Pechiney, which is on the list of 21 state-owned companies for sale, is that if the group were to abandon aluminium in favour of concentrating on its more profitable packaging activities, its centre of gravity would shift to the US, where in 1989 it bought American National Can. The government has also been considering giving Pechiney a steady source of cash by letting it take over Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, which manages a series of hydro-electric dams on the Rhone. But this plan has run into opposition from local politicians and from Electricite de France, France's monopoly distributor of electricity, and would require fresh legislation.</p>

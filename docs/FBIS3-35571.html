Yesterday morning, the secure sanctity of Prophet Abraham in  the town of Hebron, near Beit al-Moqadas, went through a tragic  and shocking incident in which hundreds of Muslim worshippers,  while in prostration, were massacred.    The catastrophe was caused by armed Zionists.    These Zionist assailants continued to fire at the  worshippers  for a full ten minutes without any break. However, there was  not shown any reaction by the armed Israeli troops who were  stationed around the mosque.    Every minutes 900 bullets were sprayed at the worshippers'  lines, and the Zionist attackers even had enough time to reload  their machineguns.    The army of the Zionist regime only at the end of this  heinous crime entered the scene. The troops took away the  martyrs and put them in a mass grave. They also prevented blood  donations to the wounded Palestinians who were transferred to a  local hospital. Also by firing at the gathering of the  Palestinians the military men killed and wounded scores of them.    The point noteworthy in this tragic incident relates to the  statement of the Zionist regime's prime minister, in which he  declared that the Zionist assailant who led the group of  attackers was mad. In this way, the rulers in Israel, despite  having planned such a plot, have once again attributed the  entire catastrophe to someone else without taking responsibility  for its negative impacts.    But the fact is that the mosque of prophet Abraham was under  the siege and strict control of hundreds of Israeli military men  [as heard]. Moreover, for months now the town of Hebron has  been besieged by the Zionist troops. How then can it be  imagined that, in the absence of any coordination with the  Israeli Army, and while tough control was in force, several  attackers could manage to massacre hundreds of people and drench  the mosque compound with blood?    Of course this is not for the first time that such a major  catastrophe has been committed by the Zionists in the occupied  Palestine. The lives of hundreds, rather thousands, of  defenseless human beings constantly fall victim to the sinister  designs of the Zionist occupiers. However, in the end, by  attributing such a major tragedy to a crazy individual, the  Zionist regime is relieved of all responsibility in this regard.    Arson in the sacred Al-Aqsa mosque was attributed to a crazy  man and also crushing of a number of Palestinians under the  wheels of an Israeli truck was alluded to a madman in a bid to  cover up such crimes. But while under international law and the  provision set by the international community as well as the  Fourth Geneva Convention, an occupier has full responsibility  for controlling the regions under its control, the occupiers  alone are answerable to any sort of insecurity in such regions.  Hence any divestment of the Zionist regime's responsibility is  unacceptable in legal terms. Moreover, what occurred yesterday,  killing hundreds of fasting worshippers, in itself is the  outcome of the Zionist regime's criminal acts.    In fact, arming of the Zionist residents in various  settlements and imparting military training to them are governed  by a policy which is being implemented by the occupier army of  Israel itself. It is a usual policy which was supplying the  Jewish settlers with weapons so as to kill the Palestinians in  the event of any move, even a doubtful one, does not allow the  Palestinians to defend themselves and to obtain weapons for this  purpose.    The world people now pose this question: If the  international  community, through its silence and by issuing ceremonial  resolutions, had not bypassed the tragedy of Palestine and if  the United States, through its political, economic and military  aids to and its covert and overt support for Israel, had not  left it free to commit such crimes, would the oppressed nation  have still become the victim of the Zionists' racist designs?</p>

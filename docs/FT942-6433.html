			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Big shake-up of Europe's labour market urged: Franco-German study urges free trade and flexible working to cut unemployment Europe should reduce labour market regulation, link pay to productivity and lower barriers to cheap imports in order to increase competitiveness and cut chronic unemployment, a Franco-German study recommends. A summary of the study, prepared for the German and French governments in the run-up to their year-long 'co-ordinated' presidency of the European Union, was released yesterday and coincided with the first day of a two-day Franco-German summit in the French border town of Mulhouse. The report was issued by the economics ministry in Bonn and was welcomed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, as showing a high degree of agreement between Germany and France on structural reform. He described it as 'a major contribution to joint initiatives to solving employment problems in Europe during the forthcoming German and French presidencies of the EU'. However, Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economics minister, appeared to distance himself from the report, saying it was provisional and did not commit his government. Germany takes the EU presidency in July for six months and will be followed by France, prompting the two countries to co-ordinate their agendas over the next year. Though commissioned by both governments at their Beaune summit a year ago, the joint study was headed on the German side by Professor Johann Eekoff, number two to Mr Rexrodt at the Bonn economics ministry, and, on the French side by Mr Roger Fauroux, a former industry minister in the socialist govern-ment. In a separate communique, Mr Alphandery and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, hailed the prospect of low inflation and rising growth rates in their two countries, and called for measures favouring more flexibility in the labour market. The report says the two countries have different employment weaknesses. Germany's drawbacks are said to include high wage costs, short working hours and products often too complex for customers' needs. French companies suffer from a heavy social security burden and invest too little in research. However, the study says both countries suffer from 'far-reaching labour market regulation, insufficient training and retraining . . . and lack of wage differentiation'. It recommends: Reducing regulation, 'above all in services, and promoting new companies and technologies, instead of subsidising outdated structures'. Basing wages policy on productivity, introducing more flexible working hours and 'reviewing rules governing dismissals'. Regarding cheap imports from east Europe as a potential benefit, rather than a threat, because they 'lower production costs' for west European industry. While most of the report's conclusions would seem more painful for France than Germany, the study would not be without consequence for Germany which, it is noted, has even more inflexible working hour rules than France.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth of five installments of article by Alexandru I. </F> Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"]    [Text] Owing to the fallacious economic-financial policy  conducted over the past four years, currently, and in the near  future, the leu is under the pressure of a mass of over 10  trillion lei. This inflationist mass has been caused by the  1993 budget deficit which exceeded 800 billion lei to which the  budget deficit of 1994 may be added, programmed to rise to  almost 1.9 trillion lei. The same kind of inflationist money is  represented by the over 350 billion lei's worth of nonperforming  loans granted over 1990 that was transferred to the public debt.  That was another antireform measure intended to further  weakened the leu in an attempt to continue to protect the  state-owned economic sector.    The leu is also under the pressure of the major part of the  4  trillion lei worth of loans which have been granted to  state-owned companies. These companies have their hands full  trying to buy raw materials and pay for the energy, fuel,  salaries, and so on, while the money they earn by selling their  products is totally insufficient to pay back the loans. Aside  from this, a part of those loans was and still is used to  manufacture goods that are sold at a loss or remain unsold, on  stocks. This is a genuine cemetery of loans that paralyzes  economic activity, because the banks are unable to regain and  reuse that money. The recommendation recently made in Bucharest  by the head of the IMF delegation to reroute a part of the loans  currently held by the state-owned sector to private companies  may be followed only if a significant number of state-owned  companies are closed, an inconceivable thing for the executive.    Another thing that is exerting pressure upon the leu is the  continuation of the production for stocks, which is proved by  the fact that over the first four months of 1994 the stocks of  unsold goods have increased by 10 percent.    Arrears (unpaid investments and debts among companies) worth  about 2.8 trillion lei may be added to all this as buried money  that has been taken out of the monetary circuit, which is a  direct source of inflation. The salaries paid by state-owned  companies, which lack the necessary financial resources to do  so, also belong to the category of inflationist money.  Furthermore, pressure is being exerted upon the leu also by the  hard currency amount of about $800 million currently existing  throughout the country (for which lei were spent) and which is  hoarded up in the country or abroad by the companies that fear  that the leu will further devaluate or that their money would be  confiscated. A total mass of 10 trillion lei is thus putting  the fragile leu under a tremendous pressure. As a matter of  fact, the inflation rate of almost 230 percent registered in  1993, which was 4 to 5 times higher than expected, fully attests  the inflationist monetary mass currently existing in the country.    Parallel to all the aforementioned direct and immediate  factors, our national currency is submitted to a latent and  long-time erosion by the fact that poor quality products at  exaggerated prices are still being produced (shoes, clothes,  cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, soft drinks, radio  and color television sets, and so on) that are surpassed by  similar foreign-made products. The same goes for the extremely  expensive and totally unsatisfactory quality of the services. A  special pressure is exerted upon the leu by the high costs of  energy, heating, telephone, and so on, which, together with the  high food prices, exhaust the incomes of the large majority of  the population and prevents it from buying non-edible products.    A similarly great pressure is exerted upon the leu by the  avalanche of taxes, fees, the taxing of taxes, interests,  commercial taxes, and so on, which artificially increase the  price of products and services, at the same time also hindering  economic activity. The accentuation of the polarization of money  and assets, as a consequence of the economic blockage, turns a  great number of workers, public servants, pensioners, and so on,  into an immense mass of non-consumers of non-edible products.    The leu is also under the pressure exerted by the tremendous  financial effort made to reimburse the due installments and the  interests for the loans taken from abroad. The fact that the  Romanian National Bank has been buying dollars for that purpose  has a double inflationist effect, first because it is paying  over 1,600 lei for $1, and second because thus it deprives the  companies of the hard currency assets they would need for  imports so that they can produce for export.    Such being the objective terms of our current  economic-financial situation, the optimistic assessments made on  the occasion of the signing of the accord with the IMF with  respect to the efficiency of the measures intended to achieve  economic restructuring and the boosting of privatization,  including the measures to improve the tax and the banking  system, lack any real basis. Our industrial potential, which  has not been re-equipped over the past 20 years and which was  further destroyed and submitted to decay over the past four  years, cannot be mended within a few months. Promises made  regarding the recovery of economy and the increase of our  standard of living over the second half of 1994 lack any grounds.    In 1994 the Romanian economy needs about $7-8 billion for  the import of the absolutely necessary quantities of energy,  fuel, raw materials, equipment, and staple foodstuffs, as well  as for the reimbursement of foreign loans and the payment of the  interest. The Romanian economy is unable to produce that much.  One feels powerless and bitter thinking that countries such as  Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, South Korea, and so on,  achieve exports worth $7-8 billion within only a few weeks!  Whereas we are running about asking to be lent a few hundred  million dollars, which momentarily eases our situation, but, in  the long run, will be a new burden. In this context it seems at  least strange the way in which the executive appreciates the new  foreign loans we have been granted, while actually that money  will make the situation even more difficult because our foreign  debt will increase by about $1 billion.    On the other hand, we will be unable to comply with the  objective criteria imposed by the IMF and the World Bank, namely  the growth of the gross industrial product, the freezing of the  state budget deficit at the established level, the observation  of the established inflation rate limit and that of the total  amount of money handed out as loans, the substantial reduction  of arrears, and the diminishing of the deficit of the foreign  trade balance of payments by making exports supersede imports  and not by taking further foreign loans, as is being currently  done.    The fact that we become indebted and have to pay hundreds of  millions of dollars in order to partially better the balance of  foreign payments, that is, to refund other debts and to  consolidate the hard currency reserves of the country, is  actually a failure, rather than a success.    After almost four years of great phrases about economic  reform, today, everyone realizes that all these things cannot be  achieved unless large-size state industry is privatized and  unless foreign capital is attracted to re-equip our economy and  make large-scale investments. The re-equipment of the industry  alone would cost more than $20 billion. This requires a radical  change in the current conceptions and legislation. Because no  one wants to buy the assets held by the large state companies,  which currently are assessed to be worth over 20 trillion lei, a  value that with each new appraisal will continue to grow on  paper, but not in reality. Besides this, great Western  companies will never invest in Romania under the circumstances  of the aggressive devaluation of the leu and the current  regulations guaranteeing the security of the investment, land  property, the recuperation of the investments in hard currency,  and the duration of the recuperation.    However, the current authorities (the parliament, the  presidency, and the executive) finds such radical changes  inconceivable. Those authorities are also doing everything they  can to block private initiative and property and to maintain and  strengthen state property and the involvement of the state in  the economy. That is why reform is not progressing at all, as  the current authorities are unable to implement privatization  and to achieve the restructuring of the economy, which are key  elements of the reform. The [IMF] memorandum will appear in  front of our eyes more like a mirage, because each day we are  getting farther away from it, despite all the optimistic  statements made by the executive.    The principal obstacle hindering the recovery of our economy  is the lack of capital, and this problem will persist, because  as long as there are no other cheap resources available, and  depositors are paid 100-percent interest, our commercial banks  will be unable to cut down the interest rates of the loans they  grant, unless they are prepared to run the risk of losing their  capital. Prices will continue to grow, inflation will increase,  and the leu will not recover. Over the future months, they will  partially or totally close down a great number of industrial  units, as it will become impossible to provide them with energy,  fuel, raw materials, and so on, because neither further  subsidies from the state budget, nor further bank loans will be  available for them. Even the companies that still have money  and raw materials will be unable to sell their products for want  of purchasers. The number of the unemployed will grow and the  amount handed out to them as allowances will become merely  symbolic. Owing to the lack of capital and clients and  suffocated by high taxes, fees, and interest rates, numerous  privately owned companies will cease activity.    All layers of the population will be affected, both the  employees working in the state or private sectors and the ones  working in the state administration, education, health, culture,  and so on. Owing to lack of resources, it will become  impossible to merely partially index salaries and pensions, as  used to be done until now.    The year of 1994 will doubtlessly be the most difficult one  of the transition period, with large-scale social convulsions  caused by the accentuation of the economic crisis and general  pauperization. All this will happen regardless of who holds  power, as there are no short-term solutions to make the national  economy and currency recover. The blocking of the reform costs  and will continue to cost a great deal.</p>

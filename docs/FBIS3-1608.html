Speaking at a national conference on poverty reduction,  State  Councillor Chen Junsheng said that the ambitious seven-year plan  includes raising the annual net income of the majority of the 80  million people to 500 yuan according to 1990 constant prices.    According to the plan, China will begin from this year to  improve infrastructural construction in poor areas, solving  drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic  animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and  connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks.    As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural,  educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas,  wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population,  offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural  population growth rate under the official limit.    "The realization of the plan will be of great significance.  It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population,  will have been secured," said the state councillor, who is in  charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction  efforts.    Chen described it as a major event in the history of China  and a magnificent feat in the history of human development.    Most of the 80 million people are distributed throughout  remote mountainous regions, rocky regions, Loess Plateau areas  and remote deserts. The regions are characterized by a paucity  of natural resources and adverse natural environment, such as  severe shortages in drinking water or cultivable land, which  make it difficult for local people to produce enough food.    Chen said that in order to achieve the poverty reduction  target, China should reduce the poverty-stricken population by  an average 11 million each year in the coming seven years,  nearly twice as quickly as it has done in the past seven years.    During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about  45  million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year.    He stressed that the present poverty reduction tasks are  more  arduous than ever before, but are achievable, since the current  conditions are favorable for poverty alleviation.    The Chinese leadership has attached great importance to  poverty reduction, a guarantee of success in the poverty  elimination cause, he noted.    He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor  areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for  poverty elimination.    The Chinese Government has decided to increase its  investment  in the "work for food program" by five billion yuan and in  discount loans by one billion yuan each year during 1994-2000.    In addition, the current reforms in China, including the  effort to establish a socialist market economy, have provided  the poor regions with unprecedented chances for economic  development, the official said.    Because of the open policy, many remote, backward inland or  border regions, which used to be sealed off from the outside  world, have taken forward positions in China's opening drive and  opened important trading ports with neighboring countries.    The opening drive has promoted economic and trade  development  in the poor areas and uplifted the living standards of the  people.    The booming national economy has also created enormous jobs  for the poor regions, which are rich in labor resources.    Last year, the expanding labor market in and outside of  China  absorbed about 10 million laborers from sichuan, China's most  populous province, which earned about 10 billion yuan, Chen told  the meeting.    Thanks to the reform of commodity circulation systems and  gradual lifting of controls over prices, the poor areas will  earn much more through exploiting their rich natural resources  than before.    According to statistics from the State Planning Commission,  China has used about 30 billion yuan worth of industrial goods  and food to finance development programs in poor regions since  it launched "the work for food program" a decade ago.    During each year of the past decade, the Chinese Government  itself allocated five billion yuan to poor regions in aid or  soft loans.    China's poor have decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80  million in 1992.</p>

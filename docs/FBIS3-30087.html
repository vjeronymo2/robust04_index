Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign  affairs and national security, said President Kim meant to say  he could promote a summit meeting if a summit is determined to  be helpful to the resolution of nuclear and other inter-Korean  issues. "We therefore expect that if and when the exchange of  special envoys are realized, they would have talks so that the  nuclear and other pending questions could be successfully taken  up at a summit meeting," Chong said.    Another senior Chongwadae official said chances for the  realization of a summit would depend on overall conditions such  as the progress of U.S.-North Korea talks and the exchange of  special envoys between the two sides of Korea. He stressed that  President Kim's proposal for a summit does not run logically  counter to the government's policy toward North Korea. "A  summit was proposed with emphasis on the resolution of the  nuclear question. But, once a summit meeting takes place, it  could discuss overall issues pending between the two sides," he  said.</p>

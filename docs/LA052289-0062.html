			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three West German relief workers left Lebanon, five days after two of their  colleagues were kidnaped. Witnesses said the three, from the ASME-Humanitas  agency that helps Palestinian refugees, left the southern port of Sidon by  launch to board a ship sailing for Cyprus. Markus Quint, one of the three, was  kidnaped May 4 and held for 10 days before being freed. Palestinian sources  said the two West Germans still being held, Heinrich Struebig and Thomas  Kempner, could be used as bargaining chips in a bid to gain the release of  Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese sentenced to a life term in Frankfurt for  murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a U.S. airliner.  </P></p>

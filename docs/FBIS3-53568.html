These results are the focus of great attention, amid  positive expectations. Arab and international circles have  described the results as a basic and important juncture in the  Middle East peace process. These circles note that President  al-Asad has gained support for the Arab position by insisting on  the peace of the brave, implementation of the resolutions of  international legitimacy, and achieving Israeli withdrawal from  the south and western al-Biqa'. Positive reactions to the  results of the Geneva summit are continuing.    Deputy Amin al-Hafiz [chairman of parliament's Foreign  Affairs Committee] said that the results of this summit indicate  that the time of separate agreements has ended. The attention  given to the Lebanese situation at the summit talks is very  important. President Clinton's statement that the United States  supports the implementation of the al-Ta'if agreement, which  gives priority to Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon through the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, is of  particular importance. Al- Hafiz affirmed that President  al-Asad had expressed the Arabs' good intentions, and the ball  is now in the Israeli court. Al-Hafiz also drew attention to  the role the Vatican can play in support of Lebanese rights.    Deputy Wajih al-Ba'rini maintained that the Syrian-U.S.  summit represents the start of a new era of peace based on  justice and equality, the restoration of the rights of oppressed  peoples led by the Palestinian people, and the implementation of  the UN resolutions pertaining to countries whose land is under  occupation, including Lebanon and Syria. Al-Ba'rini added that  the principled positions adopted by President al-Asad are a  source of pride for our Arab nation. We hope that the results  of this summit will benefit the peoples of the area and mark the  end of conflicts in the Middle East.</p>

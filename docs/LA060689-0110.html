			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAILING;  </P> <P> GRINCH-LIKE GLIMPSE SEES SLOW RETAILERS' CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> With just 201 shopping days left till Christmas, a retailing economist Monday  hazarded a somewhat gloomy guess about what the holiday shopping season holds  in store for merchants.  </P> <P> "The fourth quarter will be tough," Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the  National Retail Merchants Assn., said at the opening session of the trade  group's midyear conference at the Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.  "I'm skeptical that holiday sales will pick up much momentum."  </P> <P> Lackluster sales would prove troublesome for retailers, she said, if they  expect a repeat of last year's performance, when they scored an unexpectedly  high 8% sales gain over Christmas, 1987. If they buy too much merchandise in  anticipation of a spending boom, she said, they could get stuck with leftovers.  </P> <P> That, however, would please bargain hunters by increasing the chance that  stores will offer early markdowns.  </P> <P> Wells predicted sales growth of only 5% for the fourth quarter, partly because  of a slowing economy and partly because merchants' results will be compared to  last year's surprisingly robust results.  </P> <P> The opening session of the conference attracted only about 70 people. By  contrast, at the NRMA's biggest conference, held each January in New York,  hundreds of delegates crowd into a huge ballroom at the Hilton to hear  economists' predictions.  </P></p>

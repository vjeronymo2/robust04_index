			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Tokyo acts to halt rise in illegal Iranian immigrants JAPAN has moved to stem illegal immigration by agreeing with Iran to suspend a bilateral visa-exemption treaty that has been operating since 1974. Under the treaty, Iranian tourists were permitted to visit Japan without a visa. However, an increasing number of Iranians have been entering Japan as tourists and staying in the country illegally to work. Demand for foreign labour in Japan is high in the service and construction industries. The foreign ministry said that Iranians entering Japan had nearly trebled from 1989 to 1991, with 44,376 Iranians entering the country in the first 11 months of the year. At the same time, Japanese immigration officials were refusing entry to an increasing number of Iranians who arrived in the country. This came to 6,631 in the first 11 months of 1991, compared to 1,571 in all of 1990. In December, Iran refused entry to Japanese in Tehran in retaliation for Japan's deportation of illegal Iranian workers. The visa-exemption treaty is a relic of Japan's attempts to promote close relations with the oil exporting nations of the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry said yesterday, however, that the agreement to suspend the treaty would not affect other aspects of the bilateral relationship.</p>

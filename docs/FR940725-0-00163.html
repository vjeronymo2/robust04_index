			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) agreed, and noted that,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NFPA strongly supports the inclusion of a requirement that in addition to atmospheric tests the shipyard competent person should also be required to conduct a physical examination of the spaces and associated pipelines. NFPA 306, 2&hyph;1 requires the Marine Chemist to conduct a physical inspection and to conduct tests within the spaces. For high flash point, low vapor pressure products such as diesel, a test for flammable or combustible vapors is not sufficient, since at atmospheric temperatures there are not enough vapors being evolved for the combustible gas indicator to detect. It is essential that physical inspections be conducted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6&hyph;12) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the follow-up check is to ensure conditions have not deteriorated. The requirement [for a physical inspection] is endorsed for hot work rechecks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because it is important for a Marine Chemist to make such examinations, it is even more important that the competent person also conducts such examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By making a physical examination of the confined space the competent person understands the tank conditions better, and it helps to stress the importance of looking for other potential problems in a confined space. For example, paraffinic residues on bulkheads are sometimes partially cleaned in areas where minor welding jobs will be done on the opposite side of the bulkhead (in the adjacent space). Welders are unable to determine if they are welding outside the cleaned area, but the competent person would have the opportunity to detect a problem.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Marine Chemist Association (Ex. 6&hyph;34) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The shipyard competent person should definitely conduct physical examinations of the interior of tanks and pipelines. Instrumentation used to test the atmosphere of these structures do not always reveal the presence of flammable or combustible materials. If these persons are required to maintain safe conditions in enclosed and confined spaced they must evaluate conditions other than atmosphere.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Northwest Marine Chemist (Ex. 6&hyph;18) asserted that,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> There is no way to properly determine the condition of a space without physically entering.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Independent Testing and Consulting, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;24) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank (provided it is safe to enter) and make any necessary tests of piping provided that the piping has been approved for hot work on the Marine Chemists certificate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chemical Engineering Service, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;25A) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The original intent for the position of shipyard competent person was to detect conditions where, for some reason, there was a decrease in oxygen or an accumulation of combustible gas. Left undetected, these situations could develop into acute hazards for shipyard personnel. While these conditions are relatively rare, their occurrence could easily lead to catastrophic loss of life and property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A much more chronic problem is fire hazards in the shipyard resulting from the introduction of flammable or combustible material subsequent to the initial internal inspection for hot work. This could be the result of leaking piping, accidental or intentional contamination, or gradual buildup of trash and other combustible materials. With the exception of liquids with a reasonably high vapor pressure, these fairly common conditions can only be detected with an internal inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If it is the intent of OSHA to utilize the shipyard competent person to control fire hazards in addition to atmospheric hazards, internal inspection of all spaces must be required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Atlantic Environmental &amp; Marine Services (Ex. 6&hyph;27) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* Shipyard Competent Persons should be required to conduct an on-site survey of tanks and pipelines when making follow up inspections.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6&hyph;31) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Yes, the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. The current foundation of the NAVSEA Technical Manual lists a requirement in Section 23.4 of reference (c) for conducting a physical examination of the tank and pipelines upon reinspection. The condition for entry must be defined, such as, use of ventilation, PPE, non-sparking tools, and whether there is to be continuous or periodic testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pacific Marine Testing (Ex. 6&hyph;33) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The shipyard competent person, when trained properly by a sanctioned training such as the one developed and presented by NFPA and its supporters, is taught to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. A determination of a safe condition can be made only when the shipyard competent person has conducted a physical examination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 6&hyph;3, pg. 3) and the Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6&hyph;6, pg. 4) urged OSHA to allow a qualified person to decide whether a physical examination is necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The qualified person should not be required to conduct a full physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. . . . the qualified person should be given appropriate flexibility when making this determination based on all available data,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a physical inspection, where necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees with the majority of commenters on this issue and has concluded that, because of changing conditions, appropriate retesting must include a physical inspection of a tank or pipelines for leaks or other build-ups of hazardous substance within a certified space. Physical inspection of a space is an integral part of an effective follow-up inspection or monitoring program. For example, an actual physical examination is crucial in eliminating housekeeping debris that could be fire hazards such as rags, insulation, or heavy oil residues in the tank deep spot. Therefore, OSHA is requiring physical inspections be conducted during follow-up inspections of tested spaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

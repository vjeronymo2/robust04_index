			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is concerned over the situation in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, Russian president's Envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin told an Interfax correspondent today.    He announced that on Saturday Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey  Kozyrev had sent a verbal message to the main participants in  the recent Geneva meeting on Bosnia -- the U.S. state secretary,  the British foreign secretary, the French and German foreign  ministers.    According to Churkin, Kozyrev expressed his concern and  urged  his colleagues to resort to their influence on the parties, for  instance, on the Bosnian government in order to achieve  implementation of the Geneva Document forbidding the parties  from launching any offensives. Neither should they try to  resolve their problems by military actions, Churkin pointed out.    On the issue of the positions of the conflicting parties,  Churkin said he would not appraise their conduct while  hostilities were going on, though these were not wide-scale  offensives. At the same time, a contact group continues its  work. On Tuesday or Wednesday the group will meet the  conflicting parties in order to discuss the territorial  demarcation in Bosnia under the 49:51 proportion (as it had been  decided in Geneva).    The Interfax correspondent asked Churkin, who has several  times been to the zone of conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, what he  could advise to politicians in Kiev and in Simferopol due to the  deterioration of the situation around Crimea. "A `Yugoslav  version' is the worst that could happen. It cannot be forgotten  that human life is precious as a value in itself and when  seizing political power over destroyed territories one will lose  more than win," Churkin remarked.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirements in this final rule supersede any individual carrier coding policies. Those carrier coding policies have been changed to comply with the requirements of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Both the AMA and the American Society of Internal Medicine stated that supplying codes for signs and symptoms without also supplying codes indicating diagnoses that the physician has ruled out will not accurately describe the patient's conditions and explain the reasons for the care provided. Another commenter recommended that we allow the use of ``suspected'' and ``rule out'' codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The coding guidelines state that each visit must be coded to describe the specific reason that the patient sought care or treatment. The guidelines also state: ``Do not code diagnosis documented as ``suspected,'' ``rule out,'' ``probable,'' or ``questionable'' as if they are established. Rather, code the condition to the highest degree of certainty for that encounter/visit to reflect symptoms, signs, abnormal test results, or other reasons for the visit.'' To require coding of ``probable,'' ``suspected,'' ``questionable,'' or ``rule out'' conditions as if the conditions existed would lead to significant overcounting of conditions. This inaccurate recording would distort data and would artificially distort disease statistics. Therefore, physicians should report diagnosis codes for symptoms and signs but should exclude codes for diagnoses that the physician either suspects or rules out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters asked how they should code for situations in which a patient presents disabling symptoms but no diagnosis exists for the patient. They recommended that the diagnosis codes include codes for symptoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Diagnosis codes should reflect the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for the encounter or visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided. However, the carrier will also accept codes for symptoms when no other more definite code can be given to describe the reason for the visit of the patient. This is explained further in guideline number four of the Appendix_Claims Review and Adjudication Procedures, published with the proposed rule (54 FR 30564,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 21, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters suggested that correlating the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM diagnosis codes and the CPT&hyph;4 procedures codes is a redundant effort since a procedure may be performed as the result of several conditions. They urged that the requirement be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

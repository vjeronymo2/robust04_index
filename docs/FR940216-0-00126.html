			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In any case, EPA believes that carriers are reasonably included in the term ``marketers'' as used in section 211(k)(5). That term is vague and ambiguous, and EPA reasonably interprets it to include all persons regulated by EPA in the reformulated gasoline program including carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act does not define the term marketer for purposes of section 211(k), and while that term is used in various other provisions of the Act, it is only defined for purposes of one unrelated provision, section 324 (involving responsibility for gasoline vapor recovery systems at small volume retail outlets). The term generally appears to indicate a broad category of persons involved in the gasoline distribution system, a generic phrase with a catch-all meaning. See sections 211(h)(4), 211(1) and 211(m)(2). As used in those provisions, the scope of the term may be broader or narrower, depending on how detailed Congress made the list of parties covered by each provision. For example, the long list of parties referenced in section 211(h)(4) makes it clear that ``marketer'' as used there means an undefined category of persons other than distributors, blenders, resellers, carriers, retailers, or wholesale purchaser-consumers, while in sections 211(1) and (m)(2) the term means an undefined category of persons other than refiners. The legislative history for section 211(k) fails to shed any light on Congress' intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The generally accepted meaning of the term ``marketer'' is ``one that deals in a market.'' Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1990). A carrier would reasonably fall within this definition. Given the lack of a clear definition in the Act for this vague term, the indications that Congress intended it to have a somewhat broad, catch-all meaning, and the reasons provided above supporting EPA's inclusion of carrier's as regulated parties in the reformulated gasoline program, EPA has reasonably determined that carriers are included in the term ``marketer'' as it is used in section 211(k) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various commenters claimed that it was inappropriate to impose a presumption of liability on carriers, based on their unique circumstances. They noted that carriers do not take title to or own the gasoline, have contractual obligations to maintain the integrity of the shipment, only act in accordance with instructions from the product owner, and have incentives to not tamper with the product, as it would expose them to liability and would prejudice their relationships with both the shipper and purchaser. Commenters stated that carriers lack any economic incentive to violate the reformulated gasoline requirements, and any action that does not violate these requirements is only in response to the gasoline owner's instructions. Commenters also stated that carriers cannot refuse such instructions except for clear violations of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barge operator-carriers noted that the risk of accidental contamination for barge operator-carriers is virtually nonexistent due to contract obligations to maintain cargo integrity and the product testing that occurs before and after shipping. They also argued that the volume of product in a barge-tank would dilute any trace contaminants such that there was no practical risk of a violation of the reformulated gasoline requirements from contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that carriers occupy a role that is somewhat unique in the gasoline distribution system. In general, EPA agrees that there is limited economic incentive for carriers to tamper with the quality of gasoline, in that carriers do not own the gasoline they ship or store and would not profit by taking advantage of the price differential between complying and noncomplying gasoline. At the same time, there are still significant opportunities for carriers to directly cause violations of the reformulated gasoline program. For example, a carrier's delivery territory may span a boundary between an area requiring reformulated gasoline and an area that may receive conventional gasoline. Misdelivery of conventional fuel into the reformulated gasoline covered area would be a violation of the prohibitions of the reformulated gasoline program. Other situations where a carrier can cause a violation include a terminal-carrier or truck-carrier who mixes conventional gasoline and reformulated gasoline and transfers the resulting gasoline as reformulated; who mixes reformulated gasoline designated as VOC-controlled with non-VOC-controlled gasoline and transfers the resulting gasoline as VOC-controlled; who delivers gasoline designated for use in VOC-Control Region 1 to a retail outlet located in VOC-Control Region 2; who mixes oxygen program reformulated gasoline (OPRG) and non-OPRG reformulated gasoline and transfers the mixture as OPRG; or who mixes simple and complex model reformulated gasoline. In these examples, EPA would hold the carrier liable if the carrier improperly delivered the gasoline or mixed the gasolines that should have been segregated. Note that the gasoline owner in each of these examples also would be presumed liable for the violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these circumstances, the presumption of liability assigned to carriers is much more limited than that assigned to any other regulated party. Like other parties, a carrier is liable for violations that occur at its own facility. However, unlike other regulated parties, carriers are not liable for violations detected at other facilities, unless EPA can show that the carrier caused the violation. This is a significant reduction in the scope of the presumption of liability as compared to the scope proposed for carriers, and reflects EPA's balancing of the unique characteristics noted by carriers and the need to prevent carriers from adversely affecting the characteristics of reformulated gasoline. This parallels the presumption of liability for carriers adopted by the Agency in the gasoline volatility regulations, and approved by the court in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  U.S.E.P.A., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  907 F.2d 177 (D.C.

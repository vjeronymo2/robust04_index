			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of  the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations designed to implement self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho, has stated that considerable progress has been made in  the past two days despite the difficulties encountered at the  beginning of this round of talks. At a news conference today, he  said that the next round of talks will begin on Sunday, voicing  his hope that it will be the "last."    Sha'th pointed out that the Security Committee settled  satisfactorily all pending issues, such as water, regional  planning, and the electromagnetic field.    Regarding the agreement on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord, Sha'th said that only five paragraphs  remain to be worked out. He noted that this agreement, which is  considered the key to the detailed agreements, has 24 clauses.  He said that both the Palestinian and Israeli parties have come  close to reaching an agreement on the legal jurisdictions that  meet the Palestinian needs and the contents of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    Dr. Sha'th noted that there are still issues pending on the  release of Palestinian detainees, noting that there is an  agreement to release 5,000 detainees. He said that the  Palestinian delegation will continue negotiations on a timetable  for the release of the rest of the detainees.    Dr. Sha'th stressed that the meeting between Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres in Bucharest today has helped push the negotiations  forward, noting that he telephoned 'Arafat this morning on this  issue. He pointed out that the talks he held with the head of  the Israeli delegation, General Amnon Shahaq, yesterday after  his return from Israel helped propel the negotiations. He  expressed hope that PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud  'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will come to Cairo to be close to the  negotiations. MENA has learned that Abu-Mazin and Peres will  arrive in Cairo next week to attend the next round of talks,  which is likely to be the last.    Dr. Sha'th stated that an agreement was reached in principle  with the Israeli delegation that the first Palestinian flight  route will be between Gaza and Cairo, noting that an  international airport will be established in Gaza soon.    Dr. Sha'th said he expected the agreement on implementing  the  self-rule powers in Gaza and Jericho will be signed in Cairo  between 2 and 5 May. He noted that 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin  will arrive in Cairo in the next two days. On the first day  they will negotiate over the remaining issues, including the  size of the Jericho area, and will sign the agreement on the  next day. He stressed that the main issues will not be  postponed until after the agreement is signed but certain  secondary and detailed issues will be left until after the  signing.</p>

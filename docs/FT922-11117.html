			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Letter: Political system Sir, I agree with Edward Mortimer ('European puzzle still unsolved', April 16) where he writes that it is very difficult fo generalise about the election results in west European countries. I think, however, that there is one exception, ie the rejection by an important part of the voters of the traditional political system, which they see as dominated by corrupt, incompetent and nepotistic politicians. This attitude benefits the extreme right and new parties and lies at the basis of their success in Belgium, France, Italy and possibly also in Germany. It is up to western politicians to come up with credible proposals for the improvement of our political system. Karel Lannoo, 58 rue de la Brasserie, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

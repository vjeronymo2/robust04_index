			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Lilley acts on housing benefit The government is considering a crackdown on housing benefits, the third largest item in the social security budget, which cost nearly Pounds 9bn a year. Proposals being drawn up for Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, would tighten the definition of 'reasonable rents' which local authorities are required to pay. The scheme, which has not been given final approval, could mean that some poor families would have to move to cheaper accommodation.</p>

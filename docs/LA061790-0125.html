			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA BENDS, URGES PARLIAMENT TO DELAY SECESSION;  </P> <P> THE BALTICS: THE ACTION WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE INDEPENDENCE TALKS WITH MOSCOW. THE  CABINET INSISTS THE MOVE IS ONLY A 'TEMPORARY MORATORIUM.'  </P> <P> The Lithuanian government, retreating from its three-month-old declaration of  independence, recommended on Saturday that the Baltic republic's Parliament  suspend the declaration in order to begin negotiations with the central  government on Lithuania's secession from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Cabinet proposed that the Supreme Council, the republic's  Parliament, declare a "temporary moratorium" on the independence act to meet  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's demand that the unilateral Lithuanian  declaration be suspended before negotiations begin.  </P> <P> "The government suggests to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania  that it debate the possibility of declaring a temporary moratorium on the  (independence) act for the period of negotiations with the Soviet Union," a  government statement issued in Vilnius said.  </P> <P> The declaration of independence, adopted March 11, would remain valid,  government officials said, but its implementation would be suspended while  negotiations were under way. Lithuania remains determined to become  independent, they said, but wants to negotiate its future relationship with  Moscow.  </P> <P> The proposal must be approved by the Lithuanian Parliament, many of whose  members are outspoken advocates of immediate and full independence for their  nation, and then accepted by the central government.  </P> <P> But the shift was significant enough for the official Soviet news agency Tass  to say on Saturday that it "could mark the beginning of the solution of all the  'Lithuanian problem.' "  </P> <P> Until now, Lithuania said it would freeze only the implementation of the  hundred-plus laws and resolutions adopted after the independence declaration,  but it refused to suspend or rescind the declaration itself, as Moscow has  demanded as a condition for negotiations.  </P> <P> Such action, Lithuanian leaders argued, would amount to accepting voluntarily  Lithuania's status as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. The small  nation, which was independent for 18 years between World War I and World War  II, was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 in a pact made by  the Kremlin with Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has said that Lithuania does have the moral right of  self-determination and a constitutional right to secede from the Soviet Union,  but he has insisted that the terms for its withdrawal must be negotiated within  the framework of the Soviet constitution and legislation.  </P> <P> In talks last week with the presidents of the three Baltic republics, including  Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis, the Soviet leader significantly relaxed those  conditions, clearing the way for a compromise.  </P> <P> "If Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we  may start to talk," Gorbachev said on Tuesday. "That means suspending its  implementation at least for the duration of the talks."  </P> <P> That was the intent of the Lithuanian Cabinet, which met in Vilnius under  Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene, who has led the search for a compromise. "Our act  of independence would remain valid," Gentaras Jatkonis, a government spokesman  said, "but we are postponing the realization of it."  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Cabinet was at pains nonetheless to portray the proposed  suspension as no retreat from the principles contained in the declaration.  </P> <P> "A moratorium does not mean that the act is abolished," the government  statement said. "A moratorium only means that for the duration of the  negotiations the use of the rights stemming from the independence act is  postponed, and the status of Lithuania as an independent state does not change.  Breaking off the negotiations automatically brings an end to the moratorium."  </P> <P> Under the Cabinet's proposal, Lithuania would suspend the declaration  immediately, but it would implement the decision and begin the talks, which  have been sought by both sides, only when Moscow has fully lifted its economic  blockade.  </P> <P> The proposal, despite these precautions, could encounter strong opposition on  Tuesday in the Lithuanian Parliament, which is dominated by members of Sajudis,  the pro-independence movement led by Landsbergis. The Cabinet, a coalition led  by the highly respected Prunskiene that includes Communists as well as Sajudis  members, is regarded as more moderate and less confrontational than the  Parliament.  </P> <P> The proposal was supported by the Lithuanian Communist Party, which broke with  Moscow on the issue of Lithuanian independence and remains a political force in  the republic.  </P> <P> While declaring the independence declaration to be "irreversible," the party  said that there is a need for a transition period to consolidate real statehood  for Lithuania, and it urged the republic's leadership to do its "utmost" to  start negotiations with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's offer of compromise, including a new and looser status for the  Baltic republics within the Soviet Union, was welcomed on Saturday as "quite a  positive move" and "very serious" by Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Latvian  Popular Front, which seeks independence for Latvia.  </P> <P> "This proposal of the president expands the vistas for political movement and  produces various possibilities in solving our problem," Ivans said in a  television interview broadcast on the Soviet nightly news program Vremya. "This  is a move forward, and it cannot remain unanswered."  </P> <P> The Baltic Assembly, which groups the popular fronts of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania, met on Saturday at Jurmala, a Latvian beachfront resort, to  coordinate strategies in their campaigns to reestablish the independence of  their nations.  </P> <P> In a message to the parliaments of the three republics, the assembly warned  that "nobody has a right to demand either the abrogation or halting the acts on  independence. A retreat will harm the democratic movement," it said.  </P> <P> Landsbergis, addressing the meeting, called for a united approach to Moscow.  "We should tightly clasp hands so that the hold should not be broken and that  the Baltic link remains intact," he said.  </P> <P> The Baltic Council, which is made up of top government officials from the three  republics, is expected to meet later this week to discuss Gorbachev's proposals  following debates in each of the parliaments.  </P> <P> Going well beyond an offer to negotiate terms for their secession, Gorbachev  outlined to the Baltic leaders his vision of a commonwealth of sovereign states  bound together by varying political, economic, cultural and social ties, and he  urged the Baltic nations to participate in the talks in which this new union is  forged and to consider joining it.  </P> <P> As Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov promised Prunskiene last week, the central  government's punishing economic blockade of Lithuania is being eased. The flow  of natural gas to Lithuania was increased sufficiently on Saturday to permit  the reopening of a key fertilizer plant this week, officials in Vilnius said.  </P> <P> The plant is expected to get 3.5 million cubic meters of gas daily, allowing it  to return to operation by the end of the week.  </P></p>

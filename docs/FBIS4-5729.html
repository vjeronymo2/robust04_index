			<p>BFN     [Text] When asked by a VNA correspondent about Vietnam's  attitude toward the bomb attack that killed and injured many  Israeli civilians in Afula in northern Israel, a Vietnamese  Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Vietnam condemns all acts  of terror against civilians. Such an action will only give rise  to a wave of violence in the region and create suffering for  innocent people. This situation calls for a quick, fair,  long-term, and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  with the Palestinian issue at the core.    Vietnam supports the current peace process in the Middle  East.</p>

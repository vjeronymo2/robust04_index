			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 11 May (MENA)--A second group of 150 members  of the Palestinian National Security Forces entered the Gaza  Strip via the Rafah crossing point today.    Colonel Fawzi Zaqzuq, commander of the contingent, said it  is  part of the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut Forces, which was stationed  in Egypt. In addition to enlisted men, it includes several  officers of various ranks and some noncommissioned officers.    He said today's contingent complements the group that  entered  yesterday. He explained that their weapons and equipment  arrived in Gaza earlier.    Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad  'Abd-al-Wahhab,  commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces, said that the weapons on  hand are sufficient for sentry purposes and to maintain order in  the Palestinian streets. He said that the first groups to  arrive will assume their positions and carry out a temporary  deployment until the remaining forces arrive and take over  overall authority for security in the area.    Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab said that the Palestinian forces  are ready to begin their duties in the autonomy areas, pointing  out that 2,000 policemen are ready to enter immediately if  Israel agrees.    He noted that all the Palestinian people are waiting for the  arrival of their national forces and will welcome their presence  regardless of any political differences among various factions.    Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab remarked, however, that the  technical capabilities and equipment of the Palestinian police  are still very poor because no grants or aid have been received  yet from the countries that announced plans to send aid. He  said the United States has sent 200 vehicles as a gift, but they  are not equipped as police cars.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios may from time to time require the services of certain employees of the Central Power and Light, Company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric Power Company and West Texas Utilities Company (collectively, ``Operating Subsidiaries'') in connection with Permitted Activities. Certain employees of the Operating Subsidiaries are fluent in languages other than English or knowledgeable in the operation of Facilities, which may be necessary or desirable skills for CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios to demonstrate in connection with the Permitted Activities. However, the necessity or desirability of such skills does not economically justify hiring employees of CSWI, CSWdM and/or CSWdM Servicios with such skills during the commencement of activities at such companies. Accordingly, the Applicants seek authority for the Operating Subsidiaries to provide such services to CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Rule 53(a)(3), no more than 2% of the employees of the Operating Subsidiaries will render services, at any one time, directly or indirectly, to CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios or any EWG or FUCO held directly or indirectly by CSW. The accounting by the CSW system of such services will ensure that CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios, as the case may be, will be obligated to reimburse the appropriate Operating Subsidiary for such services. In no event will the provision of such services adversely affect the rate base or the costs to ratepayers of any such Operating Subsidiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost of services provided by an Operating Subsidiary to CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios will include all direct charges based on the wage rates or salaries of assigned employees (including direct labor costs and direct labor benefits; costs of material, vehicle and equipment usage; and meals, lodging and miscellaneous expenses) and indirect or overhead costs including insurance, employment taxes, benefits plans (if applicable) and a portion of the administrative and general expenses of such Operating Subsidiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All services rendered by an Operating Subsidiary to CSWI, CSWdM Or CSWdM Servicios will be performed in accordance with a work order which sets forth the services requested and time allocated for such services. No Operating Subsidiary shall be obligated to render services to CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios if the personnel and resources needed to fill the work order are not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There will be no diversion of CSW system personnel or resources that would adversely affect any operating subsidiary's domestic ratepayers or CSW's shareholders. CSWI will report to the Commission the nature and scope of such services provided by any Operating Subsidiary, CSW Services and Energy to CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios, including a quarterly summary of the type and cost of any services furnished by such associates. Such reports will represent that no such associate has subsidized the operations of CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios, and, further, that the transfer of any personnel from, and the rendering of services by, such associates in connection with Permitted Activities have not adversely affected the services provided by such associates to their respective customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW proposes through December 31, 1997, to: (1) finance the activities of the CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Parents in the form of capital contributions, loans or open account advances (``Investments''); and/or (2) issue guarantees in the form of letters of credit, bid bonds or other credit support to secure certain obligations incurred by CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and Project Parents (``Guarantees''), in any combination of Investments and/or Guarantees up to an aggregate principal amount of $400 million (``Aggregate General Authority'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contributions may be made from CSW to CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Servicios and/or Project Parents directly or indirectly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the amount of all outstanding Guarantees and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investments provided by CSW directly or indirectly to CSWI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and/or Project Parents shall not exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Aggregate General Authority. Such Investments would bear interest at a rate per annum based on market rates for similar credits, but in any event not in excess of CSW's weighted cost of capital and would have a final maturity not to exceed five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants contend that in order to compete in the marketplace and to develop Facilities, CSWI, CSWdM and each Project Parent will require the ability to bid on or otherwise pursue multiple projects on a simultaneous basis and to provide Guarantees at the time of bid or during development. The inability of CSWI, CSWdM and/or the Project Parents to provide such Guarantees on a timely basis will variously prevent, hinder or make more costly their participation in Facilities for which it would otherwise be able to secure contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

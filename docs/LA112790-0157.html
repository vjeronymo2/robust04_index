Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SELF-FUNDED PLANS FREE OF STATES  </P> <P> Self-funded employee health care plans, which cover about 9.5 million working  Americans, are not subject to state insurance laws and regulations, the Supreme  Court ruled today.  </P> <P> The court, by a 7-1 vote, said in the case of a seriously injured Pennsylvania  teen-age girl that federal regulation of such plans preempts any state  regulation. Self-funded plans have benefits paid directly by an employer and  not purchased through an independent insurance company.  </P></p>

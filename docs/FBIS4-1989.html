			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At a provincial propaganda and ideological work  meeting held in Lanzhou yesterday morning, Provincial Party  Committee Secretary Yan Haiwang stressed that propaganda and  ideological work should provide effective ideological insurance  and stable mass relations to support reform, development, and  conversion.    Yan Haiwang said, in the course of studying and implementing  the spirit of the national conference on propaganda and  ideological work, we must incorporate the realities of our  thinking and work, must deepen our understanding of the spirit  and guiding significance of the speeches made by the central  leading comrades, including Jiang Zemin, and must strengthen the  sense of pressure and responsibility in doing a good job of our  work. All localities should properly perform the various tasks  in propaganda and ideological work.    Yan Haiwang said: It is imperative to exert efforts to grasp  work in several aspects: First, it is imperative to grasp the  study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three  firmly and well as a basic ideological foundation and  consciously guide all our work with the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, it is imperative  to do a good job in propaganda and ideological work on the  presentation of important reform measures centering around  quickening the pace of building the socialist market economic  structure and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and giving  play to the mass enthusiasm for reform.    Third, it is necessary to augment education in ideology and  morality with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the  core, and enthusiastically promote the spirit of emancipating  the mind, being bold at blazing new trails, the spirit of taking  the bull by the horns, and struggling hard amid difficulties.  We must do away with the practice of avoiding contact with the  outside world; instead, we must advocate the spirit of opening  up in a comprehensive way. We must promote building material as  well as spiritual civilization across Gansu to mount another new  plane. Fourth, it is necessary to go all out to do a good job of  the Fourth Chinese Art Festival to ensure the further success of  art and literature. [passage omitted]</p>

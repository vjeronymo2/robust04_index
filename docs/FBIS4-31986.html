			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 14 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov  is likely to nominate a replacement this week for Deputy Prime  Minister and Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev, who has  resigned, Socialist leader Zhan Videnov told a regular briefing  today. It became clear that with this absolutely necessary  change the cabinet will work until the elections. According to  Videnov, the personnel and structural changes demanded from the  prime minister by the Socialists in return for support for the  cabinet would have made sense only if they had rallied the  parliamentary majority to support the cabinet. Since this did  not materialize and Bulgaria is heading for elections in the  autumn, structural and personnel changes became rather  pointless, Videnov said.    Prime Minister Lyuben Berov yesterday submitted a proposal  to  parliament to relieve Karabashev of his post and appoint Kiril  Tsochev in his place, it was announced later on. The Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP) will not demand changes other than those  already proposed, Videnov said after a meeting of the BSP  parliamentary group this afternoon. According to him, the  Socialists will not object to Tsochev's appointment as deputy  prime minister as well.    The BSP may back a motion by the Fatherland Party of Labour,  its coalition partner, that parliament give up its summer recess  in view of the possibility of elections in the autumn.  According to Videnov, it is worth taking a shorter holiday so  as to pass on second reading the Army and Armed Forces Bill or  elections-related legislation. Videnov said the Army is in dire  straits and it is unlikely that 2,000 million leva needed in the  second half of the year will be allocated. Videnov has proposed  to President Zhelev to convene the National Security  Consultative Council for a discussion of this issue.    The mayoral election in Veliko Turnovo (central Bulgaria) on  Sunday [12 June] gives us grounds to believe that the trend to  support the Union of Democratic Forces has begun to give way,  Doncho Konakchiev, member of the BSP supreme leadership, said  when asked to comment on the election results. The election was  declared invalid because of a low turn-out. According to  Konakchiev, the results show that a change in the reform model  is needed. According to Videnov, the BSP reached 65 per cent of  its electoral potential in Veliko Turnovo and its supporters  were obviously the more active. Clearly, people are not  interested in local elections yet and parliamentary elections  are all that matters for the time being, Videnov said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Chereshnya, candidate of historical </F> sciences: "The President's Term"]    [Text]  <H5>  Puzzle for the Quick-Witted </H5>   We elected Boris Yeltsin president of the Russian  Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR.    But there are no longer either soviets or socialism or  the Union.    Does B. Yeltsin remain a competent president? If so,  will this be for long?    All things pass, all things change. Not even two months  had elapsed before the president of Russia, without a moment's  hesitation, was abandoning the promise to present himself for  the verdict of the people and agree to early elections. Obliging  people long since found a justification of this ostensibly  surprise step, and more than one, of course. Let us see how  convincing they are.    First, it is maintained that the president has already put  himself up for election repeatedly and has on just as many  occasions obtained the people's trust. Particularly enthusiastic  admirers speak about a whole five rounds of elections  successfully negotiated by Yeltsin (to the Union parliament, to  the Russian parliament, for chairman of the Russian Parliament,  for president and at the 25 April referendum). There is much  dissembling and misrepresentation here. Elections to the supreme  organ of legislative power have nothing in common with  presidential elections. Different branches of power, rights,  authority, and procedure of election. It is absurd even to speak  about the fact that a positive outcome of parliamentary  elections endows the highest officer of the state with some  particular legal validity. Never has it! Yeltsin's victory at  the referendum is indisputable. As a statesman, he obtained the  trust of the people, but this has a very tangential bearing on  presidential elections, that is, a particular political action  on a competitive basis in accordance with legislatively  specified rules.    It has to be recognized that Yeltsin has thus far been  elected president only once. It remains to be elucidated in  legally dispassionate fashion of what he was elected president.  For me the answer is clear: president of the RSFSR, that is, not  of an independent state, not a subject of international law, but  of a component of an integral federal formation going by the  name of the USSR. Strictly legally, Yeltsin acquired that same  extent of authority which the president of the republics within  the Russian Federation (of Kalmykia or Tatarstan, say) have  currently. For the RSFSR was, I repeat, merely a Union republic  within the USSR, no more.    By a wicked irony of political fate, Yeltsin, by furthering  the demolition of the USSR, undermined the legal basis of his  own authority. In the new independent state (according to the  rules of international law) the competence of all the old state  institutions of the RSFSR (the president, the Congress, the  Supreme Soviet, the Constitutional Court) have been depreciated  and become legally worthless. And there have been no new  elections as yet, and, consequently, there is in the Russian  Federation no legitimately elected president; there is merely an  official invested with the trust of the people for the  provisional discharge of his obligations. And from the legal  viewpoint it can in no way be a question of new presidential  elections but of the first elections of a president of Russia  (as, equally, of the parliament, the local authorities, judges,  and so forth).    Second, it is maintained that Yeltsin promised to put  himself  up for reelection as a concession to the now nonexistent Supreme  Soviet. There is no one now, as it were, before whom the highly  significant words are to be kept. But this is at least  unconvincing. For they were not simply words but strict legal  instruments--Yeltsin's Decree 1400 and others, still not  rescinded, it would appear, which speak of new presidential  elections within an established time frame.    But even were they only words, they were uttered repeatedly,  publicly, openly, before the entire people. In a word, a given  word, and whereas forswearing such is barely excusable even in  everyday life, in political life it is absolutely intolerable.    Third, as our Palmerston or Talleyrand, Mr. Kozyrev,  elegantly put it, Russia is in dire need of continuity of power,  and for this reason "allow the president to complete his  appointed term." It sounds impressive, does it not? But the  president's laudatory desire to see the business through to a  conclusion in no way cancels out the simple fact that he does  not possess for this the requisite legal capacity! The mandate  he obtained from the people in 1991 was appreciably different in  terms of the extent of rights and authority, and, essentially,  in terms of its nature also.    I also would like a president endeavoring, albeit none too  successfully, to break with the communist past to remain at the  helm of power until 1996. But, as distinct from Kozyrev, I am  clearly aware that the president of a Union republic cannot have  the full legal value that would make him a genuine guarantor of  the constitutional system of a fully sovereign state.    Having adopted the deplorable decision, Yeltsin made, from  all viewpoints, a mistake. Having broken his word, he is once  again giving the opposition splendid opportunities for playing  the card of the president's unscrupulousness and political  hypocrisy. The slogan "Send Yeltsin Packing!" gains a second  wind under these conditions. The political forces and the  electorate who are the president's staunch supporters are put in  an awkward position here.    Unpleasant legal repercussions are possible also. The  president now, in the absence of parliament, has become the most  important source of law. But even after the commencement of the  activity of the Federal Assembly, Yeltsin will remain, with the  scheduled arrangement of political power, a most important  constitutional figure. And his incomplete legal sufficiency  connected with the limited nature of the presidential mandate he  obtained could in the near future compel a reconsideration of  many decisions of the executive as being legally deficient. We  would recall also that Yeltsin primordially entrusted his fate,  as it were, to the Federal Assembly. Having emphatically changed  his own opinion, the president--knowingly or otherwise--has  humiliated the future parliament and the representative  authority altogether. I do not believe that this will be that  easily forgotten.    No less deplorable is another mistake of the president's  also. He announced that he had altered his decision before the  Constitution, with the idea of a far-advanced presidential  republic, had been approved at a referendum. It transpires that  Yeltsin was deciding for the people, as it were, the kind of  reform of the constitutional arrangement that Russia needs. In  declaring that he would remain in office until 1996, Yeltsin was  making it clearly understood (to whom, to the people?) that  there could be in Russia only a presidential republic. For  heaven's sake, did not the republics in Spain and Cambodia  become constitutional monarchies before our eyes? And have we  not known in contemporary history instances of the conversion of  presidential into parliamentary republics?    And, finally, the last point. Following the disbandment of  the USSR, multiple voids have, as of January 1992, arisen in  Russia in the legal respect. Neither the president nor  parliament nor the judicial authorities have possessed full and  exhaustive legal sufficiency. Since the April referendum the  president undoubtedly became more legally sufficient than  parliament, but still not to the extent necessary for a  democratic state based on the rule of law. But circumstances  could now change abruptly to his disadvantage. Parliament,  elected for the first time in an independent Russia, even if in  accordance with deficient rules, will inevitably be perceived in  the world as an institution of fuller legal value than a  president who was sworn in under other constitutional and legal  conditions of an order of magnitude lower. Both the president's  friends and enemies have known how at the right time to  emphasize this impressive difference repeatedly.    Of course, the president and his circle had ostensibly  reasonable motives for the refusal to put himself up for  election again. It is possible that some people consider  themselves to be the winners, who, as we all know, are not  judged. Being the victor, you can, naturally, permit yourself to  go back on your word and dictate new conditions of the political  game. It cannot be ruled out that the president sincerely  believes in his mission of transformer of Russia and wants to  use these years to arrange in the country a better life as he  sees it.    In addition, Yeltsin, who is not required to delve into  legal  niceties, may not sense the frailty of his legal position and  because of this does not see the practical point of new  elections.    The president's circle, however, is seriously afraid of the  possibility of his not being reelected. This would mean for many  of them the end of their political careers, for some, an  unpleasant investigation of financial matters, and not just  financial. Political persecution and revenge are possible also.  No one wants to take such a risk under today's supercharged  political conditions. These people may be understood at the  human level, but in the highest interests of Russia it is, for  all that, impossible to agree with them. The damage to the  extremely imperfect Russian statehood and to the genuine, not  selfishly misinterpreted, ideas of democracy and a state based  on the rule of law would be all too palpable.    Strictly speaking, the damage to the president also would be  inordinate. Politics is a dirty, immoral business, no question.  But within certain bounds, which even the Chinese emperor could  not transgress without loss of face. Nor could any ruler  thinking if only to a negligible extent about his good name--no,  not about his own even but that of his country and people. It is  as necessary as the air he breathes (this is self-evident) to  the person who considers himself the unifier and spokesman for  the spirit of the nation, society, and the state. I believe that  the president will damage himself greatly if he goes back on his  promise to put himself up for election again.    Words under some conditions count for a very great deal, but  only when they are not at variance with deeds. "Word and deed!"  Russians exclaimed in the old days, wishing to call the  attention of the highest authorities to important state  interests. I believe that this should be an inner requirement of  all statesmen declaring themselves genuine spokesmen for the  people's needs. And the president should, undoubtedly, stand in  the front row of these people.</p>

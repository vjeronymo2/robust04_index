			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: 26% advance for TSB Bank Scotland TSB Bank Scotland, the Scottish offshoot of TSB Group, raised pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 76.9m in the year to October 31 1991. Profits in Scotland thus grew faster than those of TSB's retail banking and insurance division, of which TSB Bank Scotland is part. The division's pre-tax profits, announced last week, rose 17 per cent to Pounds 413m. TSB Bank Scotland's cost income ratio fell from 59.3 per cent to 52.6 per cent as a result of staff cuts and the removal of duplication. Those of the division fell from 68 per cent to 59 per cent. The charge for bad and doubtful debts was Pounds 14.7m, against Pounds 5.9m. TSB Bank Scotland handles commercial lending, although large corporate customers are dealt with by TSB's Hill Samuel subsidiary which lost Pounds 419m last year. Mr Charles Love, chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland, said it fared better than the division as a whole because of the better economic climate in Scotland, although that had worsened in the second half of the year. He said costs rose by only 4.6 per cent.</p>

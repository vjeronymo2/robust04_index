			<p>BFN     [Text] Before attending today's Cabinet meeting, Defense  Minister General Wichit Sukmak talked to newsmen about the  Cambodian first prime minister's accusation that the Thai army  is supporting the Khmer Rouge. He said he had no knowledge  about the charge, and that it may only be a remark made to a  news agency.    Regarding Cambodia seeking arms aid from other countries to  improve the capability of its armed forces, Thailand must  consider this issue very carefully.    The defense minister said the worst thing United Nations  member countries could do is to provide any Cambodian side with  support that could worsen the conflict and fighting among the  factions. Also, providing arms to the Cambodian Government is  against the Paris peace accord that was signed, and which was  jointly sponsored by France, the United States, and Indonesia.  The agreement aimed to reduce the use of arms that had  prolonged the fighting and delayed the establishment of peace.    The Thai Government wants to see national reconciliation  work  in Cambodia. Therefore, the Cambodian people should settle  their conflict peacefully. The fighting in Cambodia has  adversely affected the Thai people living in the areas bordering  Cambodia for more than 13 or 14 years. Their property have been  robbed and they have to live with the insecurity, concluded the  Thai defense minister.</p>

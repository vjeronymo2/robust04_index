			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Strong UK side lifts GA A strong performance in the UK helped General Accident, the composite insurer, increase pre-tax profits to Pounds 203.2m for the first six months of 1994, compared with Pounds 124.7m. The figures follow full year profits of Pounds 295m in 1993 and underlined the company's recovery since its heavy losses of 1991 and 1992. 'We need to be making good profits now to be effectively paying for the losses of previous years,' commented Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive. In the UK, rate increases, more selective underwriting, greater efficiency and a reduction in claims frequency all helped improve results, with underwriting profits amounting to Pounds 93.5m (Pounds 3.5m). Underwriting profits in home insurance amounted to Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 16.8m), partially because of improved weather conditions, and motor business was also profitable, despite signs that rate competition is returning to that sector of the market. Although GA maintained its portfolio of some 700,000 motor insurance customers intact, premium income fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 119.6m (Pounds 122.5m) and by 7 per cent to Pounds 60.6m in the second quarter, with rates falling about 10 per cent. Results improved in the US and in east Asia, but bad weather in the first quarter led to an increase in underwriting losses in Canada. Worldwide underwriting losses fell to Pounds 44.9m, against losses of Pounds 125m last time. Overall premium income from non-life business increased to Pounds 2.14bn (Pounds 2.1bn), with long-term business premium income rising to Pounds 435.9m (Pounds 413.7m). Investment income fell to Pounds 234.2m (Pounds 242.7m) and estate agency losses rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.5m). Interest paid took Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 9.4m). The interim dividend goes up by 4 per cent to 10.1p, payable from earnings per share ahead from 21.2p to 33.4p. The company has been badly hit by falls in the value of its equity and fixed income portfolio, with net asset value per ordinary share falling from 545p at the end of 1993 to 441p at August 4 1994.</p>

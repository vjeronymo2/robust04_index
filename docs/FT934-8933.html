			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Litigation gives Mitsui second thoughts - A look at the setback in plans for a merger of two Japanese pharmaceutical groups ON SIGNING a merger agreement with Toyama Chemical earlier this year, executives at Mitsui Pharmaceuticals were delighted at extending their range of antibiotics and issued an optimistic profit forecast for the new company's first year of trading. But a closer look at Toyama Chemical has prompted Mitsui Pharmaceuticals and the Mitsui group to step back from the agreement reached in April, and request that the two sides restart negotiations in the hope of signing another contract late next year. Mergers are rarely simple in Japan, as prospective partners are often unable to agree on the mixing of their rigid management hierarchies. But the scrapping of the Toyama-Mitsui agreement highlights how the excesses of the so-called 'bubble era' of the late 1980s have added to the risks of corporate marriage. The delay is a loss of face for both companies, but Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, thought it safer to wait until the settlement of litigation pending over the collapse of a Toyama affiliate, Yuho Chemical, which had debts estimated at Y40bn (Dollars 373m) when it failed in late 1990. Yuho was a conservative chemicals company until the late 1980s, when it diversified into property development and became friendly with the recently dissolved Itoman trading house group, which found itself entangled in art scams and underworld deals. Sanyo General Capital, a financial affiliate of Sanyo Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, has launched a legal action against Toyama Chemical to recover Y5bn in compensation for loans made to Yuho. The prospect of inheriting at least one legal action, and perhaps more if the case was successful, led Mitsui Pharmaceuticals to think again. The retreat was complicated, however, as Sakura Bank, at the centre of the Mitsui family of companies, is also a main bank of Toyama Chemical. 'In principle, there is no problem, but the companies will make a new agreement based on the most recent financial data. We will also solve problems relating to computer systems, company rules and the legal case,' Mitsui Toatsu said. Mitsui says that 'we are told' that Toyama will have no responsibility, but 'we will see what happens in the court case'. Toyama is more enthusiastic, arguing that the merger will definitely be remade when the two sides sort out differences over management structures and computer systems. These are the more common disagreements between potential merger partners, along with asset valuation, which was sometimes arbitrary before the bubble era, and has since become an even greater source of contention. Companies have been very reluctant to write down the value of assets in the wake of the bubble's collapse. An emerging problem is redundancy payments, as many Japanese companies have failed to keep pace with retirement benefit schemes, partly because only 40 per cent of the provisions are tax deductible. But the need to cut workforces creates a larger than expected liability for companies merging with or acquiring an underfunded partner. In the longer-term, as Toyama and Mitsui discovered even before joining hands, keeping middle managers happy and streamlining the hierarchy are difficult to balance. Nippon Steel, the world's leading steelmaker, was created in 1970 through the merger of two companies, and the presidency is still alternated between managers who joined from the two different streams. However, Mitsui had been prepared to tackle these difficulties in the hope of building a pharmaceuticals company comparable to those of the Mitsubishi and Sumitomo keiretsu, or corporate families. Mitsui also said that it and Toyama had research and marketing systems that would complement rather than compete with each other. Despite these benefits, the Mitsui group has decided that it doesn't want a share of Toyama's legal troubles. Another new characteristic of the post-bubble climate is a greater willingness by Japanese companies to take legal action to settle disputes.</p>

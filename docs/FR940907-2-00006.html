			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters, a fisherman and a fisherman's wife, while not directly addressing this question, mentioned in their comments that they are willing to provide documentation such as tax records to demonstrate their need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A charterboat operator stated that salmon landing tickets, income tax records, logbooks, charter office schedule logs, etc., would be appropriate documentation. Grant recipients must be willing to sign affidavits that the information is accurate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual stated that applicants should provide a record of the number of fish caught in previous years and those presently caught, with a value assigned per fish species. Documentation should be in an affidavit, so that penalties could be imposed in case of perjury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tribe member stated that there is no way to determine accurately the overall extent of uninsured losses, the funds are insufficient, but that a ``ballpark'' figure could be used to establish economic basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS is proposing to consider any or all of the documentation suggested in the comments, and is also proposing to require an affidavit that the information provided is accurate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. What should be the starting and ending dates of the disaster period for purposes of awarding grants, and what factors should the Secretary consider in determining these dates?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A charterboat operator stated that the disaster period should begin as soon as administratively possible once criteria are decided on, and extend at least to the end of calendar year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual stated the disaster period should begin on January 1, 1995, and end ``when the fish numbers equal those existing in 1972.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tribe member stated that, for the four treaty tribes, the problems began in 1977.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A charterboat operator wanted assistance extended beyond 1994, until normal fishing seasons are established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of the NEAP program, NMFS is proposing that the disaster period begin on January 1, 1992, and end on December 31, 1994. An ending date for the disaster is necessary in order to calculate the amount of the uninsured commercial losses eligible for disaster relief under the NEAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to comments responding to the ANPR questions, the following comments were received:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thirteen commenters, including two Indian tribes, a trade association, a coastal zone management association, the Pacific Fisheries Legislative Task Force, a state senator, four fishermen, two charterboat operators, and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDF&amp;G), were in favor of direct grants to fishermen, for maintenance, moorage, safety improvements to vessels, or without any conditions for use. One of these commenters also recommended grants for facilities such as ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of these comments contained specific recommendations regarding the allocation of grant funds among the three affected states; conditions for eligibility, emphasizing that grants should be provided to those most active in the Northwest salmon fishery and those most in need; minimum and maximum grant amounts; and organizations through which funds should be channeled. Two tribal governments requested direct aid under this proposal; one asked for funds for two specific programs; the other recommended tribal administration of grant funds. This latter tribe further recommended that 65 percent of the total aid go to Washington State, and of that allocation, 50 percent go to tribes in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the scope and limited financial resources available for NEAP, NMFS has attempted to devise a program to address both short-term individual needs and long-term needs of the industry and the resources. FEMA and the DOL program are accepting applications for direct grants from individuals affected by this situation. The IFA does not allow direct grants to tribal governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight commenters supported a program to employ fishermen in habitat restoration efforts, including a coastal zone management association, a State senator, an Indian tribe, and CDF&amp;G. A trade association stated that funds should be administered through the Salmon Stamp Fund in California and the PSMFC in Oregon and Washington, and opposed use of the SCS or RCD or community agencies. One charterboat operator supported habitat restoration jobs. Another charterboat operator and a fisherman, while supporting habitat restoration, noted these are costly long-term projects; the charterboat operator recommended that Congress give habitat restoration at least equal priority to Super Fund projects. The Pacific Fisheries Legislative Task Force expressed support for nonprofit and citizen group efforts in this area. A trade association opposed retraining on the grounds that only low-paying jobs were available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS concurs that a program employing fishermen to restore habitat would help address the short-term financial needs of the participants who lost income due to the disaster. NMFS also recognizes that habitat restoration is a long-term undertaking, but one that is needed to achieve recovery of the fishery. NMFS is proposing that the habitat restoration program be administered through the SCS, which has access to private lands in coastal areas where a need to restore habitat exists; an established track record in habitat restoration projects; and a history of working with Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One fisherman, a trade association, a coastal zone management association, and a State senator supported employing fishermen to conduct at-sea surveys, stream monitoring and data collection to compensate for lost income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS concurs that a data collection jobs program would address some of the short- and long-term needs of the fishing industry and of the resource. Data collection jobs provide an option for those unable to do habitat restoration work. NMFS is proposing to use the PSMFC to administer the data collection jobs program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASTILLE DAY;  </P> <P> PARIS SUMMIT OPENS AMID CELEBRATIONS  </P> <P> On a day when leaders of seven industrialized nations formally opened their  economic summit here, mounted Republican Guards in silver helmets pranced down  the Champs Elysees below jet fighters trailing the national colors today in a  show of precision, pomp and might honoring Bastille Day and the 200th  anniversary of the French Revolution.  </P> <P> More than 250 planes and helicopters streaked overhead in the daytime military  display, to be followed hours later on the flag-bedecked avenue by a nocturnal  fantasy of elephants, dancing bears and marching bands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Martial Music  </P> <P> Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign Legionnaires,  300 armored vehicles, unarmed mobile missiles and sophisticated transmission  equipment paraded to martial music this morning.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry said up to 1 million people lined the city's most  celebrated avenue for the spectacle.  </P> <P> President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de l'Etoile and  then, standing in a light reconnaissance vehicle, rode down the avenue to the  Place de la Concorde. There he joined President Bush and other world leaders in  the presidential tribune, at the site where the guillotine stood during the  revolution.  </P> <P> Later, the ceremonial start of the summit, the 15th such meeting, was held in  the spectacular but controversial Louvre Pyramid, the new, giant glass  structure designed by American architect I. M. Pei that serves as an entrance  to the national museum of France.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Summit for Bush  </P> <P> Bush, attending his first summit, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and  Japan's Prime Minister Sosuke Uno were among those welcomed by Mitterrand.  </P> <P> At a later working dinner at the Hotel de la Marine, White House Chief of Staff  John H. Sununu said, "The focus will probably be on the political issues" that  are expected to be a major topic during the talks that conclude Sunday.  </P></p>

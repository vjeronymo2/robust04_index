			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Second Serbian Submarine Sighted in </F> Adriatic Sea"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] The Hague, 8 Mar (ANP) -- Western naval ships have  observed a second Serbian submarine in the Adriatic Sea. It was  already known that a Heroj-class submarine, the "Uskok," had  already sailed. Now, however, a Sava-class submarine has also  been observed, a navy spokesman confirmed. Each boat can be  fitted out with 10 torpedoes.    Western ships are patrolling the Adriatic Sea in order to  supervise the UN oil and arms embargo against the former  Yugoslavia. The Netherlands ships serving there are the "Jacob  van Heemskerck" and the "Van Kinsbergen."    The Adriatic Sea is not a no-go area for submarines from  Serbia and Montenegro, the navy spokesman said. He did say,  however, that it was interesting that a second submarine was  operational.</p>

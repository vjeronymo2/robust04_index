			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Aetna in talks with KKR on sale of American Re AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, the largest shareholder-owned insurance company in the US, is in talks with Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out specialists, over the sale of its American Re-Insurance subsidiary. Aetna said 'progress was being made' in the talks, but added there was no assurance of a deal. It stressed that, apart from board approval, the transaction was conditional on KKR's ability to find funding, and approvals from the state-based insurance regulators. American Re, based in Princeton, New Jersey, reinsures commercial property and liability risks in domestic and international markets. Its premiums in 1991 were Dollars 979m, up from Dollars 871m in the previous year, although earnings have been flat for several years, totalling Dollars 133m in 1991. The reinsurance company warned in its annual report that pricing conditions in the property-casualty markets could mean continued pressure on earnings this year. The reinsurance operation was acquired in 1979 for Dollars 389m, and is carred on Aetna's books at Dollars 740m. It has assets of around Dollars 3.8m. Aetna did not specify the price being discussed with KKR, although speculation has centred at around Dollars 1.4bn. Aetna's possible sale of the business underlines the extent to which the large US multiline insurers are restructuring their businesses through retrenchment and asset sales, as they try to bolster capital and improve profitability. Aetna, which saw net profits fall from Dollars 614m to Dollars 505m last year, has been troubled by souring real estate-related investments. It has already pulled out of some unprofitable lines - ceasing to write auto insurance in certain states, for example - and has sold some 'non-core' subsidiaries, including a 43 per cent stake in La Estrella de Seguros, the Spanish insurance business. KKR - best-known for its massive Dollars 25bn bid for RJR Nabisco - has shown interest in the financial services sector for some time. It gained a toe-hold in the banking sector when it joined Fleet/Nordstar to buy the failed Bank of New England in a Dollars 670m deal. Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, has more than doubled its stake in Assicurazioni Generali, the insurer, to 12.54 per cent due to the insurer's capital increase, Reuter reports.</p>

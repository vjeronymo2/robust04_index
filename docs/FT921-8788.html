			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: M&amp;G This week's commitment by the Labour party not to abolish personal equity plans (Peps) if it wins the election might be seen as taking wind out of M&amp;G's ample sails. There have been more than a few nods and winks from financial advisers, after all, that the fund management group's heavily promoted Recovery Investment Trust is ideal if you have Pounds 12,000 to spare and are worried about Mr Kinnock's intentions towards Peps when he gets inside Number 10. All the same, Labour's apparent U-turn must eventually be good news for M&amp;G Group's own shares, as distinct from the products. While there is room to ponder just how sharp investors' appetite for Peps will continue to be, there is no doubting the stimulus which this Tory tax shelter has given to the retail market for equities. Labour's stay of execution may encourage some to hold on to their money this time, but others will find it hard to resist the unprecedented level of TV advertising, the power of the sponsoring bank SG Warburg and the enthusiasm for M&amp;G to be found among independent financial advisers. If this month's launch meets expectations, the two new Pep trusts could contribute as much as Pounds 5m to net profits in the year to September and more than Pounds 4m in 1993. Not only is there a guaranteed income flow over the 10-year life of the closed-end fund; the lifting of the Labour cloud means the trick can be repeated. In the circumstances, shareholders need not be unduly concerned that M&amp;G's legendary investment record has recently lost a little of its shine. High income unit trusts - to which M&amp;G is particularly exposed - were all in difficulty last year, despite the efforts of Mr Paddy Linaker, M&amp;G's chairman, to get companies to pay their dividends. His own company's shares, which have outperformed the market four-fold over the last 10 years and eight-fold over the last 15, continue to look an excellent bet.</p>

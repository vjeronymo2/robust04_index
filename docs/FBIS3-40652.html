			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Dunkel Crowbar"] </F>   [Text] The eleven-hour debate on the Dunkel draft, which  culminated in the expected walk-out of the Opposition in the Lok  Sabha last week, was a ritual affair, including the tearing up  of a copy of the draft agreement in the House. The Opposition  has done a good job of articulating the fears stemming from the  Dunkel draft; but it took the approach that since it is its  business to oppose the Government, it needed to do no more than  to suggest that the country should opt out of Dunkel, that is,  pull out of GATT. That this course of action is not open to  India or any other nation in today's unipolar world is obvious  enough. The alternative to crowbars, of the American or any  other variety, is a strong multilateral forum. Like other  developing nations, India has a stake in a truly independent  GATT.    True, the Uruguay round is taking the world away from  even-handed trade; but the issue then surely is to stem this  trend by developing a negotiating stance. The Opposition could  have contributed to this by suggesting specific amendments to  the Uruguay round proposals before these were consolidated in  the Dunkel draft. Indeed, even with regard to the draft, the  Government could have been pressured to ask for changes that  would result in visible benefits to the country's exports. As  things stand, the multilateral trade agreement that is to be  finalised on December 15 and made operational from April next  year, will improve annual world trade by $217 billion; this  country's share in this at $207 million will be a fraction of  one per cent. India is being fobbed off under the Uruguay round.  This reflects the country's failure to adopt a national stance,  stemming from a total loss of initiative following its  submission to the IMF and World Bank-referred programme of  economic liberalisation.    In the Lok Sabha debate, the Union Commerce Minister made  brave noises: if the textile export quotas against India are  kept in operation for 15 years (as proposed by the US), India  will ask for a similar term for relaxing intellectual property  rights; since the Dunkel proposals will mean a sharp rise in  prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals, the Government will  exercise its licensing powers, and so forth. The fact is that  retaliatory or protective powers are not available to India  under the Dunkel draft nor can issues be reopened at the  ministerial-level meeting of April 1994. Worse, in the  resurrected GATT, the US and the advanced capitalist countries  will tend to gang up against the developing countries; if the  multilateral forum does not suit them, there is nothing to stop  them from acting unilaterally against India. The Government has  mishandled the Uruguay round negotiations, failed to protect  India's interests in international trade and yielded to the  one-sided Dunkel draft.</p>

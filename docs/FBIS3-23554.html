			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter of General Designers to Yeltsin: "Guns Back Up to </F> the Market"]    [Text] Very esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    In the course of the last two years, a new system for the  organization of military-technical cooperation with foreign  countries was worked out and established through the joint  efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, and the defense  industry. A fundamental reorganization of the system for the  export of arms was begun under the leadership of the  Interdepartmental Commission on military-Technical Cooperation.    At the present time, a number of stages of the plan for the  reorganization of military-technical cooperation approved by the  Government of the Russian Federation have already been realized:    --a consultative and supervisory council under the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations made up of representatives of  developers and manufacturers of export arms has been established  and is working actively;    --financing-industrial groups oriented toward the export of  arms have begun to be formed and a new system is being  established for the interaction of defense enterprises with  specialized foreign economic associations of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations ("Oboroneksport,"  "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and GUSK);    --a powerful and reliable system of military-technical  cooperation is being established that relies on developers and  manufacturers of arms employing the structures of the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations, which will provide for the  comprehensive servicing and modernization of domestic military  equipment at the foreign customer and will expand the volume and  forms of exports and services for technical assistance to the  foreign buyer;    --certain changes have been made in the structures of  foreign  economic associations dealing with the export of arms, their  leadership has been replaced, etc.    At the present time, the established system of  military-technical cooperation is fully workable and basically  fulfills the functions assigned to it, although it is not free  from shortcomings (parallel efforts in individual areas of the  work of foreign economic associations, bureaucracy, and a long  time for the drawing up of contracts), which, in our view, can  be eliminated through customary methods of everyday work. For  this reason, the withdrawal of specialized foreign economic  associations in a particular stage (as foreseen by Edict No.  1932c of the President of the Russian Federation from 18  November 1993) may lead to the disorganization of the program  planned and approved by the Government of the Russian Federation  for the reorganization of military-technical cooperation. Also  unavoidable are the following negative consequences:    1. The receipt by foreign partners and arms customers of  information about the fundamental reorganization of the  All-Union association "Oboroneksport," the state foreign  economic company "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the GUSK, which have  many years of experience in international weapons markets, will  doubtless lead to increased uncertainty among them about the  stability and possibility of Russia to fulfill its obligations  in the area of military-technical cooperation. This threatens  the conclusion of a number of new contracts and the incipient  positive trends in the development of military-technical  cooperation. The losses in connection with the cancellation of  contracts are estimated at about $2 billion.    2. The establishment of the state company "Rosvooruzheniye"  means the actual transfer of the state monopoly for trade in  weapons to an economic entity, which violates the integrity of  the work being carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations to pay off the debts of foreign countries to Russia  and to eliminate the state debt of Russia to suppliers of arms  and military equipment.    3. The establishment of the new structure in the system of  military-technical cooperation will disrupt the organized  utilization of a single infrastructure for the foreign economic  activity of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,  including foreign representations (trade delegations), through  which most military-technical cooperation with foreign countries  is carried out today.    The edict of the President of the Russian Federation from 18  November 1993 was not coordinated with the departments  responsible for the status of military-technical cooperation. It  appears that actions for its realization are in need of serious  coordination on the part of interested organizations.    In connection with what has been stated above, we ask you to  suspend temporarily the effect of the edict and to entrust the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation  with the preparation of proposals in relation to its realization.    B. Bunkin, general designer of the scientific-production  association "Almaz,"    V. Yefremov, general designer of the concern "Antey,"    G. Yefremov, general designer of the scientific-production  association for machine building,    Yu. Perunov, general designer of the Scientific-Production  Association imeni P.S. Ploshakov,    V. Kireyev, general designer and general director of the  Novocherkassk Engineering-Reclamation Institute,    M. Simonov, general designer of the Experimental-Design  Bureau imeni Sukhoy,    A. Kuznetsov, general designer of the MAK "Vympel."    This letter and the material published on page 2 were  prepared for printing on the eve of the first meeting of the  Federal Assembly. We decided to put off its publication only so  that we would not exercise even indirect influence on the  results of the election of the speaker of the Council of the  Federation--the figure of V. Shumeyko was already looming behind  the scenes of this political drama.    The Russian senators have now made their choice and V.  Shumeyko is now beyond the reach of justice.    But the trade in Russian weapons is a magnitude  immeasurably greater both economically and politically. In our  view, the documents that RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is publishing today  must attract the close attention of parliamentarians and perhaps  a parliamentary investigation will be required. After all, the  powerful main designers of Russian weapons, whose letter to the  president we are publishing simultaneously, actually did not  accomplish anything, although they raised the same questions to  the highest state authority that are contained in the  publication of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA.    In refraining from the publication of this material on  the eve of the elections for the Council of the Federation, we  actually contributed to some degree to the election of V.  Shumeyko to the highest post in the legislative structure of  authority. While congratulating him on this success, we would  also like to say that the repression to which RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA  has been subject until now emanated and continues to emanate  from the closest circle around the president, to which V.  Shumeyko also belongs. At times this repression has the nature  of petty revenge. They either shut down RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA or  "punish" it in some other way for criticizing the scandalous  "settlements" in the highest echelons of power, which attained  the character of permanence and are diverting the strength of  officials away from affairs that have now reached a deplorable  state. For example, they cut off the telephones for government  communications, as happened in October and continues to happen  to this day, although the editor's office pays very well for  this kind of service. As they say, the poor are very inventive  and those in power are crafty in their repression, although  prudence is very much preferable today.</p>

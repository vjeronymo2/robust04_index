			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / US prices level off US consumer prices rose a slight 0.2 per cent in September, the government said yesterday, as a weak economy and wary consumers kept retail inflation in check, Reuter reports from Washington. The scant rise brought inflation so far this year to a 2.9 per cent annual rate. If maintained, that rate would be the lowest since 1986, the department said. A 0.7 per cent drop in petrol prices restrained the overall September gain in the Consumer Price Index, which was down from a 0.3 per cent increase in August. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core rate of inflation rose 0.2 per cent.</p>

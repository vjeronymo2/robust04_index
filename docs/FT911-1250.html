			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / How to make a bad job worse After the local elections, the government has been stuck with a Micawber strategy; but if you are waiting for something to turn up, you should at least ensure that nothing you do will impede it. The news on the public spending front suggests that they have not taken this simple precaution. The Thatcher government started its term with two economic strategies: a medium-term financial strategy, which was meant to provide a stable policy background, and a system of cash budgeting, which was designed to enlist the public sector in the fight against rising costs. These rules were meant to make government policy predictable and stabilising. In the event, they were badly designed and had the opposite effect. The medium-term strategy was framed in terms of the broad money supply, which proved uncontrollable, as it was bound to do. It blew a fuse. The cash rules were increasingly applied not to control budgeted spending, which would have been sensible, but to borrowing. This is a destabilising rule. In the US, it applies to most state spending, because the US has balanced-budget laws. The result is that it is imposing an additional squeeze of about Dollars 50bn on an already depressed economy, since it has to cut spending as revenue falls; one reason why the promised economic recovery keeps getting later. Now the Treasury seems to be applying the same handbag economics to the UK national budget; spending must be cut because revenue is weak. This is likely to have the same result as in the US, in spite of the fact that the chancellor explained in his Budget speech that a rise in borrowing at a time of recession is not only to be expected but to be welcomed; it is an automatic stabiliser. Not if you switch it off, it isn't. There are three possible explanations for this, all of them bad. It could be just a recurrence of bad habits; Mrs Thatcher's intense distaste for public borrowing, even for productive investment, never did make sense. It could be nostalgia for 1981, when tight fiscal policy at a time of recession heralded a recovery, in defiance of 364 Keynesian economists. But the 1981 budget worked because under the market conditions of the time, it weakened a grossly overvalued pound. Now it is a prime objective of policy to keep the pound too strong for comfort, to the horror of six monetarist economists; so a tight budget cannot produce an external stimulus. Most probably, though, ministers are scared of a bad reception in the gilts market - a return of rule by the young men who write brokers' circulars, as Mr Denis Healey complained. They seem to be younger than ever now; some of the comments are evidently written by analysts who have no experience of any government borrowing at all, so they find all large numbers frightening. In fact, though, it is remarkably easy to borrow large sums in a recession, as the US Treasury has found, to its surprise and delight. A world financial market which can cheerfully accommodate some Dollars 300bn of US borrowing - a genuinely frightening figure - is hardly likely to choke over the odd Pounds 5bn of extra UK borrowing. It is time to revive a medium-term strategy within the meaning of Mr Lamont's speech - a plan for public spending designed to rise in line with the expected trend growth of the economy (or preferably a bit slower). Once he has such a plan, the chancellor should stick to it. He would rightly be condemned if he embarked on a spending spree just because the private sector was unexpectedly strong - that was how President Reagan got the US economy into chronic debt; but he should be just as firm in ignoring unexpected weakness and the market should understand this. Otherwise, public policy is prey to every shifting mood in the private sector, which is not a strategy of any kind. Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry is going in for its own kind of destabilisation. In pursuit of market transparency, it is showing an unhealthy interest in what goes on at brokers' corporate lunches. Again, the reasons sound sensible: the officials are afraid that brokers may get an inside tip about profit trends from the ho-hums and eyebrow-waggling which take the place of any hard information at these meals (a form of communication first perfected by the Bank of England). The DTI therefore urges boards to make a general profits announcement before they go out to lunch. However, companies can hardly issue revised forecasts every day, so the actual result is likely to be the same as that of the insider trading law it is meant to support - to keep honest men in ignorance. The sensible answer would be to repeal the insider trading law, since it is virtually unenforceable and gives innocent investors a false impression. This will not happen, though; it would offend the fashionable cult of the small investor. The City must seek some other remedy for the real damage the law does: it deprives the institutions, who control most of the shares, of the information they need to act as responsible shareholders. The good news is that some sensible ideas are beginning to emerge, though they have taken a long time to surface. Some insurance companies, and one or two issuing houses - notably BZW - are trying to devise a new form of intermediary; a committee which would represent big shareholders, but would not itself hold or trade in shares. Such a committee could demand management information without offending the law, and could be given the clout, by way of proxy votes, to get it. It could then insist that problem companies call in consultants to address particular problems; and logically, it could also demand the appointment of new directors, as we are already seeing at Granada. This would, incidentally, remove one main cause of the 'illogical' take-over bids on which the Select Committee on Trade and Industry will no doubt be pronouncing soon. The only trouble is that the DTI may soon get suspicious about these activities, and strangle the infant committees in red tape. One government department throwing out the baby with the bath water is more than enough.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 36 CAR THEFT SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN STING  </P> <P> Three dozen suspected car thieves were arrested early Thursday by Riverside  police and the California Highway Patrol after a yearlong sting operation in  which undercover agents bought stolen cars for a fraction of their retail  value.  </P> <P> Most of the suspects were from Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles  counties, CHP spokesman Mark Mezzano said. Another 27 suspects are being  sought.  </P> <P> The special auto theft task force -- set up to combat the theft of 250 cars a  month in and around the city of Riverside -- recovered 165 stolen vehicles by  buying them back from the thieves, Mezzano said. Thursday morning's raids were  conducted by 75 officers from both agencies.  </P> <P> While many of the stolen cars were used models, some were new and had been  stolen from sales lots. Mezzano said a 1989 Mercedes worth $80,000 was sold to  the undercover agents for $1,500. Some of the thieves returned time and again  to unload their cars, he said.  </P> <P> The undercover agents opened the "storefront" operation in downtown Riverside a  year ago and depended on word-of-mouth advertising among the thieves, Mezzano  said. The thieves were interested in a quick turnover, he added, explaining,  "We were paying $100 or $250 a car for most of them, take it or leave it."  </P> <P> The sting operation was funded by a special $90,000 grant from the California  Office of Criminal Justice Planning and $9,000 from the city of Riverside. The  operation was finally closed out and the arrests made when the sting ran out of  money, Mezzano said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita defended contributions that his  political organization received from a company at the heart of a political  scandal, saying the Recruit Co. donations were legal. Takeshita, under  increasing pressure in a scandal that has led to the arrest of 13 people and  the resignation of three Cabinet ministers, spoke to a parliamentary committee  in response to recent reports of huge donations to his organization from  Recruit. Newspapers have reported that Takeshita's political support group  received about $1 million from Recruit, a publishing and telecommunications  group, in 1986 and 1987.  </P></p>

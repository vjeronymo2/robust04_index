			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Swans song played out on proud Tyneside: Why the receivers have lost faith in the future of the shipbuilder If a committed workforce, a fine reputation and a proud history could guarantee a commercial future, the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter should be looking ahead with confidence. But none of these things can compensate for lack of orders, or for lack of the financial and political muscle on which orders may depend. This week's news from receivers Price Waterhouse that the prospects of sale as a going concern are remote, and that it would start considering offers for the piecemeal sale of assets, signals the end of Swan Hunter, barring some unexpected last-minute intervention. The impending closure is a body blow for the company's loyal and skilled workforce, its suppliers and Tyneside's economy. In the 1980s Swan Hunter underwent a radical change in working practices and heavy job losses. But no amount of pruning and workforce flexibility could overcome more fundamental difficulties. The management buy-out team which privatised Swans in 1986 did not have access to adequate financial reserves to withstand the reduction in UK defence orders - or the government's increasing emphasis on driving down costs and passing financial risks on to contractors by imposing large performance guarantees. The buy-out team knew it needed to break into export markets to reduce reliance on UK defence contracts, but in spite of expensive and sustained effort it failed to win export orders for new ships. But the Pounds 5m for which the government sold Swan Hunter to the buy-out team should have given pause for thought compared with privatisation prices of other warship yards in the mid-1980s. Vosper Thornycroft was sold for Pounds 18.5m, Yarrow for Pounds 34m and VSEL/Cammell Laird for Pounds 100m, with Pounds 60m payable initially. Within weeks of the buy-out Swans failed to win an order for a Ministry of Defence auxiliary oiler replenishment vessel. It went to Harland and Wolff in politically sensitive Belfast. In 1991, completion of the British Antarctic Survey ship cost Swans Pounds 17m, wiping out reserves. On receivership in May 1993 it had a net debt of Pounds 51m. Of the other privatised warship yards Yarrow on the Clyde has the financial security of being owned by the conglomerate GEC. VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has a financial cushion from its Trident nuclear submarine programme and a tactical alliance with Norwegian-owned Clydeside merchant shipbuilder Kvaerner which helped VSEL win the helicopter carrier whose loss sent Swans into receivership. On the south coast Vosper Thornycroft is underpinned by an extremely strong export performance. Cammell Laird in Birkenhead was closed by VSEL last year, after a failed search for a buyer. The government's insistence that it would like to see Swan Hunter survive, but must follow the rules of competitive tendering, has a hollow ring for Swans' supporters. They point to the guaranteed 12-year MoD refit workload promised last year to the Rosyth dockyard as evidence that, where the political will exists, rules can bend. They say that Swans, in a Labour-dominated area with only one Tory MP, has not enjoyed the support given to areas where the Conservatives have more at stake. Mr Peter Chapman, one of Swans' union campaigners, said: 'They'd prefer to sacrifice Trotter's seat rather than Rifkind's' The Edinburgh Pentland seat of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is not far from Rosyth. Nor has the government accepted the argument that Swans' closure will create monopolies in capability, driving up prices. None of Swans' competitors wants to be seen dancing on its grave but, quietly, the view is expressed that the shrinking MoD order-book could simply not sustain four warship yards. VSEL says orders from the government are enough to support a maximum of three. The question now is whether it can sustain that many.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PERJURY PROBE ASKED IN BEER-WORK CASE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County public works supervisor's denial that he granted overtime  work to employees in exchange for cases of beer prompted a Civil Service  Commission officer on Thursday to call for an investigation into possible  perjury.  </P> <P> Joe Bonilla, a bridge maintenance superintendent, had appeared at a three-day  hearing and refuted charges that he handed out the extra work assignments to  employees who brought him cases of Corona beer.  </P> <P> But after half a dozen workers testified that they took part in the  beer-for-work swap, hearing officer Arnold L. Faber questioned Bonilla's denial  and said that he had "never seen a witness so blatantly lie." He said he would  recommend that the district attorney investigate the case for possible perjury  charges.  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: George Michael case highlights age-old tension Sir, The George Michael case highlights an age-old tension in English law (Lex, June 22). On the one hand, the courts must respect and enforce contracts freely entered into. On the other hand, certain contracts in unreasonable restraint of trade are regarded as contrary to public policy and unenforceable. Generally, English law does not require that contracts be 'fair' or 'reasonable'. The main exceptions relate to certain categories of exclusion clause and restrictive (or non-compete) covenants. This is about to change in a significant way. From January 1 1995 the UK must have implemented an EC Directive on unfair contract terms in consumer contracts. This may not help artists in Mr Michael's predicament. However, businesses issuing terms of business to consumers will have to review these carefully to ensure that they are worth more than the paper on which they are often so microscopically printed. Nigel Miller, Fox Williams (Solicitors), City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU.</p>

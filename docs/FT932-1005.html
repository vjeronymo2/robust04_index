			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Lonrho's unstinting commitment to glasnost was underlined by the absence of the joint chief executive as the company announced its interim results yesterday. Doubtless, Mr Dieter Bock had long-standing business in Germany, but it is surely not beyond the wit of Lonrho to produce its figures and its leading lights at the same time. Nor do the results themselves give great confidence that things have changed. Most of the jump in profits came from the disposal of VAG, the UK Volkswagen distributor, rather than continuing operations. While the market took comfort from the company's Pounds 118m fall in net debt, that comes only after inflows from the rights issue and the VAG sale. Exceptional items apart, cash is still flowing out of the business. Lonrho's continuing businesses may only generate 4p of earnings this year, leaving the shares at a 50 per cent premium to the market. This valuation of the company as a sure-fire recovery prospect is optimistic. Neither mining nor hotels are likely to produce radically improved profits in the near future. Other hopes rest on Mr Bock's as yet unexplained strategy for Lonrho. But even if he is able to identify avenues for expansion, it is not at all clear how they might be financed. More debt is hardly an option and disposals will not provide enough cash for substantial investment. Appetite for further rights issues or paper-funded acquisitions may be limited, at least until there is clear evidence that the African leopard has finally changed its spots.</p>

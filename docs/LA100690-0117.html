			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINCESS DIANA VISITS FIRST LADY, TOURS CHILDREN'S AIDS CENTER  </P> <P> Princess Diana visited two First Ladies Friday -- one who lives in the White  House and another, only 3 years old, who is infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The younger "First Lady" earned her nickname because she was the first child  placed at Grandma's House, a home for children with the deadly virus.  </P> <P> The girl, dressed in bright pink overalls for the occasion, grabbed Diana's  hand when they were introduced. The princess scooped her up, carried her  upstairs during a tour of the Victorian row house and acquiesced when the girl  asked for a ride around the block in Diana's dark green Rolls-Royce.  </P> <P> As cameras flashed and whirred, the princess stepped out of the car with "the  First Lady" in her arms -- a symbolic picture that gratified the founders of  Grandma's House, who have kept its location unpublicized out of concern about  prejudice and fear.  </P> <P> "That kind of picture . . . a person of her stature coming . . . " said the  Rev. Debbie Tate, president of a crisis housing organization that runs  Grandma's House. "It shows that it's all right to love a person with AIDS, it's  all right to care about a person with AIDS, it's all right to hug a person with  AIDS. . . . It won't hurt you."  </P> <P> Diana's whirlwind trip, her second solo visit to the United States, ended less  than 24 hours after she arrived in the country.  </P> <P> She attended a gala Thursday night to benefit Grandma's House and ballet  companies in Washington and London, and she had coffee Friday morning at the  White House with Barbara Bush and others before her motorcade went to the  children's residence.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia has expressed its concern over the  apparent stalling by the American Congress in implementing  legislation necessary to complete the much-delayed Uruguay Round  of world trade negotiations. The Australian treasurer, Ralph  Willis, says he raised the matter during a meeting in Honolulu  with the American treasury secretary, Mr. Lloyd Bentsen. He  said he received an assurance that the legislation would  definitely be passed by July next year. The two men were in  Honolulu for the inaugural meeting of finance ministers of the  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Mr. Willis also said  that during the meeting some countries made it clear they were  not going to be pushed into too rapid liberalization of their  capital markets.    [Begin Willis recording] The Malaysians, for instance, have  made it clear that they believe they had already opened their  capital markets considerably and that they were concerned that  if they simply abandoned all control in the banking industry,  for instance, they could (?simply) be (?flooded) by foreign  capital. So, there is no arguing about the direction of change;  it was rather concerns being expressed by some of the developing  countries about the points at which they could cope with the  current liberalization of their economy.

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Unions hold off endorsing candidate MOST US unions have decided to stay uncommitted in today's Midwest Democratic primaries in Michigan and Illinois, despite intense lobbying from Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, for their endorsement. Twelve labour organisations which had previously supported Mr Tom Harkin, the left-wing Iowa senator who pulled out of the race last Monday, met in Washington last week to consider whom to back. But Mr William Byland, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers (UEW), said after the meeting that there was 'no chance of us endorsing anyone' before today's primaries. Some labour leaders are sympathetic towards Mr Brown, the only candidate to oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which some unions feel could endanger US jobs by encouraging companies to shift their factories to Mexico. However, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas has also won some union backing.</p>

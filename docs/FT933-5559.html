			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Boral makes bid for energy group BORAL, the Australian building products group, has accelerated its diversification into energy with a ADollars 759m (USDollars 512.8m) takeover bid for Sagasco, the South Australian petroleum group. Announcing the bid yesterday, Mr Bruce Kean, managing director, said Boral's net earnings for the year ended June had jumped 50.6 per cent to ADollars 228.9m on a 14 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 4.22bn. The dividend is set to rise to 18 cents from 16 cents a share. Mr Kean said Boral had paid ADollars 146.8m to acquire a 19.9 per cent stake in Sagasco from the government-controlled South Australian Government Financing Authority (Safa) and would bid ADollars 3.50 cash a share for the remainder. The bid is substantially in excess of the ADollars 2.70 a share offer which Santos, a rival South Australian petroleum group, made for Sagasco last year. The Santos bid failed to gain clearance from the Trade Practices Commission. Mr Kean stressed yesterday that he had been advised that Boral would have no problem in this area. Safa and Santos own 31.9 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively of Sagasco. Both indicated last night that they had yet to make a decision on the bid. Mr Lynn Arnold, premier of South Australia, said his government's eventual response would take account of the employment implications for the state. Boral directors said yesterday they did not expect to push through any rationalisation of Sagasco should the bid succeed. The acquisition of Sagasco would mean that about one-third of Boral's gross earnings would come from energy. Boral's earnings statement showed it spent ADollars 500m on acquisitions and capital expenditure last year. Mr Kean said the Sagasco purchase would be funded through debt and the flotation of Sagasco's manufacturing operations. AGL, another Australian energy group, indicated yesterday that it would be interested in some Sagasco assets if the Boral bid was successful. Mr Len Bleasel, AGL managing director, announced a 71 per cent increase to ADollars 70.6m in AGL's net earnings for the year ended June.</p>

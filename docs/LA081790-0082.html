			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAAS PLAYING IT BY THE NUMBERS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: YANKEE ROOKIE HAS STEPPED IN FOR INJURED DON MATTINGLY AND REWRITTEN  THE RECORD BOOK.  </P> <P> Kevin Maas signed the last baseball, finishing off a boxful, and moved aside as  Steve Sax took his place at a table in the New York Yankee clubhouse.  </P> <P> "Who's he?" Sax said, tossing his head in Maas' direction, where a baseball  card representative had intercepted him. "Yeah," Sax said, turning back to the  baseballs, "Put the (guy) in the Hall of Fame."  </P> <P> The razzing comes with the statistics. Kevin Maas, a 25-year-old rookie who has  stepped in at first base for injured Don Mattingly, hit 10 home runs in his  first 77 at-bats with the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> No one in major league history had reached 10 homers more quickly.  </P> <P> Maas hit a homer July 4 in his 15th at-bat, off the Kansas City Royals' Bret  Saberhagen.  </P> <P> He hit homers in three consecutive games, July 23-25, against the Texas  Rangers.  </P> <P> He hit his 12th homer off the Seattle Mariners' Erik Hanson, becoming the 21st  player to hit a ball into the Kingdome's upper deck, an estimated 448-foot  shot.  </P> <P> After 100 at-bats, he had 12 homers, tying a major league record.  </P> <P> After 110, he had 13, another record.  </P> <P> "I've been in stretches like this before," Maas said. "They don't happen all  the time, though. Not even once a year. It's not a fluke, put it that way."  </P> <P> As he prepared for one of the Yankees' games against the Angels at Anaheim  Stadium this week, Maas finished another piece of business and made his way to  his stall, where a few reporters waited. Greg Cadaret, a Yankee pitcher whose  stall was a few yards away, sniffed at the attention.  </P> <P> "What did you do? You haven't even played yet."  </P> <P> Maas laughed.  </P> <P> "That's part of it," he said. "You take it in stride. I can turn one cheek with  the best of them."  </P> <P> Maas, a Cal graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering, is adding a bit  of suspense to a season that has been unsuspenseful for the Yankees, at least  on the field.  </P> <P> A left-handed hitter, Maas has a swing that is built for Yankee Stadium, where  the right-field foul pole is only 310 feet from home plate, and right field is  353 feet away.  </P> <P> Seven of his homers have come at Yankee Stadium, one in every 7.4 at-bats.  </P> <P> Even when Maas was playing at double-A Albany in 1988, people were thinking  about it.  </P> <P> "I figured Yankee Stadium was the perfect place for him," said Deron Johnson,  the Angels' batting instructor who was then coaching at Albany. "He has a nice,  short swing and real strong hands. . . . He worked real hard. He knew where he  wanted to go."  </P> <P> Now, quickly it seems, he is there, and everyone wants a piece of him.  </P> <P> "It's been pretty crazy," Maas said. "That's an understatement. . . . My days  become very short. By the time I wake up to the time I go to bed, it seems like  a couple of hours. I'm certainly trying to stay focused on baseball."  </P> <P> After the series against the Angels, Maas is hitting .266 with 13 homers in 124  at-bats, with a slugging percentage of .605.  </P> <P> The question is whether this is the beginning of a long career or the start of  one that will be buried in the Baseball Encyclopedia, along with his name.  </P> <P> For now, Maas has hit a homer every 9.5 at-bats.  </P> <P> Babe Ruth hit one every 11.8 at-bats over the course of his career; Ted  Williams one every 14.8; Willie Mays one every 16.5; Hank Aaron one every 16.3;  Carl Yastrzemski one every 26.5.  </P> <P> The 10-homer record was held by George Scott, who needed 79 at-bats with the  Boston Red Sox in 1966 to do it.  </P> <P> The 13-homer record belonged to the Baltimore Orioles' Sam Horn, who needed 123  at-bats to reach that mark in 1987.  </P> <P> Mass is tied for most homers in a first 100 at-bats with the Texas Rangers'  Dave Hostetler, who did it in 1982.  </P> <P> Some names and numbers flatter, some do not.  </P> <P> "You don't build a career in a month and a half," Maas said. "You build it by  doing it every day.  </P> <P> "I'm really trying to play down what I've done. I still feel I have to prove  myself every day."  </P></p>

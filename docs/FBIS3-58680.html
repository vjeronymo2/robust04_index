European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and the political  group leaders today disapproved of the international press  attacks against the Greek presidency when it assumed its term of  office. Our Strasbourg correspondent Nikolaos Belos has the  following report:    [Begin Belos recording] European Parliament President Egon  Klepsch and the political group leaders in Strasbourg  disapproved of the international press attacks against the Greek  presidency when it assumed office. The issue was raised for  discussion by Mr. Klepsch at the European Parliament presidium.  He said that the criticism was condemnable and that he does not  accept prejudging the failure of a presidency before it even  begins. Mr. Klepsch added, following the discussions he had a  few days ago with representatives of the Greek Government in  Athens, that he believes that the presidency gives priority to  cooperation with the European Parliament and the other bodies of  the European Union.    Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group in the  European Parliament, described the Greek presidency as solid and  experienced and called the international press articles on the  alleged negative character of the Greek presidency impolite.  Referring to the Greek presidency's priorities, Mr. Cot  described them as correct because they cover economic and social  aspects of the European Union as they were determined within the  framework of the white paper. Mr. Cot also referred to the  European Union's foreign policy, which the presidency will  promote, and stressed that from his contacts in Athens with  leading members of the Greek presidency he has viewed the  experience and knowledge the Greek Government has on Balkan  issues. In conclusion, the socialist group leader expressed the  conviction that the Greek presidency aims at insuring peace and  security in the Balkans.    Participating in the discussion on the Greek side were the  two European Parliament vice presidents, Paraskevas Avyerinos of  PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and Yeorgyios  Anastasopoulos of New Democracy. They both stressed that the  international press attacks were not only against the government  but also against the Greek people. At the same time, they also  dealt a blow to the European Union institutions.    European Commission President Jacques Delors also criticized  the international press attacks against the Greek presidency  during his visit to Athens. [end recording]</p>

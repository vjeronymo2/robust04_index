			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (5): Recession takes its toll - Big-ticket leasing The British 'big ticket' market in financial leasing has been hit hard by the recession and appears reluctant to recover. The government's privatisation initiatives have provided vital new business for the big participants but even here evidence of new growth is patchy. With 'big ticket' loosely defined as in excess of Pounds 5m it is clear that few businesses felt able to take on such liabilities during the recession. In fact, 'big ticket' is often defined as in excess of Pounds 100m - and rising. Leased assets can now range from an entire production line to a new power station. The significant drop in UK investment, particularly in providing for expanding production with new plant, has been coupled with a restriction in the tax capacity of the banks. As the banks were the parents of many of the biggest names in the industry this acted to restrict supply to the market. The value of the market in the second quarter of 1994 was Pounds 245m, compared to Pounds 542m in the preceding quarter and Pounds 542m in the same quarter in 1993. The last quarter of 1993 reached Pounds 805m. In the 'big ticket' market, particularly, the Finance and Leasing Association's (FLA) call for this year's budget to reintroduce greater tax allowances, ideal for new investment in plant, will be welcomed. But in the short term the sector is flat, but not stagnant. 'At this stage in the recovery we would expect more big-ticket leasing. There is activity in some areas - aircraft, power and transport - but there is not the investment in green field sites that we had hoped to see,' says David Hardisty of the FLA. Like many in the industry Mr Hardisty looks to privatisation for growth and the government's much vaunted but slowly emerging Public Finance Initiative (PFI). In fact, the PFI is a repeat of history for the finance and leasing industry. Lombard Group, one of the leading participants, can trace its roots back to the North Central Wagon Co founded in 1861 to purchase and hire railway wagons for the coal-mining industry. Mr David Hardisty explains: 'Leasing is particularly suitable for privatised companies which may not be in a position to benefit from tax allowances themselves. 'Through a leasing arrangement capital allowances are accrued by the lessor as and when the expenditure on the project is incurred. The benefits of these are then passed back to the lessee through lease rentals. Leasing is one of the most efficient ways of using capital allowances. Tax losses can be turned into immediate benefits.' Throughout the industry the leading players reflect a picture of disappointing activity and a search for new forms of financial leasing. John Brown, founder of NWS Bank, and an executive director, characterises the market as one flushed with capacity but short on projects with a resulting tightening of margins for the lessors. However, he is more than optimistic that the sector will return to growth. He sees Japanese investment in the car industry in the UK, the privatisation of British Rail, and new stock for the London Underground as areas of potential new business. NatWest Markets is proud of its involvement in a Pounds 290m leasing facility for Humber Power for gas and electrical plant and machinery. Despite tough trading conditions it sees new opportunities in evidence: 'Inward investment is particularly encouraging especially from the Far East and is highlighted by the recent announcement from NEC Corporation and Samsung in respect of major investments in Scotland and the north-east respectively. 'The utility sectors remain an important area for the leasing industry as illustrated by NatWest Markets' recent involvement with Humber Power.' Peter Graham, joint managing director of Airstream Finances, leases 200 commercial aircraft on six continents. Despite a difficult trading period he notes that the market is hardening with a 15 per cent rise in rental rates in the past 12 months. Hill Samuel Asset Finance, one of the leading participants, has a strategy of 'added-value' big-ticket transactions and has seen a 'marked increase in business'. It points to successes in aircraft, ships, shopping centres, and accommodation for university students as well as financing for more traditional assets. 'The market place in general is seeing a slow recovery and is in need of an investment stimulus,' according to Anthony Jukes, managing director. He notes that it could be 'several years' before investment decisions move into 'spend mode'. Mr Jukes also notes that the OECD economies in general have now achieved low inflation with growth in GDP but that there remains concern that fixed asset investment is still showing little or no growth. 'This trait is particularly borne out in the UK where despite the low inflation conditions the number of instances of major new investment have been few and far between.' Mrs Anna Merrick, head of leasing at Abbey National Treasury Services, says that in the present interest rate regime margins favour lessees. Recent successes for Abbey National include part of a new rolling stock order of Pounds 150m for Network SouthEast. For John Carr, business director of Royal Bank Leasing, there 'is a huge potential in the public sector if only the key can be found'. He lists successful deals in recent months in leasing two Boeing 757s, and significant contracts with a water company.</p>

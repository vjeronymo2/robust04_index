			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Change of Course"] </F>   [Text] The election of metal workers union leader Vicente  Paulo da Silva, or Vicentinho, to head the Sole Workers Central  (CUT) represents an important renewal in the Brazilian labor  movement. The decision not to involve the labor central in PT  [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva's presidential campaign is not the only difference  separating the new leadership from the aggressive political  stance adopted by Jair Meneguelli for the past 11 years.    Vicentinho has confirmed the opinion of political scientist  Francisco Weffort of the PT, who "opposes corporatism." During  an interview with JORNAL DO BRAZIL, the new CUT president,  following the evolutionary line of the Brazilian labor movement,  defended his independence from the state and the need to end the  compulsory labor tax.    The compulsory contribution is inherited from Getulio  Vargas' New State interventionist policies. The labor policies  implemented by Vargas were inspired by Mussolini's fascist Carta  Del Lavoro and have influenced Brazilian labor legislation.  Through the labor compulsory tax, his policies prompted the  creation of both workers unions and managers unions.    The subordination to and tutelage of the state was the  greatest contradiction in a labor movement that is trying to be  modern and at the vanguard of Brazilian workers' thinking. By  suggesting that the CUT and affiliated unions should exist on  the voluntary contribution of their members, Vicentinho  introduced a risk component that must be extended to other  workers' federations and managers' unions.    The compulsory contributions of million of private workers,  public servants, and public company employees, which today  dominate the CUT, have been the main source of workers and  managers unions' economic and political power. Thus, it was not  strange to see acrid and even mortal disputes over these  considerable funds.    We must also note that the decision of the new labor leader  follows a Progressive Renewal Party proposal to create a  Congressional Investigating Committee to investigate CUT and PT  relations and the origin of the resources of the labor central.  By what authority does the PT condemn contributions by  managers' unions and companies to political campaigns if the CUT  maintains direct links with PT candidates?    The new order within the CUT does not preclude  investigations  into past activities. The CUT is the most powerful of the four  national labor federations. It embodies 2,235 urban unions and  741 rural unions, representing approximately 18 million workers  and has an annual budget of $11 million. The labor movement  needs to control its economic and political power and,  particularly, to prepare for the possibility of no longer being  in the opposition, but ready to become part of the ruling class.    The end of compulsory contributions will not rid the  Brazilian labor movement of fascist attitudes. It will also be  necessary to end the practice of deciding on strikes in  assemblies where only the most radical elements are represented.  Vicentinho wants more democratic assemblies and condemns the  practice of calling general strikes in public administrations  without very good reason. He suggests alternatives such as  strikes in key areas of a factory to stop the production process  without forcing everyone to stop work.    The Federal Supreme Court ruled that strikes will be illegal  in public service companies until Congress regulates Article 37  of the Constitution permitting strikes by public servants. This  and Vicente Paulo da Silva's presence at the head of the labor  central that rules over state companies' workers unions should  trigger changes in the labor movement. The new CUT president  has already said Brazil must not look merely inside, adding that  public workers must also realize that a wave of productivity and  efficiency is sweeping the world today.</p>

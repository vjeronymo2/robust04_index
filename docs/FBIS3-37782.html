			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS corespondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin called to hold a summit with leaders of four major NATO  members to "put an end to the Yugoslav conflict".    The Russian president said on Wednesday [23 February] that  he  believes it possible to sign a joint agreement between leaders  of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany  which would end the bloodshed in former Yugoslavia.    "Russia should more courageously and resolutely join the  European and world community and other international  organisations", Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath to  the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Wednesday in connection with  the Day of Motherland Defenders.    "Attempts of certain leaders to keep Russia away from  solving  international security issues is a discrimination. Russia has  to and will participate in all major international events as a  permanent member of the UN Security Council", the Russian  president stressed.    He added that the NATO decision to bomb Bosnian Serbs  "caused  indignation not only among Russian diplomats, but among all  citizens of Russia".    Russia had to resort to urgent measures which it had  proposed  to the United Nations a year ago. "The Russian leadership  recommended to the United Nations to take Sarajevo under its  administrative control as the most disputed city", Yeltsin said.    Russian contacts with Slobodan Milosevic and the trip of  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin to Bosnia averted the catastrophe,  according to the president.    "In contrast to NATO which announced an ultimatum to Serbs,  Russia requested the Serbs to pull back their heavy guns", the  president said adding that this was "a psycologically  well-thought out move which has worked".    To ensure safety of the Serbs Russia sent 400 peace-keepers  from Croatia to Sarajevo at a request of Milosevic. "Despite  heavy snow the guys arrived in Sarajevo in time", Yeltsin said.</p>

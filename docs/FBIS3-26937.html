Yang Song [2799 2646], vice chairman of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional People's Government, attended and spoke at  the meeting. Characteristics of this year's regional planning  meeting are that the meeting touched on both the intangibles and  tangibles. It was different from previous meetings both in form  and content. When holding the meeting, we changed our normal  practice that stressed investment allocation, project  formulation, and continued fulfillment of incomplete targets.  Instead, we concentrated our energies to analyze Tibet's  current economic situation and to predict changes in various  factors that will affect Tibet's future economic progress. We  also studied ways and means to resolve problems in accordance  with the tasks and objectives laid down by the regional economic  work meeting.    Attending the meeting were more than 170 people, including  commissioners and mayors from various prefectures and cities;  chairmen of planning and economic commissions; directors of  commodity price and labor bureaus; and responsible comrades of  Tibet's various commissions, offices, departments, and bureaus.    Wu Shunxiang [0702 7311 4382] and Ciren Doje [2945 0088 1122  0679], vice chairmen of the regional planning and economic  commission, respectively relayed the guidelines of the national  planning meeting and the national economic and trade meeting.  Sun Qiwen [1327 1477 2429], chairman of the planning and  economic commission, delivered a report entitled "Further  Liberate the Mind, Deepen Reform, and Open Wider to the Outside  World So As To Strive To Facilitate Sustained, Rapid, and  Healthy National Economic Development." He made arrangements to  implement the tasks laid down by the regional economic work  meeting. Meanwhile, he also proposed to further transform the  functions of planned administration so that planning tasks can  more effectively fulfill the requirements resulting from changes  in the new situation in an effort to enhance the establishment  of a new market economy. Additionally, attending comrades  discussed concepts and issues concerning Tibet's long-term  development programs by the year 2010. At the end of the  meeting, Xiang Yang [0686 2799], secretary of the regional  planning and economic commission party committee, gave a speech  entitled "Liberate the Mind and Change Concepts So As To Make  Fresh Contributions to Tibet's Reform and Progress."    The meeting pointed out: In accordance with the basic  requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, the  party Central Committee, the State Council, and Tibet have  formulated a series of important general and specific policies  and reform measures, and we are shouldering the important  historic mission of implementing them. While carrying out  reform and opening up, how to link up with other localities of  China and gear Tibet's economy toward the market are important  issues facing us as Tibet's economy is very backward. The  regional economic work meeting proposed that we should make new  progress and breakthroughs in enhancing Tibet's economic  development, in raising the per capita income of peasants and  herdsmen, and in building more markets. We should also make  major progress in village and town enterprises. All these tasks  are arduous.    We are facing the formidable reality that the work is new  with tough requirements and that the mission is demanding and  difficult. Xiang Yang, secretary of the regional planning and  economic commission party committee, proposed that our most  important task is to study. First, we should study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinsee  characteristics. We should also study the guidelines of the  14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. Moreover, we should integrate our  thinking and understanding with the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, and the Fifth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of  the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee.  Additionally, we should adhere to the party's basic line,  strictly concentrate our efforts on the central task of economic  construction, strive to develop the socialist market economy,  and further pursue Tibet's policy of reform and opening up.  Second, we should further study and properly implement various  general and specific policies that have been newly formulated by  the state and Tibet so that these policies can effectively  enhance Tibet's reform and progress. Third, we should intensify  our study of professional knowledge, which offers many topics.  We should study matters that we do not understand. If we are  in the dark, we should not guide others; otherwise, we cannot  handle our work competently. To further cultivate the  contingent of cadres and raise their professional skills, the  Regional Cadre Training Center plans to hold different study and  research classes on various vocations in 1994, and to engage  some experts and comrades with practical experiences from Tibet  and other localities to lecture in the classes so that our  professional skills can be considerably raised. These efforts  aim to fulfill the requirements for carrying out reform and  opening up and for establishing a new economic system in Tibet.</p>

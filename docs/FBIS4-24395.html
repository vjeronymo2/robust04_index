			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jinye (3769 6651 2814)] </F>   [Text] Jinan, 27 May (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong Yiren  pointed out during his recent inspection of Shandong: Large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises should treasure the present  good opportunity for development, work hard to improve their  operation, pay attention to market demand, do a good job in  terms of capital funding, material resources, technology,  qualified personnel, management, and quality and variety of  products, and truly play a leading role in the national economy.    Rong Yiren inspected Shandong and investigated the problems  of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises there from 19  to 26 May. During the inspection tour, he was accompanied  separately by Jiang Chunyun, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC  Committee; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and vice governor of Shandong Province; and Han Xikai,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. He  thoroughly familiarized himself with the situation of a dozen or  so enterprises in seven cities, including the Jinan Light  Motorcycle General Plant, the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation,  and the Yantai Beijixing Watch General Plant. He also inspected  the economic and technological development zones in Yantai and  Weihai. He fully affirmed the efforts and exploration made by  Shandong with respect to improving large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, and was satisfied with Shandong's  achievements in this regard. The present overall situation of  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in Shandong is  better than last year, though some of them still have  difficulties. In the first four months of this year, the total  output value of large and medium-sized enterprises in the  province rose 15 percent over the same period of last year,  while their combined total of profit delivery and tax payment  increased by more than 20 percent.    Rong Yiren pointed out: Village and town enterprises have  developed very rapidly and contributed to rural prosperity and  stability and to the economy as a whole in recent years.  Relatively speaking, large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises have been slower in development and suffering many  difficulties. We should know that if large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises are in poor condition and fail to play a  leading role in the economy, village and town enterprises will  be unable to maintain a sustained and healthy development. It  is understandable that the plant directors or managers of some  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are feeling the  pressure of difficulties. The promotion of the socialist market  economy at present is providing large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises with a very good opportunity for  development. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  have the edge in qualified personnel, technology, and equipment.  Some successful enterprises among them have set an example. I  believe that the cadres, workers, and staff members of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises are full of confidence and  they will work hard to make progress.    Rong Yiren emphatically pointed out: In order to improve  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should take  the road of reform to establish a modern enterprise system; we  should carry out coordinated reforms of the hiring, income  distribution, cadre, and other systems of the enterprises to  build a good mechanism which conforms to the socialist market  economy and fully arouses the enthusiasm of cadres and workers  for production; we should seriously change the mode of operation  of the planned economy and make great efforts to develop  marketable products of good quality, great variety, and low cost  according to market demand, and to eliminate inferior, outmoded  products promptly; we should establish the notion of large-scale  cooperation and abandon the practice of making an enterprise  all-embracing regardless of its size; and while keeping to a  main line of production, an enterprise should also engage in  diversified undertakings, and in this way, it will widen its  market and help resettle the surplus personnel resulting from  streamlining. Of course, we should not do things beyond our  reach, otherwise we will accomplish nothing.    During the inspection tour, Rong Yiren showed great concern  about and emphasized the scientific and technological progress  of enterprises. He said: Large enterprises should have their  own scientific research institutes, if conditions permit; this  is the way to accelerate the updating of products, increase the  scientific and technological contents of products, and enhance  competitive power in the market. Attention should be paid to  the training of enterprise workers and staff members so as to  improve the overall quality of enterprises. Using foreign  capital and advanced technology, particularly high technology,  is a good way to transform the large and medium-sized  enterprises. However, we should deal with reliable foreign  businessmen and guard against fraud. In the meantime, we must  not always trail behind others; instead, we should first learn  from others, and then make our own creations and surpass others.  He pointed out: We should put our own scientific and  technological achievements to good use. At present, many of  them have not been utilized; such a situation affects the  improvement of the quality of enterprises and their products and  restricts scientific and technological development.    On the circulating-fund shortage reported by some  enterprises, Rong Yiren pointed out: It is crucial to make  funds circulate and to distribute them well. Since the  state-supplied funds are limited, enterprises should mainly rely  on society and themselves. He said: At present, the circulation  of funds is too slow in quite a few enterprises. Enterprises  should pay more attention to careful calculation and strict  budgeting and to accelerating fund circulation. If they fail in  this regard, the development of our market economy will be  affected. The central authorities have already started to  rectify the debt chain problem among enterprises. He emphasized:  Enterprises must keep their word in business operations. They  must not repudiate a debt, nor resort to dishonest practices.  They must conduct business in an legitimate way and regard  honesty as the best policy. Only in this way will our socialist  market economy be vigorous and orderly.</p>

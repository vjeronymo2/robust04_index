			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Agency Quits Perrier: The San Francisco firm Hal Riney &amp; Partners, which  until recently created virtually all the ads for the troubled Perrier Group,  has resigned the account in which it created ads for several Perrier-owned  brands, including Arrowhead drinking water and Calistoga Sparkling Mineral  Water.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the agency was fired from the $5-million account that  created ads for Perrier Sparkling Mineral Water. "Perrier has been breaking up  the account into a lot of pieces," said John Yost, general manager at the  agency. "It seemed a good time to leave."  </P> <P> From Times Staff and Wire Reports  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY  </P> <P> It's high time that serious consideration is now being given to raising taxes.  </P> <P> Those people who would also cut entitlements, however, must think that some of  us live on another planet! We who receive Social Security or federal annuities  live here and spend money, too. We would end up paying twice. Not only will our  tax payments go up but our incomes would go down. To be fair, taxes should be  raised but entitlements should be left alone.  </P> <P> EDWARD C. HOWATT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

Zambia Institute of Bankers (ZIB) president Mr Bill Fearon  said in Lusaka yesterday the apparent unlimited liberalisation  of the economy, especially on essential goods, had made Zambia a  stepping stone through which traffickers converted "illicit  dirty money" into hard currency.    The converted currency was then ploughed back into the  illicit business which enabled traffickers to finance further  trade and repeat the "whole horrible exercise," Mr Fearon said.    He was opening a Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) workshop  on money laundering at Barclays Bank Training Centre sponsored  by the Bankers Association of Zambia.    He noted that the opening of foreign exchange bureau had  contributed to the flourishing of money laundering because there  was "nothing to effectively prevent unscrupulous person going  from one bureau to another externalising and cleansing dirty  money," he said.    "It is obvious the use of scarce foreign currency resources  in this way for a poor country like Zambia can only do further  damage to the economy and eventually the living standards," said  Mr Fearon who is African Commercial Bank managing director.    Although it was widely believed that Zambia was used as a  back-door entrance to drugs to the south, there was a "high"  possibility there were manufacturers, suppliers and even  couriers of drugs in Zambia.    Such people were getting their profits back into the country  in form of luxury cars and non-funds or under-invoiced imports.    "It is frankly unlikely that we as bankers can easily  identify such persons through a routine monitoring of their  account activity," Mr Fearon said.    He appealed to Government to review the Bankers Book  Evidence  Act because the present one did not protect banks from suit if  they disclosed the information about customers' account without  a court order.    If drug traffickers succeeded in hiding and prospering  behind  the free market environment, "then we need to question whether  we have not gone too far in the quest for liberalisation."    Even in developed countries, monitoring and checks on money  movement were still in force.</p>

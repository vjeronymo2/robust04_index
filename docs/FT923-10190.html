			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Stricter company policing is sought THE CADBURY committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance should give greater consideration to enforcement, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said yesterday. The institute called in a submission which broadly supported the Cadbury report for greater detail on how the Stock Exchange will ensure that non-compliance with the proposed code is publicised. It said a number of improvements should be made before the final version of the report is published later this year. The institute argued that the onus is on a company's auditor to demonstrate its independence, adding that an auditor should disclose more information on the services it provides in addition to auditing, as well as its fees. The institute said large private companies should be encouraged to abide by the code, which is directed at public companies. It emphasised the importance of the need for a continuous review of the effectiveness of implementation of the code. The institute added that greater consideration should be given to the informal ways in which financial information is passed on to analysts, to ensure that there is equal access for all participants in the market. The institute also emphasised that Cadbury should steer clear of the idea of two-tier boards - in which executive and non-executive directors are seen as working separately - and stress the importance of unitary boards, where the two work together.

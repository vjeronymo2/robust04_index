			<p>Chinese      media in recent weeks have given increased attention to  efforts to create a modern national information infrastructure.  Several meetings have been held to discuss projects to develop an  "information highway," government officials and industry leaders  have expressed their views in the press, and a State plan is being  formulated.  Some individual projects have already been begun or  completed.  U.S. firms are providing foreign technology, expertise  and investment capital.      The "Three Golden Projects"      China's information highway program is part of the "Three Golden  Projects," a national information infrastructure initiative  announced last year by the Ministry of Electronics Industry.  Minister Hu Qili, in a national telephone conference on 2 July 1993,  said that the domestic electronics industry would concentrate on  three major projects, titled the Golden Bridge, the Golden Card, and  the Golden Customs.  The Golden Bridge is a national public  information network connecting ministry- and provincial-level  specialized databases, the Golden Card is a payment system for bank  credit cards, and the Golden Customs is an economic information  network for foreign trade (CHINA DAILY 3 Jul 93).  The projects are  aimed at permitting paperless commerce and electronic data  interchange through government-established information industry  projects (KEJI RIBAO 4 Mar 94).      National Meetings, Media Attention      Increased public attention to the Three Golden Projects began in  early March.  A signed article in the S&amp;T paper KEJI RIBAO, on 4  March, noted that the government "is paying increasing attention" to  the development of an indigenous information industry and that  "Party and government leaders have issued numerous major statements  on the topic, and officials have begun formulating appropriate  strategies and plans," such as the Three Golden Projects.  On 12  March, the same paper reported that it had sponsored a symposium the  previous day for information highway experts.  It said that  government, industry, and academic participants had agreed that  China should accelerate its planning and increase financial support  for the projects.      The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), some 10 days  later, sponsored a forum in Beijing on "building China's high-speed  information networks."  According to KEJI RIBAO, academicians from  the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), professors, senior engineers,  and high-level managers from the fields of computers,  communications, and automation offered their proposals for the  development of information highways.  Officials from the ministry's  Planning Department and Directorate General of Telecommunications  spoke on the status and development plans for the national networks.  The ministry's Science and Technology Committee chairman, Song  Zhiyuan, announced that China's information highway program will  consist of two major components-- communications platforms in the  public sector and application information systems in the government  and other official sectors (KEJI RIBAO 25 Mar 94).      The following month, more details on China's information  infrastructure plans were laid out by Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications Wu Jichuan, in an article in RENMIN RIBAO on 13  April.  Wu stressed that the creation of a nationwide economic  information network was essential to the establishment of the market  economy and reported that the Chinese Government had made "an  important policy decision" to establish such a network.  He reviewed  the development of the State telecommunication facilities over the  past 10 years and maintained that the information network could be  established on this foundation.  Noting that his ministry is  responsible for building the infrastructure of the country's  telecommunication networks and providing services to all economic  sectors, Wu concluded that the ministry should map out a development  plan and "speed up the building of public telephone networks,  packet-switching public data networks, digital data networks, and  mobile telecommunication networks, to provide a highly efficient,  high-capacity information transmission channel and reliable  telecommunication platform in support of" the Three Golden Projects  and other information processing systems.      The same day Wu's article was published, KEJI RIBAO reported that  CAS's Bureau of Technological Science had established an  interagency, interindustry expert group for "policy and research on  developing domestic high-speed information networks."  As group  director, CAS assigned Beijing Posts and Telecommunications  University optoelectronics authority and CAS academician Professor  Ye Peida.  Professor Chen Junliang was appointed vice-director (KEJI  RIBAO 13 Apr 94).      In early May, Wu Jichuan was quoted again, in two Chinese news  agency reports, on his ministry's plans for an information highway.  The first report, on 5 May, said that Wu had addressed a "recent"  symposium, attended by senior Chinese officials and information  experts.  Wu indicated that China is watching the latest  developments in information highway construction abroad and will  carry out its own development in a planned and systematic manner.  He said China will expand the application of computers in digital  telephone exchanges, accelerate laying of fiber-optic cables, and  build an internet by developing a network telecommunications  platform based on the country's public telecommunications network.  He pointed out that the construction of the information highway will  require joint efforts by participating departments.      The 5 May report reviewed the status of China's  telecommunications development, reporting that:      --China is building 22 national-level fiber-optic cable trunk  lines, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and medium-sized  satellite communications ground stations.      --The high-capacity digital transmission network connecting the  nation's major provincial capitals will be completed early in 1995.      --First-phase construction of a nationwide digital packet-  switching network, known as Chinapac, was completed last September.  At present, the network extends to 267 of China's major cities and  has started to exchange information with 37 centers in 20 countries.      --The first-phase project of the high-speed digital trunk line  network connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be put into  operation this July.  A cellular phone network covers the coastal  provinces in the Southeast and some central provinces.      --China's 700,000 mobile telephones will soon be linked by a  nationwide network.      --China's 7 million radio pagers have made the country one of the  world's largest paging markets.      As another step in the construction of the information  superhighway, according to the report, China plans to accelerate  high-tech research in information modernization, especially advanced  remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities, and  modern telecommunications technologies (XINHUA 5 May 94).      The second news agency report, a week later, quoted Minister Wu  as saying that, by the end of the century, China will finish  building a major telecommunications network composed of 16 fiber-  optic cable trunk lines covering all the provincial capitals and  connected with international networks.  He also reported that the  Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for telecommunications development  has been initially drafted and that it gives priority to  construction of long-distance fiber-optic cables (XINHUA 12 May 94).      Other Comment from Government and Industry Officials      Other government officials have also been calling attention to  the importance of building a national information infrastructure  within the overall Three Golden Projects:      --Ji Fusheng, chief engineer in the State Science and Technology  Commission's Department for Basic Research and High Technology,  wrote that, up to the year 2020, information technology will remain  a hot topic and be a key to international competition.  He said  China is capable of leapfrogging advanced nations in the race  towards an information highway, but it must be practical and  realistic, charting out its path according to market demand.  The State has already taken some steps in the Three Golden Projects,  such as providing support from the 863 Program (China's high-tech  research and development program) for research on high-speed  parallel computing and high-speed communications, but this is only a  beginning (KEJI RIBAO, 1 Apr 4).      --State Information Center Vice-Director Wu Jiapei wrote that  China's present level in information technology, 30-40 years behind  that of the United States, must be raised significantly for the  nation to remain competitive.  He advocated that the Three Golden  Projects be market-driven, nongovernment investment be encouraged,  and an entrepreneurial spirit incorporated in the projects.  He  noted that the government has invested over 20 billion yuan ($2.3  billion), which went for construction of a dozen-odd major  information systems, and is investing an additional 50 billion yuan  ($5.75 billion) for construction of information systems at as many  as 10,000 firms (KEJI RIBAO, 16 Apr 94).  (By comparison, the output  value of China's entire information services industry in 1991 was  only a few billion yuan ($250-500 million), compared to $203 billion  for the entire world; in that year, the percentage of China's GNP  occupied by information products and services was only one-tenth  that of the average for all nations (KEJI DAOBAO Feb 94).)      Industry leaders have also publicly discussed the need for the  development of a modern information infrastructure.  For example:      --Beijing Guolian S&amp;T Enterprises Ltd. General Manager Zhou Xiwei   advocated the gradual modernization of existing information systems,  noting that there should be a plan that would encourage stronger  firms to take chances on exploratory projects (KEJI RIBAO 4 Mar 94).     --The Three Golden Projects were endorsed in articles by Ni  Guangnan, chief engineer at the Legend Group, one of China's  foremost computer companies, (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO 21 Mar 94) and  Beijing Huaxun Communications Development Corporation Governor Dai  Huanzhong (KEJI RIBAO 21 Apr).      Details on Specific Projects      Since the Three Golden Projects were announced last year, the  media have provided details on some specific projects, relevant to  the development of a modern Chinese information infrastructure, that  have been given priority by MPT.      An electronics publication reported that among the critical  issues in determining the development course of China's fiber-optic  communications technology in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995),  one of the most important was the inclusion of Synchronous Digital  Hierarchy (SDH) tasks.  After sufficient investigation, the ministry  decided to include the following projects: STM-1 (155 megabits/s  (Mbps) and STM-4 (622 Mbps), as well as digital cross-connect (DXC)  equipment and 565 Mbps (DS5) fiber-optic cable communications system  technologies, all of which have been studied and which are to be  made more utilitarian.  The ministry's Institute Five and Wuhan  Institute of Posts and Telecommunications have been the leading  organizations in optical SDH research.  Simultaneously, the State  863 Program's Optoelectronics Topical Area and a recently formed  "Communications High Technology" Expert Topical Area have worked  toward development of STM-16 (2.5 gigabits/s) optical communications  systems (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 29 Nov 93).      The following month, the same publication described the 22 fiber-  optic cable trunk lines, later mentioned by Minister Wu, that form a  national backbone with Beijing as the hub, pointing toward the East,  West, South, North, and Central China.  The construction plan is as  follows:      --Beijing-to-Northeast: Two fiber-optic cable trunk lines-  -Beijing-Tianj in-Shenyang-Changchun-Harbin and Beijing-Chengde-  Fuxin-Baicheng-Qiqihar--and four branch lines have formed a mesh  network covering the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan economically developed  region and the three Northeast provinces, as well as the eastern  part of Inner Mongolia.      --Beijing-to-Southeast/Seacoast: The Beijing-Tianjin-Nanjing and  Nanjing Shanghai fiber-optic cable trunk lines are being linked to  the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou fiber-optic cable trunk line forming a  Southern Seacoast Economic Development Area information network.      --Beijing-to-Central China/South: Two Beij ing-Wuhan-Guangzhou  fiber-optic cable trunk lines--one overhead, one buried--are being  built and will be interconnected with the Southern Seacoast fiber-  optic cable trunk line and the Northwest fiber-optic cable trunk  line into a backbone.      --Beijing-to-Northwest/Southwest: Three optical cable trunk  lines--Beij ing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou, Beijing-Taiyuan-Xian, and  Xian-Lanzhou--are forming a ring network extending westward to  Urumqi and eventually farther west to Yining.  The Chengdu-  Chongqing-Guiyang-Changsha-Nanchang-Fuzhou/Hangzhou fiber-optic  cable trunk line and the Chengdu-Kunming, Kunming-Nanning, Nanning-  Guangzhou, and Guangzhou-Haikou fiber-optic cable trunk lines (which  form a chain that has linked up the Southwest in a large ring)  together have formed a mesh network covering the Southwest.      --Fiber-optic cables spanning South-Central China and the East:  Wuhan-Chongqing, Xuzhou-Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou-Xian, Xian-Chengdu and  other fiber-optic cable trunk lines are being built.      All of these trunk lines, totaling 32,000 kilometers in length,  will be completed by the end of 1995, and will be interconnected  with 20 interprovincial digital microwave trunk lines and 19  satellite earth stations to form a three-dimensional nationwide  digital communications trunk line network (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 6  Dec 93).      According to an article in RENMIN RIBAO, some of these trunk  lines are part of the Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable project,  proposed and launched by MPT.  In 1992, the 11 nations along the  proposed route signed an "Agreement to Construct an Asia-Europe  Fiber-Optic Cable" and formed the Asia-Europe Fiber-Optic Cable  Management Commission.  The main cable runs f rom Shanghai through  China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran,  Turkey, Ukraine, Poland, and terminates in Frankfurt, Germany, while  a branch leads to Tajikistan--a total length of 16,000 kilometers.  Completion of the project and operational date are now set for the  first quarter of 1996.  Within China, the cable links Shanghai with  Xian, Lanzhou, Urumqi, and the Kazakhstan border.  So far, the line  from Xian eastward has been completed, while that from Xian westward  is scheduled for completion in 1995.  The Asia-Europe fiber-optic  cable member states are to meet in Germany this June to negotiate  cable sales and usage by the various countries (RENMIN RIBAO 28 Feb  94).      Recently, information was released on the completion of China's  first major 565 Mbps (DS5) fiber-optic communications trunk line-  -Shanghai-to-Nanjing.  This project, undertaken jointly by MPT's  Design Institute, the Wuhan Institute of Posts and  Telecommunications Science, and the China Communications  Construction Corp., is based on an extension of the Shanghai-Wuxi  DS5 experimental cable, which has passed acceptance tests.  The  Shanghai-Nanjing cable, almost 400 kilometers in length, has a main  channel capacity of 15,360 simultaneous voice circuits, with 720  voice circuits for interdistrict communications (KEJI RIBAO, 18 Apr  94).      The nationwide public digital data services network announced by  Minister Wu is a crucial element of the Three Golden Projects.  For  this network, China will import from Canada a model 3600 bandwidth  management system and from the United States some DACS II-2000 DXC  equipment.  DXC node computers will be installed in 24 provinces and  municipalities nationwide.  The main channels of this network are  scheduled to be completed and operational in July 1994, with full  project completion by early 1995.  Network users will be provided  with channels for data/image/videoconference digital transmission  services at a variety of bit rates up to and including 2 Mbps (DS1),  and will have transprovincial transmission capabilities via public  telecommunications networks, packet-switching networks, and local-  and provincial-level digital data services networks now being built  (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 21 Mar 94).      Several sources have reported on the development of Chinapac, the  new national backbone network, consisting of 5,540 ports, which  covers capital cities of all mainland provinces and autonomous  regions as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,  and Chongqing, and can be connected with the public telephone  network to cover all of China's cities and counties.  After five  months of trial operation, the final form of Chinapac passed the  joint MPT/Northern Telecom acceptance tests on 5 February 1994.  The  eventual 20,000 ports--including those in local public data networks  now being built throughout China and due to start operation by early  1995--can be connected via fiber-optic, digital microwave, and  satellite links to international gateways in Beijing, Shanghai, and  Guangzhou for interconnection with 26 packet-switching public data  networks in the United States, Japan, France, Germany, the ROK,  Sweden, Italy, and eight other countries.  This final form of  Chinapac, consisting of 32 nodes and eight tandem centers with a  throughput of 6400 packets/s, provides basic services such as  switched virtual circuit ("virtual call") and permanent virtual  circuit.  Chinapac also provides specialized services such as  electronic mailbox, electronic data interchange, videotex, Teletex,  database searches, fax storage and relay, virtual dedicated  networking, broadcasting, IBM/SNA (Systems Network Architecture)  networking, token-ring LAN intelligent bridging, and asynchronous  datagram interfacing.  Since trial operation commenced on 1  September 1993, over 500 users and 16 nationwide groups have joined  Chinapac, which has carried an average monthly load of 31 million  fields (JISUANJI SHIJIE, 11 Aug 93; CHINA DAILY, 2 Sep 93; ZHONGGUO  DIANZI BAO, 25 Feb 94).      Beijing Guolian S&amp;T Enterprises Ltd. is now developing China's  first electronic data interchange network.  The network's data  processing center consists of 50 supermicrocomputers forming a  parallel distributed information processing system supplying 260,000  user terminals nationwide with real-time searches.  This network's  first-phase project--a book/newspaper/magazine data transmission  service network--is now taking shape.  The network's data input  center can store 7.5 million Chinese characters daily; it can  quickly enter abstracts and subject records from Chinese periodicals  into the network's database for servicing user searches (KEJI RIBAO,  4 Mar 94).      Saishite Electronics Ltd., in Shenzhen, pioneered domestic batch  production of fiber distributed data interface cards--often called  the heart of computer "data highways," or high-speed (100 Mbps)  LANs--beginning in September 1993.  These cards were jointly  developed by Chinese and U.S. scientists and have been authenticated  by the Federal Communications Commission (KEJI RIBAO, 5 Jan 94).   The Shanghai paper WEN HUI BAO reported on the completion of a  project closely related to the Three Golden Projects--a satellite  digital transmission network, called a "Space Highway Network" or  "Information Bridge," based at the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  The  network was developed, designed, constructed, and put on-line by  Shanghai Gaozhi S&amp;T Development Company, a Shanghai Caohejing New  Technologies Development Zone high-tech firm, along with its partner  Shanghai Xinhua Computer and Electronic Information Company.  It  provides instantaneous (0.5 s) synchronous transmission of stock and  economic information from the exchange to over 1000 small satellite  earth stations nationwide, many of them hundreds or thousands of  kilometers away.  The network also has been used for newspaper fax  transmission.  It has been in operation for six months and relies on  a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to relay information (WEN HUI  BAO, 4 Apr 94).      High-Tech Help from U.S. Firms      Chinese media have taken note that the Three Golden Projects are  receiving equipment, technical assistance and investment capital  from U.S. high-tech firms, especially 3Com, Motorola, IBM, and AT&amp;T.       --XINHUA reported that Eric Benhamou, President of 3Com  Corporation and Chairman of the American Electronics Association's  National Information Infrastructure Task Force, announced, at a 28  April 1994 seminar in China on building information superhighways  for the next century, that 3Com will shortly set up a representative  office in Beijing to help develop a pool of networking expertise in  China (XINHUA 28 Apr 94).      --Motorola Corporation will expand its production of pagers in  China by at least 50 percent this year in order to tap the potential  of the local market.  There is plenty of room for expansion in this  market, since China has 400 million city dwellers but only 10  million pagers.  There are about 3 million Motorola pagers in use in  China at present; this represents a third of the Chinese pager  market, with most of the rest going to Japan's NEC and some Chinese  manufacturers from Guangdong Province (CHINA DAILY, 5 May 94).      --Motorola signed a US$125 million contract with Beijing Kaiqi  Communications Corp. to supply Asia's first 800-MHz all-digital  trunking communications network.  Kaiqi will import a MIRS (Motorola  Integrated Radio System) frequency-division multiplexing/time-  division multiple access (FDM/TDMA) cellular mobile communications  network, integrating telephone, fax, voice mail, simple information  services, and computer data transmission.  The network will cover  Beijing Municipality with a capacity of 100,000 users (ZHONGGUO  DIANZI BAO, 28 Mar 94).      --On 3 May in Beijing, IBM announced it will invest at least $100  million in the Three Golden Projects.  It will be the first foreign  company to be involved in the Golden Bridge Project.  The deal comes  under a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 28 April in the United  States between IBM and the Ministry of Electronics Industry during  Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit.  In the first project, IBM  and Jitong Communications Corp. will set up a Beijing-based joint  venture to produce networking technologies.  In the first phase, it  will help design and install regional communications networks and  link them into a national system.  Under the agreement, IBM will  establish a wholly-owned software development center in Shanghai to  develop system and application programs for the domestic and foreign  markets.  It will also set up three open system networking centers  in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.  In return, China has pledged  to use IBM's PowerPC platform as one of the major microprocessors in  planning the country's future (CHINA DAILY, 4 May 94).      --On 7 and 8 May, AT&amp;T signed two contracts to supply state-of-  the-art transmission and other equipment to the Beijing  Telecommunications Administration.  The deals, totaling more than  $20 million, will give the city the largest and most sophisticated  digital transmission network in China.  Under the contracts, AT&amp;T  will provide fiber-optic transmission equipment operating at SDH's  STM-16 rate (2.488 gigabits/s) and a set of advanced network  management and surveillance systems to monitor and manage the  communications network.  With the equipment, Beijing can offer  advanced telecommunications services and have the flexibility to  move forward with new services, according to Beijing officials.  Zhang Ligui, director general of the Beijing Telecommunications  Administration, said the signing of the two agreements signifies  that cooperation between AT&amp;T and Beijing has entered a new stage.  AT&amp;T currently has nine joint ventures in China (CHINA DAILY, 9 May   94).     (AUTHOR:  THOMAS TORDA.

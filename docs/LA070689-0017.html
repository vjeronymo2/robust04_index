			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR  </P> <P> The mother of twins allegedly abused and abandoned by her boyfriend at a Del  Mar hotel was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail for child endangerment.  </P> <P> As her parents looked on, Dorothy DeSimone, 25, of Oceanside, was taken into  custody.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge John Thompson said he was rejecting the county  Probation Department's recommendation that she be committed to state prison.  </P> <P> Her boyfriend, Charles McCoy, 27, of Oceanside, is awaiting a preliminary  hearing July 14 on multiple charges involving the battering of the twins, now  3, at the Del Mar Inn on March 25.  </P> <P> Thompson remarked that DeSimone knew or should have known the risk of allowing  McCoy to have contact with the children. "She put these children at risk and  knew (McCoy) had a propensity for violence," said the judge.  </P> <P> Her attorney, Kirk Migdal, urged the judge to impose credit for the 87 days  already spent in jail, and no further jail time, but that was denied.  </P> <P> Thompson also placed DeSimone on five years' probation and ordered that she  have no contact with the twins -- who are in a foster home -- without an order  from him and Juvenile Court.  </P> <P> Thompson also forbade DeSimone from contacting McCoy while on probation.  </P> <P> DeSimone pleaded guilty to child endangerment, a felony, May 9. She could have  received six years in prison and a $10,000 fine, but the prosecution did not  ask for prison time.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said DeSimone had been warned about McCoy  because one twin's leg was broken in January, 1988, and it was suspected that  he caused the injury. Migdal said DeSimone was in love with McCoy at that time  and did not suspect he would do such a thing.  </P></p>

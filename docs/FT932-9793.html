			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Billiton gives promise of new life on international stage GENCOR has for years been searching for assets that would provide it with the core of a substantial business outside South Africa. 'We have kissed a lot of frogs but not one has turned into a princess,' is the way Mr Derek Keys, the former chairman, summed up this apparently hopeless quest. But now the search is over. Gencor believes Billiton, a mining and metals company with a 114-year history but which has been buried within the Royal Dutch Shell oil group since 1970, has all the necessary qualifications. Ironically, although virtually every other oil company has baled out of mainly disastrous forays into mining and metals, Shell seemed determined to persevere with Billiton even though low metal prices and various write-downs and provisions pushed it into a Dollars 75m (Pounds 48m) net loss last year against a Dollars 12m profit in 1991. However, Gencor's unsolicited offer, which analysts suggest was probably more than the Dollars 1.8bn book value of the Billiton assets, was too attractive for Shell not to give it serious consideration. If everything went smoothly, Gencor eventually would have interests in two mining and metals businesses. The one in South Africa would retain most of the group's assets there - including those producing gold, platinum, coal, manganese, chrome, ferro-alloys, stainless steel, aluminium, and granite. Billiton would be used to create a second, publicly-quoted international group mining gold, nickel and zinc in six countries, with exploration activities all over the world, a global metals marketing and trading network, and joint ventures in alumina refining in Brazil, Australia and Surinam and aluminium smelting operations in Brazil. To this Gencor would add its existing operations outside South Africa - 25 per cent of Consolidated Rutile in Australia and nearly 100 per cent of Sao Bento in Brazil and, probably, its half-share of Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa. This would be a medium-sized mining and metals group in world terms and without a comparable rival, although it would have some similarity to Minorco, owned by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.</p>

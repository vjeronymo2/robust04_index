			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Labour outlines shadow Budget Labour yesterday fore-shadowed an alternative Budget designed to rebuild the economy and ease the impact of tax increases on less well-off people. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the alternative Budget would demonstrate how the government could avoid implementing the second phase of the increase in value added tax on domestic fuel, which is planned for April. He said the increase in VAT from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent could be replaced by revenue raising from several other sources, including a windfall levy on the 'excess profits' of the regional electricity companies. Mr Brown said the companies' forecast profit of Pounds 3.5bn on the sale of the National Grid was an example of how 'some people are making windfall bonuses at the expense of pensioners and others'. Mr Brown told BBC Television that the alternative Budget would include a building programme financed by the release of capital receipts from council house sales held by local authorities. He said other measures would include: An energy-efficiency programme, intended to create employment for building workers, which would be self-sustaining in the long term. A training programme for the unemployed. A National Insurance holiday for employers prepared to employ the long-term unemployed. A review of childcare costs and social security benefits to help people back to work. Mr Brown said: 'We need a programme to rebuild Britain. You can't do this unless you recognise that there is a huge problem which is costing us . . . billions of pounds in unemployment and social security benefits.'</p>

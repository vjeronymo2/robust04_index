			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Danone looks at Colman's food and drinks side Groupe Danone is studying a possible acquisition of the Colman's food and drinks businesses of the UK's Reckitt and Colman, a spokesman for the French food group said yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris. According to the spokesman, the study is at an early stage. He said it was natural that Danone would be interested in buying an important force in its own markets when the opportunity arose. The possibility of the acquisition of Colman's follows the decision by Reckitt and Colman to sell assets to finance its Dollars 1.55bn acquisition of L&amp;F Household, a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak of the US. Industry observers estimated that the Colman's food and drinks operations, which include well-known brands such as Colman's mustards and Robinson's soft drinks, are worth between Pounds 250m (Dollars 395m) and Pounds 300m. Colman's operations would complement Danone's existing businesses. The French group is the market leader in mustards in France and already owns the Maille and Amora brands. Each of these brand lines achieves annual sales of about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 220m). Danone, however, is just one of the companies thought to be interested in the acquisition of Colman's. Corn Products of the US and Ranks Hovis McDougall of the UK are also considered likely candidates.</p>

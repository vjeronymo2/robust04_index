			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Astra surprises with 2.7% fall after results PHARMACEUTICAL stocks came under renewed pressure yesterday, partly on worries over US proposals to regulate prices, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM went negative on Astra, even although the pharmaceutical group reported better than expected 1992 results and the B shares lost SKr19 to SKr675 in high turnover. Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank in London, commented that some investors may have taken account of the significantly large contribution that foreign exchange gains made to the figures, while others may have been disappointed at the absence of a scrip issue and ignored the 60 per cent rise in earnings per share. The Affarsvarlden general index was up 3.50 to 996.00 at the close but, in post-close trading in London, further selling of Astra left the Swedish component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 down 21.48 at 943.60. ZURICH was also undermined by some heavy selling of pharmaceutical stocks, particularly by US investors. The SMI index dipped 11.5 to 2,095.8. Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, SFr16 lower at SFr614, led the downtrend, followed by Roche certificates, which shed SFr80 to SFr4,010. Conversely, a firm bond market and a new round of cuts in cash bond rates gave some support to banks and insurers. CS Holding rose SFr10 to SFr1,140 and UBS bearers added SFr2 to SFr943. FRANKFURT extended last week's themes as business slowed with the start of the carnival season. Weakness in carmakers and strength in banks almost cancelled each other out, and the DAX index rose just 3.35 to 1,680.74 in turnover down from DM9.4bn to DM5.4bn. Bearish car registration and production data issued late last week left Volkswagen DM8 lower at DM270.80, Daimler off DM6.20 at DM604.80 and BMW down DM9.20 at DM503.30. Banks reflected rising interest rate optimism as the Bundesbank's average bond yield fell 10 basis points to 6.60 per cent; Deutsche Bank led with a gain of DM12 to DM697. PARIS opened the new account broadly positive as last week's hopes of lower European interest rates, given encouragement by good German economic data on Friday, spurred further buying. The CAC-40 index closed up 22.00 at 1,959.23, but off the day's high of 1,967.14 in turnover of some FFr2.8bn. Profit-taking in Rhone-Poulenc, on its first day in the index, left the shares off FFr2 at FFr564 after a high of FFr578 while Elf and Total saw respective gains of FFr7.80 and FFr3.90 to FFr369.80 and FFr247.90 following a meeting between the two companies and the Kuwaiti oil minister last week. MILAN was dealt an early body blow by news that two Fiat executives had been arrested as part of Italy's ever-widening political bribery scandal. The market had begun positively on hopes that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's weekend cabinet reshuffle would do something to restore damaged credibility. But the news of the latest arrests brought another attack of nerves before some bargain hunting later in the day restored a firmer trend to other sectors. The Comit index ended 1.67 lower at 501.92. Fiat shares fixed L30 lower at L5,350 and fell back to L5,200 in after-hours trading. Other shares in the group were similarly hard hit, with Toro Assicurazioni down L340 lire to L26,000. The financial holding company, Ifi, firmed L5 to fix at L11,205 before dipping to L10,850 after hours. AMSTERDAM, which sees results from Unilever today followed by Akzo and Royal Dutch later in the week, remained resilient with a 0.4 gain in the CBS Tendency index to 100.1. Borsumij Wehry, the trading group, picked up Fl 5.00 to Fl 63.50 following 1992 results much exceeded some analysts expectations. Financials were strong with ING up Fl 1.80 at Fl 64.40. OSLO moved ahead to close near an eight-month high, helped by weaker interest rates. The all-share index rose 5.17 to 406.92 in turnover of NKr445.6m. Norsk Hydro fell NKr0.5 to NKr163.5 as it cut the 1992 dividend and attributed sharply higher 1992 net income to a change in its accounting practices. COPENHAGEN liked the central bank's one-point cut in discount and key deposit rates, and the KFX index rose 0.37 to 84.25. Bikuben, the country's third biggest bank, moved against the trend with a drop of DKr2 to DKr199 on a DKr1.2bn net loss for 1992. VIENNA expressed its enthusiasm for interest rate prospects as the ATX index climbed 19.1, or 2.3 per cent to 837.12. Interest rate-sensitive, insurance companies and banks have been a strong influence over the past four weeks but, yesterday, building stocks led the market with Universale up Sch50 to Sch910 and Strabag - one of the best performers this year - Sch70 better at Sch1,370. ISTANBUL put on 4.7 per cent, the market index ending 266.59 higher at 5,922.35 with demand boosted mainly by new deposit rate reductions by state and private banks.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 22                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1138.90      1137.04      1136.67      1136.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1194.07      1193.46      1191.98      1190.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1135.88      1134.63      1132.44      1132.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1192.25      1190.66      1190.65      1190.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 19    Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 16    Feb 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1136.60   1132.95   1121.77   1123.14   1132.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1191.09   1191.03   1173.51   1179.54   1184.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1138.90; 200 - 1194.92 Low/day: 100 - 1131.97  200 - 1187.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

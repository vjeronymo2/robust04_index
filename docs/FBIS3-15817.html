			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov of IZVESTIYA: "`Gazprom' Gives </F> Ukraine Final Warning and Turns to International Court"]    [Text] Government talks between Ukraine and Russia on  questions of gas deliveries begin 10 March in Moscow. On the  eve of the talks "Gazprom" representatives confirmed to  IZVESTIYA that over the holidays Ukraine continued unilaterally  to take 40 million cubic meters of gas per day from the export  pipeline. Ukrainian enterprises' overall debt to Russian gas  industry workers now tops 1.5 trillion rubles [R].    The problem of Ukrainian nonpayments, which has an acute  impact on the situation of the West Siberian gas fields, has  periodically flared up over the last two years. Seemingly all  the methods of settling the conflict by peaceful means have been  tried. If the Moscow talks produce no guarantees of  uninterrupted payment for Russian deliveries, then, as your  IZVESTIYA correspondent was told by "Gazprom" Deputy Chairman  Vladimir Remizov, the company leadership will be forced to turn  to the International Court. If this does happen, it will be the  first time the former Soviet republics, finding themselves  unable to reach agreement among themselves, have washed their  dirty linen in public.    The last agreement between Ukraine and Russia on gas  deliveries was signed in February. Ukraine pledged to ensure  the transit of 111.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to West  Europe. Russia is to supply Ukraine with between 50 and 70  billion cubic meters of gas. The breakdown of these agreements  is jeopardizing "Gazprom's" far-reaching ambitious plans to  break into the European market.    No matter how much "Gazprom" may threaten to take this  course, it is technically infeasible to reduce gas deliveries to  Ukraine, and the chronic defaulters can effectively pump gas out  of the export pipeline to West Europe with impunity. If the  Ukrainian leadership's restrictions affect anyone, it is only  the enterprises working on contracts with "Gazprom." Although  in early March the concern announced a reduction in gas  deliveries from 160 million cubic meters to 110 million, in  reality this had no consequences for the violators of the  convention. As a result pressure in the pipeline on the border  with Slovakia fell to danger point. Moreover, Ukraine has  managed to pump so much gas into underground storage facilities  that it will be more than enough to get through the  spring-winter period.    According to V. Remizov, "Gazprom's" tough stance at the  Moscow talks will also include a point about Ukraine repaying  some of the debts with property in the gas supply system. The  concern's leadership is interested primarily in the underground  storage facilities that enable Ukraine to withstand the Russian  suppliers' financial assaults with no particular problems.</p>

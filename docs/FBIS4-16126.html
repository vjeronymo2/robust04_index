			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Fighting Organized Crime </F> Becomes a Priority"]    [Text] Riga, 6 Apr -- The parliamentary Commission for  Defense and Interior Affairs has accepted a plan to counter  organized crime, which will be deemed a priority in the overall  fight against crime. The problem of ensuring a "green light" for  this drive is to be resolved by the National Security Council  and the Cabinet of Ministers, DIENA was told by Odisejs  Kostanda, a member of Defense Commission. He also said that the  commission will see to it that this prioritization is accepted  at the highest level of state policy.    To implement this policy, it will be necessary to introduce  several changes to legislative acts, and create a material and  technical basis for the fight against organized crime. The  Cabinet of Ministers will have to adopt proposals to reorganize  the police. Eventually, it is envisioned that a special  department for fighting crime and narcotics, a prosecutor's  office, and a separate court structure will be introduced.    At present, Latvian law does not contain a definition of  "organized crime," therefore neither the Prosecutor's Office nor  the Ministry of Interior Affairs can supply precise data on  results of the fight against this phenomenon. It is also  difficult to estimate the true scale of organized crime, because  only one quarter of all reported crimes are solved -- last year,  that figure was 27.9 percent.</p>

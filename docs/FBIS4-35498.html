			<p>BFN     [Text] India is expected to receive thousands of defense  spare parts and critically required ammunition from Russia and  Ukraine within three months. Addressing the naval commanders  conference in New Delhi today, the minister of state for  defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, said this was successfully negotiated  during the visit of a defense delegation to the countries early  this month. He expressed concern at the increasing belligerency  and weapons acquisition beyond its requirements by Pakistan.  Referring to the low intensity conflict by Pakistan to  destabilize India, the minister lauded the efforts of Navy and  the Coast Guard in countering seaborne operations of subversive  elements. He stressed the need for self-reliance and  highlighted the necessity to undertake multi-institutional  research to build all types of vessels and sophisticated  warships.</p>

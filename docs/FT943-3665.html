			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rate rise a low-risk move Sir, Samuel Brittan in his article of September 8 (Economic Viewpoint) castigates Goldman Sachs for trying to guess the non-inflationary growth rate of the UK in its advice that interest rates ought to rise. There is, however, a more subtle argument for raising interest rates soon than one that sees renewed inflation around every corner and that relates to the relative risks run in making the wrong decision. Not to raise rates and to find that inflation takes a hold again would mean that the harsh anti-inflationary medicine that the economy swallowed in 1992 was all in vain. And it would reinforce the image that the sceptics have of the British economy as one prone to inflation and boom/bust cycles. To raise rates, however, runs very little risk indeed. With the output gap falling, Europe emerging from recession and the rest of the world for the most part growing strongly, there is every reason to invest. And because raising rates would reinforce the determination on the part of the monetary authorities to provide a stable low inflationary environment, it could even be argued that that would be positive for investment] If consumer expenditure does take a dive, then interest rates can easily be lowered with no longer-term damage (and anyway since, if the authorities are seen to be ahead of the game, longer-term interest rates will surely fall, the impact on consumer expenditure is likely to be quite mild).

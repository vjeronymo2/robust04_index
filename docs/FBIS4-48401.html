			<p>BFN     [Text] Malawian Foreign Minister Dr. Hetherwick Ntaba says  there is no proof that the Mozambique National Resistance is  harboring Malawi Young Pioneers. Dr. Ntaba added that his  government has always been willing to repatriate the probable  elements of the military wing of President Banda's party, but  that has not yet happened. The Malawian foreign minister was  speaking to a group of Southern African Development Community  journalists at the end of the parliamentary session which  adopted Malawi's new constitution. Dr. Ntaba noted that all  members of the armed unit were demobilized soon after the  referendum held in 1993 following complaints by opposition  parties.</p>

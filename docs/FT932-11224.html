			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mosaic shares poised to return TRADING IN the shares of Mosaic Investments, the Birmingham-based mini-conglomerate which has been reorganising its business and finance for the last nine months, is expected to resume on May 28. The relisting, however, is dependent on shareholders' agreement at meetings the day before to approve an elaborate finance package. The shares were suspended on September 29 last year at 60p, valuing the group at Pounds 10m. Mosaic had failed to raise finance for the redemption of preference shares and had to pass a dividend it had already announced. The new-look group will have, if shareholders agree, a new equity structure, new bank facilities and a changed board. The package embracing these elements includes: Revised arrangements to redeem 2.99m preference shares held by Mr Rodney Day; he will be paid Pounds 1 a share for 515,625 shares now, the same amount for 1.5m shares in tranches spread over 10 years and will convert the balance of his holding into ordinary shares. Arrangements to issue new ordinary shares at 20p apiece to the owners of companies bought between 1988 and 1990, in order to settle the initial purchase terms which involved not only immediate cash payments but deferred payment in shares. The effect of these arrangements is to lift the number of issued shares from 17.08m to 34.38m. Mr Day will end up with 14.5 per cent of the equity, while the previous owners of companies bought by Mosaic - T Turner, Stainless Steel Services and IBH Advertising and Design - will respectively hold 17.2 per cent, 18.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Mosaic has enlisted the support of Lloyds as its new banker. Lloyds, if the new shareholding arrangements are approved and the shares are relisted, will provide Mosaic with an overdraft of Pounds 3m and a 5-year loan of Pounds 1.75m. Although the core businesses have been trading profitably, Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman, said yesterday that 'the re-organisation we've done produces enormous extraordinary and exceptional charges and when you deduct them you get a hefty loss.'</p>

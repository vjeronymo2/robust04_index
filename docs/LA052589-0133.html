			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BONUS EVENTS POSSIBLE FOR NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Lolita Pile, Laural Isles and Lisa Gill of Cal State Northridge qualified for  the NCAA Division II track and field championships in one event each, but they  may compete in a second one before the three-day meet ends on Saturday night.  </P> <P> For a variety of reasons -- poor weather in much of the country being the chief  culprit -- only two women sprinters met the Division II championship standard  of 24.10 in the 200, and only three met the 100-meter low hurdles standard of  14.25.  </P> <P> In an effort to fill out the fields to a minimum of five athletes in those two  events, qualifying races will be held during the meet among athletes who have  qualified in at least one other event.  </P> <P> So Isles, who qualified in the 100, and Pile (triple jump) might run in the 200  meters and Gill (heptathlon) might compete in the 100 hurdles.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said.  "But there is a good chance that they'll run in those events."  </P> <P> Strametz also has the option of putting together a men's 1,600-meter relay team  -- there were only four entries in that event -- but he said he didn't think he  would.  </P> <P> "We just don't have the personnel here to run a good 1,600," Strametz said.  </P> <P> The rest of Northridge's entries are more concrete.  </P> <P> Darcy Arreola will attempt to defend her titles in the 1,500 and 3,000. She  will not attempt a distance triple -- as Strametz had proposed several weeks  ago -- because she intends to run the 1,500 at next week's Division I  championships in Provo, Utah.  </P> <P> "I think she could have won three events," Strametz said. "But it wasn't worth  it . . . I don't want her too tired for next week."  </P> <P> The top two finishers in each event at the Division II meet -- who are juniors  or seniors -- are eligible to compete in the Division I meet if they have met  Division I standards.  </P> <P> Freshmen and sophomores are not eligible because Division I schools passed a  rule two years ago that will phase out Division II athletes running in the  Division I meet.  </P> <P> Arreola, a junior, has met Division I standards in both the 1,500 and 3,000,  and Pile, another junior, has met the standard in the triple jump.  </P> <P> The school record-holder in the event (42 feet), Pile will attempt to improve  upon her eight-place finish of 1987 and her sixth-place effort of 1988.  </P> <P> Tyrone Jeffries and Walt Stewart will lead the Northridge men.  </P> <P> Jeffries will run in the 110 high hurdles and the 400 intermediate hurdles as  well as a leg on the 400 relay.  </P> <P> Stewart, who cleared a personal best of 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches in the high jump  at Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday, will compete in that event on Friday.  </P> <P> Northridge juniors Paul Albers and Dan Youngberg will compete in the finals of  the men's hammer throw today, and Arreola will run in a qualifying heat of the  1,500.  </P></p>

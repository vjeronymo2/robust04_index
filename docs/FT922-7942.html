			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften slightly MONEY MARKET rates softened slightly yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a smaller shortage than had been expected in the discount market. But the market's underlying view remained bearish about a cut in base rates in the near future. The cost of 1-month and 2-month money softened slightly after the Bank forecast a shortage of only Pounds 500m in the morning. As the shortage was easily taken up, 1-month money ended the day at 10 1/16 per cent, down from 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent the day before. 2-month money also ended at 10 1/16 from a previous close of 10 3/32 per cent. One trader said that these reductions were purely technical. He said that the overnight rate had dipped as low as 8 1/2 per cent because of the high liquidity in the system and, as a result, traders were more willing to lend at longer rates. The market's underlying pessimism about a rate cut was reinforced by poor UK economic figures. These showed that unemployment grew by a bigger than expected 42,600 in April to reach 2,695,300. Average earnings in March also increased by 7.5 per cent, the same as the February figure which was revised up from the original estimate of 7.25%. There was disappointment at sterling's performance on foreign currency markets with the pound trickling away from its best levels and closing at DM2.9375. Sterling futures reflected those poor figures. The September contract ended the day at 90.24, eight ticks down on the previous close, and implying that base rates in September will be at 9.76 per cent. The December contract ended at 90.49, down ten ticks, and implying that base rate at the end of the year will be 9.51 per cent. The discount market had a very quiet day. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 550m. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 500m. The Bank then purchased Pounds 500m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The shortage was later revised to around Pounds 600m before taking account of the morning operations. The Bank then purchased Pounds 109m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. German call money rates eased yesterday to just below 9.60 per cent for the first time in two months after the Bundesbank added liquidity to the market on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Marcin Swiecicki by Krzysztof </F> Grzegrzolka; place and date not given: "Not This Way"]    [Text] [Grzegrzolka] Poland's finances are in a bad  state. Will the government-proposed budget improve them?    [Swiecicki] Not only will the government draft budget fail  to improve Poland's financial condition, it will also make it  even worse. The increase in spending will be so large that in  order to pay for it, the government, apart from increasing tax  rates, wants to increase the budget deficit from 44 trillion  zlotys [Z], the 1993 level, to Z83 trillion this year. The Sejm  will probably approve an even greater increase. The government  is not going to fulfill its preelection promises in any case,  and an increase in the budget deficit could ensnare Poland in  new debts. This will make it impossible to fulfill any promises  whatsoever in the future and will lead to a further increase in  taxes and dramatic cuts in social spending. The government  seems to forget that we have still not repaid the horrendous  debts that Gierek [former communist party first secretary]  incurred. Poland's foreign debts amount to over Z1,000  trillion--i.e. almost $50 billion. This year we will spend  almost Z30 trillion on servicing these debts. This is only  possible because we are not yet repaying the London Club, and  the agreement with the Paris Club contains exceptionally  favorable conditions. To this, one must add the servicing of  our domestic debts. In 1994, we have to spend over Z80 trillion  on servicing these debts. Already this year, 18 percent of  budget revenues will be spent on repaying old debts instead of  financing the health service, education, the Army, or the  police. An increase in the budget deficit and the acquisition  of new credits to finance this deficit could bring about a  collapse of state finances in subsequent years.    [Grzegrzolka] Perhaps the deficit will revive the economy?    [Swiecicki] That is rather impossible in our situation  because there is no spare production capacity to produce quality  products that could boost demand. Many enterprises have lost  their markets. Apart from that, we have too many people engaged  in agriculture and a new population boom. As you can see, new  jobs and investments are necessary in order to cause a revival.  Yet the banks are compelled to finance the budget deficit, and  they do not have much money left to give to investors. The  budget deficit makes loans more expensive.    [Grzegrzolka] What types of spending do you consider  unnecessary?    [Swiecicki] In a market economy, is it really necessary to  subsidize the State Railways by Z7 trillion and provide  agriculture and industry with several dozen trillion zlotys?  Instead of spending budget funds on social objectives, it would  be better to give money to the rural districts, which are bound  to manage this money better.    [Grzegrzolka] Is a spending cut the only solution?    [Swiecicki] Great structural reforms to the social security  system, health service, and education are required.  Unfortunately, the government has still not presented any ideas  of its own about these spheres, and it has abandoned the ideas  of previous governments.    [Grzegrzolka] But the present ruling coalition is considered  very prosocial.    [Swiecicki] The indiscriminate granting of costly social  security benefits in a poor country means that there is not  enough money for those who are really dependent on social  security. For instance, too many working people have gained the  right to early pensions. Many people are retiring early but are  still working at their jobs. This is the so-called gray zone.  Instead of contributing to insurance funds, these people are  drawing from them. For instance, in Poland there are more men  who are drawing pensions and have not yet reached retirement age  than men who who have passed retirement age. Despite the very  high social security contributions, 30 percent of the workers'  contribution and 94 percent of the farmers' contribution are  paid out of the budget. We pay high contributions, but not even  such basic benefits as family income supplements for low-income  or multichildren families are available. It is similar with  unemployment benefits. The coalition has evaded the difficult  subject of reforming the social security and pension systems, as  well as the health and education systems. In Poland, 90 percent  of the funds to combat unemployment are spent on benefits. Only  10 percent is spent on creating new jobs, public works,  retraining programs, and loans for people setting up their own  businesses.    [Grzegrzolka] Democratic Union politicians are very fond of  discussing this issue, but not even the Democratic Union  government managed to resolve it.    [Swiecicki] But the program to combat unemployment initiated  by the Democratic Union government remains valid. The present  government is allocating more money for this program but has  failed to indicate necessary cutbacks in other spheres. The  rural lobby in the Sejm will demand subsidies for fuel and  preferential loans for farmers. Large farms will profit by  this, but it will not save the small farmers or the workers make  redundant by the closure of state farms.    [Grzegrzolka] Do you see a better solution?    [Swiecicki] This money should be spent on developing the  rural service infrastructure, expanding small-scale production,  establishing more schools in rural areas, and creating  nonagricultural jobs there. That will reap greater benefits  than pumping money into rural production, which has only 25  percent of the per capita productivity of urban production.  People should leave small and inefficient farms and transfer to  other areas of the economy, and they ought to receive help for  this transfer. In economically developed countries, less than  20 percent of the population lives off agriculture; in Poland,  50 percent of the population does. Instead of restructuring  this percentage and making rural areas dependent on market  forces, the government is making them dependent on state  subsidies.    [Grzegrzolka] What do you think of the idea of a  protectionist customs duty?    [Swiecicki] Poland has the conditions to produce more food  than for just its own needs. Therefore, it is quite natural to  compete for foreign markets, especially in West Europe. But  cutting ourselves off from foreign competition is a bad  solution. The government's proposed equalizing payments will  preserve the high production costs in Poland and cause high food  prices. All this will affect the consumer. The Mazowiecki  government was criticized for opening up Poland to a mass influx  of Western food on the Polish market, but these critics forget  that it is thanks to this opening up that we can now buy fancy  foodstuffs that used to appear only at Christmas or never at  all. The quality of Polish dairy produce has also improved  thanks to foreign competition. In 1990, our food exports went  up by 20 percent against the previous year, and we had a  $1-billion trade surplus in food, and without any equalizing  payments. I wish the present government similar success. I  think that opening foreign markets to Polish agricultural  produce should be one of the government's strategic tasks.</p>

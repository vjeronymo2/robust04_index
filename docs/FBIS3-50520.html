The promotions were established by special  resolutions issued and signed by Fujimori and published today in  the official gazette EL PERUANO. The 23 colonels to be promoted  to brigadier general come from special areas such as infantry,  artillery, cavalry, engineering, communications and the judge  advocate's office.    The Peruvian president also promoted seven generals to  division generals, the highest rank in the Army. These soldiers  are Tomas Cavero, Jose Picon, Juan Leon, Enrique Torrico,  Napoleon Vasquez, Andres Sanchez, and Guido Guevara. Rear  Admirals Jose Texeira, Enrique Salomon, and Americo Ibarcena  were promoted to vice admiral, the highest rank in the Peruvian  Navy. Major Generals Cesar Urday, Ernesto Burga and Luis Moy  were promoted to liuetenant general, the highest rank in the  Peruvian Air Force.    All these promotions were confirmed by presidential  resolutions and published in the official gazette. The  promotions are consistent with the new Constitution, which went  into effect on 31 December 1993. It states that the promotions  of high-ranking officers of the Armed Forces are to be confirmed  by the president after each branch of the Armed Forces presents  its recommendations. The old Constitution stated that promotions  were to be confirmed by the legislature upon a recommendation  sent by the Executive Branch.    The political opposition criticized the constitutional  change  because they believed this undermined legislative authority and  allowed for "politicking" with the military institutions. The  opposition magazine CARETAS said in December that the military  High Command and General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the commander  in chief of the Army and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  had decided on the promotions themselves, adding that the  "politicizing and counter-institutionalization in the Army has  had devastating effects." Peruvian opposition parties view  Hermoza as a negative factor within the Army, and they have  requested his removal on several occasions. All of the requests  were rejected by Fujimori.    Hermoza is considered to be the Peruvian president's closest  military ally after he backed Fujimori's self-inflicted coup  d'etat on 5 April 1992, when the president dissolved the  parliament, closed down the Judicial Branch, and assumed full  power.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Technology: Promise of power - Tom Foremski looks at the next generation of computers which will have vastly increased performance You can never be too rich or too thin, the saying goes. And in the computer world you can never have too much computer power or memory - which forces microprocessor manufacturers into an increasingly expensive quest for technologies that will bring greater performance. The ambitious goal of the recent alliance between US electronics giants Intel and Hewlett-Packard is to develop a microprocessor that will perform 10 times faster than current microprocessors. These next-generation microprocessors will be used in PCs with the performance of today's supercomputers. Computer-intensive tasks such as speech and handwriting recognition will allow people to communicate easily with their computers, while the machines process vast volumes of data in the form of three-dimensional, high-resolution graphics and manipulate massive database files. Virtual reality systems will be as common in business settings as they will be in home entertainment systems. And the new computer power available will create applications not yet envisaged. But to reach this stage, vast investment in research and development and expertise in a large number of different areas will be needed. It will also mean correctly identifying the technologies to enable such a large increase in performance. The alliance of Intel and HP has focused attention on a little-known technology called Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW). Both companies say VLIW may be one of the technologies included in their future microprocessors. Most PCs use a type of microprocessor design called complex instruction set computer (Cisc), a design with its roots in the 1970s. As memory chips became cheaper in the 1980s, researchers found they could make microprocessors more efficient if they simplified the design and let the system software handle more of the complexity in analysing and executing the programs. These types of microprocessors are known as reduced instruction set computer (Risc) and are typically found in high-performance workstations and are gradually emerging in PCs through products such as Apple Computer's Power Macintosh computers. VLIW offers to take this process a step further by making the microprocessor design very simple and using special software known as software compilers to analyse the programs and feed the code rapidly into the microprocessor. HP has made the biggest investment in VLIW, which was first pioneered by the now defunct computer company Multiflow in the mid-1980s. HP's focus is to improve superscalar functions in microprocessors. Superscalar means that a microprocessor can handle more than one task or instruction within a time period or cycle. Some CISC microprocessors can take several cycles to process a single instruction. But superscalar microprocessors, such as the Intel Pentium or the PowerPC from IBM and Motorola, can handle two or more instructions in one cycle, greatly improving microprocessor speeds. HP is hoping to go beyond current superscalar designs with a microprocessor design it calls 'super parallel'. Super parallel microprocessors could process as many as 32 instructions per cycle. Intel and HP are not the only companies interested in VLIW. IBM says it has several patents on VLIW technology and is considering including the technology in its future microprocessors. But not everyone is convinced that VLIW is the way forward. IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer formed an alliance, called PowerPC, three years ago to develop high-performance RISC microprocessors. The alliance created the Somerset Design Centre in Austin, Texas, staffed with several hundred top chip designers. Russell Stanphill, co-director of the Somerset Design Centre, says that developing radically different microprocessor architectures may be premature. 'I believe that RISC technology has a long way to go before we run into limitations - Risc is still in its infancy. There are also questions about whether VLIW is a good approach. Does it make sense to give the compiler such a massive task to do?' Linley Gwennap, industry analyst and editor of The Microprocessor Report, claims other companies might ignore VLIW and take a different approach. 'You could choose a multi-processor chip approach that would ensure easier backward software compatibility. Or reconfigurable microprocessors where you use gate array technology to reconfigure your microprocessor for specific tasks.' But whichever technology is chosen, developing new microprocessor designs and manufacturing them is increasingly expensive. Apart from the R&amp;D expense, building a microprocessor factory can cost Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) It is a job that Intel, the world's richest and largest microprocessor manufacturer, cannot handle alone. Its alliance with HP gives Intel access to HP's Risc microprocessor technology, its software compilers and its large customer base - while HP taps into Intel's chip manufacturing skills. 'This alliance raises the stakes in the microprocessor market. It will be very expensive to develop the next generation of microprocessors and it's clear that some companies won't make it,' says Gwennap. Microprocessor manufacturers must not only develop faster designs but also ensure they can get the economies of scale to match Intel which intends to manufacture tens of millions of microprocessors. Sun Microsystems has already teamed up with Fujitsu, with the two companies pledging to spend more than Dollars 500m improving the Sparc microprocessor architecture. Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha microprocessor faces the biggest challenge, according to Gwennap: 'Digital lacks the economies of scale needed.' For Alpha to survive into the next decade, Digital will need to find able partners. Silicon Graphics, which produces the Mips Risc microprocessor, is hoping to obtain the economies of scale required by designing its microprocessor into a potentially large market for set-top TV boxes that will act as gateways to 'information superhighways'. Intel clone manufacturers, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix claim they will be able to match whatever Intel produces. But while microprocessor design moves towards less complexity, paradoxically, the size of the microprocessor chips grows larger as additional system functions are placed on the same chip.</p>

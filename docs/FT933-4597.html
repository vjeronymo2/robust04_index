			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: WBB beats off hostile Belgian bid WATTS Blake Bearne, the 280-year Devon-based supplier of ball clay, has retained its independence despite a hostile 420p-a-share cash bid by Sibelco, a private Belgian company. Sibelco, which produces silica sand for the glass industry, conceded defeat yesterday after its mandatory cash offer for the British company lapsed. WBB's stock closed unchanged at 430p. Mr John Pike, WBB's managing director, said the group was 'very relieved and glad' that the offer had lapsed and thanked shareholders for their confidence and support. He noted that the company had been subject to offer periods for most of the current year. Sibelco was one of three original concert party partners who held a 45 per cent stake in WBB. The bid was triggered when one partner, Ceramics Holdings, decided to sell its stake to Sibelco, lifting the Belgian company's stake to 30.4 per cent. Subsequently, in August, Sibelco also acquired the shares of the third concert party partner, Quarzwerke of Germany.</p>

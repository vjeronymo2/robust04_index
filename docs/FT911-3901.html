			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Poll puts fate of Chancellor in question SUNDAY'S Social Democrat victory in a key German state election, giving the party control of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, is certain to strengthen the trend towards co-operation between government and opposition. For the first since the process of German re-unification began it has also placed a question-mark over the future of Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself. Mr Kohl admitted yesterday that the loss of Rhineland-Palatinate, his home state, was a 'bitter defeat' but said that his government could not duck unpopular decisions. He added the Social Democrats would now enjoy 'a new dimension of responsibility' but stressed there would be no strategy change in Bonn and that he was not considering early retirement. Mr Kohl, echoed by other leading members of the ruling Christian Democratic party, did say, however, that the generation change at the top of the party had to be speeded up. Mr Theo Waigel, head of the CDU's sister party, the Christian Social Union, called the result a 'disaster'. Mrs Anke Fuchs, SPD general secretary, said that Mr Kohl was politically exhausted and had sunk to the level of unpopularity of 1989 before being saved by German unity 'which he manipulated for electoral ends'. However, despite the boost to the SPD, the party has still to find a convincing leadership team, and as it gets drawn into accepting more responsibility for national politics will find it more difficult to score points at Bonn's expense. In national opinion polls the centre-right coalition continues to comfortably lead the SPD. In the Rhineland-Palatinate itself the SPD will negotiate first with the liberal Free Democrats, also coalition partners in Bonn, but may following Hesse and Lower Saxony with a 'red-green' coalition. In Bonn the SPD will use its blocking power in the Bundesrat to stop the coalition's plans to abolish two local taxes mainly levied on companies.</p>

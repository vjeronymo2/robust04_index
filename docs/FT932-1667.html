			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / German UN role defended THE German government and the United Nations' top official in Europe joined forces yesterday to counter an attempt in the country's constitutional court to order an immediate withdrawal of German troops from UN operations in Somalia. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said such a move would cause grievous damage to Germany's international reputation. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, said it would have 'catastrophic effects' on the morale of the German soldiers. They were backed by Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the former Soviet deputy foreign minister, who is now UN under-secretary general in Geneva. He declared that the involvement of German troops in the Somalia operations was of the greatest importance for the UN mission, and for the restoration of peace in the country. Mr Petrovsky was standing in for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who had offered to give evidence in the constitutional court when he arrives in Germany for an official visit today. In the event, the hearing finished last night and a ruling is expected by tomorrow. The big guns were called up in defence of the peace-making mission, after leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday demanded the immediate withdrawal of the German troops, on the grounds that they were part of a military operation. The SPD claims that such a use of the army outside the Nato area is excluded by the constitution. The SPD has called for a ruling by the constitutional court in Karlsruhe to recall the 250 soldiers already stationed in Somalia. Mr Ruhe retorted that the men were in less danger than those flying supply missions in former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In response to the Church massacre, the Progressive  Socialist Party has asked international organizations to  reconsider the acquittal of Zionism and confront Israeli  barbarism and racism.    The party's Foreign Relations Office has cabled the United  Nations secretary general, the Arab League secretary general,  Amnesty International, the EU president, the secretary general  of the Islamic countries organization, his holiness the pope,  and the president of Socialist International.    The cable said: We cabled you a few days ago condemning the  Zionists' horrendous massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron. Today, we cable you to condemn another massacre  perpetrated by the same hand against innocent worshipers in  Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq, Lebanon. These and many  previous massacres confirm the nature of Zionism and require us  all to reconsider some UN resolutions that acquitted Zionism and  (?overlooked) its past and present. We urge international and  regional institutions, all human rights organizations, and all  countries and parties to adopt immediate, courageous positions  against this barbaric racism, which denies every human right and  threatens world peace if its interests are not served.</p>

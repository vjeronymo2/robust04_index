			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Move to cut truck red tape attacked Government plans to reduce regulations governing standards for operators of heavy trucks were attacked by Labour in the Commons yesterday. Fears that the move would harm road safety were voiced during the report stage debate on the deregulation and contracting-out bill, which the government says is aimed at cutting red tape and reducing the bureaucratic burden on business. The bill provides that operators of heavy lorries would no longer have to reapply for their licences every five years. Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said: 'All the evidence points to the need for the current system to be maintained or toughened up - not weakened. Our concern is that the government will be giving a wink and a nod to those who may take short cuts with safety.' Mr Steven Norris, junior transport minister, accused Labour MPs of 'quite deliberately confusing the issues of safety and regulation'. They had assumed deregulation automatically compromised safety. He said the bill did not affect the power of a licensing authority to take vehicles off the road and bring legal action against operators for sub-standard practices.</p>

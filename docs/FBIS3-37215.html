He told journalists on Monday [14 February] that bomb  attacks could escalate the military crisis in the center of  Europe.    To quote Grachev, bomb attacks, even if they are carried out  with extreme precision, which he doubts would be the case, would  kill many people.    He also said that the decision on the withdrawal of the  Russian peacekeeping force from Bosnia, if bomb attacks begin,  must be taken by the country's political leaders. He said that  Russian servicemen would have to perform their peacekeeping  mission all the same. "So I don't think the Russian troops  should be removed even after bombings," he said.    Speaking about Russia's possible participation in the  Partnership for Peace project, Grachev said that this document  had not yet been discussed by all the parties concerned. Every  country interprets this document in its own way, he said. For  instance, Eastern Europe and the Baltic States view this  document in the context of a transitional period till joining  NATO.    "For us this is a document which has to do with all European  countries because it is expected to ensure European security,"  said Grachev. He also noted that Russia considered the  Partnership for Peace project to be an intermediary step towards  an even closer European political alliance under the leading  role of the CSCE.    On the whole, Russia supports the Partnership for Peace  project, he said. He did not say, though, when Russia would  join it because, he said, the final instrument of joining this  program has not been worked out yet.</p>

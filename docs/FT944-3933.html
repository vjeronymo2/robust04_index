			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone back in the black with Pounds 4.2m McCarthy &amp; Stone, the retirement home building group, yesterday reported a return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m for the year ended August 31, against losses of Pounds 11.2m previously. The group attributed the turnround to the continuing improvement in the housing market and efforts by the company in cutting costs and focusing on its core operations. Turnover was only slightly ahead at Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 71.1m), while the operating profit improved sharply from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 6.8m. Earnings per share were 4.1p compared with losses of 15.6p in the previous 12 months. The dividend was again passed, but the company said it hoped to resume payment this financial year. The shares rose 1p to 64p yesterday. During the year, the group sold its fixed freehold investments and management services operations for Pounds 30m, which together with the proceeds from the summer's Pounds 15.5m rights issue and the underlying cash generation, eliminated borrowings. The number of units sold fell 45 to 936, although the average selling price rose 5 per cent to Pounds 64,700 (Pounds 61,300). Mr Matthew Thorne, finance director, said the group had managed to withstand many of the cost pressures being experienced by the rest of the building industry. 'We are not in competition with other residential builders for the type of land we buy, which tends to be town centre sites,' he said. The company's widespread use of contractors also offered some protection from materials and labour price rises. He added that although the group's market had largely recovered from the recession, it was currently static and that sale prices were unlikely to rise in the foreseeable future. However, margin improvement was likely to come from new higher margin sites and lower overheads.</p>

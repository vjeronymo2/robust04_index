			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Polish president's plea to west Poland yesterday urged the US to play a more active role in central Europe. Speaking during a visit to Warsaw by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, President Lech Walesa complained that the European Union and Nato were not expanding eastwards. 'No great structural changes have been made and life cannot stand a vacuum,' he said, implying that only Russia stood to gain from the west's cautious stance. Mr Talbott met Polish leaders to discuss the country's membership in the Partnership for Peace security programme.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling Judging by its strength in recent weeks, sterling has been unmoved by Euro-election nerves. After a low around DM2.48 three weeks ago, sterling yesterday rose above DM2.52, its highest level since early April. In the same period, the trade weighted-index has risen nearly a full point to 80.6. But this does not mean the currency markets have been ignoring politics; rather that stronger forces have been pushing sterling higher. Part of this is the currency's usual tendency to move up in the backwash of a higher dollar. More important is the growing awareness of the currency markets of the strength of the economic recovery - fuelled in particular this week by strong industrial production figures  - and the expectation that this will lead the authorities to start raising interest rates sooner rather than later. Indeed, since the short sterling futures contract is pricing in a half-point rise in base rates by September, one might have expected sterling's recovery to have been even more pronounced. That it has only risen as far as DM2.52 suggests a poor election showing for the Tories was priced into the exchange rate already. In that sense, the market has little to fear from the result. But for sterling to rise much further depends first on the recovery remaining robust and second on the Bank of England's success in using its increased influence to ensure that its hard line on inflation prevails.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Do It All Boots and WH Smith have finally accepted that Do It All needs more than a fresh lick of paint. The disappointment is that the structural work outlined yesterday will take so long to complete. Of the 100 stores earmarked for disposal, only 14 have actually been sold. The Pounds 60m provision - which will be split equally between the two parents - covers trading losses from unwanted stores for the next two years. That may hint at how long the remaining work will take. Whether the slimmed-down chain can show a decent return thereafter is difficult to judge. While money is being made available to convert the remaining 140 stores to a new trading format, it is too early to say that the format is a runaway success. Even if Do It All can hang on to third place in DIY, shrinking must have its disadvantages. Yet nimbler competitors, such as Sainsbury's Homebase, have shown that brain is more important than brawn. With a new trading format, better distribution and a little help from the housing market, Do It All must stand a fair chance of reaching break-even at a trading level next year. But Do It All's competitors will not stand still while the restructuring proceeds. New retail space is being added elsewhere in the DIY market. So it is by no means clear that Do It All can carve a niche large enough to allow it to flourish. With something like a credible plan in place, though, Boots and WH Smith can spend a year or two deciding for themselves.</p>

Mogultay and Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk  visited the Palestinian Embassy in Ankara and signed a memorial  book which was dedicated to the 63 Palestinian victims of the  Ibrahim Mosque massacre in Hebron by a Jewish settler last  Friday.    Mogultay expressed condolences to Palestinian Ambassador  Fu'ad Yasin over the incident.    Yasin called for international protection for the  Palestinians living in Israel. Israel and the PLO signed a  treaty in Washington on Sept. 13, 1993 that provides autonomy  for the Palestinians living in the Gaza strip and the city of  Jericho.    Mogultay said Israel and the PLO should continue a  constructive dialogue as the peace process is in a critical  point.    He said a lasting and peaceful solution should be found to  the problem.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- Practical work to create  Russia's Choice Party begins as of today. Yegor Gaydar, leader  of Russia's Choice faction in parliament, said in an exclusive  interview to ITAR-TASS.    The main directions of the programme of Russia's Choice  Party  have been defined, Gaydar said. He described it as the  programme for the next stage of Russian reform.    Gaydar said the main purpose of Russia's Choice Party is to  pass on from weak market mechanisms that have just begun to  function to a steady market system based on private property.    Gaydar believes Russia now has two main strategic problems:  The creation of reliable guarantees for property and the easing  of the tax policy. He said the simplest truth which the party  wants compatriots to understand is that the cutting of state  expenditures is the only way to cut taxes.    The leader of Russia's Choice Party is aware that it will be  very difficult to enlist public support for the implementation  of what is planned. He has confidence in the interests of  skilled workers in the increase of capital investment in  production and of the number of well-paid jobs. The  intelligentsia is interested in the preservation of democracy in  Russia, and business people are interested in long-term  prospects for the activity to form private economy, Gaydar said.    He said Russia's Choice Party will have fixed membership,  broad freedom in debating tasks and rigid discipline in  fulfilling decisions.</p>

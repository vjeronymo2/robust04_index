			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fears over warheads discounted - Defence FEARS that the nuclear warheads to be fitted to Britain's Trident missiles could be unsafe were discounted by Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence procurement minister, in the Commons last night. He gave an assurance that the warheads would be designed and manufactured in the UK and would not be affected by the problems which led to the closure of the plant at Rocky Flatts, near Denver, which produced missiles for the US Trident force. Concern over the warheads was raised by a US Congress armed services committee report warning of the risk of 'unintended detonations'. Mr Carlisle said the British made warheads would be subject to a series of trials and independent assessments to ensure safety before and during operational service. He rejected opposition criticism of the Atomic Weapons Establishment Bill which provides for private contractors to undertake the management of the atomic weapons establishments at Aldermaston, Burghfield, Cardiff and Foulness.</p>

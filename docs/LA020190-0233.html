			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CASE AGAINST PLAYERS DROPPED  </P> <P> The owners of a nightclub allegedly vandalized by bat-wielding Marshall  University football players last weekend will not press charges against the  men, authorities said today.  </P> <P> "They told us they've made arrangements with the school," Chief Deputy C. A.  Adams of the Cabell County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> "We've closed the case."  </P> <P> More than 20 men, many of them Marshall football players, forced their way into  DeSoto's nightclub early Saturday and used sticks and bats to smash tables,  chairs and the bar's namesake, a 1956 DeSoto, after one of them was ejected  from the club, deputies said.  </P> <P> Adams said the nightclub manager had reached an agreement with Marshall  Athletic Director Lee Moon under which the players involved, including two  starters on last year's team, would lose their football scholarships and make  restitution for more than $2,500 in damages to the club.  </P></p>

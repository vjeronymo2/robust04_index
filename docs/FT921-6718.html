			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour takes three-pointpoll lead - Public Opinion LABOUR has taken a three-point lead over the Tories in the latest opinion poll, which shows them with 41 per cent to 38 per cent for the government. The ICM survey, in today's Daily Mail, also indicates that almost half of those questioned - including just over a quarter of Labour voters - believe that the recession would end more quickly if the Budget contains tax cuts. Labour is due to continue its attack on the government's taxation and borrowing plans at a press conference today. More worryingly for the Tories, Mr John Major's popularity fell six points to 36 per cent, while the rating for Mr Neil Kinnock as a potential prime minister has risen by three points to 24 per cent. The Tories have slipped three points since last month's ICM poll, which showed them on 41 per cent - a one point lead over Labour. It is their lowest ICM rating since July. The Liberal Democrats' showing has risen to 17 per cent from 13 in January. The 48 per cent of those saying they believe economic recovery will come more quickly with tax cuts compares with about one-third who believe recovery will begin more quickly through government expenditure. Tax cuts as a way to help the economy are favoured by seven out of ten Tory voters, 27 per cent of Labour voters and 41 per cent of Liberal Democrats. Labour is confident that the lead represents a breaking of the deadlock in the polls, but the Tories can argue that it is still within the three per cent margin for error. ICM interviewed 1,557 people in 54 constituencies last Friday and Saturday.</p>

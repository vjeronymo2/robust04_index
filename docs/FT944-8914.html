			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y's US unit close to finalising debt plan Olympia &amp; York USA, New York-based subsidiary of the failed Canadian property developer, has taken an important step towards finalising a debt-restructuring plan by handing over its interests in two Manhattan office towers to one of its biggest creditors. A 40-storey property at 125 Broad Street will be turned over to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the building's two biggest tenants. In addition, CIBC will take over O&amp;Y's 49 per cent partnership interest in a 39-storey building at 1250 Broadway. In return, the bank will release O&amp;Y from about Dollars 325m of mortgage obligations. The mortgage on the Broad Street property fell due some time ago. Negotiations with the bank were complicated by O&amp;Y's inability to honour a guarantee which it had provided on the loan. A person familiar with the deal said that O&amp;Y turned over its interest in the Broadway building in exchange for being released from the guarantee. O&amp;Y said it considered neither building to be part of its core portfolio, which includes the World Financial Centre and other office blocks in New York, as well as buildings in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. CIBC holds a mortgage on One Liberty Plaza, which is part of O&amp;Y's core holdings. The bank was the second biggest lender to Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), the Canadian parent which collapsed in 1992, but whose creditors retain an 80 per cent stake in the US company. O&amp;Y USA, led by Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, has so far been spared OYDL's fate. It has turned over several distressed buildings to mortgage holders, and has managed to convince other creditors that it would not be in their interests to push it into bankruptcy. The mortgage and guarantee on 125 Broad Street were the thorniest remaining problem among O&amp;Y's non-core properties. Bankers expect that the resolution of this issue will accelerate talks with creditors on the rest of the restructuring plan. O&amp;Y said yesterday that these negotiations were continuing.</p>

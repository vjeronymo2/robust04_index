			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES," by Wafa' 'Amr] </F>   [Text] Amman -- The agreement initialed in Cairo on  Wednesday [9 February] between the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) and Israel reflected the great Israeli  security concerns which delayed implementation of the Sept. 13  self-rule accord, political observers said Friday.    For Palestinians, the agreement on Israeli withdrawal from  Gaza Strip and Jericho and self-rule was far less than their  minimum aspirations, and it drew mixed reaction from PLO  officials.    Although people's reaction in general has been cautious, the  overall response of many Palestinians was negative.    Supporters of the agreement said that when implemented, the  initial impact of the harshness of the text would be softened.  This was contested by other PLO officials who said that the  negative elements of the Cairo agreement would be revealed upon  implementation. They said since many issues have been left for  further negotiation, as was the case of the Oslo agreement, it  meant the door may be left open for Israel to renege on  implementation as it sees.    Both supporters and opponents of the Cairo deal agreed that  like the Oslo agreement, many pitfalls and ambiguities shrouded  many of the articles, particularly security issues, despite the  immensely detailed security procedures at border crossings.  However, supporters said Palestinians had improved many of the  Oslo accord's conditions, and Israel has conceded on security  issues and on Palestinians' role on border crossings despite the  Israeli army's opposition. "We have made many concessions in  the Oslo agreement, but since everything is relevant, we believe  we have improved many of the conditions stated in the  Declaration of Principles," said a PLO negotiator.    A Tunis-based PLO official, who negotiated the  implementation  agreement in Davos, Switzerland, and Cairo said the accord was  supposed to have been signed in Davos, but the Israeli army's  opposition had dissuaded Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin.    "The army felt that this agreement penetrated the strong  Israeli security wall by giving Palestinians some control on  border crossings. Strategically, it means a great deal for the  army when they recognise the fact that they have to share  security control with the Palestinian authority," he said.    He added that the initial Israeli position was to post a  Palestinian flag on crossings, but it was changed into accepting  the raising the flag on the building itself. "This means  recognising Palestinians' authority on the entrances to  Palestine."    PLO negotiators felt satisfied with most of the agreement  despite the fact that many issues remained to be negotiated.  They said negotiations with the Israeli delegation were a very  difficult battle.    "In practice, we were negotiating with three Israeli  delegations -- the army who were the hardliners, (Foreign  Minister Shimon) Peres the moderate, and (Prime Minister  Yithzaq) Rabin, who was less hardline than his army generals," a  PLO negotiator said. The PLO leadership was concerned that the  delay in the implementation of the Sept. 13 accord was eroding  support for it among Palestinians and it would only have drawn  more divisions and bloodshed in the occupied territories.  Initialing the agreement, they argued, would give internal  momentum for the negotiations on implementation of the Oslo  accord.    Some Palestinians argued that the PLO leadership had  conceded  a lot to Israel in order to sign the agreement.    Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, however,  considered the Cairo agreement "dangerous" saying it included  many loopholes and PLO concessions.    What has been accepted in Cairo was redeployment of Israeli  troops rather than withdrawal since Israel has been given  control over areas surrounding Jewish settlements much bigger  than the size of settlements, he said.    "The agreement has given Israel all its wants regarding  security issues, and nothing for Palestinians. Israel has also  been given control of a number of roads connecting Jewish  settlements which divide the Gaza Strip," Mr. al-Najjab said.    "We are very worried about the possibility that Israel might  choose to accept only its own reading of the Cairo  agreement...we are concerned, over some articles which indicate  the continuation of occupation instead of its gradual removal as  stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 242," Mr. al-Najjab  said.    But chief Palestinian negotiator Faysal al-Husayni, who took  part in the negotiations, defended the agreement saying that  both the Oslo and Cairo agreements were only a step that would  ultimately lead to independence and a Palestinian state.    "Unfortunately, people cannot still distinguish between an  interim period, which we are negotiating, and the final status,"  Mr. al-Husayni said.    "We are talking about an interim period, during which final  status negotiations will start, which means we will be moving  from one stage to another, and it also means we will not be able  to end occupation completely and at once during the interim  stage," he argued. "However, when we reach final status, it  will be the period of independence and statehood."    "I think this agreement includes elements that would enable  us gradually to achieve independence because it paves the way  for Israeli withdrawal and redeployment from densely Palestinian  populated areas," he said.    Other PLO officials called for guarantees that ensure the  implementation of the agreement.    PLO official Nabil 'Amr, a supporter of the Sept. 13 accord  but who calls for democratisation and political reforms in the  PLO, said the Cairo agreement offers Israel the upper hand and  right to be the effective reference point for all decisions. He  said the need to break the deadlock reached in negotiations  should not mean ignoring the pitfalls which would challenge the  PLO's ability to implement what it signed.    "It seems that the need to sign the agreement after the  series of unsuccessful attempts since September evidently led to  a failure to include the necessary guarantees for a scheduled  implementation," Mr. 'Amr said.    He said the PLO leadership should start working on securing  such guarantees in order to ensure better conditions during the  interim and final periods.    Some senior members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA),  who, for months, have been preparing to enter Gaza and Jericho  and to control security there, disapproved the Cairo agreement  and felt great disappointment.    "We have no real role in security affairs or management of  Jericho and Gaza Strip," said a senior PLA officer. "We were  told we would enter the self-rule areas and be in full control,  or at least have a big say in our own security affairs, but it  seems Israel will not only maintain overall security but also  manage all the details."    They were referring to such issues as stated in the text of  the accord as having a policeman armed with a handgun at the  border crossings and total subordination to Israeli security  concerns as mentioned in many of the articles concerning border  crossings.    Some residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip visiting  Jordan said they were gravely concerned over the possibility  that they would be more humiliated and harassed by having to go  through three checking areas while crossing rather than just two.    "Now we go through the Israeli and Jordanian checking  points.  According to the new agreement, we will be passing through an  additional Palestinian checking point," one West Bank resident  said.    He said Palestinians feel terrified and humiliated by  Israeli  measures while crossing the bridge. "Under the excuse of  security, Israel will refrain from improving these measures."    Palestinians crossing into Jordan have complained of  harassment by Israeli security officers at the crossings, and  humiliating body searches. The details of crossing procedures  in the Cairo agreement have frightened them more. They feel  there will be added security measures which will exhaust them  instead of preserving their dignity.    Both Mr. al-Najjab and Mr. 'Amr criticised the PLO's  negotiating strategy which led to the loopholes in the Oslo and  Cairo agreements. They called on the PLO leadership to clearly  define and reconsider its negotiating strategy in order to  improve the Palestinian position in peace talks and to avoid  surprises.    Mr. al-Najjab, upset that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat signed  the Cairo agreement before presenting it to the Executive  Committee for approval, also criticised the PLO leader for  downgrading his position and accepting to negotiate with Mr.  Peres, the foreign minister, as his equal.    'Arafat has accepted the role of the head of Palestinian  delegation in the PLO-Israeli liaison committee instead of  Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin). This gives Israel the right to  demand that Palestinians return to a higher reference than  'Arafat for final decision...this weakens the Palestinians'  negotiating position," Mr. al-Najjab said.    He said Palestinians were worried that if such concessions  were repeated, the PLO leadership would lead the people to  further "dangerous pitfalls" because the leadership has been  acting without being accountable to any side.</p>

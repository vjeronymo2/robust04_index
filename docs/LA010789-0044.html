			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> On Dec. 26, there was a very interesting article in Calendar surveying "the men  and women who shape Los Angeles' cultural scene" ("Dear Santa . . . ," by Times  writers).  </P> <P> While you chose to represent organization after organization in theater and  through music, and though performance, painting and dance were all represented,  not one of the excellent local film or video organizations was included. In the  film and video capital of the world, this is a major omission.  </P> <P> I have enclosed a list of some of the organizations you should have included:  </P> <P> Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, American Cinematheque, American  Film Institute, Black American Cinema Society, Director's Guild of America,  EZTV, FilmForum, Gay &amp; Lesbian Coalition, Independent Documentary Assn.,  Independent Feature Projects, KCET, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Plaza  de la Raza, Sundance Institute, UCLA Film &amp; TV Archives, Visual  Communications, Women in Film.  </P> <P> GARY ESSERT  </P> <P> Founder/Artistic Director  </P> <P> American Cinematheque  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

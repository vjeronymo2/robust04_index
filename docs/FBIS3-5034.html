The contact was resumed by the North side's sincere efforts  four months after the third contact was held in October last  year.    After the contact, the head of the North side's delegation  met with home and foreign reporters on the spot and briefed them  on its results.    According to him, the North side said the way of breaking  through the difficulties smoothly and at the earliest date at a  time when the danger of a nuclear war is menacing the nation is  to remove the obstacles to the exchange of envoys. It urged the  South side to stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises  against its dialogue partner, give up seeking an "international  cooperation system," cancel the projected introduction of  Patriot missiles and withdraw its remarks that it "could not  shake hands" with its dialogue partner.    The South side, however, made it impossible to discuss  working procedures concerning the exchange of envoys, repeating  its far- fetched argument in a bid to justify its unreasonable  stand towards dialogue.    The sides agreed to have the next working contact at the  Tongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on March 9.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Labour MP seeks probe into Clarke Foods A LABOUR MP last night urged the government to launch an investigation into the collapse of Clarke Foods, Britain's second largest ice-cream manufacturer, which went into administrative receivership last October leaving debts of about Pounds 25m. Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North and former Labour frontbench housing spokesman, also questioned share sales by chairman Mr Henry D Clarke and fellow director Mr Martin Riley. The two directors sold shares from their pension funds weeks before the share price began a steady fall to the suspension price of 8p. Mr Neil Hamilton, Corporate affairs Minister, agreed to request an interim report from the receivers, Robson Rhodes, while describing Mr Howarth's request for an official investigation under the Companies Act as premature. Mr Howarth, whose constituency includes the Clarke factory in Merseyside which was briefly occupied by angry workers following the receivership, was speaking in a Commons debate on redundancies at the company. He also said that Nestle, the foods group which bought much of the business and assets of Clarke, had decided to close the Merseyside factory. He alleged that Mr Clarke and Mr Riley 'clearly must have known that Clarke Foods was in severe difficulties' at the time they sold the shares. 'Were Mr Clarke and Mr Riley guilty of insider dealing?' he asked. The Labour MP called for the interim report to include 'any preliminary evidence of fraud and/or insider dealing'. Mr Howarth also asked for an investigation into the state of Pounds 1.4m allocated for severance and pension payments to employees at one of Clarke's factories. Mr Howarth finally called on the government to launch an inquiry in to the fitness of Mr Clarke to be a director of a UK quoted company.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Editor: "To Readers of ERK"] </F>   [Text] The free man often forgets about his freedom, in the  same way he forgets about his face or his eyes.    The free man views his freedom as a natural part of his life  and does not find amazement in it or weep for joy; it does not  enter his mind that it might be a great blessing sent from God  the Almighty.    Once freedom was a blessing, and, since mankind descended to  earth with Adam and Eve, they have striven for this sacred  blessing; all struggles in world history have been to attain  this blessing or in order not to lose it.    If the state is free -- this is a blessing; if the nation is  free and each member of the nation is free -- this is a blessing.    If, when a man enters his home and talks with those near to  him and does not lower his voice, does not think of listening  devices -- this is a blessing.    If "security officials" do not threaten him, if they do not  throw him into a car and then beat him mercilessly, if they do  not throw him into prison -- this is a blessing.    Every thinking person in all of Uzbekistan wants normal  blessings like these. When they write our government, it is not  always about "bread and meat alone," but also they also express  the wish for normal human rights.    Certainly man needs meat, bread, and rice. The government of  Uzbekistan has promised these blessings over the last four  years. For four years this government has said " we are putting  the economy ahead of politics because first we have to fill the  people's stomach," but the people's stomach are still not full;  on the contrary, the people sink further into poverty every day.    Because an economy that is not free can never fill the  people's stomach -- freedom is also necessary to the economy.    Today, every social stratum in Uzbekistan understands this  truth. Approximately two years ago the urban population which  was living rather well -- intellectuals, civil servants, and  workers, began to view with doubt todays' "precedence of  economics over politics."    Even some government organs and some members of the  government began to understand this truth. As a result of this  mistaken policy Uzbekistan's standard of living has dropped to  one of the lowest in the world: the republic has not moved  forward, it has fallen ten years behind.    Who will answer for this?    The majority say, "the present government has to answer for  this."    True, the day for an answer has come, but this "answer" can  never make up for the time that has been lost. We need the  answer not in the "future," but now. This government,  undoubtedly, will go down as one of the worst in our history,  and there are many who want an answer to this question. But the  answer must not come from some low-level bureaucrat, but from  the tyrant now sitting on the throne.    ERK newspaper has once again come forward to ask for an  answer.    May your eyes be clear, yearners for freedom!</p>

The party's [word indistinct] decision-making Central  Standing Committee at a regular meeting endorsed a proposal that  James Chu, director of the party's Cultural Affairs Department,  be promoted to deputy secretary-general.    The post vacated by Chu will be filled by Chien Han-sun, now  the chairman of the KMT Taipei Municipal Committee, and Chien  will be succeeded by Tiao You-ping, secretary-general of the  Taipei city government.    The KMT also appointed Wu Wan-lan, deputy director of the  China Youth Corps, the director of the party's Social Affairs  Department, to replace Chung Jung-chi, who was elevated to the  post of chairman of the KMT provincial committee after Tu Te-chi  stepped down last week to placate widespread anger over the  vote-buying scandal surrounding the March 1 elections for  speakers and deputy speakers of 21 city and county councils.    Local newspapers reported that KMT Secretary-General Hu  Shui-the started planning the reshuffle soon after his return  from the Philippines Monday evening.    A party worker who requested anonymity said the appointments  of Tsao and Wu had surprised many party members because neither  of the two men has held a position in the party before.    Chien said at a press conference following the meeting that  he would dedicate himself to communicating with other political  parties, "so as to help promote Taiwan's party politics."</p>

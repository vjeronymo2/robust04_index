			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Axel Springer gives up plans for alliance AXEL SPRINGER Verlag, the German media group, and Poligrafici Editoriale, the listed Italian newspaper concern controlled by the members of the Monti family, have wound up their four-year attempt to create a closer alliance. Springer has sold the 10 per cent stake it took in Poligrafici Editoriale in June 1989, when the Italian company spent L160bn (Dollars 107m) to buy a similar sized stake in its German counterpart. Separately, Poligrafici said it had sold its 10 per cent stake in Springer for DM220m (Dollars 132.5m). However, plans for closer co-operation, including an Italian language equivalent of Springer's best-selling Bild Zeitung, never materialised.</p>

Talks centred on a proposed visit by Mandela to Israel,  according to a Dutch committee for the support of the democratic  process in South Africa, quoting African National Congress (ANC)  officials in Johannesburg.    Such a visit, however, would only take place once a peace  accord was concluded between Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO), the committee said.    The talks took place at the official residence here of Prime  Minister Ruud Lubbers.    Following the meeting, 'Arafat was to hold talks with  Lubbers  and deputy economic minister responsible for foreign trade  Yvonne van Rooij on Dutch aid to the future autonomous  Palestinian territories.    Mandela, for his part, was to meet with the premier of the  German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau, to discuss  German aid to South Africa before holding talks with Dutch  deputies and businessmen.</p>

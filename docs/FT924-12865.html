			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Radical reform sought for judiciary FUNDAMENTAL reform of the system of appointing and training judges and of the method of handling complaints against them is proposed today in a report published by Justice, the all-party independent law reform organisation. Its central proposal is for a judicial commission to advise the lord chancellor on judicial appointments. The commission would be chaired by a lawyer, but would have a majority of lay members with management experience. It would select judges through a much more open process than now, and job descriptions would be drawn up setting out the qualities necessary for high judicial office. The present system of keeping records of frequently un-solicited comments on potential judges would be abandoned, although the final decision on appointments would remain with the lord chancellor. The report says that any lawyer should be eligible for appointment and that judges should be chosen for their judicial qualities rather than solely on their success as advocates. It adds that the retirement age of judges should come down from 75 to 70 - and eventually to 65 - and that fixed-term and part-time appointments should be considered. Justice believes this would lead to the appointment of a broader range of judges, including more women and members of ethnic minorities. Two of the 83 High Court judges, 22 of the 467 circuit judges and 43 of the 786 recorders are women. Three circuit judges and seven recorders have ethnic-minority backgrounds but there is no ethnic-minority judge on the High Court bench. The report echoes recent calls from Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, for an independent body to deal with complaints about lazy, rude and incompetent judges. It says the new commission should take responsibility for handling complaints and should have power to recommend sanctions to the lord chancellor. Justice notes, however, that judges in England and Wales are held in high esteem around the world. Both Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor - who has won widespread praise for his recent appointments to high judicial office - and Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, oppose changes in the present system.

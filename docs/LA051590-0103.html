			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO OF AN ELITE KIND, IN SHARP CONTRAST;  </P> <P> PAT RILEY: THE JOY OF BEING VOTED THIS SEASON'S COACH OF THE YEAR IS DAMPENED  BY THE LAKERS' NEED TO WIN GAME 5 AGAINST PHOENIX TONIGHT.  </P> <P> Leave it to Laker Coach Pat Riley, always seeking motivational material, to  turn his long-delayed award as the NBA's coach of the year into a challenge  going into Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals tonight against the  Phoenix Suns.  </P> <P> Only this time, Riley used it as motivation for himself rather than his team, a  loss away from early elimination after finishing with the NBA's best  regular-season record.  </P> <P> "I am ready now to see if I can coach," Riley said, smirking.  </P> <P> What should have been a joyous occasion for Riley, who had been routinely  overlooked by sportswriters for the award while guiding the Lakers to four of  their five NBA titles in the 1980s, was tempered considerably by the Lakers'  plight.  </P> <P> At a Forum news conference Monday morning, the dapper Riley wryly noted the  irony of receiving the award the day before the Lakers face early elimination  from the playoffs for the first time since the Houston Rockets ousted them in  the 1986 conference finals.  </P> <P> "I thought I was walking into a gas chamber when I walked in here today," Riley  said. "I know it's ironic right now with our backs against the wall, but it  does not minimize exactly how I feel. I will cherish this award."  </P> <P> Riley, whose 533-194 record in nine seasons is the best in NBA history,  received 52 of 92 votes from selected sportswriters and broadcasters in each  NBA city.  </P> <P> Jim Lynam, who led the Philadelphia 76ers to the Atlantic Division title,  finished second with 14 1/2 votes, and Rick Adelman of the Portland Trail  Blazers finished third with 12 1/2 votes. Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons had  five and Larry Brown of the San Antonio Spurs had four. Voting was done at the  end of the regular season.  </P> <P> Riley has led the Lakers to nine consecutive Pacific Division titles. In a  milestone this season, Riley reached 500 victories quicker than any other  coach, and he has more playoff victories, 102, than any coach.  </P> <P> Riley had often joked that he had received more recognition for never having  won the award than he would have if he had won it. Last season, for instance,  Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons won the award, and Riley received one of a  possible 88 votes.  </P> <P> This season, the Lakers' first in 14 without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, they finished  63-19, the franchise's third-best record. But the Lakers have faltered in the  playoffs, losing once to Houston in the first round and three of four games so  far to the Suns.  </P> <P> Riley, admittedly distracted by the Lakers' predicament, nonetheless was  gracious and, at times, self-deprecating in accepting the honor Monday. When  Jerry West, the Laker general manager, introduced Riley by saying how proud he  was of his coach's record, Riley quipped, "What, 533 wins or 1-3?"  </P> <P> In an odd way, winning the award has been a detriment to some. Five of the last  10 recipients are no longer head coaches. The last coach of the year whose team  went on to to win the championship that season was the Lakers' Bill Sharman in  1971-72.  </P> <P> "Jerry told me last week, so I've been carrying this ever since we got beat the  very first game against Phoenix," Riley said. "I was thinking about all the  history of the coaches of the year getting fired immediately after that."  </P> <P> Riley expressed his thanks to Laker management for supplying talent, Laker  players for performing consistently well and assistant coaches Bill Bertka,  Randy Pfund and Jim Eyan for their support.  </P> <P> The last three seasons, there has been speculation that Riley would leave the  Lakers to become a broadcaster. Rumors persist that he is a candidate for a  commentator's role next season when NBC takes over coverage of the NBA.  </P> <P> Monday, Riley denied having talked to NBC. Sunday, he confirmed that Jerry  Buss, the Lakers' owner, has expressed an interest in extending Riley's  contract, which runs another two seasons. Riley said he and Buss will talk  after the season.  </P> <P> "I read, like Chuck Daly reads and like everybody else, who (the networks) want  to work for them, and my name keeps coming up all the time," Riley said. "So, I  just have to answer questions about it. It makes interesting reading and,  believe me, it doesn't help in any type of contract negotiations with Jerry. At  all.  </P> <P> "Everybody assumes (he is leaving). Why are you assuming that? That I'm fed up?  I've never said that."  </P> <P> Riley said he remains interested in coaching the Lakers mainly because he still  feels an emotional charge.  </P> <P> "The passion and the intensity of the job is what makes me feel alive," he  said. "I can do without the travel and a lot of the things on the periphery  that get in the way of the joy. But it's what I do best right now in my life.  It's what I love to do. . . .  </P> <P> "I can't think of myself being anywhere else. But I can't specifically say,  because things change. The only thing you can count on in life is the  permanence of change. So, I can't say I'll coach here the rest of my life."  </P> <P> Riley said that, despite coaching the same core of players for nearly a decade,  he can still relate to them and they still listen to him.  </P> <P> "I know there's always something you hear about, that they're tired of the same  old song," Riley said. "As long as you keep staying truthful and dealing with  the present moment -- I know I get accused of conjuring up all these  motivational ploys and all this stuff -- you can stay connected. . . .  </P> <P> "Now, it's a little different. The routine has set in. But it's not less  exciting. The thing that really ignites myself . . . is the competition, being  down on the floor, the intensity. That's where it is right now. (Tonight) will  either bring out the best in the Lakers or the worst."  </P></p>

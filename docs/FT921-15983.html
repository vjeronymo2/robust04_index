			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Danish-Malaysian investment pact MALAYSIA and Denmark have signed an investment protection and promotion agreement, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. The pact would give investments involving the two countries some protection against nationalisation and expropriation, with adequate compensation should either occur, Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's international trade and industry minister, said. 'The Malaysian government recognises the importance of providing such protection in its efforts to promote foreign direct investment,' the minister added. Malaysia had approved 16 Danish manufacturing projects worth Dollars 83.6m (Pounds 45.9m) between 1987 and November 1991, compared with 14 totalling Dollars 6.3m between 1980 and 1986. Danish investment in Malaysian manufacturing had stayed relatively small, but interest had 'shown a favourable trend'. Danish-linked manufacturing projects approved since 1981 had been mainly in the food, beverage and chemicals sectors.</p>

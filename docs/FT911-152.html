			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Mexican oil group in Pounds 180m trade facility PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state-owned oil company, has established a Pounds 180m two-year trade finance facility in the London market. The facility, arranged by Baring Brothers and NM Rothschild, will make funds available to Pemex through either bankers' acceptances or advances, writes Stephen Fidler. The financing, which complements a Dollars 2.5bn bankers' acceptance arrangement earlier this year, will partly refinance a 1987 facility arranged by the same two banks. The size of the facility will be cut over the next two years as part of Pemex's plan to repay external debt incurred during the 1980s.</p>

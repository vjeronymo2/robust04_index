			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Decision on European tobacco ads delayed HEALTH ministers yesterday delayed a decision on an EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising until November at the earliest. Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC health commissioner and the measure's strongest advocate, now fears that the British, and the Danish - who hold the EC presidency for the next two six-month terms from July - will give the directive a low priority, in effect pushing it off the agenda for a year. Ministers from Germany, Britain and the Netherlands - which form a blocking minority - yesterday reiterated their objections to a ban. Some states said it was contradictory for the European Commission to try to ban advertising while it subsidised Community tobacco production. The measure will now be discussed by national officials and should be tabled again at the next health ministers' meeting in November under the British presidency.</p>

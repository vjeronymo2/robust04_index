			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another question related to the debtor-creditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was raised by the PPC work group. The issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves situations in which a borrower relies upon a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse's income for repayment of the loan and wishes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase credit or term life and disability insurance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse, but the spouse is not a co-maker of the loan. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA considers it to be unlikely that a spouse who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly contributes to the loan's repayment would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have signed the note. Nevertheless, because spouses may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have contractual liability for the debt by operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state law, the proposed regulation would permit the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit insurance on a borrower's spouse. As with all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations, the amount of insurance offered could not exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total amount of the loan commitment to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA's review of the legislative history on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enactment of section 4.29 of the Act indicates that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debtor-creditor relationship is not necessary for System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to provide other insurance necessary to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the member's farm or aquatic unit, such as hail and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple-peril crop insurance. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restriction has been deleted in the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purchasers of other insurance would, however, have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either members or borrowers. Proposed &sect;618.8040(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would define members (for subpart B only) to include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stockholder or participation certificate holder who acquired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment purposes, or to qualify for other services of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association or bank. Therefore, the reference in existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8030(b)(1) to eligibility for landlords of tenants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tenants of landlords having a debtor-creditor relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be removed as unnecessary. Such tenants or landlords  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be eligible to receive hail or multiple-peril crop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance upon becoming members of a bank or association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar to the debtor-creditor requirement in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8040(b)(1), the purchaser of other types of insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have be to a borrower or member of the offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bank or association, but can be a borrower or member of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System bank or association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.R. Rep. No. 1287, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., 44 (1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 618.8040(b)(5)_Incentive Compensation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sale of Insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 618.8040(b)(5) is proposed to be amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify how incentive compensation for sale of insurance may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided to employees. The existing regulation states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``Bank or association personnel shall not benefit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly or indirectly, from insurance sales by receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commissions, gifts, or incentive awards.'' The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would allow incentive compensation for sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance with some limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prohibition of compensation for insurance sales was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the existing regulation to prevent conflicts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest between System employees and borrowers and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the requirement in section 4.29 of the Act that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers not be coerced into buying insurance from System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. The FCA believes that unrestricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation of loan officers or other employees, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume of insurance sales can lead to abusive, high-pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales practices. In addition, other Federal financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulators agree and continue to place limitations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee compensation derived from insurance sales. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same time, however, the FCA recognizes that if sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance is a part of an employee's regular job, incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation should be allowed to some extent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the FCA is aware that some institutions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instituted bonus pools that are shared by employees who may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be involved in selling insurance. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation accommodates those arrangements as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue of employee compensation for insurance sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was raised in 1992 when it became known that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions had employee compensation programs that allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct compensation for insurance sales. On May 20, 1992,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA issued Bookletter 327&hyph;OE, which recognized that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System employees were compensated for insurance sales in one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of two ways: (1) Incentive bonuses were directly tied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the insurance sales generated by each employee; or (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive bonuses were tied in some way to the net income of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, part of which was derived from sales of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance. The bookletter stated that compensation that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tied directly to insurance sales is not in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations. However, the FCA did not intend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply that determination to the second type of plan where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation is tied to the net income of an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since that bookletter was issued, the FCA has received a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of inquiries from System institutions requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification on whether specific compensation plans would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered acceptable. In addition, the PPC work group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that the FCA consider the issue of compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for sale of insurance as part of its project to amend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;618.8040(b)(6) allows for incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation for sale of insurance in line with what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently allowed in the commercial banking industry. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any single year, the amount of incentive compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to insurance sales cannot exceed 5 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recipient's annual base salary. This limitation applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to individual incentive plans, as well as bonus pools or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other type of plan. If an employee participates in both an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual plan and some form of bonus pool, the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive compensation attributable to sale of insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from each plan must be aggregated for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether it meets the 5-percent limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

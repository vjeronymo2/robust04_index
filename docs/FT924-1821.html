			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: Tate Gallery plans new museum The Tate Gallery in London, which houses both British and modern art, intends to split up its collections. Yesterday it revealed plans to build a new Pounds 50m plus museum of modern art in central London, to be mainly financed by money from the Millennium Fund and to be open by 2000. The existing Tate, on Millbank, will become an enlarged museum of British art. A Dollars 10m donation from an anonymous American well-wisher will enable it to build new galleries in the Tate, which should be complete by 1996. While it waits for Millennium revenue, financed through the national lottery, to come on stream, the Tate is looking for a temporary home for its modern art collection. It hopes that a property developer with an unlet building will loan it to the Tate for about five years, and perhaps contribute to the Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m needed for the conversion into an art gallery. The dual role of the Tate, as the main British gallery covering the very different fields of modern art and British art, has attracted criticism, but the main impetus for the new museum comes from the Tate's inability to display more than 15 per cent of its 5,100 paintings and sculptures. Even with the new museum only 25 per cent of its holdings will be on show at any one time. The Tate Gallery is making an early bid for Millennium money, intended to give the nation important new arts buildings to celebrate the year 2000. It will have received the government's tacit approval for the scheme, but will be expected to raise some of the money from private and corporate sources and to build up an endowment fund to finance the running of the new museum. It is possible that an existing building, like the unused Bankside power station on the Thames, will be converted to a museum if the finance for a new structure is not forthcoming. The Tate is not yet launching an appeal; it is staking a claim and hoping that its commitment will attract a response from business and government and ensure success. The Tate Gallery of British Art will show foreign artists if they have influenced British artists, and the Tate Gallery of Modern Art will exhibit some British paintings. Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, said the scheme was 'a vision put down in words,' but, along with the chairman of the Trustees, Mr Dennis Stevenson, thinks the climate is right for this ambitious project. Both museums would offer free admission.</p>

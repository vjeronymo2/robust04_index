			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE ON TOURISM;  </P> <P> SWEATING OUT COMPLETION OF THE CONVENTION CENTER  </P> <P> Champagne, brass bands and ribbon cutting notwithstanding, the National Spa and  Pool Institute says being among the first convention groups to stage a show in  the San Diego Convention Center is a dubious honor.  </P> <P> In fact, if NSPI vice president Larry Jennings had it to do over again, he  would reschedule his Alexandria, Va.-based trade association to be the  convention center's "first anniversary" group in January, 1991, giving the  center a year to get the kinks worked out, he said.  </P> <P> As it is, Jennings, whose 5,000-delegate group is due Jan. 10, is sweating out  the completion of the structure. Why the trepidation? Jennings frankly  confessed in an interview this week that the delays and snags that have  attended the construction of the $165-million center have unnerved him and his  board of directors.  </P> <P> The most recent scare came last month when San Diego Fire Marshal Jim Sewell  declared that the convention center's sprinkler system was unacceptable because  some of the sprinkler heads in the fire-safety system were obstructed by light  fixtures. Sewell's initial ruling was that the entire ballroom's sprinkler  system would have to be moved, a considerable and costly undertaking, before  the convention center owner, the San Diego Port District, could receive a  certificate of occupancy.  </P> <P> The fire marshal's ruling set of a round of finger-pointing among the  convention center architects, contractors and construction management firm over  who was to blame, how best to alleviate the problem and who should pay for it.  The story also sent shudders through the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors  Bureau (ConVis), which markets the 760,000-square foot facility. The convention  center's credibility has been damaged enough by past delays, ConVis officials  have said.  </P> <P> The sprinkler problem now seems to have been solved, at least partially, say  Sewell and project manager Billy G. Crockett of Fluor Constructors, who was  hired by the port district to oversee construction. The subcontractor  responsible for the sprinkler system apparently built an "excess number of  sprinklers" into the ceiling, sources said, meaning that even with the  obstructions, the water coverage will be adequate to meet fire safety  standards. A test by the fire marshal's office last Friday confirmed the  adequacy.  </P> <P> Sewell said a new sprinkler system still has to be built in some of the  convention's meeting rooms, but, according to Crockett, there is ample time for  the new system to be in place and not delay the center's opening.  </P> <P> Still, Jennings isn't resting easy, largely because there is so little margin  for error. He suffered another scare over the summer when 60% of the convention  center's construction crew walked off the job for 2 1/2 days to protest a  non-union crew being called in to work on the convention center's kitchen. A  protracted strike was averted when the non-union work crew agreed to organize.  Theft of some of the center's aluminum molding and glass also disrupted the  construction schedule.  </P> <P> "It's not a whole lot of fun being the first group," Jennings said this week.  Actually, the NSPI and its 5,000 delegates will be the center's second major  out-of-town occupant after Young Life, a 3,000-delegate evangelical Christian  organization from Colorado Springs that's due in Jan. 3. CHRIS KRAUL Although  the convention center opens its doors to local groups and meetings in November,  the first two months are seen as a "shakedown phase" to train staff in the  center's operating procedures, marketing director Carroll Armstrong said. The  first two months will also be used to promote local good-will for the center.  Toward that end, the convention center management is planning a three-day  "Community Celebration" over Thanksgiving Day weekend. San Diegans will be  invited to tour the center during the weekend, and nonprofit groups will be  allowed to set up booths in the center free of charge. Entertainment is  planned, and food prepared by the convention center's food service department  will be available at "reasonable" prices, Armstrong said. That the convention  center will be an economic dynamo throwing off profits to local businesses,  particularly hotels, has become accepted local doctrine. According to ConVis,  the center will draw 171,200 more convention delegates to San Diego in 1990, or  25% more than total conventioneers in 1988, resulting in the sale of an  estimated 252,000 more hotel room nights, a 30% increase in hotel room nights  sold to conventioneers over 1988. But other kinds of businesses will benefit as  well. And assisting those businesses in getting their fair share of the  convention center windfall is the purpose of a series of seminars to start in  October, sponsored by ConVis. Visitors will be given advice in catering to  conventioneers' needs in transportation, food service, shopping and special  events. Those interested in attending may call ConVis at 232-3101, Ext. 107.  </P></p>

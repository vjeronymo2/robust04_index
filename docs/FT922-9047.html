			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Books: Sweet desolation of freedom JAZZ by Toni Morrison Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 229 pages PLAYING IN THE DARK by Toni Morrison Harvard Univ. Press Pounds 11.95, 91 pages TONI MORRISON'S fifth novel, Beloved, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988, explored the immediate psychological aftermath of slavery in the US during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. Conceived as a sequel, Jazz is set in Harlem in 1926 among the burgeoning community of African-Americans who fled north after emancipation to escape landlessness and lynchings. While the novel's unnamed narrator hymns 'the City' in confiding, colloquial tones, relaying snatches of melody from street-corner musicians and ubiquitous Victrolas, the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance are only obliquely evoked. Jazz is present principally as a motif, signalling a new freedom and sensuality alongside an overwhelming compulsion to forget. 'Here comes the new. Look out. There goes the sad stuff. The bad stuff . . . Forget that. History is over, you all, and everything's ahead at last.' The vision proves illusory for Joe Trace, a door-to-door beauty produce salesman and his wife Violet, who arrived from Virginia 20 years earlier on a 'dancing train'. The novel begins as Joe has shot dead his young lover, Dorcas, whose face Violet has attempted to slash with a knife at the funeral. It is the complex motivations behind this melodrama that unfold through the fragmented narrative, with its shifting viewpoints and its flashbacks to the south, of families dispossessed, houses burned, men hanged and mothers absent or suicidal. Through Morrison's fictional 're-remembering' of forgotten black histories she suggests the delusory nature of free action where the determining demons of the past have been neither exhumed nor exorcised. The music that expresses freedom's 'sweet desolation' also contains a 'complicated anger', disguised as 'flourish and roaring seduction', that can trigger self-destruction. Yet, in a narrative twist, Jazz reaffirms the possibility of freedom, of transcending rather than succumbing to the past as 'an abused record with no choice but to repeat itself at the crack'. In place of the sensational events initially promised the reader, Joe and Violet opt for a healing, even cloying, reconciliation, for 'figuring things out'. The storyteller confesses both her power and her inadequacy, her characters having been 'busy being original, complicated, changeable, human . . . putting their lives together in ways I never dreamed of'. While Jazz displays Morrison's supreme ability to illuminate social process and the sweep of history through character, those seeking the emotional authority of Beloved or the visionary intensity of The Bluest Eye, Sula or Song of Solomon, are likely to be disappointed in Jazz's preoccupation with its own construction; the self-consciousness of the telling has perhaps been at the expense of the tale Morrison, a revered chronicler of the African-American experience, in a collection of essays on the work of white American writers, challenges 'American Africanism': the 'disabling virus' of myths, stereotypes and misconceptions of African peoples, to which her own fiction is a powerful antidote. In Playing in the Dark she argues that, just as the Enlightenment's concept of freedom was parasitical on the reality of slavery, the rights of man yoked inevitably to the assumption of racial hierarchy, the concerns of a nascent American literature were shaped by the white relationship to a 'dark, abiding, signing Africanist presence'. Developed with illustrations from Poe, Twain, Melville, Hemingway and others, Morrison's argument provocatively extends critiques of colonial literature (notably Edward Said's Orientalism, or the Nigerian Chinua Achebe's dissection of Conrad) to white American writing in its relation to its own subordinate black population. In doing so, she challenges the 'universalist' or 'race-free' pretensions of a literature whose habitual resort to shorthand constructions of blackness marks it out as the product of white writers with an assumed white readership. More crucially, her sombre conclusion that racism 'is as healthy as it was during the Enlightenment', its utility as a metaphor having outstripped its ideological purpose in justifying economic exploitation, lays down a challenge to others to share her own project as a writer: to 'free-up' the language from the 'sinister, lazy, predictable racial codes' that pervade and impoverish it.</p>

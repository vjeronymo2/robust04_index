			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  described as a very good and positive step Sanaa's decision to  observe a cease-fire as of midnight last night. It is important  to respect the cease-fire in a strict way because it represents  the right step toward resolving the crisis, Musa said.    Commenting on the postponement of the Damascus Declaration  meeting, originally scheduled for Tuesday [28 June], Musa said  that the postponement occurred due to certain obligations of  some foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration's signatory  countries.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Keeping ahead of the game - The Financial Law Panel plans to act, rather than react The Financial Law Panel was set up on the recommendation of the Bank of England's Legal Risks Review Committee to help solve problems of legal uncertainty said to be threatening London's future as an international financial centre. To many outsiders its creation was a sign of weakness, confirmation that London had a problem. But to Colin Bamford, the panel's new chief executive, it meant quite the reverse. 'I think it is a sign of the great strength of the English system. It has been seen as a weakness because of the Hammersmith and Fulham swaps case. People said 'Oh dear, English law can't cope'. But the same would have been true about any other jurisdiction. It's just that the problem materialised here.' It was the House of Lords' 1990 decision in the Hammersmith and Fulham case which led to the creation of the Legal Risk Review Committee. The Law Lords ruled that swaps contracts between banks and local authorities were invalid because local authorities had never been empowered by government to carry out swaps. The swaps contracts were therefore ultra vires. Banks, many of them foreign, were outraged at being unable to enforce the contracts. In general, Mr Bamford believes concern that legal uncertainty is undermining London's position is overdone. English commercial law is the most advanced in the world, he says. If there is a problem with legal uncertainty it affects all legal systems equally. Huge markets are growing up in very quick time. The trouble is that legal systems tend to be reactive, he says. They don't anticipate problems and everybody is only too aware that, given the size of these new markets, the first time a problem arises its impact could be catastrophic. The panel was set up precisely to try and anticipate where problems might arise. So it is a positive move, he says, which shows that at least the English system is addressing the issue. No one else has a similar type of body - yet. When the panel was proposed Lord Alexander, the former Bar chairman and chairman of NatWest who headed the Bank's review committee, said he envisaged it evolving into a body like the Takeover Panel, giving informal advice to firms about the legality of financial transactions they might be contemplating. Its judgments would not have the force of law but Lord Alexander said he hoped they would carry weight if they came to court. Lord Justice Hoffmann, a member of the review committee, had told him he thought the courts would give weight to the panel's decisions. But Bamford, a 42-year-old City solicitor with a commercial banking background, sounds a note of caution. The panel will have to earn the respect of the courts first and that will take time. The only precedent is the Takeover Panel, which took 10-15 years to acquire that level of authority. He also says that the Panel will have to be careful not to usurp the role of the courts, particularly in areas which might involve white collar crime. But it will be able to provide guidance as to best practice in the absence of specific guidance in the legislation. All that, however, is for the future. In its first year of operation the panel is unlikely to be in a position to consult widely and disseminate best practice on problems brought to it at this stage because one consequence of the Bank's review committee was that by the time it was set up it had a ready made agenda. Three or four years down the line, the Panel may operate on a different pattern, he says, but for the first year at least everything it looks at will be drawn from a list of problems presented to Lord Alexander's committee during its review. The panel has identified 11 areas of concern on which it will concentrate over the next 12 months and has already formed working parties to look at two problem areas - shadow directorships and banks taking security over cash. The market needs a definitive view on taking security over cash because at the moment it is getting different advice from different lawyers, says Bamford. He has chosen a working party of high-powered lawyers: Professor Roy Goode, Philip Wood of Allen &amp; Overy, Francis Neate of Slaughter and May and Michael Crystal QC, to look at the issue. He chose them on the basis that whatever they say should carry weight with lawyers whichever side of the debate they are on. He has also identified three big potential problem areas for early attention: vires, looking not only at local authorities and swaps but also at a whole host of associated problems and uncertainties relating to building societies, insurance companies and public bodies; fiduciary duties  -a very large and highly complex issue at which the Law Commission is also looking; and netting. Netting is an area where if problems arose, consequences for the markets would be enormous, says Bamford. The Bank's committee received submissions from the foreign exchange, bullion, derivatives, money and securities markets stressing the importance of netting and set-off on insolvency. At its simplest level, netting involves the set-off of reciprocal obligations between transaction costs. When it works effectively, is recognised by the counterparties and is designed to reduce insolvency exposures, capital requirements can be greatly reduced since the credit and liquidity exposures of participants are also reduced. The problem is that while netting has always been accepted as a basic principle of English insolvency law it is not accepted as a basic principle in the US and in mainland Europe, although America has recently passed legislation to allow it, so that it can bring its capital adequacy rules into line with England's. 'It's not that there is a legal problem,' Bamford says. 'It's just that the consequences if there were one would be so enormous. If you had a collapse in one of the big markets and someone discovered that the netting of operations across the market didn't work the way everybody thought that they would, the implications would be absolutely staggering. So it merits worrying about even though there is nothing wrong at the moment,' he says. When the worrying has been done by the various working parties and by Bamford and his team of seconded lawyers, their deliberations on the issues will then be considered by the full panel, chaired by Lord Donaldson, former Master of the Rolls. In general, Bamford expects the 15 panel members to play a monitoring role, ensuring its work is going in the right direction. He also expects the panel to be a success. If it is, he says, it will be interesting to see, by the time he hands over to his successor three years from now, whether the Americans have followed suit and set up a panel of their own.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI JOURNALISTS SHUN SETTLERS OVER SHAM NEWS CREWS  </P> <P> Israeli journalists said today they will refuse to report on Jewish settlers in  the occupied territories after some settlers pretended to be correspondents by  putting press signs on their vehicles.  </P> <P> Ronnie Shaked, head of Israeli journalists covering the West Bank and Gaza  Strip, said correspondents have been put in greater danger in covering the  15-month-old uprising because Palestinians now doubt the identity of real  journalists.  </P> <P> Militant settlers traveling in vans bearing press signs clashed several times  with Palestinians last week.  </P> <P> "Lately everyone wants to be a journalist. The police disguised as journalists.  Now the settlers put up the press signs and in the name of journalism carry out  activities no journalist would," Shaked said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The State Statistical  Bureau (SSB) said today that the month of April saw basically  normal development of China's national economy, thanks to the  macro-economic control measures that started last June.    Industrial production was up by 170.9 billion yuan,  representing a two percent increase over the average level in  the previous three months, said an SSB report released today.    The SSB said that the investment structure in April was  better than last year, with more money going to the transport  industry, but less to machinery and textile industries, luxury  villas and hotels.    State enterprises completed 55.4 billion yuan of investment  in fixed assets, 8 percent more than the average level of the  first quarter.    Demand and supply in consumer goods remained balanced, the  ssb said, noting that the total retail sales reached 117 billion  yuan, 24.3 percent more than in April of 1993 or a four percent  increase in real terms.    The growth of exports outpaced that of imports for the first  time since September 1992, with the export volume reaching 8.94  billion U.S. dollars.    The state revenue receipts and expenditure increased by 23.5  percent over April of 1993, according to the SSB, indicating the  normal operation of the new tax system.    The bureau said that enterprises' shortage of funds was  eased  to some extent and the bank savings increased dramatically  despite the fact that a large amount had been diverted to buy  state treasury bonds.    The momentum of price hikes was blunted. Consumer price in  the month was 21.7 percent higher than the same month of last  year but the range of increase fell by 0.7 percentage points  from March, it said.</p>

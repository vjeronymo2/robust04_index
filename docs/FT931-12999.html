			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Clinton gives Hillary key health task PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday put his wife, Hillary, in charge of a presidential task force on health care reform, widely regarded as the most pressing social challenge facing his administration. He said the task force would work 'night and day' to have legislative proposals ready for Congress within 100 days of his inauguration. The appointment makes Mrs Clinton the most powerful first lady in memory. Mrs Rosalyn Carter, wife of former President Jimmy Carter, chaired a presidential commission on mental health but it had nothing like the scope of the health care task force. The last relative of a president to exert comparable influence was Mr Robert Kennedy, who became attorney general in his brother's administration. A subsequent law prohibited the appointment of close relatives to cabinet positions. The task force will include Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary and an old Clinton friend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, as well as other cabinet officers and White House staff. Mrs Clinton will not be paid. Mr Clinton said he had turned to his wife because 'she's better at organising and leading people from a complex beginning to a certain end than anybody I've ever met in my life'. While governor of Arkansas he put her in charge of a committee that devised educational reforms now considered one of his main achievements. Mr Clinton said it was time to 'make sense' of the US health care system. Tough choices had to be made if costs were to be controlled and insurance extended to the 35m or so people without cover. Mrs Clinton, 45, is a prominent Arkansas lawyer and a former chairwoman of the Children's Defence Fund. She is widely regarded as being politically to the left of her husband. Her appointment may thus indicate that he is envisaging a radical reform of the US health system, which relies more heavily on the private sector than other industrial countries. Mr Clinton vowed yesterday to lift a ban on homosexuals in the armed forces, refusing to back down in the face of strong opposition from the military and Congress, Reuter reports from Washington. Announcement of the policy is expected within a week.</p>

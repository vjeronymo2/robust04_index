			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIG PROMISES, BIG DREAMS AND INVESTOR RUINS;  </P> <P> INVESTMENTS: A SANTA ANA PROMOTER OFFERED 22% RETURNS AND A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE,  BUT AUTHORITIES SAY IT WAS THE LARGEST FRAUD EVER AGAINST THE SOUTHLAND LATINO  COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> For thousands of low-income Latinos, Jose Manuel de la Jara burst on to the  scene as a modern-day messiah promising to transport his own kind into  middle-class comfort and a life free of financial concerns.  </P> <P> On Spanish-speaking television and radio, De la Jara repeatedly broadcast his  message of hope -- he knew a way to earn a 22% annual rate of return.  </P> <P> Guaranteed.  </P> <P> De la Jara's Santa Ana-based American Finance and Investment Group (Inversiones  Y Finanzas Americanas) claimed it was buying real estate around Southern  California and it was looking for partners.  </P> <P> The company's salespeople said de la Jara knew what he was doing. He was, they  said, a rich businessman from Peru. He had a couple of Mercedeses and a big  house in Costa Mesa. And he wanted to spread the wealth.  </P> <P> "He was a Latino and he was getting ahead, so I figured I could too," Los  Angeles investor Jose Espinosa De Los Monteros said through an interpreter.  </P> <P> Federal and state authorities now say IFA was nothing more than a  well-contrived scam, the largest ever perpetrated on the Latino community in  Southern California. De la Jara, they say, operated a Ponzi scheme through IFA  in order to enrich himself from March, 1988, through September, 1989.  </P> <P> So far, a state-appointed receiver -- who is selling off de la Jara's estate --  has identified 700 investors who have lost more than $8.2 million. Most of the  money has vanished.  </P> <P> The victims are nearly all working-class people, scattered around Southern  California. Very few speak English.  </P> <P> "People are in financial ruins," said Carlos Negrete, a San Juan Capistrano  attorney representing several victims. "I don't know of one family that wasn't  literally devastated by it."  </P> <P> De la Jara is now under investigation by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on  bank and mail fraud charges.  </P> <P> Investigators say he wasn't the godsend he seemed.  </P> <P> For starters, de la Jara is wanted by Interpol -- the international police  agency -- for misappropriation and swindling in his native Peru. Police there  say he carried out a scheme similar to IFA, bilking Peruvian investors out of  $7 million in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Besides being an alleged con artist, federal authorities claim de la Jara  launders money for associates of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, he was convicted in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on  money-laundering charges. The prosecution introduced into evidence scores of  documents seized from de la Jara's home and business, including a notebook full  of names and telephone numbers of known narcotics traffickers.  </P> <P> De la Jara, 44, is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Los  Angeles. He refused to be interviewed for this story, but in the past has  denied the charges against him. He has said he is an honest businessman, forced  out of Peru because of threats against his life.  </P> <P> Five years ago, de la Jara and his son were kidnaped in Lima by the feared Los  Retacos gang of brothers -- Peru's version of Jesse and Frank James -- who  strapped dynamite to de la Jara's chest and threatened to blow him up unless  his well-to-do family paid them $1 million.  </P> <P> The family handed over the ransom and then fled to the United States, where de  la Jara eventually started IFA. He has used as many as 10 aliases in the last  three years, something he says was necessary to stay one step ahead of his  kidnapers.  </P> <P> "This entire case is very Alice in Wonderland," concluded state Department of  Corporations attorney Dorene B. Wolf.  </P> <P> Catalina Torres came to this country from Mexico in 1977. Even though she earns  only about $200 a week sewing garments 10 hours a day, Torres and her husband  had managed to put away $40,000 in savings.  </P> <P> In late 1988, the South-Central Los Angeles couple were notified that the  building they live in is going to be demolished at the end of this year. Torres  decided it was time they bought a house, but she figured they needed more money  first.  </P> <P> While watching Spanish-language KMEX Channel 34, Torres saw an ad for IFA. The  company was guaranteeing a 22% interest rate -- not as much as the 40% you can  earn in inflation-plagued Mexico, but pretty good nonetheless.  </P> <P> She paid a visit to the company's East Los Angeles office and met with a  salesman.  </P> <P> "I went there and I spoke to him before I gave him the money and he told me  they were a company that had been in business 25 years," Torres said through an  interpreter. "He said the money was going to be safe."  </P> <P> She invested $40,000 in January of 1989 and has apparently lost it all. Now the  Torreses aren't sure where they and their two children are going to live after  their apartment building is destroyed. "You can't imagine how I feel," she  said.  </P> <P> Federal and state investigators say her experience is typical of those who  passed through IFA.  </P> <P> The company told investors they would earn very high interest on money loaned  to IFA, which would be secured by trust deeds on one of 16 different properties  the company had acquired around Southern California.  </P> <P> People invested anywhere from $1,000 to $300,000 -- the average loan was about  $40,000. The company had promised to give trust deeds on the properties to  anybody loaning IFA more than $20,000.  </P> <P> The state Department of Corporations claims IFA sought loans on the same  properties over and over again and then issued numerous trust deeds on the same  house. On de la Jara's Costa Mesa home, for instance, county records show there  are eight people holding trust deeds. They had invested close to $280,000  collectively.  </P> <P> Some trust deeds were actually recorded with county officials and a few deeds  were allegedly issued on property IFA didn't own, according to state  investigators.  </P> <P> "By having a trust deed, investors thought, 'I have a secured interest in a  property,' not realizing that if it's not recorded it's not worthless but close  to it," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Carolyn Kubota.  </P> <P> For a while, early investors in IFA didn't suspect anything was wrong because  monthly interest was paid on time. But state officials say that was because de  la Jara was running a Ponzi scheme -- paying earlier investors with the money  provided by new investors.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo National Bank claims in a lawsuit against de la Jara that he  duped it into loaning him around $1 million by using 11 of the 16 properties as  collateral.  </P> <P> The tiny institution said title searches showed numerous owners of each  property but that de la Jara provided them with full reconveyances -- which  state officials now say were forged -- showing IFA owned the property outright.  </P> <P> State examiners now say De la Jara needed those loans from Mission Viejo to  keep IFA afloat.  </P> <P> Just where all of the money has gone is something of a mystery, particularly  because IFA failed to keep its books up to date. The raid on de la Jara's home  and IFA headquarters did produce documents showing he had opened several  offshore bank accounts.  </P> <P> He paid $29,500 to the government of Montserrat to operate International  Hispanic Bank of North America in the British West Indies. And he had an  account with St. Gallische Kantonal Bank in Switzerland. Both institutions  refuse to provide any information to U.S. authorities.  </P> <P> State auditors say they know IFA took in at least $14.7 million, but only about  $500,000 in cash and $2.6 million in real estate were remaining last September  when law enforcement officials raided the company.  </P> <P> "The defendant had cleaned out the bank accounts pretty well before we got  there," Wolf said.  </P> <P> IFA allegedly commingled investor funds, which were used to pay some of de la  Jara's personal expenses, according to the state audits.  </P> <P> "He misappropriated investor funds for personal use, ran no legitimate  income-producing enterprise and utilized funds of later investors to pay off  the earlier investors," said state appointed receiver Gilbert Vasquez.  </P> <P> Jorge Palomino said he was so upset about losing his money he hired a private  detective to track down de la Jara.  </P> <P> He wasn't any happier when he discovered de la Jara was in a U.S. jail.  </P> <P> Palomino is one of hundreds of investors in Peru who claim de la Jara fled to  the United States with funds they had invested in his first investment company,  International Money Market of Lima.  </P> <P> The Florida Department of Banking and Finance says it has received about a  dozen complaints from Peruvians saying de la Jara had millions of dollars in  investments transferred to Miami.  </P> <P> "They had purchased what they believed were certificates of deposit in Peru,"  said Florida banking investigator Morgan Cronin. "Mr. de la Jara had a lot of  those funds transferred into Florida banks."  </P> <P> Cronin said his department is investigating de la Jara with the U.S. Attorney's  office in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Palomino, a rare-book dealer, says he lost $50,000 to de la Jara.  </P> <P> "He has an ambition to get money," Palomino said through an interpreter. "He  had very nice houses (in Peru) and he always flaunted his money."  </P> <P> Because de la Jara has used so many aliases and has admitted moving from place  to place, his background is a bit blurry.  </P> <P> He was born on Sept. 17, 1945, somewhere in Peru. He became wealthy there at  least in part from exchanging inte, the Peruvian currency, for U.S. dollars. He  has testified in court in Los Angeles that he ran one of his country's largest  currency-exchange businesses, Picaref S.A. ($30-million annual revenue, U.S.  dollars).  </P> <P> The Peruvian government nationalized its banking system in 1987 and Picaref was  shut down.  </P> <P> De la Jara has said Interpol's issuance of an arrest warrant against him is  wholly politically motivated.  </P> <P> "The Peruvian government instigated a series of administrative and judicial  proceedings to discredit Mr. de la Jara and his business affairs in Peru," his  wife, Maria Ledesma, said in a court filing.  </P> <P> De la Jara moved to Miami the same year Picaref closed and opened an  International Money Market branch there.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors claim de la Jara was already laundering drug money at this  point, out of Miami and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service first noticed in the summer of 1987 that de la  Jara -- using the name Jose O. Fernandez -- was depositing hundreds of  thousands of dollars in Southern California banks in increments of less than  $10,000. Federal law requires cash transactions of more than $10,000 to be  reported to the U.S. Treasury Department.  </P> <P>  During de la Jara's money-laundering trial, a former associate testified the  two men drove around Southern California in August, 1987, with a paper bag in  the trunk containing $126,000. They made deposits at 16 different branches of  Bank of America.  </P> <P> De la Jara's attorney, public defender Lupe Martinez, told jurors his client  didn't want the money to be detected for fear it would be seized by Peruvian  authorities.  </P> <P> But Assistant U.S. Atty. Karin Immergut said de la Jara was laundering drug  money and showed jurors a notebook in his handwriting which contained detailed  information about narcotics traffickers.  </P> <P> Among the entries was this one about two traffickers: "They have contact with  fishermen who transport the drug from the Islands that are close to Miami in  the Bahamas Zone. They work for one of Pablo Escobar's trusted men in Miami. He  goes by the name of Jerry . . . This guy, Jerry, is a very dangerous man."  Escobar has been identified by U.S. officials as chief of the Medellin drug  cartel.  </P> <P> Some of the descriptions were so detailed they included information such as  what kind of car a particular trafficker was driving.  </P> <P> "Luis drives a Chevette, light blue with dark blue doors. . . . He supplies  weapons to the Colombian guerrillas in exchange for drugs," the entry read.  </P> <P> Immergut then showed jurors what she said were payoff ledgers, which contain  the names of many of the same traffickers.  </P> <P> "There were references to kilograms and amounts that appeared to correspond to  kilogram prices of cocaine," Immergut said. "He said they were currency  exchange rates."  </P> <P> De la Jara said he had gotten in contact with the narcotics traffickers because  he thought they could help him catch his kidnapers.  </P> <P> "He was looking for these people to help him look for those individuals who had  kidnaped him and were hiding out in Colombia," said IRS special agent Ray  Rivera, who has interviewed de la Jara. "His rationale for that was that the  only ones with power in Colombia are the drug traffickers."  </P> <P> To cement a case against de la Jara, the Internal Revenue Service conducted a  sting operation against him last year. Federal agents wanted to get him on tape  agreeing to launder supposed drug money.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo in Glendora agreed to employ an undercover IRS agent as a personal  banker and within six months he had befriended de la Jara. Agent Oscar Garcia  soon approached de la Jara about laundering some money, supposedly from drugs.  </P> <P> "De la Jara answered that that was not a problem. He said that in today's world  there are few businesses that are not involved in something illegal," according  to an IRS affidavit. "De la Jara discussed de la Jara's ability to get money  into various South and Central American countries. De la Jara indicated that  Colombia was a problem; Venezuela was fine but Costa Rica was better."  </P> <P> De la Jara was convicted April 24 on three of the four money-laundering charges  stemming from that undercover operation.  </P> <P> The IRS agent brought in an undercover investigator from the Drug Enforcement  Administration, who told de la Jara he was a narcotics trafficker whose main  business was selling chemicals used to make cocaine.  </P> <P> "On Aug. 8, 1989, de la Jara stated that he was interested in obtaining ether"  used in processing of cocaine paste, the affidavit claims. And later --  according to the affidavit -- de la Jara "suggested that maybe he could help  with the selling of the cocaine."  </P> <P> But later "de la Jara informed the undercover agent that he currently did not  have a customer for the cocaine and suggested that the cocaine deal be put on  the back burner for now. De la Jara told the undercover agent that the people  he spoke with were distrustful of people they did not know."  </P> <P> Exactly one week before Christmas last year, state-appointed receivers Gilbert  Vasquez and Oscar Gamez met with about 600 families in the auditorium at East  Los Angeles College. One by one, victims approached the microphone and pleaded  to get their money back. One man said if he was only going to get one penny on  the dollar he wanted to get that one penny now.  </P> <P> State officials say they don't know how much -- if anything at all -- can be  returned to investors. For many, the damage is already done.  </P> <P> Alfonso Garcia, 44, owned two small houses in Orange County and took out  mortgages on both thinking he could increase his income. The mortgages were at  10% or 11% and IFA was supposedly paying 22%.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana resident lost $120,000 and is now having trouble keeping up with  his mortgage payments even though he and his wife are working an extra eight  hours a day.  </P> <P> But he says the worst thing of all was deciding he had no choice but to sell  his childhood home in Mexico.  </P> <P> "My father bought that house when he was very young, even before he got  married," Garcia said through an interpreter. "In my life and in all of my  family's life this is a big disaster."  </P> <P> </P> <P> INVESTIGATION INTO AMERICAN INVESTMENTS (IFA)  </P> <P> The company's records included a listing of the 16 properties used as  collateral for trust deeds issued to investors. In most cases, the amount owed  to investors exceeds the cost of the property. Although trust deeds totaling  $3.6 million were issued, state appointed receiver said other records indicate  that the total "invested" was closer to $8.2 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homes Owned by American Investments (per city)  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:2.11IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Address  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Estimated  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Encumbrances  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Cost  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (Trust Deeds)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> LONG BEACH  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 23 68th St.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $136,408  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $160,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> COSTA MESA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1085 Tulare Dr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 290,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 260,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> SANTA ANA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 111 N.

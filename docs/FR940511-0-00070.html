A permit may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted by the Director of the Office for Ocean and Coastal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resource Management or designee if he or she finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity will not substantially injure Sanctuary resources and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualities and will: Further research related to Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources; further the educational, natural or historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource value of the Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations in or near the Sanctuary in connection with a recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air or marine casualty; assist in the management of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery operations in connection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an abandoned shipwreck in the Sanctuary title to which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held by the State of Washington; or promote the welfare of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian tribe.

In addition, the Director or designee is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized to consider any other factors she or he deems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.10 sets forth procedures for requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or rights in existence on the date of Sanctuary designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizing the conduct of an activity prohibited under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (a)(2)&hyph;(8) of &sect;925.5.

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> KELLAWAY'S WAY AT LE CAFE  </P> <P> Fortunately for a local gathering of admirers, Roger Kellaway decided to  celebrate his 50th birthday Wednesday (with a follow-up Thursday) at Le Cafe in  Sherman Oaks. It was a double celebration, since his drummer, John Guerin, had  reached the big Five-0 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Kellaway belongs to a rare breed of piano virtuosi who can be said to defy  classification. He blends the lyricism of a Bill Evans with the energy of McCoy  Tyner. He may open unaccompanied with a series of chordal speculations, then  ease unpredictably into some familiar song -- "Just Friends" or "If I Were a  Bell" -- to which he will bring, at various points, sumptuous harmonic ideas,  coruscating cascades of two-handed runs and crashing dissonances.  </P> <P> Chasing down more stylistic avenues than a rainbow has hues, he may reach the  end of the last chorus, then keep going with a series of hard-cooking tags,  like a letter with a hundred postscripts. At all times he is sensitively  followed by Guerin and by his longtime bassist Chuck Domanico.  </P> <P> Kellaway's way with the blues was twice demonstrated. The contrast between  "Blue Monk" and "All Blues" was striking, since the former is your basic,  melodically jejune blues tune, yet he was able to bring everything to it from  atonality to deep indigo funk, whereas "All Blues" is an inherently fascinating  Miles Davis masterpiece on which the trio elaborated, doubling and halving the  tempo, building the tension while Domanico's ecstatic expression underlined the  mutual jubilation.  </P> <P> That Kellaway is a gifted composer was illustrated in "Love of My Life," which  he recorded recently with Yo-Yo Ma. That he works no less compellingly  unaccompanied was shown in his solo version of the 60-year-old "I'll Never Be  the Same," to which he brought his personally graceful touch. Here as  everywhere, he demonstrated that for him improvisation is not only the art of  creation, but the art of sublimation. Roger Kellaway is an authentic 20th  Century genius.

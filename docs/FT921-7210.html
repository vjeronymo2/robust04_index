			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / German Bunds: Investors ponder indicators amid uneasy calm THE GERMAN Bund market has now entered a reflective phase. The surge in prices which followed the Bundesbank's interest rate move just before Christmas has given way to an uneasy calm as investors ponder the implications of this month's settlement in the steel sector and the outlook for money supply and inflation. On all these counts, there has been a worsening of sentiment since the end of last year. Investors - largely international investors - then bought heavily because they assumed the Bundesbank's shock tactics would drum moderation into the unions and deal a fast blow to headline inflation, thus creating the conditions whereby interest rates could be brought down again sharply. In fact, there was a consensus earlier in the year that rates would be cut as early as April, assuming that shortly before then there would emerge conclusive evidence that inflation in the western part of Germany was not going to reach the feared annualised rate of 5 per cent at all. Thus there were fairly general predictions that the yield on the 10-year long Bund would tumble to 7.5 per cent by the middle of the year, down from 8.25 per cent before December's rate cut. The outlook for inflation has not worsened in the intervening weeks, but perceptions about the Bundesbank's interest rate stance have. The market senses a growing likelihood that the hoped-for rate cut will not come until the third quarter of the year at the earliest. Hence the Bund yield is currently lodged at 7.94 per cent - fractionally down on its best for the current year - and pundits are more reluctant to predict further imminent price gains. It is too strong to say the market has been infected by outright pessimism. However, the strike settlement, with a pay increase of an effective 6.35 per cent, was undoubtedly higher than the central bank would have liked and is bound to have an impact on the forthcoming wage negotiations in the public and engineering sectors. The steelworkers' settlement is therefore deemed likely to act as a spur to prolonged vigilance in monetary policy. The news on inflation is more positive: Dieter Wermuth at the Caisse des Depots et Consignations in Frankfurt points out that import prices have been falling at an annualised rate of 5 per cent since June last year, and that export prices for January are likely to have risen by only 1.2 per cent year on year. The year-on-year rate for consumer prices is likely to be 4.1 per cent for February. 'An excellent result,' says Mr Wermuth, and one which makes 5 per cent look less probable later in the year. On the other hand, figures out on Friday showed that money supply grew at an annualised rate of 9 per cent in January - well outside the 3.5 to 5.5 per cent range set for the whole of 1992. The Bundesbank is determined to choke off this growth - another reason why rates are unlikely to be brought down in the short term. On balance, commentators believe the medium-term prognosis is favourable, that interest rates will be on their way down again within six months or so. But that is not what international investors were hoping for when they bought so vigorously earlier in the year and, in the short term, the market seems likely to stagnate at current levels.</p>

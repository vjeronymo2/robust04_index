			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index challenges 3,000 mark FAVOURABLE data on the domestic economy and a cut in French interest rates brought new peaks in UK stocks yesterday, as the FT-SE 100 Index market mounted a challenge to the 3,000 mark which it will have in its sights when it opens for business this morning. Encouragement for equities came from stock index futures, where the September contract moved briefly above 3,000, and also from continued firmness in British government bonds. The reduction of a quarter of a point in the 24 hour lending rate of the French central bank strengthened optimism in London that rate cuts in Europe will open the way for a further cut in UK base rates, probably in the autumn. Predictions in the City of London are that base rates will fall to 5 per cent. Confidence in the progress of economic recovery in the UK was buttressed yesterday by the latest statistics on UK producer prices and consumer credit. Producer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in July, slightly less than expected, while consumer credit increased to Pounds 4.69bn, supporting expectations that consumer spending is leading the economy out of the recession. Economic optimis was also encouraged by reports that the Bank of England quarterly bulletin, due today, will indicate that British firms have survived the recent economic recession in better shape than they were after the recession at the beginning of the 1980s. The market advance was fairly restrained at first, however, and the new intra day trading peak of 2,986.8 on the Footsie was not established until late afternoon when London was cheered by an early gain of 20 Dow points early in the New York session. The Footsie 100 Index closed 16.6 up at 2,986.4. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued its headlong advance, gaining 6.6 to yet another new peak of 3,399.4. Private investors, who tend to concentrate on the Mid 250 list, played a leading role in the market yesterday. Trading in non-Footsie stocks expanded to make up around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 525.3m shares; on Friday, 681.3m shares traded through the Seaq network, worth Pounds 1.48bn in retail or customer business. Retail business has exceeded Pounds 1.37bn daily for the past nine trading sessions, indicating a good level of profitability for the London-based securities houses. The big investment institutions were also buyers of UK stocks yesterday although they were unwilling to chase share prices in a market now in such clearly confident mood. High levels of turnover in such blue chip names as British Gas and BT disclosed the presence of managers of the pension funds. Very heavy trading was recorded in Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer, as rumours re-emerged that Pittsburgh Steel may yet make a bid for the equity. The influence of the Wall Street market brought only modest support for the heavyweight oil stocks and pharmaceuticals traced a somewaht uncertain path. Consumer issues, including most of the leading retail stores, continued to lead the advance in the interest-related sectors. In the banking sector, which was still digesting last week's profits statements from the leading UK houses, investors became more cautious in their selection of shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Raja Zafar-ul Haq by Irfan Siddiqui; place </F> and date not given]    [Excerpt] [Siddiqui] You keep a very close eyes on foreign  affairs, especially those related to the problems of the Islamic  world. What is your opinion of the present situation in Kashmir?    [Zafar-ul Haq] Briefly, I would say that Kashmir is a living  example of India's atrocities, Pakistan's mistaken policies, the  unprecedented brave struggle of the Kashmiri people, the  helplessness of the Islamic world, and the biased policies of  the international community. There are 27 places in the world  where human rights are being seriously violated. The deplorable  fact is that 23 of these 27 places are populated by Muslims.  Kashmir is the most prominent place among them. The present  movement has resulted from Indian atrocities. India has gone to  extremes in committing atrocities during the last four years.  But it failed to crush the freedom struggle. I believe that  since the partition of the subcontinent, the campaign in Kashmir  has never been so widespread or powerful as is now. India has  changed governors here three times during this period, and every  new governor has claimed that he would crush the movement in  little time. Krishnarao said in an INDIA TODAY interview, "If I  get three or four more months, I will break the backs of those  who want independence." India is continuously increasing its  military forces, but the more the number of Indian troops  increases--and it increases along with atrocities--the stronger  the independence movement becomes. Thousands of people have  become the prey of bullets. Those in jail are being killed and  tortured. Houses, shops, and villages are being burned. There  has been a rapid increase in the incidence of rapes. The  movement is still going on, and perhaps it will be impossible  for India to crush it.    [Siddiqui] What can you say about the success of this  movement?    [Zafar-ul Haq] I have no good expectations from India's  treachery and stubbornness. It does not support resolving the  Kashmir issue peacefully, by sitting around a table or by  holding a plebiscite according to the UN resolution. We have  learned over the centuries that when a community decides to  break the shackles of slavery and is willing to make any  sacrifice to do so, then no power can keep that community  enslaved with military force and weapons. The sooner India  understands this, the better.    [Siddiqui] Has there been any change in international  attitudes?    [Zafar-ul Haq] As I mentioned earlier, Kashmir has gotten  the  world's attention by making sacrifices. Now CNN, the BBC, the  Voice of America, and the Voice of Germany are airing news  stories about human rights violations there. Last year (1993),  the UN secretary general mentioned the situation in Kashmir in  his annual report after a long time. The U.S. President also  declared Kashmir a disputed area for the first time in his  speech to the General Assembly. The countries that adopted a  neutral stand have started to talk openly about the sacrifices  of the Kashmiri people. But I would still say that the world's  conscience has not bothered enough to put pressure on India and  to force it to accept the promises made at the international  level. In this context, Pakistan has an important responsibility.    [Siddiqui] Has Pakistan met its responsibility?    [Zafar-ul Haq] Unfortunately, I must say that the attitude  of  the present government on Kashmir does not reflect the desires  of the people. This government is fixated on keeping India  happy. The people of Kashmir have made great sacrifices and have  worked tirelessly to present their case to the world. They have  been successful in this effort. The concrete result of their  efforts should have emerged, in the UN resolution in which the  attention of the Security Council was brought to the Indian  atrocities. This resolution had recommended that the Security  Council visit occupied Kashmir and investigate the human rights  violations there. The passing of this resolution would have been  a major diplomatic defeat for India, and its true face would  have been unmasked to the whole world. During that period, there  was also strong pressure on India from within, and after a long  time, India found itself in a very troublesome situation. It had  neither time nor any alternatives. It was coming to face the  Security Council forum after many years. This was the time when  Kashmiri Governor Krishnarao said he would "crush this movement"  if he got three or four more months. India showed great skill in  trapping Pakistan by initiating those meaningless talks. This  was the failure of our foreign policy.    [Siddiqui] Do you think that there should be no talks?    [Zafar-ul Haq] In this era, anyone who refuses to hold talks  loses the sympathy of the international community. There should  be talks; however, the resolution about Kashmir should not have  been withdrawn. If India refused to hold talks because of this  resolution, then it would have been condemned. Now the Indian  press is jumping with joy at the fact that because of these  talks, India got new and unexpected relief, and our government,  because of the people's pressure, is raising the slogan that we  have not lost anything. We could have re-introduced the  resolution any time we wanted. The next session of the General  Assembly is scheduled for September 1994. How can we introduce  the resolution again before that time? [passage omitted on  foreign policy]    [Siddiqui] In your opinion, what kind of policy should we  adopt on Kashmir?    [Zafar-ul Haq] Look! The first thing is, our stand should be  clear and firm. We must have full faith in our stand. It is a  simple fact that after the division of the subcontinent, the  people of Kashmir, according to the agreed-upon formula, should  have had the right to decide whether to join India or Pakistan  by holding a referendum. The UN resolution has used the word  "plebiscite." Later, the people added the right of  self-determination on their own. The plebiscite should be held  on the question of whether Kashmiris want to join Pakistan or  India. The states of undivided India were presented with the  same question. Confusing this with some other definition aims  only at opening other options for Kashmir. Pakistan should know  that there is no third option for Kashmir. In fact, there is no  second option. There is only one option: the right to hold a  plebiscite in Kashmir. At the same time, our government should  present this case on the international level and provide the  Kashmiris with more opportunities. This is not a question of  India or Pakistan, but a question of the rights of 12 million  Kashmiris. It is a human issue. Our present leadership puts  forth nonsensical statements that confuse this issue even  further. Recently, President Farooq Leghari said that Kashmir is  the only hindrance to good relations between India and Pakistan.  Some other politicians also have said the same. Kashmir is no  hindrance to our good relations. The hindrance is caused by  India and India only, which has an imperialist mentality and is  very stubborn. It has spoiled relations with all its neighbors  and is crazy about ruling others. Similarly, Benazir Bhutto  said, "The way we swallowed the bitter pill of East Pakistan,  India should be ready to swallow the bitter pill of Kashmir."  This statement is contradictory to the facts, and it weakens our  case. Comparing Kashmir with East Pakistan is unrealistic and  unwise. East Pakistan was part of Pakistan. It was never a  disputed region. In contrast, Kashmir has been a disputed area  from day one. The prime minister's statement means that she  considers Kashmir part of India, the same way East Pakistan was  part of Pakistan. After sitting in the prime minister's chair,  making such foolish statements will lead to being ridiculed by  the world. Kashmir is not a bitter or sweet pill for anyone, but  a solid problem that is in need of a solution.    [Siddiqui] India still declares Kashmir to be an integral  part of the nation.    [Zafar-ul Haq] This is nothing new. The imperialists always  think in this way. They always call areas under their control  integral parts. But with time, everything fell asunder. At one  time, this subcontinent was also an integral part of Great  Britain. America declared its independence when it was  influenced by the French Revolution, and Britain's Foreign  Ministry issued a statement asking all countries not to  interfere. "This is an internal affair," they said. "America is  an integral part." When the movement for independence was going  on in Algeria, France also sang the same song. History tells us  that wherever the lamps of freedom are lighted, this will be the  first reaction of the imperialists. The Kashmir issue is totally  different, though. India's claim is totally unfounded. The day  is not far when Kashmir will be freed from Indian clutches. If  India does not compromise on its "part," then all other parts of  its body will be dispersed everywhere. [passage omitted on  Bosnia]    [Siddiqui] You are the secretary general of Motmar Aalim  Islami. Please throw some light on the services of this group.    [Zafar-ul Haq] The basic work of Motmar is to present the  problems of the Islamic world properly and to get the people's  support. We are paying special attention to preparing literature  in this context. We published literature based on facts about  Kashmir and the Babri Masjid crisis and distributed them during  the foreign ministers' Islamic conference. Later, we sent this  to diplomats all over the world. Last year, at the Human Rights  Commission meeting in Geneva, Motmar sent a deputation of  Kashmiri women, which unmasked the Indian atrocities there. In  June 1993, Motmar sent a group, in which I also participated, to  the Human Rights Conference in Vienna. We sent Ilama Iqbal's  poetry, in Persian with a Russian translation, to the central  Asian countries. We also publish a weekly magazine which carries  facts and news about the Muslim world. It is circulated in about  70 countries. Last year we sent medicines valued at 83,000  rupees [Rs] to Bosnia, and we have established a fund for  Bosnian children. We donated Rs500,000 to this fund. Now we are  sending Rs800,000 in aid to the Bosnian people through UNICEF.  The Motmar is also giving scholarships to 32 students, who are  receiving educations in different countries. We have published  books and pamphlets about problems in the Islamic world.  [passage omitted on Afghanistan, Somalia]  *</p>

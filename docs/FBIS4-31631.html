			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic People's Party, KDNP, by Jozsef Szabo Bartha; place  and date not given: "Surjan: The KDNP Has To Be Reorganized in  a Professional Way"]    [Excerpt] [Bartha] [passage omitted] In your view, what  are the main tasks of the national meeting convened for 25 June?    [Surjan] Christian ideology and democratic belief do not in  themselves make anyone suitable to form or implement a Christian  Democratic policy, or to fill the position of party leader. We  must do away with the illusions. The Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] has to turn into a people's party that has  a message for all strata of society. It has to have a powerful  economic development and socially committed program for this.    [Bartha] If I am not wrong, you will reorganize the KDNP  from top to bottom.    [Surjan] This is inevitable. As a result of the  reorganization, we will need an executive chairman -- or perhaps  a general secretary -- who is consistent and implements  everything strictly. He has to be given rights that make him  into a strong person in the party. I do not consider myself  suitable for this position.    [Bartha] It is rumored that you would prefer to see  parliamentary group leader Tibor Fuzessy beside yourself as this  "force."    [Surjan] I will not talk about personnel issues.    [Bartha] Judging from views arising from party, the KDNP is  seeing many conversions.    [Surjan] I do not wish to comment on this, either.    [Bartha] How are you taking the fact that everyone is now  blaming the party chairman for everything, for whatever reason?    [Surjan] In politics, thinking about changes of personnel is  natural after failures. I believe that this is how it should  be. For this reason, the KDNP's leadership and I have also  announced that we would hand in our resignations at the  extrordinary national convention. The delegates will then  decide which leaders' work they will continue to require in the  future.    [Bartha] What do you expect? Will you stay?    [Surjan] Similar to the relationship between the president  of the republic and the prime minister, the position of a  chairman can also exist alongside a strong executive chairman.  At least, this is the way I see it. Very many people support  me, but quite a few believe that I am responsible for  everything. If the party decides that it needs my knowledge, in  any position, then I will accept this. If it decides -- as was  suggested to me by Sandor Keresztes -- that I should vest my  energies in being a parliamentary deputy, then I will help the  new party leadership this way. Providing that this new party  leadership does not shift to the right. The fate of the  Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only showed that  letting down the coalition is cowardice, it also showed that, by  shifting to the right of the KDNP's current policy, one falls  into an abyss. The MIEP's right-wing policy has minimal support  of society, and it is dangerous for the country's future.    [Bartha] As far as we know, Miklos Gaspar, who is said to be  one of the leading figures of the radical wing, will also run  for the position of chairman.    [Surjan] I have already said that I will not talk about  people.    [Bartha] Fuzessy indicated that it would be fortunate if the  KDNP was able continue to provide the ambassador to the Vatican.  The former prime minister once successfully "exported" the then  party chairman, Sandor Keresztes, who had criticized the  coalition and had become inconvenient, to this position. Is it  possible that you are the next one?    [Surjan] It would be good for Hungary and the new government  if the new Vatican ambassador was a Christian democrat.  Presumably the coalition of the Hungarian Socialist Party and  the Alliance of Free Democrats will not deny this request.  However, I clearly say no to me filling this position. As a  matter of fact, I know that Fuzessy was not thinking of me when  he talked about this.    [Bartha] There is also talk about setting up a ministry  dealing with church affairs, under your leadership.    [Surjan] Ministerial and state secretarial positions can  only be filled from within the coalition. At least this is  natural. Therefore, this is out of the question in this form.  However, if it operates as a non-governmental organization that  fulfills concrete tasks then I can easily imagine mainly legally  trained Christian Democrats in it -- but not me.    [Bartha] Another coalition is also often mentioned, namely  that of the future opposition. In the KDNP, many people fear  that "the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] still wishes to  absorb the KDNP."    [Surjan] Some MDF politicians still consider this as the  main goal of their lives. My answer to them and to others: Yes  for cooperation, no for fusion. The KDNP will be a constructive  opposition party that has its own image and that has goals.</p>

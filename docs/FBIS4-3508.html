			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] The senior echelons of the civil service are  facing a serious lack of experience in the run-up to 1997 as the  Government prepares for a new set of leaders to bring it in line  with Basic Law requirements. At least 20 of the 56 most senior  officers, ranging from policy secretaries to heads of  department, are expected to leave the service before 1997.  Either they are due to retire or their nationality does not  meet the requirement of the Basic Law, barring them from taking  principal official positions.    The rapid thinning-out of experience in the next two years  is  understood to be a key concern for the Secretary for the Civil  Service, Michael Sze Cho-cheung, as he plans future leadership.    Senior expatriate officers, whose prospects have been  blocked  by locals, are said to be ready to opt for the Government's  special compensation scheme and leave the service before 1997.  The Civil Service Branch is understood to have given top  priority to making the necessary changes now to minimise the  impact later. Vacancies will be filled by accelerated promotion  for many junior officers, even though such promotion might not  normally be considered desirable.    Although only policy secretaries with foreign nationalities  are required by the Basic Law to step down, it is understood the  administration is fully aware also of the possibility of an  exodus of lower-level expatriate staff as their promotion  prospects are affected.    At least three senior expatriate staff have been told their  contracts will not be renewed when they expire late next year or  early in 1996. They include Deputy Secretary for Recreation and  Culture Rachel Cartland, Deputy Secretary for Economic Services  Elizabeth Bosher, and Deputy Secretary for Security Ken  Woodhouse.    The Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, Principal Assistant  Secretary for Security Barbara Ellington who specialises in  defence matters, and senior research officer at the Political  Adviser's Office, Ken Walker, are also expected to return to the  British civil service before 1997.    Others at the level immediately below policy secretary whose  promotion will be blocked include Director of Administration  Richard Hoare, Director-General of Trade Tony Miller, Director  of Social Welfare Ian Strachan, and Postmaster-General Mike  Pagliari. They are expected to leave to make room for locals to  move up the hierarchy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [8  February] condemned the devastating mortar attack on a Sarajevo  marketplace last Saturday, but remained noncommittal on support  for possible air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to end the siege  of the capital. "We strongly condemn such a barbarous and  atrocious act against innocent civilians," Foreign Ministry  Deputy Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said.    Referring to the attack on an open-air Muslim marketplace  that killed 68 civilians and injured some 200, Amae said Japan  "considers that the offenders should be identified as soon as  possible and duly punished." But the spokesman did not go so  far as to express support for air strikes by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) on Bosnian Serb artillery and mortar  sites in the hills around Sarajevo.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked the NATO  allies Sunday to authorize the use of air power in response to  the shelling of Sarajevo. NATO is expected to decide whether to  take such action in a meeting on Wednesday in Brussels, which  will be attended by the ambassadors to NATO from its 16 member  countries.</p>

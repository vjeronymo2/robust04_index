			<p>921026 FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Too kind about a mugging Sir, Your front page headline is surely too kind to the UK government - or am I making the common American mistake of failing to notice British irony. 'Cabinet thwarts Tory revolt' (October 22) is true only in the sense that a New York pedestrian 'thwarts' a revolver-wielding mugger by immediately handing over his wallet. Warren Oliver, 44 Highbury Hill, London N5</p>

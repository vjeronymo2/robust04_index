			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: BA near its peak level THE BEST performance among the FT-SE listed stocks came from British Airways, which jumped 23 to 248p, just shy of its all-time high, after reporting third-quarter profits well ahead of the most optimistic market forecasts. Profits came in at Pounds 100m, against Pounds 20m at the same stage a year ago. The general range of forecasts had been around the Pounds 50m mark, although Charterhouse Tilney had predicted Pounds 73m. Activity in the shares started early, with dealers reporting a 15 rise to 240p in pre-market trading. There was then a rush to buy after the market opened, sending turnover to a hefty 29m by the close, the highest figure for nearly five years. The majority of buying came in the morning and business was more two-way by the afternoon. Most analysts raised their full-year profit expectations following the quarterly results. Mr Mike Stoddart, of Charterhouse Tilney, who upgraded his figure by Pounds 23m to Pounds 275m for the year to March 1992, said: 'The results are better than expected due to cost-cutting and growth in the North Atlantic market.' However, he maintained his 1993 prediction at Pounds 370m. Mr James Halstead, at Hoare Govett, increased his 1992 full-year profits estimate by Pounds 70m to Pounds 280m. Vickers active Engineering and defence group Vickers hardened a penny to 170p early in the day but eventually eased to end unaltered at 169p as turnover rose to 1.6m. The word in the market was that Vickers could be a direct beneficiary of a framework defence agreement signed yesterday between the UK and Kuwait. There are suggestions in the market that Kuwait may order more than 250 Challenger 2 tanks as part of the agreement. One analyst said yesterday: 'This could be worth Pounds 750m for Vickers.' BAe upset British Aerospace (BAe) retreated 13 to 282p after the company said it had paid a Pounds 79m indemnity to Burwood House Group, a joint venture held between BAe's Arlington property subsidiary and Asda's Gazeley Holdings. The market had expected a settlement at a lower figure, and was further alarmed by confirmation from Asda that it believed it had a right to exercise a put/call option in the original contract entitling it to sell its stake in Burwood to BAe at market value or to buy BAe out. British Aerospace is understood to dispute this and analysts now fear a drawn-out row. One analyst said: 'The worry now is this thing is not over yet, just like the situation with Rover.' Sentiment was further affected by emerging worries over the health of the civil aircraft order book. Turnover in BAe reached 6.2m by the close. Thorn weak US press reports that news of the sale of Virgin Records was imminent left Thorn EMI lower, as the market reacted coolly to the possibility that the electrical and leisure group might have been outbid for this profitable retail outfit, in which it is known to have shown interest. European media giant Bertelsmann was the reported bidder. However, Virgin Group, owner of Virgin Records, later denied the reports. Thorn shares were also under pressure because one leading broking house had recommended a switch into Rank Organisation. 'Thorn is at the top of its range,' said one analyst, 'and Rank still looks good value.' Thorn lost 15 to 820p in busy volume of 1.3m shares, while Rank added 7 at 684p. Pharmaceutical group Glaxo was held back by a cut in profits forecast and switch recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The house lowered its estimate for 1991-92 figures by Pounds 60m to Pounds 1.42bn. It cited launch costs of new products, rising research and development expenditure and industry-imposed price constraints for the cut. UBS, which has been a seller of Glaxo for some time, also published a note highlighting the relatively attractive rating of Astra Holdings. Glaxo shares were further affected by a forecast adjustment from Goldman Sachs, which shaved Pounds 30m off its estimate to Pounds 1.42bn. The stock slipped 3 to 824p with 2.1m shares traded. ICI rose 13 to 1271p as buyers emerged after last week's decline. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was active. MTM responded to positive press comment, advancing 11 1/2 to 280 1/2 p. An insurance sector suffering the effects of recent profits downgrades and forecasts of dividend cuts was hit again after flash floods wrought havoc in California. Royal Insurance, viewed by specialists as having the biggest exposure to expected losses from the latest US disaster, dropped 12 more to 220p, close to its lowest level for over five years. Sun Alliance was also mauled, closing 11 off at 269p with 2.32m traded, in spite of strong support triggered by a comprehensive research document from Smith New Court. Guardian Royal Exchange lost 7 to 121p, with recent bid stories almost forgotten. Smiths Industries fell 9 to 263p after United Airlines, of the US, said it would reduce its order for Boeing aircraft. Smiths supplies to Boeing. The losses announced by Amstrad had been well flagged in the market and the shares edged up 2 to 28p on relatively heavy turnover of 6.6m. Computer software group Electronic Data delivered another sparkling performance, surging to close 65 higher at a record 513p in response to a couple of agency crosses, carried out at 494p and 505p. BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, lost 6 to 139p on heavy turnover of 3.2m after suggestions that leading brokers had downgraded their current year estimates to around Pounds 43m. Cider taxation threatened to become a contentious issue between London and Brussels, but the effect on the cider producers was varied. HP Bulmer advanced 8 to 262p, while USM stock Merrydown fell 25 to 353p. Analysts suggested that Bulmer has continued to recover from concern that it may lose UK distribution rights for Perrier water. Food retailer Argyll was firm, rising 6 to 316p, as BZW remained positive on the sector's prospects and particularly the quality superstore operators. At the same time, Kwik Save was muted in the face of a lower profits forecast from BZW, gaining just a penny to 580p. Profits downgrades by several brokers led to a weakening of the shares last week. Hopes of lower UK interest rates in the near future provided general support for stores, but Burton and Ratners remained under a cloud. Boots moved forward 6 to 451p and Great Universal Stores 'A' appreciated 10 to 1435p. Kleinwort Benson advice to switch out of Forte and into Ladbroke lifted the latter 4 to 215p. Forte managed to gain a penny at 223p. Textile issues saw unusually thin trade as around 100 analysts attended an industry conference. However, SG Warburg circulated a note to clients arguing that the sector would remain weak for the first half but that would be followed by 'the second leg of the textile bull market'. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was slightly more positive in a review sent out yesterday. Among the stocks it favoured, Courtaulds Textiles firmed 2 to 414p and Campari International gained 5 to 436p. Buying ahead of today's results continued to bolster Reuters, which closed 8 higher at 1103p. Tightly-traded Central Independent Television moved ahead 45 to 1233p. SG Warburg Securities recommended the company in a recent wide-ranging note which it has been discussing with Scottish institutions this week. USM-quoted Sherwood Computer Services forged ahead 23 to 175p after announcing that it had secured contracts totalling more than Pounds 4m in recent weeks.

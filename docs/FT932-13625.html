			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Accor slides to FFr870m for year ACCOR, the French hotel, catering and tourism group, yesterday reported a 15.5 per cent decline in its net profit to FFr870m (Dollars 161m) last year, from FFr913m the previous year. The company blamed part of the decline on the poor economic climate. Although 60 per cent of its business is now outside France, Accor executives have been among the relatively few French managers who have been quoted in the press as advocating an end to France's high exchange rate policy, for fear that it will deter tourists. The other factor cited for Accor's profit drop was depreciation associated with its acquisition of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et du Tourisme. This doubled turnover to FFr30.56bn. The dividend is raised 12.5 per cent to FFr18 a share. Air France has confirmed that its losses last year deepened to FFr3.2bn from FFr685m the year before, on total turnover which decreased by 1.1 per cent over the same period. The state-owned carrier blamed part of its poorer performance on the 'morose' state of the French market in which it was facing new competition. But it also revealed that it had made a FFr723m provision to cover costs of pensions for ground personnel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Make Defense Spending Curb the Starting Point </F> for Amending `Guideline'"]    [Text] Concerning the growth in the fiscal year 1994  defense budget, which has become one of the focal points of the  fiscal year 1994 budget, the finance minister and the Defense  Agency [DA] director general agreed on 14 February, at the end  of their budget deal, to increase the defense budget by 0.92  percent. Hence, the increase in the defense budget will be  curbed to less than 1 percent for the first time in 34 years  since 1960, when its increase was curbed to 0.6 percent. We  pointed out when the Finance Ministry announced a draft of the  fiscal year 1994 budget that the curb on the defense budget is a  trend that reflects the current times.    With the tight fiscal policy envisioning an increase of only  1.0 percent in the entire national budget, the defense budget  cannot be increased exceptionally. Given the post-Cold War  situation of the world and the Far East region, the curb on the  defense budget is an inevitable decision and a matter of course.    In his speech last fall at a ceremony reviewing the  Self-Defense Forces [SDF], Prime Minister Hosokawa unveiled his  plan to review the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan" and  stressed that "Japan should take the initiative in promoting  disarmament worldwide."    In response, the Finance Ministry planned to curb the  increase in the fiscal year 1994 defense budget to a negative  figure by cutting back on the procurement of military hardware  even before the guideline is reviewed. Meanwhile, the prime  minister is said to have intended to curb the growth in the  defense budget to zero. The DA, however, vehemently resisted  this.    The DA has claimed that 1) although it is said that European  nations and the United States have been promoting arms control  and disarmament, what they actually are doing is reducing their  so-called redundant war capabilities; 2) unlike in Europe, there  is no framework for disarmament and collective security  arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region, and 3) in particular,  an unstable situation continues to be present in the states  neighboring Japan.    The DA has opposed any attempt to curb the growth in the  defense budget, saying that about 80 percent of the defense  budget goes for personnel and food expenses and payments for  military equipment procured in past years. The DA has also  asserted that if funding for the repair of major military  hardware is slashed, this would ground many aircraft and keep  many ships in port, thereby scuttling the SDF's plans to carry  out training and maintain Japan's security.    The potential Soviet [as published] threat to Japan has now  decreased largely, and the United States has cut its 1995  defense budget by 0.9 percent. The current situation is that  the SDF cannot avoid making itself lean.    The DA has so far worked to "build the SDF into a force  beloved by the people," and we believe that its efforts to make  the SDF a lean force will be welcomed by the people. Japan's  neighbors in Asia, who have been concerned about the emergence  of Japan as a military power, are also expected to welcome the  DA's efforts.    What is noteworthy is that the growth of the defense budget  has been curbed to less than 1.0 percent, but there is one point  that we cannot clearly understand.    The percentage of the defense budget compared to the entire  general accounts budget still remains unchanged. In the past  few years, the ratio has hovered around 6.2-6.4 percent, and  this time, the ratio stands at 6.4 percent.    In other words, the ratio of the defense budget compared to  the overall budget remains as it has been.    The inclusion in the defense budget of the procurement of  airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft and Patriot  missiles is a question mark. The ruling Social Democratic Party  of Japan, which has so far opposed their procurement, has agreed  to this on the condition that the procurement be reexamined in  the course of reviewing the "guideline." No serious debate has  been held as to whether Japan really needs the aircraft, and the  government intends to purchase the aircraft on the grounds that  the Liberal Democratic Party government earlier promised the  United States that it would buy it.    An advisory body to the prime minister is set to reach  conclusions on the review of the "guideline" by this summer.  The prime minister should set a direction of keeping the  defense budget in check by defining the current curb on the  defense budget as an important starting point for a future  institutional curb on the budget.</p>

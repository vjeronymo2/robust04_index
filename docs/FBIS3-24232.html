			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Lifshits: "Right Turn Through the Left </F> Shoulder"]    [Text] It is not enough to say that the process is  under way--it has begun to tear along. The process, we recall  Mikhail Sergeyevich once again, of the discovery of consensus.  Consensus between the radical-right nomenklatura-bourgeois  groupings victorious in December. For whoever did not understand  this, even having listened to President Yeltsin's report to  parliament, all the discoveries will be to come. It will very  shortly be revealed that the new Kremlin ideology of the  "national cause" and the anticrisis policy of the government  will successfully combine the white Bolshevism of Russia's  Choice and the black Bolshevism of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia], and the upshot will be something suspiciously  Zyuganovian.    The odious super-radicals are cut off here as yet--Gaydar  has  quit the government, Zhirinovskiy has not yet arrived, and  Chernomyrdin is coping by himself. But the conservative projects  going back to the summer-fall initiatives of Oleg Lobov  and--horrors!--Khasbulatov's leadership of the Supreme Soviet of  the Russian Federation: the inflationary financing of "priority"  state industry, the self-organization of apparatus-bureaucratic  capital into "financial and industrial groups," the renunciation  of privatization romanticism, and so forth, have been tacitly  restored. The political realities of Russia, on the other hand,  are evoking the specters not only of "Ukrainianization" or the  "Belarusian option" but of Central Asian dictatorships also.    Many people certainly already understand that the LDPR did  not support the "democratic" constitution fortuitously. It is  not only a question of the keen political sense of Mr.  Zhirinovskiy. Today's "strong of this world," having adopted the  oligarchic precept: "The strong determine progress by exploiting  the weak," are already quite openly seeking an acceptable leader  figure. This figure began to show in outline, it would seem, in  the person of the main favorite on 12 December--in quite  grotesque fashion as yet, but give it time! Practice makes  perfect.    Even more important is the fact that the LDPR, which was the  mirror reflection in the election campaign of the anti-Gorbachev  tactics of Democratic Russia, is oriented toward the  national-fundamentalist circles of that same nomenklatura  bourgeoisie whose comprador wing is the social client of  Russia's Choice. While deliberating a great deal on how Vladimir  Volfovich managed to attract the votes of 14 million Russians  (which is not difficult in our times for a man with his  inclinations), commentators are omitting a far more serious  question: How did this person attract multimillion financial  flows, that is, win the support of part of the ruling elite?    The other December winner, the Communist Party of the  Russian  Federation, is essentially from that same crowd. Having become  ideologically loosened since 1987, having joined up with  bureaucratic business, and having lost direct access to the  managerial function, the Communist Party, as a whole, ceased to  be a totalitarian structure--this was the undoubted achievement  of April-85 and August-91. But, having ceased to be  totalitarian, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has  moved not to the left but to the right flank of the political  spectrum. The program reference points of the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation are based on the same conservative  populism and fundamentalist statism as of the LDPR. True,  Zyuganov's leadership is concerned more for respectability and  is of a traditionalist frame of mind, furthermore--whence the  commitment to the Soviet form of authoritarian rule and  criticism of the constitution. As far, however, as left-wing  phrase-mongering, of a social-protection motif particularly, is  concerned, nowhere is state paternalism the prerogative of  forces of the left, being the alpha and omega of any  populism--from Le Pen through Turkes (about the NSDAP we will  say nothing). Today's Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, for example,  are demanding an end to privatization and the concentration of  all property in the hands of an independent state, but this does  not make them people of the left.    There is no effective alternative to  right-wing-authoritarian  hegemony in the Federal Assembly. Sergey Shakhray's PRES [Party  of Russian Unity and Accord] has demonstrated the quite lifeless  launch of Civic Union-2. It is possible that Shakhray's attempt  to consolidate big national capital, state capital particularly,  will prove more successful thanks to the chord which is being  struck between the industrialists and the regional  administrators, but there is no guarantee that the PRES will not  be supplanted in its parliamentary niche by that same Communist  Party of the Russian Federation or by New Regional Policy, which  has appeared like a bolt from the blue.    The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc has created for itself  the  image of a constructive democratic alternative to Gaydar,  Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy put together and has partially  managed to attract the sympathies of the electorate committed to  liberalism and social democracy. But YABLoko has not fallen far  from Russia's Choice, despite the strong intellectual efforts of  Yavlinskiy, who has been forced to concoct differences. The  "liberal-legal" concept of essentially that same model of  capitalization is formulated speculatively, which is partially  connected with the absence in YABLoko of the criminal resolve  typical of the leadership of Russia's Choice. In fact, YABLoko  assigns itself the role of respectable generator of liberal  ideas, which will someday, "at a new historical stage," be  claimed in a reformed Russia. The ascent to this stage still has  to be made, it is true....    So "accursed friends" were the winners in December. A kind  of  symbol of this community was the election of the right-wing  populist Nevzorov in an elite district of Petersburg--"an area  of hard-currency taverns and privatized apartments." The clashes  between Russia's Choice and the LDPR and the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation are a prepared version of the conflict of  the "mafia against the bureaucracy" known since Mussolini's  times. The political struggle of the Gaydarites and the  Zyuganovites and Zhirinovskiyites has been brought about by the  differences in the interests of comprador-speculative capital,  the administrators of the state economy, and nationalistically  oriented business. Whence the different ideological  slogans--liberalism, chauvinism, communism--whence the appeal to  different social strata in the search for mass support, whence  the success of the demagogy: "Either us or... (insert as  required)." The common denominator of the ruling oligarchy  remains, however, authoritarian elitism and statism and reliance  on state power as the instrument of compulsory capitalization.    By and large, the claret-colored shadow of fascization looms  over the country for the uncontested struggle of the right  against the extreme right is being played out in the Russian  political space. The niche of the forces of the left is empty,  and wage labor and the independent economy have been cut off  from actual politics--this is the main result of the menacing  totalitarian degeneration.    To blame for the failure of the left (the real left!) is  primarily the left itself. In an excruciating search for a path,  the Social Democratic Party of Russia has split into several  groupings. Thanks to its leader, Rutskoy's NPSR [Free Russia  People's Party] has sunk to the bottom. Having concluded a  "pink-beige" alliance with the moderate nationalists, Cossacks,  and oil industrialists, the Socialist Workers Party allowed  itself to be dragged into the plan for a "social-patriotic  alliance" struck up on the basis of the conservative Federation  of Commodity Producers and the personal interests of Yuriy  Skokov. The Socialist Workers Party has thereby excluded itself  from the movement of the left, virtually, which is not all that  surprising, considering its genetic kinship with the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation. Running in majority-system  constituencies, certain representatives of forces of the left  frequently ended up on the Communist Party slate, which  complicates the situation even further.    In short, the formation of a center left, in which social  democracy can alone exist, has to be started almost "from  scratch." This is difficult, but there is the hope that society  will soon understand how dangerous it is to fly on one wing. And  the left itself, it has to be thought, will bestir itself. There  are already some signs of revitalization on this flank,  incidentally.    The defeat of Civic Union and almost all the trade union  bosses stirred among the leaders of the "traditional" trade  union movement interest in the plan for a Labor Party, which is  being proposed to them by the social democrats of the Social  Democratic Party of Russia, the Free Russia People's Party, and  the Party of Labor, which has for three years served politically  the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions. The cornerstone of the  plan is a strong, typically Laborite coupling of  left-wing-democratic organizations and social civic  associations--the "traditional," "free," and "corporate" unions,  the STK movement, self-managing associations, consumer unions,  civil rights organizations, and so forth.    In the event of realization of this plan, the Russian  Laborites would be a political force potentially capable of  defending the formation of the civil society and of  strengthening and stimulating its structures. This ensues  naturally from their main function--defense of the socioeconomic  rights of the citizens against the background of the essentially  anti-civic position of the principal political subjects of  contemporary Russia. Economic democracy and self-government, the  employees' share in profits and ownership, reform of the system  of social insurance and taxation, the social responsibility of  enterprise and state administration, stimulation of all forms of  civic self-organization on a firm material and legal  foundation--a movement with such a program "package" could  obviously lay claim to the "pink" niche, which stands empty in  today's political spectrum, and constitute a real democratic  alternative to the "claret-colored" Stalinists and the in fact  perfectly "white" Zyuganovites.    The consolidation of the antiauthoritarian and antifascist  movement along the lines of the National Front in France in the  1930's--the sole historical example of a mass democratic  movement stopping fascism--is possible on a Laborite basis. It  is hard to say what would result from Russian Laborites, but the  citizens are required to forestall a "chief"--they have no  worthier option.</p>

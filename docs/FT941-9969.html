			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Starmin agrees to acquire private construction group Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire a 'large privately-owned construction group.' Starmin's share price climbed 1 3/4 p to 5p on the news. The acquisition was described as 'significant in relation to the size of Starmin.' It will be funded through a combination of new shares and cash, through a placement or rights issue. If the deal goes ahead, the Abdullah family, the main shareholders, face greater dilution of control, as the owners of the construction company would take new Starmin shares and seats on its board. It is understood that the family speaks for more than 25 per cent of Starmin's shares, but it has not indicated whether it will support the transaction. The deal follows a period of great uncertainty for Starmin. The Abdullah brothers resigned last July, when it was announced that the 1992 results would be re-examined due to accounting irregularities. Subsequently, the figures were restated, and the final dividend rescinded. Mr Raschid Abdullah has since been re-elected to the board. But his brother, Osman, the former chief executive, is seeking Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office. The Abdullah family built up Evered, the aggregates company. But the brothers resigned in 1989. Taking control of SI Group in the same year they renamed it Starmin and launched numerous acquisitions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign news agencies and radios reported today that  a Palestinian national, Yusuf Sha'ban, who belongs to  Fatah-Revolution Command, stated before a Lebanese court that he  carried out the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,  Scotland, six years ago.    These media organs, including AP, CNN, and REUTER quoted the  Palestinian national as saying: I brought down the airliner  over Lockerbie. I have already told the investigators, but my  confession was not recorded. I repeat here what I have already  said.    The Palestinian national's statement is the latest  development in the so-called Lockerbie case. It is an element  which should acquit the two Libyan nationals who have been  indicted by America and Britain. These two countries should,  furthermore, refrain from levelling such a false accusation if  they really want to discover the truth.    The state-controlled Voice of America has stated that Yusuf  Sha'ban's confession will embarrass the Western powers, which  have repeatedly accused the two Libyan nationals of  masterminding the incident.    The attorney of the two Libyan nationals, Ibrahim  al-Ghuwayl,  states that such a confession affirms his belief that his two  clients are not guilty.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] What will be  the position of your clients following the latest development?    [Al-Ghuwayl] Actually, this is a very important development.  Had matters been proceeding normally toward finding the truth  this new development should have drawn people's attention to  carry out a comprehensive investigation in the presence and  under the supervision of neutral and decent foreign lawyers,  judges, and human rights observers.    It was a coincidence that Mr. Mitchell, who is my first  assistant in the defense team, was here to examine the defense  of the civil case against our two clients. We have been  following the news with great interest. And it is our intention  to ask -- in our capacity as the defense team and in the name of  the accused -- the director of the criminal chamber of the  [Beirut] district which was conducting the case, counsel Philip  Khyr Alla, to investigate the new development, in view of the  fact that the news agencies have reported that there was no  indication that the Lebanese state prosecutor, Mr. Sa'id Mirza,  took seriously the confession of the Palestinian national.    Given the fact that such information is serious, and that we  have a legitimate and serious interest in it, we will, thereby,  be requesting an opportunity to continue our investigation in  the presence of a number of honorable and decent Lebanese, Arab  and foreign lawyers and human rights observers. We will be  informing the president of the court of the name of our  colleague who will be selected to represent us in Lebanon in  order to take the necessary measures in conformity with the law  in order to enable us, in our capacity as a party with a  legitimate interest in the case, to follow such investigation  seriously.    We believe that any serious and unbiased investigation into  this confession will affirm our firm belief in the innocence of  our clients and that the truth will surely come to light and  will prevail.

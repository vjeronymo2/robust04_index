			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Housing boost fails to lift economy Japan's industrial economy continues to bump along the bottom of a recession, but government efforts to boost private housing have begun to lift household spending, William Dawkins writes. That is the message from Japan's latest mixed bag of statistics yesterday, indicating clear signs of recovery have yet to emerge. Industrial production fell 3.1 per cent in January, against the equivalent month in 1993, setting a new record of 28 months of year-on-year declines, the ministry of international trade and industry said. But output recovered 0.9 per cent from December's level, a slight rebound from the previous month's 1.9 per cent decline. Industrial production represents just under a third of economic activity in Japan. Despite the industrial gloom, strong growth continued in low-cost housing, helped by subsidised government loans and low prices. Housing starts rose 20.7 per cent in January, from a year earlier, the 20th month of year-on-year increases, the construction ministry said.</p>

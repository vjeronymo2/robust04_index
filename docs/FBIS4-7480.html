			<p>BFN     [Text] At the opening of today's news conference held at  Cotroceni Palace, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, spokesman for the  presidency, announced that on 5 April Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic will make a one-day visit to our country.    According to our correspondent, the majority of the  journalists' questions referred to issues related to the recent  visit to Greece by the head of the Romanian state.    Talking about our country's stance regarding the embargo  imposed on Yugoslavia, Chebeleu said that in Romania's general  opinion, considering the fact that the embargo, in the way it  was implemented, did not help to extinguish the conflict, all  measures intended to slacken the embargo are to be saluted.    Answering a question related to the trade unions' request  that President Ion Iliescu should intervene again as a mediator  [in their negotiations with the government and the employers],  Chebeleu reasserted the readiness of the head of state to  intervene in various dialogues, whenever necessary, including  the current case.</p>

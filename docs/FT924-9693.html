			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's banks sweep up their bad loan troubles - A complex company is being set up to untangle the sector's difficulties FOR the past few days, ordinary Japanese have been puzzling over the complex structure of a company being set up to aid the country's troubled banks by buying their bad loans and property collateral that has plunged in value. Meanwhile, the banks have been congratulating themselves on their timely move to deal with what they are seeking to portray as their temporary difficulties. However, this self-congratulatory mood was crushed on Monday evening when NHK, Japan's sober national broadcaster, laid out the full, gory details of the country's banking crisis. It made clear that the industry's new company would hardly impact on problems extending deep into the economy. Armed with wads of leaked bank documents and a sense of indignation, NHK found that leading banks have been routinely reselling unwanted land to each other at a profit, and that the lending for ill-conceived property projects continued into this year. In setting up the new company, the Federation of Bankers' Associations faced the conflicting demands of tackling the banks' fast-growing non-performing loan portfolios while maintaining the image that the non-performing loans do not represent a serious threat to the health of Japan's financial system. The Ministry of Finance announced on Friday - at the same time as the banks unveiled their new institution - that the non-performing loans of the leading 21 Japanese banks rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Dollars 99.2bn) in the six months to the end of the September, while the loans not covered by collateral rose from Y2,562bn to Y4,000bn on a total loan portfolio of Y396,000bn. Those figures do not tell the full story, as they represent a very narrow definition of a non-performing loan and do not include the troubled loans of all affiliates. A popular estimate for the non-performing portfolios of leading banks is around Y30,000bn, while there is no accurate estimate of the total number of non-accrual loans held by regional banks, non-bank banks and property finance corporations. The new institution is expected to begin untangling some of this mess early next year. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Credit Suisse Research Japan, said the banks' move was at least 'a step in the right direction'. But Ms Sasaki-Smith said the company was founded on the questionable principle that there would be buyers for property collateral which the banks had so far been unable to offload. That is why, as NHK found, banks have been selling properties to paper affiliates, booking profits from those sales and hoping against hope that a worsening property market would improve. In some ways, the workings of the new company are not far removed from that practice. For instance, Bank A, owed Y10bn by an ailing developer, would sell that loan to the new institution, which would rely on an 'independent' valuation of the property collateral to calculate the loan's market value. If the loan and land was estimated to be worth Y7bn, Bank A would provide the Y7bn for the institution to buy the loan and the right to sell the land. Thus, a Y10bn non-performing loan to the developer became a Y7bn loan to a reputable, bank-run company and Bank A could write-off the Y3bn loss this financial year. Tax considerations weighed heavily on the bankers' federation, as the transfer of land to the new company would have drawn a tax charge. But the new company does allow the banks to sidestep an old dispute with the National Tax Agency, which insisted that the banks cannot write-off loans until the property collateral was sold and the loss was clear. There is an apparent understanding among the banks and the finance ministry that the land collateral will be generously valued, providing an artificial floor for the property market and limiting the tax write-offs. If, after five or six years, the new company is still unable to dispose of the land, Bank A must buy back the rights and would then take a second write-off, stretching out the tax concessions and delaying the day of reckoning. The bankers' federation hopes that the valuations, to be done by a panel of assessors and accountants, will stimulate a property market that it concedes is 'dead'. In the hope of stirring demand, the federation will limit initial dealings with the institution to non-performing loans backed by property collateral which has a chance of finding a buyer and a clear title. As such, the company will be of use to the larger, less bruised banks able to furnish the loan funds and able to produce a clear title to the property. But smaller institutions, some of which are in particularly bad shape, are unlikely to make much use of the new body, which will have a start-up capital of about Y6bn, shared among participating banks. The issue of title is important, as it is becoming clear that less honourable property developers borrowed many times on the same piece of land. Meanwhile, the banks, which insisted they only provided funds equivalent to 70 per cent cent or less of a property's value, regularly provided money in excess of valuations made at the height of the financial 'bubble' era in the late 1980s. One side-effect of these lending habits is a sharp rise in court actions launched by banks and other financial institutions in an attempt to recover money through auctions of property collateral. In the first eight months, cases rose 36 per cent, essentially because institutions could not agree among themselves on the division of rights to the property. Clearing away the debris will take many more court cases and far longer than the banking industry has publicly forecast. A survey of 34 banks by NHK found that privately, none of these institutions expect the problems to be solved within three years and half reckon it will take five or more years. Over that period, the bankers' federation is likely to be forced to alter the structure of its loan purchase company and the Japanese government, in one form or another, may have to take the unpopular step of providing public funds to assist troubled institutions.</p>

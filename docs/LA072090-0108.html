			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUDROE NEARLY WIPES OUT BEFORE CATCHING FIRST WAVE;  </P> <P> SURFING: DESPITE HIS RANKING, HUNTINGTON BEACH RESIDENT'S PLANNING LAPSE FORCES  HIM INTO QUALIFYING TRIALS AT SAN CLEMENTE MEET.  </P> <P> Sometimes, it pays to be a little disorganized. Planning ahead isn't always the  best course. Just ask Noah Budroe.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach surfer returned from an East Coast promotional tour with a  sponsor on the day of the entry deadline for the Body Glove San Clemente Surf  meet. He called contest officials, who basically said, "Sorry, tough luck. Want  to put your name on the end of the 30-signature alternate list?"  </P> <P> Wednesday morning, the first day of competition at the San Clemente Pier during  this sixth stop on the Professional Surfing Assn. of America tour, Budroe  learned he would be surfing this week, after all. And surfing a lot. All the  way through the qualifying trials, which is an odd route for a guy who is No. 7  in the PSAA rankings and No. 39 on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world  tour.  </P> <P> But Budroe has discovered it's not a situation without advantages. He came into  the meet with $5,525 in PSAA earnings this season and already has picked up  another $150 in pocket money thanks to the $75 award to the winner of each  heat.  </P> <P> "I got in some good practice and made a little money on the way," said Budroe,  who normally would not have competed until Saturday.  </P> <P> Thursday afternoon, Budroe advanced to today's fifth round after a second-place  finish in a Round 4 heat, which figured to be the most competitive of the day.  The drama was gone before it began, however, and then what had been a fairly  consistent two-to-three-foot southwest swell disappeared for much of the  20-minute heat.  </P> <P> Two surfers from each four-man heat advance and everyone knew who they would be  before the horn sounded. Noel Rahme, of Huntington Beach, apparently missed his  flight from the East Coast and amateur Ryan Ragan, of San Francisco, was left  pining for his frigid home waters after a stingray, enjoying the 74-degree  water off San Clemente, left his mark on Ragan's right leg and foot when he was  "free-surfing" to warm up.  </P> <P> So, with nothing to lose, Budroe's battle with 18-year-old sensation Kelly  Slater was more show time than showdown.  </P> <P> When a set finally arrived, Budroe caught a shoulder-high wave near the pier  and pulled off four slashing backside cutbacks. But Slater grabbed the next  wave and countered by going airborne over a breaking section and landing under  control.  </P> <P> Slater, from Cocoa Beach, Fla., edged Budroe by a half-point on three of the  five judges' cards.  </P> <P> Budroe, who has finished No. 5 in the PSAA rankings the past two years, already  has made two finals this season, finishing third and fourth. He learned to ride  waves in Hawaii after his parents moved to Sunset Beach, home of the famed  North Shore break, on the island of Oahu when he was 1.  </P> <P> Budroe moved to Huntington Beach five years ago, however, forsaking good waves  for good business. He wanted to be closer to his clothing-manufacturer sponsor  and compete in the California-based PSAA tour.  </P> <P> "Hawaii has the best waves in the world, no doubt, but you're so far out of  touch there," he said. "Everything's happening on the Mainland. This is where  all the money is. It's really a struggle to get a sponsor in Hawaii."  </P> <P> Budroe also discovered he liked the level of competition and the size of the  paychecks on the PSAA tour. He won the first PSAA contest he entered, an event  in Malibu in 1985, and that was enough to send him home to pack.  </P> <P> "I've never finished higher than 17 in an ASP meet, never been able to crack  into those top seeds (on the world tour)," he said. "They have other pro  contests in Hawaii, but there's so many good surfers over there and they give  like $500 to the winner."  </P> <P> There's a check for $5,500 awaiting Sunday's winner here. And Budroe doesn't  mind paddling out a few extra times with that kind of money at stake.  </P> <P> Surfing Notes  </P> <P> Costa Mesa's Mike Cruickshank, the PSAA points champion in 1986, competed in a  wet-suit hood Thursday. He was trying to protect a recently ruptured eardrum.  The hood apparently worked well enough to allow Cruickshank to win his heat to  advance to the fifth round. Other Orange County surfers who advanced to today's  competition include Kirk Tice, Joey Zintel, Jeff Deffenbaugh and amateur Mark  Austin of Huntington Beach; Jim Pinkerton, Mark Lindblad and Matt Archbold of  San Clemente; amateurs Kasey Curtis and Shane Stoneman of San Juan Capistrano;  Chris Billy of Dana Point; Brian McNulty of Capistrano Beach; David Giddings of  Corona del Mar, and Glen Tilly of Laguna Hills.  </P></p>

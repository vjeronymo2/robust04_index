We can also say that with fewer resources, we have  begun classes and are trying hard to enhance the quality of  education, which we think is possible. We believe that a good  education does not depend on imports, currency, or raw  materials, but mostly on political willingness. We have this  because we have excellent teachers who are opposed to the  closing of any school, and who are willing to make all possible  efforts so the quality of education will be continually improved.    [Lopez] The schools in the interior involve a more difficult  process because there we need some resources, and the  agricultural polytechnic institutes are capable of achieving  them, the minister said.    [Gomez] Right now we have provinces that have attained  higher  levels of self-sufficiency in the fields, especially in  establishing plans to increase production of pork and milk. They  also managed to find rational solutions to water supply problems  when there is no electricity. Nevertheless, the schools have  been kept open because in each place, everything has been done  with intelligence and rationality. It is the third term here and  we must now develop our teaching activities under these  conditions. Experience has already been accrued and of course we  are willing to develop further. We are sure that the living  conditions of the students and the workers will be as  comfortable as possible.</p>

"We hoped that the resolution of the UN General Assembly  adopted last December, which pointed to unsettled problems in  Estonia concerning big ethnic groups, mostly Russians, will be  correctly comprehended in Tallinn", Vasiliy Svirin, head of the  Russian delegation at talks with Estonia, told a press  conference on Wednesday after the end of the 16th round of talks.    "We called on Estonia to begin a concrete discussion of a  draft agreement on settling the citizenship problem which has  been on the negotiating table for two years without any progress  because Estonia had blocked it", he said and added that the  Estonian delegation refused to work on the agreement.    The document grants Russians in Estonia and Estonians in  Russia the right to acquire the Estonian or Russian citizenship  on a free basis.    Svirin also said that Estonia demanded that Russian military  who retired after the abortive Soviet coup in August 1991 be  withdrawn from the Baltic state together with Russian troops,  but agreed that 9,670 military who retired before that can count  on receiving a residence permit.    "The issue of deporting a considerable number of retired  military is put on the agenda", Svirin commented.    The deportation problem may diminish the "considerable  progress" which, according to Svirin, was reached on the draft  agreement on the Russian pullout. He added that the agreement  might be initialled in the near future, but the deportation  problem had now emerged.    The Russian chief negotiator said that Russia had for the  first time warned Estonia, which categorically refuses to  jointly demarcate the border with Russia, that it has to begin  doing the job by itself.</p>

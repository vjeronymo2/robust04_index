			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 12 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign  Ministry considers the immediate cessation of attacks against  the civilian population of Gorazde, the prevention of conflict  escalation, and the furtherance of the Bosnian peace process  with the participation of all sides to be a prime necessity,  Hungarian foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman said at his  customary press briefing in Budapest on Tuesday [12 April].    Herman was evaluating the situation that has come about in  the wake of the Serbian attack on Gorazde.    The Foreign Ministry is following the situation with  particular attention. Its situational analysis starts out from  the fact that the NATO action was carried out based on UN  Security Council resolutions, and that the implementation of  these is an obligation of the member-states.    In answer to another question, Herman welcomed the Polish  government's submission of its official European Union [EU]  membership request to the current presidency of the European  Union on April 8, parallel to the Hungarian move.    Herman noted with satisfaction that these historical steps  were prepared in close concert between the Hungarian and the  Polish governments.</p>

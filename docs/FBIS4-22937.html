Lomonosov; UDC541.11]    [Abstract] The electro-physical properties of high  temperature superconductors, as observed at low temperatures,  are determined by the conditions under which they were prepared  at high temperatures, and for this reason study of phase  equilibria and stability over a wide range of temperatures and  oxygen partial pressures is of primary importance to the  preparation of ceramic materials and films having good working  characteristics. The notion of determining the area of  thermodynamic stability of a substance comes down to the fact  that any unforeseen changes in properties are excluded at  equilibrium in this area; by fixing the thermodynamic variables,  thermodynamics guarantees preservation of the state of  equilibrium and also determines the trend and final result for  any given changes in the system. The title phase (123), as well  as others, may, and in fact does exist beyond the limits of the  stated thermodynamic equilibrium range of temperature, pressure,  and composition. This can only be metastable or frozen (labile)  states of matter. In the first case the state may exist  indefinitely, so long as no sources of activation energy,  necessary for transition to stable equilibrium, enter the  system. In a previous work, the thermodynamic stability of the  123 solid solution was determined on the basis of the results of  a thermodynamic study of the system Y-Ba-Cu-O. In the present  work the most recent data on the thermodynamic properties of  this phase were used to calculate stable and metastable phase  equilibria within the title system. The area of thermodynamic  stability of this phase was constructed for the coordinates  composition-temperature and partial oxygen pressure-temperature.  The results were compared with existing published results of  direct experimental research and the thermodynamic properties of  Y[.sub]2[/]BaCuO[.sub]5[/] and the solid solution  YBa[.sub]4[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8.5+q[/] were  estimated.

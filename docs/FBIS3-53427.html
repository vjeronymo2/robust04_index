In 1993, conditions were not the same in all countries of  the  region, but there were some common denominators. In light of  the Gaza-Jericho accord, the face of the Middle East will  undergo a transformation in 1994 as the United States gains its  objectives based on the trend toward compromise.    Most of the countries will relinquish part of their  geopolitical positions, and countries that are emulating the  U.S. model will gain from this situation. It is an immutable  fact that a large part of the world's oil resources are  concentrated in the Middle East, but there is no sign of any  development patterns in the region. If, in 1993, the Middle  East witnessed Clinton's hosting Rabin and 'Arafat in the White  House, it was solely because during the eighties, a country by  the name of Iraq had embarked on an extensive war and opened the  path for the West to enter Islamic countries in the nineties.  This is the beginning of the end of an era in which resistance  took on a different connotation.    In the current year, the United States is contemplating the  manifestation of another Gaza-Jericho accord so that it can make  the region subservient and calm. The region should at the same  time be a center for harboring a potential crisis that can be  escalated into a war when the need arises.    If those countries that are on the U.S. blacklist do not  react, they will not get a chance to defend themselves.  International economic conditions have transformed the Middle  East into an oil-producing area and at the same time a consumer  of goods. By the end of 1993, the Middle East oil prices had  reached an unimaginable all-time low, despite the onset of the  cold winter season. The hue and cry for human rights is also  heard and most Middle East leaders have not yet understood the  meaning of unity, of ending their differences, and may perhaps  never do so.    What makes the difficult days of the nineties bearable for  the free nations of the region, however, is the cry of the  intifadah.    In any case, the Americans will step up their pressure on  the  progressive and independent countries of the region in order to  eliminate the last vestiges of resistance. They will certainly  adopt an independent approach toward each country so that the  others do not wake up to it and are not aware of the danger.  The Middle East of 1994 will be replete with compromising  plans and levers of pressure for the United States so that a new  picture may be drawn up.</p>

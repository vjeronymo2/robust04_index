			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell takes on pubs IN WHAT might appear an unusual diversification for a merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell is to become a substantial pub landlord as a result of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's Pounds 622m purchase of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain from Grand Metropolitan. Morgan is in effect acting as a warehouse for up to 748 pubs which S&amp;N must sell to comply with the government regulations on pub ownership. S&amp;N has six months to dispose of the pubs. Morgan, owned by Deutsche Bank, the leading German bank, since early 1990, officially regards the move as part of its service to a client. Nevertheless, the bank is clearly tickled by the idea of its new pub estate. Directors have searched the list of pubs but failed to find a Craven Arms. Mr John Craven, the chairman, may be disappointed not to have a pub in his name where he can pull a few pints. The bank is also delighted that the deal demonstrates the combined group's ability to provide over Pounds 1bn of funding, with more than half coming from Deutsche internally, as well as the corporate finance skills necessary to find a way round the Tied Estate Orders. Few other British merchant banks have the balance sheet to do the same. It meant the deal could be done without having to syndicate the long-term loan element of the funding - more than Pounds 300m - before it was announced, minimising the number of people who knew about it. The financing of S&amp;N's deal is complex. It involves a two-stage rights issue, totalling Pounds 416m before expenses, which Morgan underwrote. The second tranche will only be called if the deal is completed, and allowance has been made for the possibility of a Monopolies Commission reference. Part of the loan finance Morgan and Deutsche are providing is a short-term facility to cover the second tranche, since GrandMet will want the money on completion but it will take a month to collect the second payment from shareholders. To buy and manage the pubs, Morgan is setting up three subsidiary companies. The first - unimaginatively named Newco A - will buy 235 pubs leased to Chef and Brewer from Inntrepreneur, for Pounds 94m, paying S&amp;N another Pounds 22m for the leasehold interests in them and another 227 pubs, making a total of 462. As they are sold, S&amp;N and GrandMet will share the profits or losses equally. Merging the freehold and leasehold interests in the 235 pubs should make them easier to sell. Newco B will run the pubs, with S&amp;N providing management services for a fee. Newco C will buy any of the other 286 pubs which S&amp;N has failed to sell within the six months' time limit. Profits or losses on the sales of these will be borne by S&amp;N. Morgan believes it is facing no risk other than the credit risk of S&amp;N and GrandMet. The pubs it has to sell are the less attractive end of the estate, and have been individually valued at a total of Pounds 105m compared with the Pounds 116m Newco A is paying for them, although they may be worth more than the valuation if sold in packages. Morgan does not expect to make any trading profits from its move into the pub business beyond a normal banking fee.</p>

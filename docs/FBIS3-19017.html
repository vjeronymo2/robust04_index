			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Richardt Vork, head of the customs </F> investigation troop "Sanctions Assistance Mission" is  responsible for the UN embargo against Serbia, by unidentified  correspondent in Vienna; date not given: "Mafia-Like  Structures"]    [Text] [Correspondent] Your international investigation  troop "Sanctions Assistance Mission" (SAM) has been controlling  the embargo against the Serbs since 5 October 1992. How do are  you proceeding?    [Vork] Our people -- a total of 240 men from over 20 states  -- have been positioned at all important border crossings into  Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM], Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine. They monitor  all deliveries to and from Serbia and Montenegro. In 19 months,  we have discovered several thousand violations of the embargo.    [Correspondent] Who breaks the embargo most frequently?    [Vork] The large European states are mostly involved because  the majority of businesses with Serbian participation are  located in Germany or Italy. Many of them claim to have  subsidiaries in FYROM. Our investigations usually reveal two  things: Either these businesses do not exist, which means that  they have been invented by criminals. Or the business exists,  but it never issued the consignment documents.    [Correspondent] This applies to the export of goods from  Serbia. What about imports?    [Vork] Since the adoption of UN Resolution 820...    [Correspondent] ...which was adopted in May 1993 and also  bans the transit of goods through Serbia...    [Vork] ...the number of attempts to import goods has  declined. Yet the number is still very high. In addition, false  UN documents are being used. Instead of applying for permits  with the Sanctions Committee in New York, perfect fakes are  used. The biggest problem continues to be attempts to smuggle  crude oil into the country.    [Correspondent] You are facing strong criticism because  ships on the Danube have succeeded to this very day in smuggling  tanker-loads of oil products on the Danube before the eyes of  the controllers.    [Vork] It is right that there are logistic shortcomings.  The Romanian customs authorities, for example, had no fast  boat. We have now acquired one, but we cannot be everywhere at  the same time. In the Black Sea, a Ukrainian 5,000-tonne steamer  recently ignored all requests to stop. A Bulgarian warship  finally stopped it. The ship wanted to unload oil for the Serbs  at a small Romanian port. The local authorities decide whether  ships are stopped or not.    [Correspondent] What is coming from other directions, that  is from West Europe?    [Vork] Things are easier for us on the Danube in Hungary.  Road crossings are being monitored tightly. For this reason,  violations are increasing in the Adriatic Sea. Ships appearing  on the radar screen claim that their crude oil is destined for  Croatian enterprises. We then contact the ports of Rijeka or  Koper and ascertain whether the company mentioned really exists.  A few days ago, we sent back another 85,000-tonne oil tanker in  cooperation with NATO warships.    [Correspondent] Let me ask you a question about deals with  third countries. It is well known that Serbian enterprises are  operating under cover everywhere in East Europe. With the  proceeds earned from these trade activities, the headquarters in  Belgrade buys goods in the international black market.    [Vork] Things like that happen even in Vienna. A Swiss  company may act as the agent of an enterprise in Kiev, for  example, which is known to belong to a Serb. The financial  transaction takes place in Vienna. Completely new mafia-like  structures are developing in the East. Frequently, these  criminals are armed.    [Correspondent] Are Austrians involved in the smuggling  activities?    [Vork] A total of 224 violations on the part of Austrian  companies have been registered. Of an overall number of 5,855  cases, 1,600 violations alone have been committed by the FYROM.  Over 600 infringements have been carried out by  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, and Germany.</p>

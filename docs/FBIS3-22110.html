The  objective of the project is the protection of the environment of  the city, famous for its cultural and historical interest,  including its excellent museum. The project will also have an  education component. Thus far the "Lvia" Project has 690  employees. They are engaged in reforestation in the hills round  the city, the improvement of roads, restoration of the "Rozafa"  Castle, as well as work on hospitals, schools, libraries, and  the city's museum.    "There is a good beginning," the director of Caritas for  north Albania, Gjon Markagjoni, told ATA, adding that in the  future the project will also cover the district of [word  indistinct] and the communes of Lac and Vau i Dejes. The  additional activity will increase the number of the workers by  several hundred.    Three billion lira have been allocated by Italian bishoprics  and the Italian Government to this joint undertaking. This sum  will finance the Lvia Project for only several months, but,  according to Markagjoni, the European Union will contribute to  that project in the near future. The EU financing will permit  the employment of additional workers and an expansion of project  activities. Angjelin Muzhani, a Caritas representative, said  that future plans for the project will also cover agriculture,  especially vineyards.</p>

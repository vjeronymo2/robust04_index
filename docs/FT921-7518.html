			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Porsche runs full-speed into management crisis PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer struggling to prop up sales and preserve its exclusive image, last night appeared to be heading for a management crisis with its most senior figures undecided about who should be at the wheel. Dr Arno Bohn, chief executive of the Stuttgart company's management board, effectively threatened to resign next Friday unless he is given a vote of confidence by the supervisory board. His ultimatum followed a board meeting yesterday which failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to endorse the extension of his contract beyond the end of this year. The supervisory board met as it became clear that Dr Wolfgang Reitzle, research and development director of executive carmaker BMW - and heir apparent to BMW's 63-year-old management board chairman, Dr Eberhard von Kunheim - had decided not to accept an offer, believed to have come from Dr Ferdinand Porsche, chairman of the Porsche supervisory board, to take over from Dr Bohn. Dr Reitzle is understood to have been offered both a generous salary and a personal shareholding of up to 5 per cent in Porsche, in exchange for steering the car maker through a maze of troubles. Some 4,000 Porsche workers are being put on short time after a slump in 1991 worldwide sales to 26,200 vehicles - down 4,000 on 1990, and little more than half the 50,000 sold in Porsche's peak year of 1986. Dr Bohn has already warned that sales will drop further to about 25,000 in 1991-92. Most ominously, sales in the US - the world's most important prestige car market - plunged below 5,000 last year, only one-sixth the level of the mid-1980s. At the same time Porsche has encountered mounting criticism for failing to invest adequate finance and other resources in new model ranges, despite reaping big profits from the 1980s boom and the ever more obvious challenge to its position which is posed by Japanese manufacturers. Last month, Dr Bohn announced that the company was shelving previous plans to build a new, expensive four-seat model and would concentrate instead on a cheaper two-seater. Some industry analysts believe its response may prove too little and too late to avert an independence-threatening crisis. Control of the company is shared between the Porsche and Piech families, who between them control all the company's ordinary shares and 40 per cent of its preferred stock.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR DENIES PLANS TO BUILD ON RESERVOIR;  </P> <P> HOUSING: A LETTER FROM TOM BRADLEY SAYS THERE IS NO BASIS FOR REPORTS OF  EFFORTS TO LURE TEACHERS TO LOS ANGELES WITH LOWER-COST HOMES ON A DRY LAKE  BED.  </P> <P> A proposal to develop a housing tract for teachers on the city-owned Chatsworth  Reservoir brought vigorous opposition Tuesday from City Councilman Hal Bernson  and local homeowner activists and denials from the mayor's office that the site  was being seriously considered.  </P> <P> Bernson said it would be moronic for anyone to believe he or the community  would tolerate a disruption of the reservoir, a 1,200-acre dry lake bed now  serving as a wildlife refuge.  </P> <P> "Hiking and bird-watching -- those are the only kinds of things that should be  permitted there," Bernson said.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, The Times reported City Hall sources as saying that the Tom  Bradley Administration was developing a plan to build up to 5,000 units of low-  to moderate-cost housing at the reservoir as a way to induce teachers to work  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There goes Bradley again -- the mayor has been totally insensitive to the  needs of the Valley in the past," said Rita Seashore, vice president of the Oak  Lake Assn., a group that represents 200 homeowners who reside south of the  reservoir.  </P> <P> "For the mayor to be even considering this . . . is absolutely absurd," said  Jan Hinkston, a founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "Somebody's off  their rocker."  </P> <P> The Chatsworth site, which is owned by the city Department of Water and Power  and is located in the west San Fernando Valley, was used as a reservoir from  the 1930s until the early 1970s. It has been empty since being damaged in the  1971 Sylmar earthquake. The site now functions as a de facto wildlife  sanctuary, primarily for birds, including Canada geese.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani denied Tuesday that Bradley's office has  seriously considered faculty housing for the reservoir. And the mayor sent a  two-page letter to Bernson assuring the councilman that there "was no basis for  the news media . . . to suggest that the Chatsworth Reservoir site has been  targeted" for development.  </P> <P> In his letter, Bradley wrote that no plan to develop the reservoir would "ever  have been seriously considered and finalized without the cooperation and  involvement of your office and interested community groups."  </P> <P> Before a development site could be considered, it must be determined if it  would be worthwhile public policy for the city to provide housing incentives as  a way to lure teachers to jobs in Los Angeles, Fabiani said in an interview  Tuesday. That threshold decision has not been made yet by the mayor's office,  the deputy mayor said.  </P> <P> But last week in an interview, Fabiani, in acknowledging that preliminary plans  were being prepared to have the city promote faculty housing, called the  Chatsworth Reservoir "the primary site we've focused on so far" and he said he  intended to meet with Bernson and local community groups about this interest.  "That's the land that's under consideration," he added.  </P> <P> According to a City Hall source, who asked for anonymity, Art Gastelum,  director of the Mayor's Office of Economic Development, said the development of  faculty housing at the reservoir was one of his top priorities.  </P> <P> Gastelum, who is also the mayor's liaison to DWP, made the remarks to the  Office of Economic Development staff in early January, shortly after Bradley  appointed him to head that unit, the source said.  </P> <P> Another of Gastelum's official assignments has been to explore ways to help  local schools and universities attract top faculty to Los Angeles. One of the  difficulties facing teacher recruiters has been the area's high housing costs.  Fabiani said Gastelum "originated the idea of teacher incentives, like housing"  within the Bradley Administration.  </P> <P> Gastelum did not return a phone call from The Times.  </P> <P> "But the fact that that one site may have been mentioned by a single member of  the mayor's staff does not a proposal make," Fabiani said.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this story was Times staff writer Gabe Fuentes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP)  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), two of the seven  parties in the ruling coalition, will form a joint policy study  group as early as the end of this month, party sources said  Friday [15 April].    At the beginning of next week, Muneaki Samejima, deputy  secretary general of the JNP, and Kansei Nakano, the DSP's  policy board chairman, will begin preparing for the forum to  study policies to achieve a better quality of life for Japanese  people, they said.    The alliance will take over a suspended JNP plan to ask  other  coalition parties to join "Kaikaku (Reform)," the JNP's  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, the sources  said.    The launching of the group, however, means that the DSP will  join the reform in the future, they said.    The JNP, led by outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  disbanded a parliamentary alliance with new party Sakigake  (Harbinger) led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  shortly after he announced his resignation on April 8.    It then formed the reform with two United Social Democratic  Party members including Science and Technology Agency chief  Satsuki Eda and began urging other ruling parties' members to  join.    But the JNP suspended its campaign as ruling parties fell  into deeper disagreement over selection of Hosokawa's successor.    Another reason for the suspension was that some JNP members  objected to allying with Shinseito and Komeito -- two powerful  forces in the coalition.</p>

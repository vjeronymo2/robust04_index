			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Cariplo reports profits flat at L298bn CARIPLO, Italy's biggest savings bank, which is in talks to buy a large stake in the state-owned Istituto Mobiliare Italiano financial services group, reported virtually static net profits of L298bn (Dollars 185.3m) last year against L296bn in 1991. Operating earnings rose by 5.9 per cent to L1,746bn; provisions, depreciation, write-offs and tax amounted to L1,373bn, while L75bn was transferred to shareholders' reserves. Deposits rose by 10.7 per cent to L98,208bn, while total loans jumped by 14.7 per cent to L101,546bn. The bank's total assets jumped by 16.2 per cent to L132,659bn. In Rome yesterday, a further round was held in the continuing negotiations to sell a 44 per cent stake in IMI owned by the treasury to a Cariplo-led group of big Italian savings banks. The talks, which have been continuing in various forms for over two years, have recently gained new life after appearing to collapse earlier this year. Sogefi, the listed car components company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's listed CIR holding company, more than doubled group net profits to L33.3bn, from L15.3bn in 1991. Sales rose by 6.7 per cent to L664.5bn, in spite of the downturn in the European motor industry and growing pressure on component suppliers from leading car groups. The company, 60 per cent owned by CIR, is raising the dividend by L20 to L120 a share. Earnings were also boosted by last year's sale of Sogefi's 48 per cent stake in the German Boge group to Mannesmann. The L120bn transaction produced a L19bn extraordinary gain and helped cut group borrowings to L116.4bn from L251.7bn at the end of 1991. Borrowings could fall further this year following this month's L28bn sale of the group's SVAMA distribution subsidiary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Dr. Musa  Abu-Marzuq's interview with AL-SABIL last week and the Political  Bureau's 16 April statement sparked controversy among political  circles. The news media misinterpreted both the interview and  statement. Therefore, we deem it important to publish the  following 21 April Hamas Political Bureau statement:    In the light of the political concept presented by the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; in the light of the various  official and media reactions to what was said; and in the light  of the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state and  officials in the enemy government and other states, Hamas would  like to emphasize the following:    1. Escalation of the brave popular resistance and  continuation of jihad and military operations against the  occupying enemy will be maintained as long as the Zionist  occupation of our blessed Palestinian land is continuing and  until our usurped Palestinian soil has been fully liberated from  the sea to the river.    The Hamas Movement believes that the so-called settlement  negotiations currently taking place between the PLO leadership  and the Zionist enemy are doomed to failure because they are  based on consecrating injustice, aggression, and occupation, and  held under Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Arab and  Palestinian weakness. These negotiations are a submission and  capitulation to the Zionist and U.S. terms and dictates and  conflict with our patient people's will and struggling forces.  Hamas also reiterates its clear rejection of the flimsy  self-rule.    3. Hamas has presented its political concept through its  Political Bureau's statement as well as the statements made by  the head of the Political Bureau. These statements were  unequivocally clear. However, some news media disseminated them  in a mutilated and incomplete manner, suggesting that there is  some sort of change in Hamas' policy, programs, and concept of  the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even went so far as  to interpret the Movement's statements in their own way,  claiming that Hamas proposes peace with the occupying Zionists,  recognizes the usurping Zionist enemy, and similar wrong  utterances and interpretations.    4. The Hamas Movement's concept as presented to the sons of  our people and their struggling forces calls for:    A. The unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation  forces from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem.    B. The dismantlement and removal of settlements and the  evacuation of settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and  Jerusalem.    C. General free legislative elections for the Palestinian  people inside and outside the occupied territories in order to  enable them to elect their leadership and true representatives.  Only this elected and legitimate leadership will be authorized  to express our people's will and aspirations. It alone can  decide all the subsequent steps of our conflict with the  occupiers.    5. Hamas explained through the statements of the chairman of  its Political Bureau that if the Hamas Movement and its  political program win the confidence of our Palestinian people  in general elections, Hamas will then express our people's will  and implement its program for the sake of pooling our people's  efforts and forces and unifying their ranks for the liberation  of all of their territory and holy shrines. If the outcome of  the elections is different, Hamas will then respect the opinion  of the majority, adhere to their constants and programs, and  seek to accomplish them and express their opinion with full  freedom and vigor.    6. The above-mentioned statements did not include what some  tried to circulate as a Hamas recognition of the usurping  Zionist entity, acceptance of Security Council Resolution 242,  or relinquishment of Hamas' program and genuine Islamic  constants which consider Palestine an Islamic land which should  not be ceded, relinquished, or bargained over.    Finally, this is Hamas' concept, which was strongly and  clearly presented from the position of its escalating jihad. It  appeals to all the sons of our struggling Palestinian people and  influential forces to rally around this political concept and  join hands to implement it on the ground. The Hamas Movement,  which expresses the people's will and the pulse of the living  Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses, stresses that it will  continue its jihad and valiant resistance of the unjust Zionist  occupation, along with all the faithful sons of our people, on  the path of victory and liberation.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Cuba sets Dollars 1bn tourism target The Cuban government has set new targets which indicate expectations of a significant expansion in tourism over the next two years, writes Canute James in Kingston. It is expecting gross income from the sector to reach Dollars 900m (Pounds 600) this year and Dollars 1bn next year, Mr Osmany Cienfuegos, the tourism minister, told a recent conference on Cuban tourism. Gross income from the sector last year was Dollars 720m, of which about one third represented net earnings. The government is hoping the volume of visitors will reach 1m by 1996, double last year's volume, the minister said. The island's stock of hotel rooms is being increased to meet the growth in visitor arrivals, with foreign investors involved in the construction and rehabilitation of 7,000 rooms. The expansion in capacity should lift the number of rooms to 50,000 by the year 2000, he said.</p>

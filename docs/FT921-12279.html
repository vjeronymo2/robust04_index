			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Demand for refrigerators helps limit fall at Bullough BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday announced that it would maintain its dividend for the year to end-October 1991 in spite of a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. The decline in profits to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 26m) was less than some commentators feared, mainly because of a strong performance from refrigeration. Environmental and health concerns have led to a big demand for new fridges, increasing the division's operating profit to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 6.1m). The results were also lifted by an exceptional surplus of Pounds 994,000 arising on settlement of insurance claims after redundancy costs. Earnings per share fell from 14.3p to 11.55p. A recommended unchanged final dividend of 4.3p maintains the total for the year at 6.05p. Gearing fell from 28 per cent to 9 per cent. Borrowings were reduced to Pounds 7.8m from a cash inflow of Pounds 15.7m, after capital expenditure and net acquisition costs of Pounds 8.7m. Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, said debt was reduced by slashing costs and reducing capital expenditure as turnover fell from Pounds 318m to Pounds 293m. Office products, which continued to suffer from the recession, saw operating profit fall from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 7.82m as sales fell by 25 per cent. Store fitting incurred a loss of Pounds 1.78m compared to a profit of Pounds 23,000 as sales by BFN storefitters to the DIY retail sector fell sharply in the first half. Severe cut-backs, leading to a reduction in the workforce of 220 to 80, enabled the division to make a small profit in the second half. Operating profits at the remaining divisions were: heating Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.1m); electrical Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 2.16m); and engineering Pounds 2.59m (Pounds 2.13m). COMMENT As Derrick Battle put it: 'If you are going to surprise the market there is only one way to do it: produce better results'. Accordingly the share price jumped by 15p to close at 140p. Analysts expected a fall in profits; few companies are in need of office furniture and the recession in the DIY market is far from over. Yet there was plenty of good news to please the market: store fitting is already back in profit and refrigeration has proved recession proof. A significant reduction in working capital has led to a reduction in gearing from 40 per cent two years ago to under 10 per cent today. That figure is likely to continue to fall - and with it the Pounds 1.6m interest charge  - as costs are further reduced. Full year pre-tax profit forecasts of Pounds 22m, reflecting an upgrading from some analysts after yesterday's results, gives earnings per share of 12p and a prospective multiple of 11.6. The shares still look cheap.</p>

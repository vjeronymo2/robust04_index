			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: LWT rejects Granada'sfinal Pounds 776m offer as still 'far too low' London Weekend Television yesterday appealed to shareholders to reject Granada's increased offer for the company as still 'far too low'. Last week Granada announced a final offer worth about Pounds 776m, or 750p, in a deal that offered 13 new Granada shares and 100p cash for every 10 LWT shares with a 686p cash alternative. In a new circular to shareholders yesterday Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman, said the offer failed to reflect 'not only the level of our 1993 earnings but also the earnings which we are confident we can achieve in future.' Sir Christopher argued that LWT was a premium franchise which should only be sold at a premium price. LWT directors refused to be drawn about whether they would quit if the Granada bid proved successful. However, Sir Christopher said few directors had figured prominently in a Granada organisation chart drawn up for running an enlarged company. He emphasised that the importance of management should not be underestimated. LWT said that all directors, who together hold 6.7 per cent of the company, intended to reject Granada's offer as will 32 senior management shareholders who own 32 per cent of the company. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada said LWT's defence was strong on presentation but weak on content. 'In their latest document the board of LWT have made no fundamentally new points,' said the Granada executive, who added that the argument in favour of size and resour-ces has been won and that LWT risks being marginal-ised. Both sides plan to spend this week making presentations to institutional investors who will decide the outcome. The final date for acceptance is February 25.</p>

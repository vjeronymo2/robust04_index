			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazuaki Kajiwara, commentator: "Hiraiwa Stands </F> Firm Against Involvement in Political Contributions"]    [Text] Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Federation of  Economic Organizations] normally behaves like a used-book store  proprietor. Tokyo Electric Power Co. honorary chairman Hiraiwa's  office desk is cluttered with huge stacks of books that appear  about to topple down.    Ranging from Shonen Jumpu (a book for boys) to  books on pure literature, philosophy, and economics, his scope  of reading may be considered "eclectic." He is a rare well-read  person.    He is usually extremely courteous. For example, he responds  to a question with a query: "I believe thus and thus... but what  do you think?" He is apparently uneasy about confrontations.    However, his true sentiments are quite strong. He is able to  name the successive professional boxing champions of each class  in Japan wihout hesitation.    He is a great fan of such hand-to-hand combat sports as  sumo, boxing, and Western wrestling.    He regularly played the shortstop position on the baseball  team at the former Nagoya High School. His front teeth were  knocked out by a fierce grounder that rebounded with a hop, and  he continued to play in the game despite a mouthful of blood.  Such brave exploits are not very well known. Despite his small  stature, he participated in swimming, horsemanship, kendo  [fencing], baseball, and tennis.    "Golf is like walking, so I do not consider it a sport." A  typical example of a person who is gentle in appearance but  sturdy in spirit, Hiraiwa displays rare determination and  "self-assertiveness."    Recently, at the Keidanren meeting of the chairman and the  vice chairmen on 2 September [1993], he advocated the "abolition  of mediation by the Keidanren regarding political  contributions." Among the dozen vice chairmen, three strongly  opposed Hiraiwa's proposal to abolish mediation.    The usual Hiraiwa would give in, to no one's surprise, but  he did not retreat a step concerning the abolition of mediation  in political contributions and he pushed forward toward a  "decision."    Regarding the political, financial, bureaucratic cozy  alliance structure, the source is of course the political  contributions by the financial circles and companies. In other  words, the politicians of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] are  weak-kneed in front of the financial circles from whom they  receive contributions. The financial circles are weak-kneed  before the bureaucrats from whom they receive permits and  licenses. The bureaucrats are weak-kneed before the politicians  in connection with personnel authority and budgets.    This "three-way struggle" is considered to constitute  Japan's power structure and is called the 1955 system. In fact,  more than 20 years have passed since this political, financial,  and bureaucratic triangle began to be distorted from an  equilateral triangle.    First, the power of the financial circles began to weaken.  Then the LDP began to squeak and became fractured. Next, with  deregulation and the difficulty of obtaining appointments to the  private sector for retired government officials, an era of  ordeal will soon come for upper-bracket bureaucrats.    The political, financial, bureaucratic equilateral triangle  structure rarely seen in the world has definitely wrought a  miraculous economic prosperity. The true identity of "Japan  Inc." could be said to be the political, financial, bureaucratic  joint corporation.    The change in the industrial structure is a major factor for  the decline in this section of financial power.    What would happen if the growth of such industries and  enterprises as autos and distribution that deal with the masses  surpasses the growth of such industries and enterprises as  electric power and steel on which permits and licensing and  administrative guidance have considerable impact?    The interests within the so-called total capital clash. The  monolithic financial era has long since passed.    In other words, the long-term decline of the financial  circles began more than 20 years before. It can be rephrased as  the power decline of Keidanren, which is the central  organization of the financial world. Comparing the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] with Keidanren is based on the  fact that both are in a long-term decline.    There was once an era when the Keidanren chairman was called  Japan's "shadow prime minister." However, one could never call  Gaishi Hiraiwa--the seventh chairman--a "shadow prime minister,"  even in flattery.    The Keidanren method of allocating political contributions  to the various enterprises and distributing them to the LDP and  DSP [Democratic Socialist Party] en bloc is considered to be  extremely clean. However, Hiraiwa says that the national  sentiment will not tolerate even that. He means that political  contributions in the future should be left up to the companies  to do as they wish.    To whom is Chairman Hiraiwa's "unusual firmness" directed?</p>

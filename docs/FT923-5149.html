			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Substantial turnround at Litton LITTON INDUSTRIES, the diversified electronics, defence, marine engineering and resource exploration services group, achieved a substantial turnround in the fourth quarter of its 1991-92 fiscal year. The California-based company recorded net income of Dollars 44.95m in the three months to end-July, compared with a loss of Dollars 58.4m in the same period of 1991. The loss last year did, however, include Dollars 100.1m of charges taken because of the phasing out of a part of the group's integrated automation division. Sales in the fourth quarter were Dollars 1.44bn, up from Dollars 1.37bn. Earnings per share in the quarter were Dollars 1.08, against a loss of Dollars 1.43 per share a year ago. For the whole of the 1991-92 fiscal year Litton made Dollars 174.4m of net profit, compared with Dollars 63.5m in the 1990-91 year. Sales for the year ended July 31 1992 were Dollars 5.69bn, against Dollars 5.22bn. Mr Orion Hoch, chairman, said fiscal 1992 operating profits from Litton's on-going businesses were 11 per cent higher. Operating profit in the resource exploration services division improved by 29 per cent to Dollars 133.6m, thanks to a shift from North American to more international areas of energy exploration. Defence budget cuts continued to reduce sales and operating profits from the group's advanced electronics division, Mr Hoch said. This division suffered a Dollars 10m drop in operating profits for the year to Dollars 138.1m. He added, however, that internal consolidation efforts should lead to firmer profit margins. On Wall Street, Litton's share price was marked Dollars  3/4 higher to Dollars 46 1/8 at close of trading.</p>

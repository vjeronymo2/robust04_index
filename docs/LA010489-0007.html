			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office, as expected, will appeal a  judge's extraordinary reversal last month of a jury's murder conviction against  an Anaheim woman, who claimed she suffered from postpartum psychosis when she  ran over her 6-week-old son. In filing an appeal with the 4th District Court of  Appeal, prosecutors said, they will argue that Superior Court Judge Robert R.  Fitzgerald had no legal authority to acquit Sheryl Lynn Massip on the grounds  of insanity after a jury had convicted her of second-degree murder in the  killing of her colicky infant son. In addition, Fitzgerald's action threatens  to give judges greatly expanded power in criminal cases and to make juries  "nothing more than an advisory board," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris said.  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Justice bill survives Lords challenge The government secured a majority of 52 in the House of Lords last night to defeat another challenge to the introduction of new court procedures affecting the right to silence. Ministerial fears of a further defeat on the criminal justice and public order bill receded with the introduction of a new safeguard for defendants who refuse to answer when questioned by the police or in court. Peers approved without a division a government amendment stipulating that a defendant must be cautioned that the jury would be asked to draw inferences from his decision to exercise his right to silence. But the amendment failed to meet objections raised by Lord Ackner, a former appeal Lord, who recalled that two royal commissions had rejected outright similar proposals to those made in the bill. He said the change introduced by the government failed 'quite hopelessly' to safeguard the innocence of an accused person. Lord Ackner moved an amendment providing for an accused person to have his lawyer present before being interrogated, and for the tape recording of any statements made. The amendment was supported by Viscount Runciman. Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, described Lord Ackner's amendment as 'too restrictive'. It was defeated by 143 votes to 91.</p>

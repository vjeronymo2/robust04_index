In his  view, the idea of imposing a tax on polluting emissions of CO2  even if decided by the EC, could not be applied in practice  because of strong opposition from third countries. Mr Matutes  was obviously referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, which  is strongly opposed to the EC Commission's proposal for an  energy/CO2 tax and whose representatives were attending the  Athens conference. The Commissioner also praised the United  States' plan to cut CO2 emissions, by the year 2000, to their  1990 level, describing it as a good approach. During the opening  day of the conference, Michel Grenon (France) of the  Mediterranean Energy Observatory, launched an appeal for the  international community to support energy saving programmes in  Mediterranean cities before their burgeoning development makes  rational use of energy schemes even more difficult and costly.</p>

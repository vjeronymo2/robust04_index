			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-SPEED TRAIN, COMMUTER INTERESTS  </P> <P> A high-speed train to take people to Las Vegas, where they lose money, while  thousands sweat it out on freeways driving to work means only one thing: The  gambling interests are lining the politicians' pockets with bribes.  </P> <P> Who lobbies for the commuter? All he can do is write letters saying how much we  need a good transportation system for the commuters.  </P> <P> Maybe we could talk Las Vegas into having the train operate so commuters would  benefit too.  </P> <P> ROBERT SHACKFORD  </P> <P> South Laguna  </P></p>

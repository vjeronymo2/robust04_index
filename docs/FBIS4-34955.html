			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Official sources told PRENSA  LATINA today that the fact that almost 70 illegal occupiers of  diplomatic missions in Havana have changed their mind proves the  success of the Cuban Government's position in these cases.    Foreign Ministry sources confirmed that, while unexpected  visitors decided to leave the Chilean Consulate in Havana  yesterday, almost 60 of those who remained inside the Belgian  ambassador's residence under similar conditions have already  voluntarily returned to their homes.    The departure of those who forcibly entered the two missions  obviously responded to the certainty that the Cuban decision,  which is meant to prevent actions of this type from replacing  the legal procedures used to leave the country, will not change.    In addition, the Cuban Government thought that this policy  was the most appropriate measure to protect the properties of  the diplomatic corps in Cuba from the use of violence against  them, in keeping with obligations established in international  conventions.    The situation inside the Belgian residence, according to the  information disclosed, points to increasing discouragement among  those who remain inside and leads one to the belief that members  of the group that entered the residence on 28 May will continue  leaving.    The internal order at the occupied residence is currently  under the responsibility of specialized Belgian personnel  following media reports, sent even from Brussels, that revealed  a verbal confrontation between some of the occupiers and the  Belgian representatives.    Meanwhile, 21 persons are living in the German Embassy.  These 21 persons, who entered the embassy after stealing a  truck and ramming it against the fence surrounding the building,  will have to answer for this crime once they leave the mission,  according to statements by the Cuban Government. As the number  of people who have decided to leave other delegations increases,  so does the isolation of those remaining at the German Embassy.    Judging from this situation, everything indicates that this  episode involving the violation of the immunity of diplomatic  missions could be coming to an end sooner rather than later.  These actions began a few weeks ago, and Cubans believe they  were basically inspired by a permanent U.S. hostility against  Cuba.</p>

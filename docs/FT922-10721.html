			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Whirlpool earnings rise to Dollars 35m WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large domestic appliances and now the full owner of the former Philips' businesses in Europe, saw earnings increase to Dollars 35m in the first quarter of 1992, compared with Dollars 24m in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose by about 6.5 per cent, to Dollars 1.72bn. The results were only slightly below most analysts' forecasts, but the shares still greeted the news with a Dollars 2 5/8 fall to Dollars 42 7/8 . There was some speculation that the worse-than-expected results from the Brazilian affiliates  - where Whirlpool's share of losses was Dollars 10m compared with Dollars 17m a year ago  - lay behind the reaction. With the reduction in Brazilian losses stripped, moreover, the earnings improvement looked less impressive. However, Mr David Whit-wam, chairman, said the Whirlpool, Kenmore and KitchenAid appliance groups in the US had shown 'notable' revenue gains, with shipment increases in the quarter topping the industry's average of 2 per cent. The result, he said, was a 'dramatic' improvement in operating results. He predicted that, for 1992 overall, shipments in the North American industry could rise by about 6 per cent as the economy recovered. In Europe, by contrast, industry shipments for the quarter were down slightly, although Whirlpool Interna-tional managed an increase. For the year overall, the company is predicting a 1 per cent increase in home appliance shipments for the European industry generally.</p>

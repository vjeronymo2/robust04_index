			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Observer: Heaven sent support Parisians and others visiting the Louvre today should keep careful watch on Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of the Mona Lisa to see whether her enigmatic smile suddenly turns to a grimace. If so, the reason will lie in tonight's London opening of the musical, Leonardo: A Portrait of Love - although not in the plot, despite its romancing about a highly improbable passion for her on the painter's part. What is more likely to get up her nose is the musical's financial basis. It is the crust of bird-droppings that covers most of the Pacific island of Nauru. The riches founded on the tiny republic's stock of guano were well known to 47-year-old Liverpudlian Duke Minks, who is a long-standing adviser to the government. But he is also an impresario whose show-business career aptly rests on still solider foundations. He was the lead singer in the 1960s chart-topper, Concrete and Clay. Having written much of the new musical, he took tape-recorded extracts to Nauru, played them to senior ministers, and dropped lucky. Not only did they pass over Pounds 2m backing, but the president and some 30 other government members are arriving to attend the first night. With their guano due to run out in five years, they are hoping the show will pay a high return by proving successful enough for transplanting to to other countries. Let's hope it isn't given the bird.</p>

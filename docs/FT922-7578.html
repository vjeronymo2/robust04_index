			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Through the ranks at Barclays Barclays Bank has named Bill Gordon, a career Barclays man who has worked his way up through the ranks since he joined a Birmingham branch at 16, as its new managing director in the banking division. In charge of UK banking, he replaces Geoff Miller who is taking early retirement at the end of the month. Gordon, 52, moves after a spell as director of personnel, which should be good preparation for his new assignment - given that the bidding for Midland places the British banking market on the cusp of its biggest shake-out, in jobs as well as everything else, for decades. His new responsibilities encompass the gamut of everyday banking activities throughout the UK branch network; central retail services including UK credit cards; and the Mercantile Group. He works alongside Richard Carden who is the banking division managing director in charge of international and corporate banking. At personnel for the past two years, he says one of his achievements, last year, was to 'downsize' the overall staff by 5,000 'using a range of imaginative schemes rather than the brown envelope technique'. Immediately before that, he worked under Miller in the banking division as director of UK corporate services, among other things helping to create the 300 or so business centres around the country which cater specifically to medium-sized businesses - a pool of expertise at the bank which he claims has proved very useful in dealing with the kinds of problem that have arisen during the recession.</p>

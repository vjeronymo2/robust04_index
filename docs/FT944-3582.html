			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Veteran Chinese leader dies Mr Yao Yilin, one of China's veteran leaders, died in Beijing on Sunday. He was 77 and had served in many posts, including head of the State Planning Commission and of the leading group in charge of finance and the economy under the Communist party Central Committee. He had also been a member of the politburo standing committee. Like many of his colleagues Mr Yao, a graduate of Beijing's prestigious Qinghua university, was purged at the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In latter years he was seen as a conservative voice among older leaders, urging caution in economic reforms.</p>

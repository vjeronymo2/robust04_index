			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has  reacted to a broadcast speech addressed by King Fahd of Saudi  Arabia to the pilgrims last Tuesday, 24 May 1994:    The foreign minister said: We heard the speech made by Fahd  in which he stupidly charged in the first sentence that Iraq is  skirting UN Security Council resolutions. In the second  sentence, this genius of a king went on to contend that keeping  the sanctions in place will make sure there is no change in the  stands toward Iraq of regional and world powers. In the third  sentence -- in which he predicted that once the status quo ends,  the region will see an era of stability -- he became unbalanced.    The foreign minister added: It is well known to the  population of Najd and Hejaz and to all Arabs and Muslims that  the feeble-minded Fahd begins his day by gulping alcoholic  drinks just as greedily as beasts guzzle stagnant water -- a  habit he practices even during the pilgrimage. He is scarcely  sober enough to conduct a meaningful conversation, even at  official sessions, which explains why his utterings are  typically absurd, revolting, and hollow.    These particular remarks by Fahd fit the pattern of a filthy  monarch's manner of speech. His memory, devastated by alcoholic  drinks and possibly narcotics, must have led him to fantasize  that his kingdom is the sixth permanent member of the Security  Council. Influenced by a mixture of repulsive illusions,  ignorance, and spite, Fahd set about slandering Iraq and  accusing it of sidestepping Security Council resolutions. This  agent forgets that his kingdom is not even a nonpermanent member  of the council.    What are we to make of his charge that Iraq is skirting  Security Council resolutions, or his demand that the sanctions  be retained, the foreign minister asked. These remarks, added  al-Sahhaf, prove Fahd to be a petty agent of a Security Council  member allied with Zionism -- a nation that attempts to force  its influence and political agenda on the Security Council.    Fahd can convince no one that he is a mere ally of nations  that want to impose their hegemony. Fahd's inability to advance  a convincing case is because in the eyes of these nations he is  hardly an ally; he is viewed as trash, a petty agent attached to  a huge pig that has put itself at the disposal of the Zionist  Movement to torture the Arabs and antagonize the virtuous  Islamic faith and its lofty and undying values. The changes  favoring Iraq's cause regionally and globally are ongoing and  will continue. The positive relationship between Iraq and the  Security Council and the Special Commission is on course. The  feeble-minded Fahd and his likeminded petty agents will only  reap failure and suffer dire consequences. Great Iraq and its  proud people will, in the meantime, continue to walk tall and be  a lofty example of pride and dignity and a bastion for the Arab  nation and revival, the foreign minister stated.</p>

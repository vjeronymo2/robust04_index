			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the proposed rule in &sect;287.8(c)(2) should be changed to remove the requirement that the immigration officer must document, on appropriate Service forms, the fact that an arrestee was advised of his or her rights. The commenter pointed out that many United States Attorneys accept advice of rights given in the presence of witnesses in lieu of a form. The Service disagrees. Immigration officers must document advice of rights on appropriate Service forms, consistent with the practice of other components within the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that proposed &sect;287.8(c)(2) incorrectly stated that a person arrested and charged with a criminal violation shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required by law at the time of arrest, or as soon thereafter as practicable. The commenter pointed out that current law requires that such warnings be provided only prior to a custodial interrogation. The commenter further stated that many criminal arrests are made where the arresting officer does not want to conduct a custodial interrogation and therefore should not be required to advise the person arrested of the appropriate rights. The Service and the Department disagree with the commenter's interpretation of the rule. First, the rule states that the person arrested shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required by law. The law, including constitutional standards, determines when advice of rights must be provided. Second, to the extent that the rule encourages a uniform advice of rights at or shortly after the point of arrest, it serves as an appropriate reminder of these constitutional standards and establishes a practice that will prevent situations where interrogations are wrongfully undertaken without proper advice of rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the definition of a designated pursuit vehicle in &sect;287.8(e)(1) should stipulate that the vehicle must be a sedan in order to conform to the Border Patrol Vehicle Pursuit Policy. The Service disagrees. Other enforcement programs will be developing their own vehicle pursuit policies that may permit the use if vehicles other than sedans. The proposed regulations authorized certain categories of immigration officers, including special agents and deportation officers, to initiate a vehicular pursuit. In the final rule, special agents and deportation officers have been removed from the list until such time as the Investigations and the Detention and Deportation Programs have developed their specific vehicle pursuit policy, the policy is approved by the Commissioner, and all of the special agents and/or deportation officers authorized to initiate vehicular pursuits have undergone the requisite pursuit driving training and received training in the new policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned the legitimacy of the Service's Office of Internal Audit, starting that the Service is trying to create by regulation an office similar in function to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which was transferred from the Service to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department pursuant to section 102(d) of the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;504. The Service and the Department disagree. The Office of Internal Audit was established in the reorganization of the Service and approved by the Attorney General in April 1991. Regulations have been drafted wherein the Director of Internal Audit is responsible, in part, for providing the capability to investigate alleged misconduct by Service employees and for coordinating that program with other agencies within the Department. The transfer of the Office of Professional Responsibility from the Service to the Office of the Inspector General neither relieved Service management from responsibility for ensuring proper employee conduct nor precluded Service management from exercising its fundamental management authorities to identify and correct employee misconduct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the proposed rule in &sect;287.10 was insufficiently specific because it stated only that allegations of misconduct would be referred ``promptly'' and did not: describe how the process for resolution would be expedited; describe the circumstances under which a Service employee, against whom allegations were made, might not be notified of the allegations; indicate that more serious allegations would be handled differently than less serious ones; call for the involvement of operational peers or supervisors in resolving allegations; and eliminate from involvement in the process management officials who lack law enforcement experience. It is not appropriate to incorporate the specific requirements for the handling of alleged violations of the enforcement standards into administrative rulemaking, and therefore, no change has been made to the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

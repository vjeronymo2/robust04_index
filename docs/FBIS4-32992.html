			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A. Sanchez Belisle] </F>   [Text] Banking confidentiality in Panama "should be  redefined" to avoid the legitimate right to privacy from being  used as a means to protect the laundering of money resulting  from drug trafficking, Olegario Barrelier, president of the  Panamanian Banking Association, has told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA.    "As part of the services banks offer to honest local and  foreign customers, banking confidentiality should be redefined  in explaining the rights banks, their employees, former  employees, the National Banking Commission, and other  authorities should have," Barrelier has said. He has said the  National Banking Association will present specific proposals to  the national government "when appropriate."    According to Barrelier, total banking secrecy in Panama, as  in other countries, "does not exist." The banker has said: "We  would rather say there is banking confidentiality," and he has  said the legal provision on this issue "is a part of the  legitimate right to privacy an individual has regarding his  home, mail, telephone communications, assets, and businesses."    According to Barrelier, the proposals at the international  level, particularly those coming from the United States,  advocating a limitation on banking secrecy in nations "attempt  to avoid" individuals or companies linked to drug trafficking  that use banking services "to camouflage," through banking  confidentiality, the illegal nature of their revenues.    Although the Panamanian Government has taken significant  measures to avoid the dishonest use of banking services, the  Panamanian Banking Association "has a great willingness to  continue cooperating in the struggle against money laundering,"  Barrelier has said.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: Inflation threat undermines the euphoria - Wall Street THE THREAT of inflation again alarmed Wall Street this week, sending stock and bond investors scurrying for cover just two days after they had lifted prices on both markets to record highs. The news that prompted yesterday's heavy selling (in the first 30 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 50 points and bond prices dropped sharply, sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond back up past 6.8 per cent) was the 0.4 per cent increase in the February producer price index, a closely-watched inflation indicator. Although analysts were expecting a smaller increase in the PPI, the number itself was not especially shocking, coming in no more than one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the median of forecasts. So why was there such a dramatic reaction from financial markets? Essentially, the PPI number was, as they say on Wall Street, 'a wake-up call.' Over the past year, both stock and bond investors, particularly the latter, have grown complacent about the threat of inflation, which has been running at an annual rate this past year of about 3.3 per cent. More important to investors, the inflation outlook has consistently been bright. Economic growth might have picked up in the past few quarters but it has been remarkably uninflationary, and economists - who are forecasting growth this year of between 3.0 and 3.5 per cent - expect it to remain that way. The reason is that they expect improvements in growth to remain primarily a function of rising productivity which, over the past year, has helped to keep unit labour cost inflation extremely low. If, in spite of accelerating economic growth, the labour market remains depressed for the foreseeable future, then the markets need not worry too much about wage inflation. Yet, what about that extraordinary February employment report of just over a week ago, when a wholly unexpected surge in non-farm payrolls spread temporary panic in the bond markets? Was that not proof that the jobs market was, finally, catching up with the recovery? Not necessarily, if the most recent weekly jobs data are to be believed. Thursday's report, showing a big rise in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance during the final week of last month, contradicted directly the February employment figures. However, not everyone was convinced by the news. There are those on Wall Street who follow the weekly jobless claims numbers - which, they believe, are both more accurate and more up-to-date - while others prefer to concentrate on the monthly employment report, a supposedly less exact measure but one that is less prone to volatility and a better measure of longer-term trends. Making sense of the conflicting economic evidence is not easy. The most sensible response to the recent numbers would be to conclude that economic growth will maintain a steady, if unspectacular, pace this year; that jobs growth will remain sluggish; and that inflation, while still weak by historical standards, will soon assume an upward trend. Making sense of the stock and bond markets is another matter. Both look distinctly overbought, which is probably why investors panicked slightly yesterday when the inflation data proved worse than expected. Equities still look expensive - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is trading at 23 times earnings - and bonds have been supported as much by short-term technical factors (investors switching out of mortgage-backed securities because of prepayment fears, and continued speculation that the Treasury will slash the size of future long bond issues) as they have been by the economic fundamentals. This means prices are vulnerable to sudden reverses. On the positive side, money continues to flood in from investors seeking better returns than from low-yielding certificates of deposit and money market funds. This should provide a bedrock of support for share prices, and please the mutual fund managers and stockbrokers. Among the latter, Charles Schwab revealed this week that it executed a record number of trades for customers during February, an illustration of how much individual investors still like stocks. This must have cheered Sanford Weill, who yesterday concluded a Dollars 1bn deal that will merge the Smith Barney broking subsidiary of his Primerica group with the Shearson brokerage unit of American Express. The new creation will rival Merrill Lynch as a powerhouse in retail broking  -an extremely profitable business to be in these days.  ----------------------------------- Monday        3469.42  +   64.84 Tuesday       3472.12  +   2.7 Wednesday     3478.34  +   6.22 Thursday      3457.0   -   21.34 Friday        3427.82  -   29.18  -----------------------------------</p>

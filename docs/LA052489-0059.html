			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLASTIC FOAM MAKERS SEEK TO AVERT BAN  </P> <P> Representatives from plastic foam manufacturers have urged Duarte officials to  consider recycling rather than banning cellular polystyrene.  </P> <P> City council members have been considering banning the use of plastic foam  containers and other products in restaurants because it is not biodegradable  and poses a litter problem. Some cellular polystyrene is made with chemicals  that damage the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere, contributing to the  so-called "greenhouse effect."  </P> <P> John Marshall, a product manager of Dow Chemical Co., told city officials  during a three-hour hearing that manufacturers are moving away from making  products made with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. By the end of  the year all foam food packaging, including egg cartons and meat trays, should  be free of CFCs, he said.  </P> <P> Stanley John, president of Rastra Building Systems Inc. in Riverside, described  a recycling plant he plans to open in July that would process 6,000 cubic feet  of plastic foam daily.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Moscow Introduced Arms Trade </F> Monopoly in November, and Revoked It in May"]    [Text] The Russian Government has authorized industrial  enterprises in the military-industrial complex and weapons  manufacturers to export their own military equipment and  supplies, and to sign contracts with foreign partners and  cooperate with them.    This decree was adopted right in the wake of the president's  decree dated 18 November of last year, which established a state  monopoly in Russia on military-technical cooperation; the state  company "Rosvooruzheniye," formed several months ago, was  entrusted with its implementation.    The reestablishment of a monopoly was attributed to the fact  that the liberalization of the arms trade which had been  conducted over several years had led to substantial currency  losses because of the commercial incompetence of enterprises,  competition between establishments which had the right to enter  foreign markets, and the emergence of a large number of  parasitical intermediary firms. By and large, whereas in 1987  the USSR sold approximately $22 billion worth of arms, in 1993  Russia was only able to earn around 2 billion.    Does the government decree repeal the presidential edict?  The president's press service advised IZVESTIYA to think for  itself. The Interdepartmental Commission for Military-Technical  Cooperation Between the Russian State and Foreign Counties  believes that there are no contradictions between the two  documents. The draft decree was prepared over a period of 18  months, Nikolay Bogdanov, senior secretary of the commission,  said. It was reexamined after about 20 general designers and  directors of military-industrial complex enterprises sent the  president an appeal demanding that the manufacturer be given  back the right to sell his own output independently on foreign  markets. The president instructed the commission to sort the  matter out.    The investigation resulted in a decision being adopted by  the  commission -- in whose work representatives of all institutions  and firms interested in military-technical cooperation are  participating -- to submit the draft decree for ratification by  the government.    Only the manufacturers will be able to trade in arms.  Private trading companies and middlemen have been excluded from  the lists of possible contenders, Nikolay Bogdanov said.  Furthermore, every enterprise will have to undergo strict  attestation and obtain a license. A decision will be adopted by  members of the commission on the principle of consensus. The  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company fully retains the functions of  price control.    According to Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the  president's representative in the "Rosvooruzheniye" State  Company, who has been entrusted with the functions of monitoring  the observance of legality in the arms trade, it will be  impossible to avoid the expansion of the number of participants  in military-technical cooperation. Both manufacturers who offer  the commodity and consumers exist throughout the world.  Relations between them are regulated by tough laws and are put  into practice under state supervision. The complexity of  Russia's position is that it does not have a law on arms trade.    Marshal Shaposhnikov believes that the government decree  will  be implemented gradually, which will make it possible to adopt a  law, a draft of which has already been prepared. Every  application for a license by an enterprise will be studied  carefully.</p>

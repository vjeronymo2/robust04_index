			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PADRE NOTEBOOK / BILL PLASCHKE;  </P> <P> HARRIS FEELS BETTER BUT WILL KNOW MORE AFTER TODAY  </P> <P> Greg Harris' left rib cage area was feeling better Thursday, but the big test  will come today when the Padres' rookie reliever throws for the first time  since walking off the mound with a sharp pain Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's a torn cartilage or anything, because it feels pretty good,  and I can move around pretty good," Harris said late Thursday. "I'll just have  to wait and see what happens when I throw, but I think it won't be anything  serious."  </P> <P> The Padres hope not. Harris was removed from Wednesday's 4-3 victory over San  Francisco in the eighth inning after striking out Tracy Jones with the bases  loaded in the seventh.  </P> <P> He was on the verge of another strikeout in the eighth, with a one-and-two  count on Kirt Manwaring, when his side "felt like a knife was sticking in it."  </P> <P> Harris was replaced by reliever Mark Davis, who threw one pitch to Manwaring --  a strike -- and had his first strikeout of the season.  </P> <P> The rules state that when a pitcher leaves during the middle of the count, it  becomes a no-lose situation for the man relieving him. The injured player gets  burdened with the walk or hit if one is given up, while the reliever gets  credited if the hitter makes an out, even if it is a one-strike strikeout.  </P> <P> The Padres' August move to accommodate the Chargers will actually work in the  Padres' favor.  </P> <P> The Padres have agreed to switch their Aug. 13 home game with Atlanta to Aug.  12, already an off day, so the Chargers can play the Cowboys on national  television on the 13th. This will give the Padres consecutive off days Aug.  13-14.  </P> <P> It will be a good time for the players to relax. After the "vacation," they end  the season with a 44-game stretch that will include six games with the New York  Mets and six each with Cincinnati, San Francisco and the Dodgers, over a 48-day  period.  </P> <P> Exactly half of those games -- 22 -- are at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P></p>

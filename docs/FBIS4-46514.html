			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sr Lt Yuriy Povkh: "The SAM Operators Did Not </F> Have `To Shoot' in the Rear Hemisphere."]    [Text] I have visited the command post of the Air Defense  Forces many times. And even though I did not have a sense of  seeing something new when I looked at the numerous screens and  monitors [tablo], on this occasion, as well, I could not rid  myself of the feeling that I was in the most important facility.  How else could it be, given that everything that happens here is  the final result of the work of all the country's air defense  forces?    The training exercise that was being conducted that day at  the command post's intelligence-gathering and information  processing center [RITs] was no exception.    In our present situation, it is no exaggeration to say that  it is very important to have as much information about the enemy  as possible. This is especially true in the case of the Air  Defense Forces. Without accurate and timely information about  hostile aircraft, the highly accurate SAM complex and  interceptors remain blind. To prevent this from happening, the  Radiotechnical Troops of the Air Defense Forces of Ukraine  constantly conduct training exercises at various levels of  subordination for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of  air reconnaissance.    ...It is never quiet and calm in the RITs room. Information  about the situation in the air over the whole country and beyond  its borders arrives here all day and all night from subunits,  command posts, units, and formations stationed across the whole  of Ukraine. The large screen was lit up with markers of planned  [side-] numbers [borty]. Every so often, the monitor lit up -- a  new target had appeared. However, the first part of the exercise  was already in full swing. As it progressed, the officers of the  RITs command post and their colleagues from the mobile command  post were undergoing a theoretical test of their knowledge of  documents on organizing combat duties, combat operations in the  RITs, and the operational use of the combat arms of the Air  Defense Forces. The usual procedure was used: a question on a  card, twenty minutes to prepare, and then the answer. The  examiners were officers in charge of the training exercise. Col.  R. Kim, chief of the combat training division of the  Radiotechnical Troops [RTV], and Col. H. Avramenko, chief of the  command post of the Air Defense Forces, did not stint in asking  additional questions to assess how well the officers were  prepared. Lt. Col. O. Ohoreltsev and Lt. Col. V. Moshenskiy  demonstrated excellent skills. Lt. Col. Serebryakov and majors  Kolesnikov and Polyanskyy gave assured answers. On the other  hand, officers Potyomkin, Kublo, Sokol, and Latyshkevych gave  answers that were not up to their expected level of nowledge.  They ran into difficulties answering questions on the structure  and organization of foreign armies and on the tactical and  technical features of Air Defense equipment.    After the last answer is heard, the examiners announce the  results. Officials are charged with holding additional classes  on subjects in which individual officers demonstrated  insufficient proficiency. This time no drastic measures are  taken; requirements with respect to the theoretical knowledge of  officers are very strict at the command post. An unsatisfactory  level of knowledge can result in disciplinary action here, even  removal from the performance of service duties.    Then the crew take up their usual places. The last orders  ring out. The numbers on the electronic clock have already  passed the "H-hour".    Groups of "enemy" targets begin to appear on the screens and  plotting boards, where just seconds ago there were only  individual blips. Several directions light up virtually at the  same time. More than half the blips symbolizing the "enemy" are  red in color. These need to be dealt with first, because these  targets are coming it at low and very low altitudes. For that  reason, the leader of the exercise gives special instructions on  following them and producing the information needed to destroy  them.    Gradually, the tension in the RITs approaches the critical  point. But the faces of the officers of the duty watch remain  calm and concentrated. Reports are coming in over the  communication channels from the various sectors about the  actions of the "enemy." The "enemy" gives no quarter, as they  say. Across the entire range of altitudes, from very low all the  way into the stratosphere, despite the mounting of active  resistance, the strike group of targets is approaching ever  closer to the country's border.    "In the southwestern sector, the target is... the command  post!" states another report.    The information about this target is processed as quickly as  possible and passed on to the commander for a decision.    Fighter aircraft lift off. Radar conditions become even more  complicated. Given the situation, Col. R. Kim assigns part of  the information for manual processing.    While the automated command and control system [ASU]  responded faultlessly to changes in the situation in the air (it  is, after all, a machine), those manning the plotting board  performed somewhat less efficiently. Lacking sufficient  experience, they were unable to deal with the large volume of  work. As a result, the amount of information given them was  decreased in the course of the exercise. Despite this, they made  many mistakes in depicting the actions of "enemy" targets. This  was revealed when they compared the situation on the map board  with the attack plan. But it would not be fair to blame only  those manning the plotting board. After all, their job is only  the final link in the long information transmission chain, which  consists of many specialists at various levels. As became  obvious later, the telegraph operators at the communications  node also made mistakes. The RITs officers should also have  reacted more decisively when information disappeared, and they  should have acted more boldly in checking through the  communication channels.    But this will become apparent later; meanwhile, the RITs is  receiving the first reports about targets that have been  destroyed. The numbered arrows that had just "crossed" the state  border are being replaced by markers that resemble envelopes.  However, it is too early to speak of complete success. There are  still many hostile aircraft in the skies, attempting to reach  their assigned targets.    Colonels R. Kim and H. Avramenko are devoting particular  attention to the interaction of units and formations. Their  concern is understandable: this is one of the most important  prerequisites for carrying out the combat mission.    ...The exercise is over. The hour of intense combat activity  has passed with lightning speed. It is now time to analyze the  actions of the duty watch of the RITs.    "The objective of this training exercise for the battle crew  has been attained in all respects," states Col. H. Avramenko.  "The work was done using both automated and nonautomated means,  which required of the specialists the ability to combine these  two methods during the course of a massive strike. The exercise  also exposed the shortcomings in our work. Above all, it  revealed an inability to quickly analyze the actions of the  targets depending on their importance and other factors. It also  revealed inadequate oversight of the quality and quantity of  information. In the future, we will have to devote more  attention to ensuring more decisive action by the crew of the  RITs as well as the communications center specialists to avoid  information gaps."    At the outset of the exercise, Hennadiy Volodymyrovych had  said that when surface-to-air missile operators shoot in the  rear hemisphere, this signifies a defect in the work the  Radiotechnicaol Tropps. Applying his statement to everything  that I heard and saw, I think that the SAM operators would not  need to do so. The level of air surveillance remains high, as  does the performance of the brain center in this chain -- that  is, the RITs command post of the Air Defense Forces.</p>

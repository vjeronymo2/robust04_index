			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Amato quickly fills agriculture post: Italian premier moves to repair damage caused by latest resignation THE Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, yesterday sought to shake off his administration's lame-duck image by quickly naming a new agriculture minister - 24 hours after the incumbent had resigned following a police raid on his home in connection with the nationwide corruption inquiry. Former Christian Democrat senator, Mr Alfredo Diana, was appointed to the post vacated on Sunday by the resignation of Mr Gianni Fontana, who became the fourth minister in just over a month swept from office by the corruption scandals. Instead of marking time until the next main event in the political calendar  -the referendums set for April 18 - without replacing the minister, Mr Amato opted for decisive action. One of the 10 referendums concerns the abolition of the Ministry of Agriculture and the devolution of decisions in agricultural matters to the regions. However, the agricultural minister has to watch over at least three key and controversial areas - the future of the Gatt talks and the impact of any agreement on Italian farmers, especially of oilseeds; the bitter dispute between Italy and the EC over milk quotas; and this month's outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Italy, caused by cattle imported from Croatia, which has led to a tough ban on meat exports. These considerations, combined with the obvious signals of weakness in any decision not to replace Mr Fontana, appeared to have persuaded the prime minister to act. As the portfolio was held by the Christian Democrats it was filled from within their ranks, although Mr Amato could have opted for a technocrat. Mr Fontana, 48, is under investigation by magistrates in his home base of Verona for alleged illicit financing of political parties. A total of six ministers have resigned since the Amato government was first formed at the end of June last year. Among them, Mr Giovanni Goria, who resigned as finance minister because of his alleged involvement in irregularities in a savings bank scandal, has since been cleared by magistrates. Another, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the former EC commissioner who resigned as Italy's environment minister last month and left the Socialist party in protest at Mr Amato's attempts to find a political solution to the judicial problems presented by the corruption scandals, was elected the leader of the Green party over the weekend. Mr Amato still faces an uphill task in being able to convince both the members of his own four-party coalition and the rest of parliament that he has the will to keep governing. The leaders of most of the political parties have begun discussions to consider whether a new, broader-based government should be formed after the referendums to carry out essential constitutional reforms. But the positions of the parties remain riven by internal rivalries and suspicions.</p>

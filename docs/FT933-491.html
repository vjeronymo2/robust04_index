			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Camdessus calls for refocusing of economic policies MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday called on the industrialised countries 'to refocus boldly' their economic policies to strengthen growth and employment. Spelling out the latest IMF doctrine for its 178 members from the industrialised, developing and former communist worlds, Mr Camdessus warned that global economic problems were formidable but 'opportunities are in some respects unprecedented'. In his speech at the formal opening of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Mr Camdessus said globalised financial markets would not tolerate imbalances in the mix or stance of macroeconomic policy or inconsistencies between exchange rates and fundamentals. Warning that 'business as usual' would not solve the profound changes brought about by globalisation of the world economy, he urged: More liberal trade. Successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks was an 'opportunity governments cannot allow themselves to miss'. More developing IMF countries should liberalise exchange controls. Structural reform. A key mistake of the 1980s was the failure to realise that rising unemployment was a result of factors apart from the ups and downs of the business cycle. 'Part of the problem is that our well-meaning efforts to protect the unemployed and people in insecure and low-paid jobs have actually been adding to labour market rigidities,' he said. 'I believe there is increasing recognition of the need to reform social insurance schemes, to promote job search and wage flexibility, to limit taxes and regulations that discourage employment and at the same time devote more resources to education and training.' Lower budget deficits. Apart from Japan, countries had lost the ability to use fiscal policy to support demand. Deficit cutting plans by the US, Germany, Italy and Canada did not go far enough. Nearly all industrial countries should draw up stronger medium-term deficit-cutting plans and introduce them as recovery strengthened. They should cut subsidies and excessive military spending. Cutting interest rates. In Europe lower interest rates could ease stagnation and unemployment. 'Continuing decline of inflationary pressures in Germany, as well as further fiscal consolidation, promise relief.' Mr Camdessus also called for a strengthening of the international monetary system through closer policy co-ordination among the Group of Seven industrialised countries and strengthened policy surveillance by the IMF. Progress to European monetary union should be encouraged. Widening bands in the European exchange rate mechanism should help recovery but 'it also entails a risk of a relaxation of discipline. This must be resisted by a major effort at policy convergence.' Developing nations should follow the example of fast-growing countries by adopting sound macroeconomic policies, liberal trade policies and stamping out corruption. Mr Camdessus said the world faced daunting problems. Industrial countries had to contend with unemployment, anaemic growth and budget deficits. Poverty still afflicted 'hundreds of millions' in developing nations, despite strong growth in some countries. But there were some hopeful signs. The world monetary and financial situation had 'significantly improved'. Inflation in the industrial world remained subdued, increasing the scope for lower interest rates. Currencies were not seriously misaligned. The debt crisis had receded as a threat. Strong growth in developing countries had supported global trade and growth. Among former communist countries, Albania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland and Slovenia were expected to show positive growth this year. Global economic co-operation was improving as shown by policy changes since the spring meetings of the IMF. In that period, the US and Germany had adopted budget consolidation measures, Japan had taken steps to boost its economy and interest rates had fallen in Europe.</p>

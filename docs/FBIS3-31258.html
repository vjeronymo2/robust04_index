			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Branko Jokic: "Business Is Business"] </F>   [Text] (From our correspondent) Podgorica, 28 January --  According to an article published in the Novi Pazar magazine  SANDZAK, Montenegrin and Albanian authorities concluded a secret  agreement on the export of gasoline from Albania to Montenegro,  from where it is delivered to Pale [capital of the Srpska  republic] to be used by the Bosnian Serb military.    According to the article, Montenegrin Albanians living along  the Montenegrin-Albanian border are involved in the deals. Some  of them have been licensed by the Montenegrin Government to  "import" gasoline. Gasoline, which costs one German mark per  liter in the Albanian town of Scutari, is transported in large  quantities across Lake Skutari to Montenegro. The Yugoslav Army  provides specially equipped boats.    The citizens of Montenegro involved in this business earn  one-half mark per liter. Almost all local residents participate  in this trade (actually it is a state-sanctioned smuggling  operation) because of the high earnings. Montenegro and the  Srpska republic are well supplied with gasoline. The Pizon  Petrol Enterprise, owned by the former Crvena Zvezda soccer  player Vladimir Petrovic Pizon, transports gasoline from Lake  Scutari to Pale.    As reported, the Albanian authorities have recently  tightened  control over gasoline sales in Scutari, but it is a well-known  secret that gasoline stations in Scutari work at full speed and  sell almost half of all the gasoline sold in Albania. We are  talking about very large quantities, knowing that last year  Albanians registered several thousand vehicles that they had  purchased at European junkyards. According to the article, Pale  receives five to seven tanker-truck loads of Albanian gasoline  each day.    In addition to Albania, Macedonia is also accused of  sanctions violations. At the border crossings near Ohrid and  Rozaj (on the Macedonian-Albanian and Montenegrin-Albanian  borders), aluminum is exported from Montenegro and raw materials  are imported for Montenegro and Serbia without hindrance. Heavy  trucks and trailers wait for hours on both sides of the border  crossings, which in the past were almost without traffic.    If all this is true, we could conclude that this type of  border trade, uncontrolled by representatives of the  international community, was agreed to by Momir Bulatovic and  Sali Berisha when the Montenegrin president visited Tirana. At  the same time, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic paid a  visit to Skopje. It is a fact that we can only guess now how  Albania benefits. Maybe it is alleviation of discontent in the  western part of the country, where at least some hundred local  residents are earning good incomes trafficking in gasoline.</p>

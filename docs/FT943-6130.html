			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Smurfit in IPounds 20m Austrian purchase Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish packaging company, is injecting IPounds 20.5m (Pounds 20.2m) into an Austrian paper producer, further strengthening its hold on the European corrugated market. Smurfit, Europe's leading producer of corrugated paper with 10 per cent of the market, yesterday announced it would acquire 27.5 per cent of Nettingsdorfer Beteilingungs-Aktlengesellschaft, the fourth largest producer. Earlier this month Smurfit announced plans to buy Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging interests of Saint Gobain of France, for Pounds 670m. The latest purchase is Smurfit's first step into the eastern European and German markets. Mr Dermot Smurfit, chairman and chief executive of Smurfit Continental Europe, said the company intended to increase its stake in Nettingsdorfer to more than 50 per cent through a further cash injection in the next two to three years. The move could leave Smurfit with two of the three European mills producing kraft liner paper, a key component in corrugated manufacture. Nettingsdorfer, a family-owned group quoted on the Austrian stock market, produces 320,000 tonnes of paper. It has been lossmaking in recent years but rising paper prices have helped it move back into profit in 1994 on a monthly basis. The group is heavily indebted, however, after investing some IPounds 120m in its Austrian Kraft liner mill. Debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds is estimated at about 400 per cent. Mr Smurfit said his group had not been prepared to take on such debt. Any further holding increase would depend in part on Nettingsdorfer cutting borrowings, he said. The group is paying Sch310 (Pounds 18.17) per share, against Friday's suspension price of Sch253.</p>

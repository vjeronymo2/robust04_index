			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Curragh hopes to reopen Yukon zinc/lead mines CURRAGH RESOURCES, operating under bankruptcy protection, hopes to reopen its two Yukon zinc/lead mines in the first half of 1994 if two big Korean investors finally put up CDollars 50m (Pounds 26m) in new equity and the company succeeds in getting a CDollars 34m government loan guarantee. But Mr Clifford Frame told the annual meeting in Toronto that Curragh also needed to restructure CDollars 200m of debt and be confident of a zinc price of about 50 US cents a pound and a lead price of 22 cents a pound, substantially higher than present levels. It was Curragh's first annual meeting since an explosion in a company coal mine in Novia Scotia in May 1992 killed 26 miners. The company faces manslaughter charges. Curragh has to raise CDollars 25m itself in new equity to seal the investment by Korea Zinc and Samsung. It hopes to complete its financial restructuring in September and emerge from protection.</p>

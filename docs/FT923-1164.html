			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Kohl and Mitterrand aim to ease fears over Maastricht CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand want next month's European Community summit to issue a special statement designed to soothe popular fears that economic and political union will rob people of their national identity. The German and French leaders, who discussed the idea of an 'interpretive declaration' on the Maastricht treaty in Paris on Tuesday, are expected to press other EC leaders for support. Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl agreed at their meeting that the lesson of the narrow Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht was that the European Community had become remote from ordinary people, an Elysee official said. The aim over the next few weeks should be to discuss how Community decision-making could be made more transparent and more democratic, he added. The summit, scheduled for October 16 in London, should then brief the Commission to prepare firm proposals which could be taken up at the next summit in Edinburgh during December. France was keen that they should complement the report on subsidiarity called for by Mr John Major. According to news agency reports from France, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, said decisions must be brought closer to the people. The subsidiarity principle - maximum devolution of decision-making - must be 'fully realised', the reports said. Renegotiation of Maastricht was not discussed on Tuesday. Both leaders, the principal champions of European union, remained firm in their commitment to the treaties on monetary and political union even if they took longer than expected to be ratified by EC members. Although there was some disparity between French and German versions of the precise contents of the Paris meeting, it was clear that both leaders felt the need for an initiative to bolster popular confidence in economic and political union, which has been weakened by the Danish referendum No and the narrowness of the Yes vote in France. According to an opinion poll published yesterday, more than 70 per cent of Germans want to keep the D-Mark in preference to a single European currency, and only 32 per cent support the Maastricht treaties as they stand.</p>

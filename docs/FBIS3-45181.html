Some collectively-owned firms have followed suit.    In the first ten months of last year more than 700,000  unemployed people received benefit funds from the state,  according to the first issue of the newspaper "CHINA REFORM"  today.    Since China changed its "insurance for people waiting for  jobs" to unemployment insurance in 1986, a total of 1.2 million  people have received relief funds. Now the majority of the  unemployed have found new jobs, according to the paper.</p>

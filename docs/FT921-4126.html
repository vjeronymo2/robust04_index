			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt takes dividend cuts in its stride FRANKFURT took dividend cuts by two big chemical companies in its stride while the upswing in Paris gathered momentum, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS approached 2,000 as its current favourites continued to rise. The CAC-40 index rose 17.60 to 1,993.38 in turnover of FFr2.23bn but dealers expected the final figure to be swelled by orders booked after the close. Euro Disney closed at an all-time high of FFr164.30, up FFr2.80, as overnight orders from the US were executed. Elf fell another FFr3 to FFr366.90 as the government placed its 2.3 per cent stake, but news that the international tranche was already oversubscribed by yesterday morning indicated that the stock would rebound soon. Chargeurs, popular last week on reports that BSkyB would soon be in profit, rose FFr54 or 4.6 per cent to FFr1,218 on confirmation that the satellite television company was breaking even early in March. There were reports that analysts were raising their estimates of Chargeurs' net asset value. One of the day's biggest losers was Printemps which fell FFr45 or 5.1 per cent to FFr835 after a French court rejected a demand by its minority shareholders that Pinault should extend its two-thirds bid for the department store group to 100 per cent. FRANKFURT continued its consolidation, unmoved by dividend cuts from BASF and Hoechst. In fact, shares in the two chemicals companies rose by DM1.90 and 50 pfg respectively, to DM249.50 and DM256.20. The FAZ index rose 0.97 to 711.52 at midsession, and the DAX index put on 0.29 to 1,750.54 at the close. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM5.9bn. Ms Wendy Anderson at County NatWest said that BASF was heavily exposed to areas of overcapacity in the industry, and that its results indicated a final quarter fall in profits from DM410m to DM150m. Final quarter profits at Hoechst, with a better product profile, were likely to have fallen from DM764m to DM540m. The shipbuilder and engineer Bremer Vulkan rose DM2 to DM83.30 on nearly doubled 1191 net profits, and news that it would be buying two of the largest shipyards in east Germany. MILAN steadied after its recent fall on short-covering ahead of Thursday's expiry of monthly options. The Comit index lost just 0.03 to 512.73 but turnover remained thin, estimated at L70bn after L60.5bn. Shares in Bonifiche Siele, the holding company of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura (BNA), Italy's second largest private sector bank, plummeted L5,100 or 15 per cent to L29,000 in thin trading. The stock was re-admitted on Monday after an investigation by Consob. Generali advanced L95 to L29,650 before it posted a 15.1 per cent increase in parent company premium income for 1991. Eridania rose L80 to L6,780 after pleasing the market with a 15 per cent rise in 1991 operating profits. ZURICH rose, with foreign investors balancing a local preference for high-yielding, money market instruments. The all-share SPI index rose 2.7 to 1,135.5. Surveillance, the product and resource inspection group, fell SFr160 to SFr7,890. Late on Monday it followed the latest fashion with five-for-one share split, but the market was disappointed with a rise of just 3 per cent in 1991 net profits. AMSTERDAM continued to focus on the brewing sector while the rest of the market was mixed to lower. The CBS Tendency Index eased 0.1 to 127.8 in light turnover of Fl 456.6m. Heineken and Grolsch rose to to new all-time highs. Grolsch, which reports its 1991 results today, gained Fl 5.50 to Fl 204.00 while Heineken, which reported last week, gained Fl 1.70 to Fl 179.00. BRUSSELS closed mostly higher although Solvay moved against the trend. The Bel-20 Index rose 7.50 to 1,209.34, Solvay easing BFr100 to BFr12,300 in volume of 3,875 shares, while SGB gained another BFr10 to BFr2,215. STOCKHOLM scored its tenth consecutive gain, although the Affarsvarlden General index closed just 2.2 higher at 991.5, lifted by hopes of improved company profits in 1993 and the gradual scrapping of restricted shares which foreigners may not own. However Sandvik, the steel tools group, saw its B shares SKr1 lower at SKr395, on a drop in 1991 net profits from SKr2.69bn to SKr1.92bn, and in spite of its own decision to remove share ownership restrictions. HELSINKI staged a rebound after falling for the previous 11 trading days, and dealers expected a continued uptrend in anticipation of Finland's entry into the EC. The Hex index rose 7.8 to 866.9.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1167.71  1166.87  1166.85  1167.58  1167.58  1168.31  1168.67  1169.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1169.22    Day's Low  1166.18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Mar 9     Mar 6     Mar 5     Mar 4     Mar 3 1165.45   1162.10   1169.56   1176.33   1176.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

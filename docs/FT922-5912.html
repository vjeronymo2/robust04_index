			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fox decision baits US networks MR RUPERT Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting, an independent US television network founded five years ago, will challenge the traditional networks by expanding its programming schedule in September from four to six nights a week. The network also plans to expand to seven nights a week of programming next winter, when it adds an evening of movie programming. Fox, a division of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation, has managed to take on the existing big three networks - ABC, NBC and CBS - with a brash formula of successful drama, comedy, and tabloid shows. Last year Fox garnered more than 8 per cent of the US television audience share. The plan adds 11 new shows, increasing Fox's prime time programming from 10 to 14 hours a week. That is still below the 15 hours weekly level which, under US regulatory guidelines, allows Fox to profit from the syndication of shows. Other networks are prevented from syndicating as they exceed 15 hours weekly. Fox was founded under the management of Mr Barry Diller, who resigned recently as chairman of Fox Inc, the parent of the network and Hollywood studio. Mr Murdoch assumed a more hands-on role at Fox after Mr Diller's departure. He is keen to prepare for a greater challenge for his fledgling network.</p>

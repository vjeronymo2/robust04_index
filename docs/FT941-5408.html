			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Another Italian shake-up Italy's state-run railways have set out to attract commuters and other frequent users with a shake-up in the ticket system, writes John Simkins in Milan. The effect of the regulations, which came into force on March 1, is that travellers who buy nine consecutive monthly passes for journeys up to 250km will receive a further three free of charge. If the traveller makes a one-off payment for the nine passes, four more are gratis. The innovation comes alongside a 3 per cent average increase in prices which still leaves Italian fares well below the average European level. A railways spokeswoman said that measures to reward customer loyalty were aimed at increasing the railways' share of traffic from the present 12 per cent to 20 per cent within the next few years. She said that a bigger increase in fares was unlikely until there was a widespread network of high-speed trains. Currently high-speed trains run only between Rome and Florence. Under the new ticketing system, return tickets have been scrapped. Books of tickets are now available, giving a 10 per cent reduction for at least four journeys of more than 70km to any destination, and a 20 per cent reduction for journeys exceeding 350km. Discounts on return tickets have also been scrapped. Books of tickets are now available, giving a 10 per cent reduction for at least four journeys during one month of more than 70km to any destination, and a 20 per cent cut for journeys longer than 350km.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Drummond rises to Pounds 393,000 Drummond Group, the cloth-ing fabrics manufacturer, achieved a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 370,000 to Pounds 393,000 on a 12 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 25.8m. This is Drummond's third consecutive set of improving results since it reported a loss of Pounds 3.38m for the year to March 31 1993. At the operating level, profits to September 30 were 43 per cent ahead at Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 469,000). In the comparable period there was Pounds 196,000 profit on the sale of a discontinued operation. The result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 277,000 (Pounds 295,000). The board was still cautious enough to pass the dividend, but Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said a final dividend was likely if recovery continued as planned. Drummond recruited Mr Zvika Pollak, an Israeli, as chief executive three years ago, and embarked on a vigorous investment programme at the James Drummond worsted mill in Bradford. It was now investing in efficiency improvements at John Crowther &amp; Son, the woollens and dyeing plant at Huddersfield and had sold its small bunting fabric business. Earnings per share improved 15 per cent from 1.17p to 1.35p.</p>

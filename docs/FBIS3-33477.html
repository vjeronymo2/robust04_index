			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article written by Jayme Brener with the cooperation of </F> Helio Contreiras in Rio de Janeiro and Otto Sarkis in Brasilia:  "Dr. Von Braun's Return"]    [Text] H.O.P. are three letters that stand for pure  dynamite. They are the initials of Lieutenant Brigadier Hugo de  Oliveira Piva, the father of the Brazilian space program and of  half a dozen domestic missile projects. His name stirred a  great deal of controversy in the 1980's when he went to work for  Iraq's Saddam Husayn with Brasilia's concurrence, although such  concurrence was never fully assumed. Well, the man behind  these three letters is back. At 67, and retired since 1987,  Piva is quietly serving as an informal adviser -- although  without pay -- for two of his old projects, which were  resuscitated in recent months through new doses of government  funds. These projects are the MAA-1 Piranha (an air-to-air  missile) and the MSS 1.2 (surface-to-surface missile).    Piva knows that his name, or just his initials, has been at  the center of one of the worst controversies in the history of  Brazilian-U.S. relations. The fact is that Uncle Sam has never  forgiven him for his cooperation with Saddam Husayn, who was  thrashed in 1991 during the Gulf war on an initiative of the  White House. To avoid further friction, "the brigadier" --  Piva's nickname -- has not put his signature on any of these  projects and, officially, he continues to work as an  international dealer of a large number of products ranging from  black pepper to machine tools. This is a rather sad job for  someone having two doctorate degrees -- in aeronautics and  applied mathematics -- from foreign universities and who had  become known as "Brazil's Dr. Von Braun," in reference to German  scientist Wernher von Braun, the pioneer of aerospace research  in the United States. Yet, Piva's dream is to be able to come  back through the front door to the field of arms manufacturing  or to the Brazilian aerospace program. Speaking to ISTOE, he  said that he might be able to do that during the next government  "if it is favorable to resuming the materiel, aeronautics, and  nuclear industries given their role in promoting development and  national sovereignty."    Piva said: "I view the resumption of Brazilian missile  projects with satisfaction and reassurance because these  projects will promote advanced technology -- which is essential  for the progress of any nation -- in every area." He added:  "After all, I regard these projects as my children whom I used  to hold on my lap." To a certain extent, he still holds them.  The Aeronautics Ministry has entrusted the development of the  Piranha project -- under an $8.8 million contract -- to the  Mectron Engineering Company, which is based in Sao Jose dos  Campos [Sao Paulo State], without a prior bidding process in  light of its being highly specialized in the field. Working  for Mectron are Piva's "scientific children," that is, a  handful of researchers who worked with him after graduating from  the tough Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA) and  participated in the early stages of the Piranha project. They  followed the brigadier to two missile factories: Orbita, a  mixed company, and Avibras [Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc.] a  private company. Then, in 1989, they left for Iraq. Their  mission was to develop an air-to-air missile. Those who turned  to the dictionary to look up the word for piranha in Arabic --  if there is one -- made the right move. They all had a  humiliating return to Brazil as the Brazilian Government was  aligned with the anti-Saddam alliance and denied any  responsibility concerning the work of the scientists. Piva said:  "The Collor de Mello government was dominated by foreign  interests and needed a scapegoat."    Following the Iraqi affair, the leading members of the team  of researchers created Mectron while Piva announced his  retirement. In 1992, Mectron obtained a contract with the Army  to complete the MSS 1.2 surface-to-surface missile, which is now  being tested. Piva helped them secretly. Now, Mectron -- which  has a little more than 30 employees -- is grabbing a slice of  the Piranha project. Mectron Technical Director Renato Zanetta  declines to comment on his ties with his mentor. According to  Major Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of the Aerospace  Technical Center (CTA), "Piva has nothing to do with this  project." Yet, the man whose initials are H.0 P. has given  Mectron -- in addition to his expert advice -- papers, sketches,  and diagrams of the Iraqi Al-Piranha. All this was done  secretly because Hugo de Oliveira Piva, a retired lieutenant  brigadier earning the equivalent of $1,400 monthly, continues to  quietly run his company Spaceplus from an office located above a  lingerie store in downtown Sao Jose.    The award of contracts to Mectron, a company that is very  close to Piva's heart, would then be a well-earned  acknowledgement of the work of somebody who has been racking his  brain to produce missiles, wouldn't it? This is what the  majority of the military involved in the project believe. But  insiders in the military hardware industry, who are already  "hot-tempered" by nature, are even more troubled. The sharpest  thrusts come from Avibras, at present the only manufacturer of  rockets in the country, also located in Sao Jose. Avibras Vice  President Rubens Porto contends that "our advice has not been  sought for the development of the Piranha missile, but if we  were consulted we would have alternative projects." Major  Brigadier Jose Marcone, deputy chairman of the Brazilian  Commission of Space Activities, adds that "Avibras was not  interested in the Piranha." An engineer satirizes: "The truth  is that Avibras was never able to recover from the killing off  of scientists made by Piva there."    Piva and Avibras have not been on speaking terms for a long  time. In 1991, when the company entered into composition with  its creditors, Piva was hired by a bank to make an estimation of  the equipment offered by the company as collateral for the  payment of its debts. When Piva went to the Avibras'  facilities, which have very strict security control, he  presented himself as "engineer Hugo de Oliveira." When Avibras  managers saw their rival on the premises they got the fright of  their life. From there to pressing charges of industrial  espionage there was only one step.    Piva smiles when talking about this incident. His smile  vanishes when he recalls that in spite of being the father of  the renaissance in the Brazilian missile industry, the latter is  far from being the apple of his eye. His real pet answers to  the name of V.L.S., satellite launching vehicle, a project that  goes back to the 1970's but that was hamstrung by lack of funds.  Last year, however, the project was revived because the  government promised to invest $40 million in the sector in the  next three years. It is estimated that the V.L.S. will be  launched in 1995 carrying a satellite that will also be of  Brazilian make.    The only thing is that the acronym V.L.S. -- as well as the  initials H.O.P. -- is tantamount to having problems with the  United States because Brazil is not a signatory to the  international treaty on the control of missile production. The  Brazilian Government guarantees that the V.L.S. project -- which  is being developed by the newly set up Bahia Space Agency since  the end of January -- is a purely civilian endeavor -- green and  yellow [the colors of the Brazilian flag] and not olive green.  Notwithstanding this, the White House mistrusts Brazil given  the fact that whoever has the know-how for launching satellites  may very well launch a military missile having a range of 1,000  km. The United States is also suspicious of all the other  countries that have refused to sign the aforementioned treaty,  namely India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Iraq itself. U.S.  military have gone as far as hinting that Piva may have used the  V.L.S. technology to upgrade Iraq's Scud missiles. By using its  clout, the U.S. Government did its utmost to delay the Brazilian  aerospace project. Its last bid for delaying it was to ban  Brazil from having access to inertial platforms, the devices  that guide the rocket. Piva and Brigadier Taveira from the CTA  argue that the problem has already been overcome. A CTA  official notes, in a state of euphoria that "we have even  managed to buy a computer for the rocket from the United  Kingdom, a faithful ally of the United States." "We thought  that they were not going to deliver it," he added. The most  skeptical ones, however, contend that the satellite launcher  still has many shortcomings and that the frequently claimed  self-sufficiency is all but designed to lure possible suppliers  of the necessary equipment.    If the Brazilian aerospace program is already facing  difficulties, one can very well imagine how it fared after  Piva's signature. Even though he has many friends and disciples  at the CTA of Sao Jose dos Campos, Piva tries to avoid even  coming close to the center. As a friend of his notes, "his face  shines when he talks about the V.L.S.." As soon as he starts  working on exportation and importation, Piva's thoughts wander  to what is in store for him. He does not rule out the  possibility of wearing a researcher's overall. H.O.P. says he  does not support any candidacy in particular, but concedes that  "Lula's [Luis Inacio da Silva] PT [Workers Party] has supported  the development of the military hardware industry, which is  precisely what I have always defended." In conclusion, he says:  "I could go back to that area if I were asked to do so by a  government that follows those guidelines, whether it represented  the PT or any other party."</p>

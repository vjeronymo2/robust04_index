Attending the meeting of the Asia-Pacific sister cities  exchange are a total of 60 representatives from cities in 14  foreign countries and 15 Japanese municipal governments,  organizers said.    Under the sponsorship of the Home Affairs Ministry and the  Foreign Ministry, the convention aims to provide a forum for the  sister city authorities to discuss matters of mutual concern and  to foster closer ties.    This is the second such Asia-Pacific exchange, organizers  said.    The morning was taken up by the executive committee session  but subcommittee meetings in the afternoon planned to discuss  two issues -- ``economic activity and the role of self-governing  bodies'' and ``developing consideration for the environment.''    From Thursday the Japanese cities represented will host the  delegates from their respective sister cities and the visit will  culminate in a concluding session next Monday in Tokyo.</p>

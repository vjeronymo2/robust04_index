			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Heineken venture shows NZDollars 98m nine-month loss DB Group, the New Zealand concern controlled by a joint venture of Heineken and Singapore Breweries, yesterday reported a loss of NZDollars 98.1m (USDollars 57.57m) after abnormals for the nine months to March 31. This included a loss on the sale of Australian pub chain Austotel of NZDollars 86.7m. Austotel, which was sold to Brierley Investments, was part of a deal which saw Brierley sell its 27 per cent shareholding in DB Group to Asia Pacific Breweries, the holding company for Heineken of the Netherlands and Singapore Breweries. DB Group is now managed by Heineken. DB Group reported operating profits before abnormals 24 per cent higher at NZDollars 17.3m over the year-ago figure. Sales fell 5 per cent to NZDollars 559.8m. Directors said after the sale of Austotel and various New Zealand hotels and taverns, net debt fell from NZDollars 158.9m to NZDollars 29.4m at March 31. In addition the directors had provided a further NZDollars 23.4m for costs involved in quitting other hotels and liquor outlets. They said they remained convinced that the strategy of selling non-performing assets was 'the proper approach' to take. They planned to sell all company-owned hotels by December 31. No dividend is planned.</p>

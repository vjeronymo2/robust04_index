			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S LEFT FOR THE LATIN LEFT?;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: THE SANDINISTAS' LOSS IS A MILESTONE FOR MODERNIZING SOCIALIST  IDEALS IN THE FACE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS.  </P> <P> The election upset in Nicaragua is important from many perspectives, and will  be a topic for commentary and analysis for some time to come. It is a watershed  in Nicaraguan history, and a decisive event for Central America as a whole.  </P> <P> Less obviously, the defeat of the Sandinista government is a milestone for the  Latin American left, which is living through its most traumatic crisis ever.  Its response to the events in Nicaragua, along with those in the Soviet Union  and Eastern Europe, will determine whether the left will remain a major  reference point in this hemisphere or pass into irrelevance.  </P> <P> Daniel Ortega's defeat is the most shattering setback the Latin left has  suffered since Salvador Allende's overthrow by the military in Chile in 1973.  It is sure to provoke soul-searching, identity crises and downright depression  throughout the left side of the hemisphere's political spectrum. It should,  because only then will the political forces ranging from the moderate  left-of-center to the radical fringe be able to come to terms with the  monumental changes under way in the world. Only through such a process can it  hope to benefit from what should be an exceptionally and paradoxically  favorable situation for its future prospects.  </P> <P> The most immediate explanation for the Sandinistas' loss seems evident: The  Nicaraguan people, fed up with 10 years of war, apparently believed that the  only way to end the Contra offensive and the U.S. embargo, and the resulting  pervasive economic degradation of the country, was through U.S. acceptance of  the election results, which inevitably meant an opposition victory. The  Nicaraguans were probably right in believing that a vote for Ortega meant  continued American hostility; they are probably wrong in thinking that a vote  for Violeta Chamorro ensures American financial largess.  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan revolutionaries must also attribute their defeat to more general  and long-term trends that are affecting Latin America as a whole. The  hemisphere is experiencing an extraordinary conjunction of major democratic  advances and economic and social regression. The Contra war, the U.S. embargo  and economic mismanagement (partly due to the war and the embargo) have turned  Nicaragua into a wasteland. But the country's affliction is simply an extreme  manifestation of a process that reaches far beyond Nicaragua's borders. The  subcontinent in its entirety has been going through a dramatic crisis  characterized by economic stagnation, social regression and massive  decapitalization. Throughout the 1980s, per-capita GDP growth grew only in  Colombia and did not fall only in Chile and the Dominican Republic.  </P> <P> The coincidence of economic decline and democratic gain bodes disaster for  incumbents in general and in particular for political entities identified with  the status quo. In Latin America, that means the military (Brazil, Chile,  Argentina, Uruguay), or one-party rule (Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua), or two-party  monopoly (Venezuela, Colombia). The coincidence of those two trends had  disastrous results for the Sandinistas, but in theory it should be encouraging  for the left in the long term. That promise, however, could be aborted by the  other underlying trend that brought about Daniel Ortega's demise: the  transformation of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The end of the Cold War also means the elimination of what was known as the  "socialist bloc." More importantly, it entails the dissolution of the socialist  paradigm, which over the years has been broadly adapted, with additions or  subtractions that each party, government or author wished to apply. Yet the  collapse of the paradigm in the Soviet Bloc has not spared the Latin left: To  the extent that any movement or regime in Latin America is perceived as being  identified with the Soviet Union or Cuba, it now pays dearly with public  opinion or at the polls. Conversely, it is no surprise that where the Latin  left or left-of-center is strongest today -- Brazil and Mexico -- it is also  totally newly born, home-grown and devoid of any ties, debts or emotional  attachment to the "socialist camp."  </P> <P> The end of the paradigm has plunged this hemisphere's orthodox left into a  collective depression. Having indefinitely postponed dealing with issues such  as democracy, sound economic management and relations with the United States,  it found itself in a totally untenable, indefensible position as the socialist  world collapsed and the Cold War came to an end. In this sense, the  Sandinistas' commitment to a fair election, their acceptance of defeat and  their restructuring as an institutional opposition is a positive development.  It obliges the Sandinistas to take democracy seriously -- like it or not -- and  not just tactically. Above all, it gives them a marvelous opportunity to remove  the "Soviet-Cuban" handicap, and once again be and be seen by their countrymen  and neighbors as a purely Nicaraguan, fully democratic movement. Such a  full-fledged commitment to democratic practices is something that the  traditional Latin American left, with the notable exception of Salvador  Allende, had been until now unwilling or unable to achieve.  </P> <P> If the Sandinista Front's acceptance of opposition status is fully carried out,  it will allow the comandantes to renew ties with their followers -- as many as  are left -- and be rid of the arrogant and authoritarian habits they acquired  over 10 years of nearly absolute rule. It will force them to learn once again  how to struggle for power, but under different rules: those they themselves set  and bequeathed to their nation, in a gesture that was perhaps forced upon them  but is nonetheless undisputably noble and generous. They have become an example  that other pending processes of democratization would do well to follow. In one  case, Cuba, it would save the revolution's place in history; in Mexico, it  would spare the country a near-certain tragedy.  </P></p>

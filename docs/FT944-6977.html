			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Battle of the super-jumbos: How competition and new technology are changing the face of air travel It was a Jesuit priest who introduced me to the art of frequent flying. 'Wear a dog collar,' he declared one Sunday from the pulpit of the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Chelsea. 'It can work miracles.' As one who has flown more than 150,000 miles in the past year, I know what he means. Wearing the cloth is only one of many ways to persuade the world's airlines to offer an upgrade to an improved class. A word of warning, however. Not everyone welcomes a priest in the first-class cabin. Dom Anthony Sutch, a Benedictine monk from Downside Abbey in Somerset, had settled comfortably into his first-class seat in full monastic robes, sipping champagne and tucking into the caviar en route to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. 'You hypocrite,' said a loud Australian next to him. 'No,' he replied. 'I had an economy ticket but was upgraded because my brother Peter is the chairman of the airline.' 'You are a liar as well as a hypocrite,' snapped the Aussie. Frequent flyers have all had to develop their own techniques to survive the rigours of modern air travel. But they are having to sharpen their skills because air travel is set to become even more confusing as airlines adapt to huge changes in their market. Aviation is in a state of revolution as the industry struggles to achieve profitability and adapt to forces of competition brought on by liberalisation and the evolution of a once elitist mode of travel into a mass transport system. Last year, more than 1.25bn people travelled by air. The industry expects the number to double by 2005. On the ground, many big airports are already saturated. Since the construction of a new airport takes up to 30 years (for example, Munich which opened last year), some of the busiest airports such as Heathrow or Frankfurt may eventually be forced to turn airlines away. In the air, the congestion is just as bad. Unless traffic control systems in Europe and other parts of the world can be modernised fairly soon, many of the world's busiest air lanes will find it hard to cope with the expected 5-6 per cent a year growth in traffic. It all adds up to more delays for passengers and heavier costs for airlines, which have accumulated losses of Dollars 15.6bn during the last four years on their international scheduled services alone. Although business is picking up, this year's, profits are expected to be less than 1 per cent of the industry's turnover. While traffic is rising again, competition is holding down fares and passenger yields. As the business traveller has traditionally subsidised the majority of people who fly economy, airlines have had to offer increasingly complex inducements to lure them into their aircraft. But they have had to go further. To fill their aircraft, they have had to extend these offers to the bulk of their economy passengers. Each carrier wants to fill every last seat on its craft, almost at any price, but on the other hand to maximise overall profits. These conflicting pressures yield increasing opportunities for alert passengers, but plenty of pitfalls as well. All big airlines, even those which were at first reluctant, have had to introduce frequent flyer loyalty programmes for business travellers; many are improving their airport lounge facilities with showers, business centres and, in some cases, fitness centres and swimming pools; others offer free limousine services to airports, luggage pick-up or drop-off services, and valet parking at airports. These incentives, especially for high fare paying passengers, are likely to multiply because airlines expect that only a fifth of passengers will be travelling in premium class cabins by the turn of the century. But you need to develop the eye of a detective to make the most of these offers. The inducements vary greatly from airline to airline, and many carriers will volunteer to tell passengers what benefits they can claim only if asked. British Airways, for example, offers generous free air miles for passengers flying across the North Atlantic, where one of the fiercest battles for market share is being waged between European and US carriers. But on other routes, the number of free miles is much smaller. A full fare paying economy passenger flying from London to San Francisco receives 750 free miles. If he flies to Hong Kong he gets 125. Such schemes have helped airlines win business but they are now in danger of becoming a serious embarrassment. Several million seats are now thought to be covered by frequent flyer schemes. If everyone were to take up their entitlements, the industry would be in deep trouble. Airlines, however, calculate that many people who have accumulated free miles and other bonuses, will never take them up. At present, the redemption rate is around 30-40 per cent, and airlines believe they are safe provided they budget for about 20 per cent more. But there is a dangerous precedent. The troubles of Pan Am in the late 1980s were severely aggravated by the high proportion of passengers taking up free flight entitlements from its bonus programme. The famous airline ultimately went bust. To some extent, the industry has learnt its lesson. Many of the incentives now offered are designed to encourage people not to take them up. Many airlines have set a time limit (on average two years) for the redemption of free miles. Many impose restrictions on when you can fly, to avoid swamping their system with free seats. They are also increasingly offering passengers alternative benefits such as sending free bouquets of flowers, reduced car hire rates, free hotel rooms and other gifts. The development of big computer reservation systems, providing carriers with up-to-the-minute information on the booking situation of any flight at any time on any day, and the growing freedom to set fares is also forcing consumers to keep a tight watch on prices. Airlines call it yield management. It means they can adjust prices, especially in the high volume economy cabin, to match demand. As a result, economy class fares in Europe can vary by Pounds 100-Pounds 150 on any given route. On long haul flights, the variations are even more pronounced. 'If you have time, it pays to shop around,' advises an Air France official. 'By making a few telephone calls, you can find very attractive deals with airlines as well as bucket shops.' The airline scramble for market share has produced another phenomenon: over-booking. It was originally a product of the aviation boom of the late 1980s and disappeared as the industry went into recession after the Gulf War. But with the recovery, it is making a comeback. Although airlines are now forced to compensate any confirmed passengers who are denied boarding, some deliberately continue to flaunt the industry's 'good airline practices' in an effort to pick up market share. Any passenger with a confirmed ticket who risks being bumped off an overbooked flight should stand his ground in the check-in line. Airline staff will try to persuade passengers to step aside to sort out the problem to avoid delaying the entire check-in process. Those who agree will miss their flight. Those who make a fuss will get a seat, usually with an upgrade. Liberalisation, globalisation and consolidation in the industry have other implications for passengers. For the past few years, airlines have all been jostling to form alliances, buy equity stakes in each other, and to form commercial partnerships to extend their global reach and market penetration. The prevailing trend has been code sharing agreements. Bob Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, describes these deals as 'the great deception'. Code sharing enables two airlines to use their ticket codes on each other's flights. A passenger may think he is flying BA all the way from London to Cincinatti because his ticket says so, but he might be changing aircraft in Pittsburg and continue his journey on USAir, BA's financially troubled American partner. What you expect from BA is not what you may get from USAir. Technology is also continuing to change the nature of air travel. Jet legs are getting longer. New Airbus and Boeing airliners can fly non-stop for 15 hours or more, and the manufacturers are already studying the development of 800-1,000 seat double-deck super jumbo aircraft, which could transform long distance air travel into an extended city rush-hour crush. How are you going to make 16-hour non-stop journeys bearable? Airlines are already developing new high-tech entertainment systems including electronic gambling and multi-channel videos. Richard Branson pioneered the idea of bringing back a sense of fun to air travel when he started his airline 10 years ago. He introduced first class travel at business class prices, an extensive library of in-flight entertainment, in-flight massages, the possibility of ordering a suit just before taking off in London to be ready on arrival in Hong Kong, and, according to some of his stewardesses, the tradition of giving a resounding send off to any passengers graduating to the 'mile high club'; those who succumb to the sexual arousement long flights are said to provoke. That is Virgin's special style, but its bigger airline rivals are also adapting to the new demands of long distance travellers. It is no longer just a question of price and comfort. It is also the introduction of what British Airways calls a sense of well-being in the skies by becoming more conscious of the health needs of passengers. For the future super jumbos, BA has already drawn up plans to include lounges and gyms, even possibly a swimming pool on board. Airbus has also been working on designs for its proposed A3XX jumbo with self catering cafeteria-style facilities on board to avoid the problem for the crew of feeding up to 1,000 passengers. Mass air transport is not only becoming a logistical headache for consumers but a health hazard. This is not because modern jets are dangerous (they are far safer than road or rail transport), but because hours spent crossing time zones in a cramped cabin with the same oxygen level as Mexico City is bad for you. Just like pilots, passengers are having to monitor much more carefully what they eat, drink and do on long trips. And airlines are already adapting their in-flight service to respond to the new health issues raised by modern jet transport. They are increasingly offering lighter meals and introducing more long distance non-smoking flights despite the risk of losing business in some markets. In adding leisure facilities to their aircraft, airlines are also responding to research which suggests that it is a waste of time to work on a long flight. Studies by the Royal Air Force have shown that it is difficult to concentrate and to assimilate many new facts on a long haul flight. Jet lag is also known to cause loss of efficiency on arrival, and has led many businessmen, politicians and diplomats to make serious errors of judgment straight after a long journey. John Foster Dulles, the late US Secretary of State, admitted just before he died to a critical mistake that probably led to the 1956 Suez crisis because of jet lag. Immediately after returning to Washington from a Middle East diplomatic shuttle, he learnt of President Nasser's agreement to buy arms from the Soviet Union. Tired and angry, he decided to cancel a big loan for the Aswan dam project in Upper Egypt. The Suez conflict followed with the subsequent nationalisation of the Suez canal and war with Egypt.</p>

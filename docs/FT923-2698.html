			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: CU dips on share sale hints WIDESPREAD suggestions that Sun Alliance had sold its near 15 per cent stake in Commercial Union were still unproven at the market close yesterday, but many traders believe that such a deal is not far away. A quiet opening in Commercial Union shares changed dramatically as the stock fell on suggestions that Sun Alliance had sold its CU holding via a bought deal. CU shares dropped from 509p to 490p as a series of rumours swirled around the market early in the session. However, a spokesman for Sun Alliance declined to comment. One suggestion was that Sun Alliance had sold its holding of around 60m shares to one of the big US investment banks at 470p a share, and that the bank was attempting to place the stock with institutions. Another variation was that Sun Alliance's joint brokers, SG Warburg and Cazenove, were attempting a placing of the shares. However, the Seaq ticker produced no evidence of a large deal in CU shares, which ended the session 27 off at 483p on turnover of 2.9m. Sun Alliance eased 3 to 254p. Sun Alliance acquired the bulk of its CU shareholding in August 1989 when it bought a 13 per cent stake, some 55m shares, from Adelaide Steamship, the Australian group then controlled by Mr John Spalvins. It paid 465p a share for what has been described as a 'long term friendly holding'. Arjo Wiggins shock Recent worries that Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper group, would struggle to achieve half-year profits of Pounds 100m, against Pounds 135.5m last time, paled into insignificance as the company stunned the market by chopping its interim payment. To make matters worse Arjo said it believed the final dividend would be cut by a similar proportion. The profits figure came to Pounds 99m. The market had braced itself for the steep reduction in interim profits, with estimates said to have been as low as Pounds 95m, but none of the London-based analysts had factored in a lower dividend. Dealers said analysts had already begun to hack at their full-year forecasts, with many shaving estimates by upwards of Pounds 20m. Arjo stock was easily the Footsie's and the market's worst individual performer, plunging nearly 30 per cent to close 53 down at 129p, by far the lowest level since the company's June 1990 demerger from BAT Ind-ustries. Volume reached 20m. Gas offers British Gas gave a notably sluggish display as dealers picked up hints that a number of hefty lines of stock were making an appearance in the market. There were suggestions that the stock on offer came from institutions that were beginning to question the commercial viability of the transportation of gas from the UK group's joint venture in Khazakstan. The Khazakstan gas story was behind a good run in British Gas shares earlier this year. By the close, the stock was 4 1/2 off at 230 1/2 p on turnover of 6.1m shares. The big banks moved with the market, Barclays sliding 13 to 310p and Royal Bank of Scotland, where there was exceptionally heavy trading, 8 to 148p. Legal &amp; General, where the market is still haunted by worries about domestic mortgage indemnity losses, retreated 13 to 317p. The international/pharmaceutical sectors gave up some of Monday's big gains as the market preferred to focus on the sharp fall on Wall Street in early trading yesterday rather than on renewed weakness in sterling against the dollar. Glaxo settled 14 off at 776p and Wellcome fell 17 to 867p. The oil market was brooding over the possibility that yet more earnings downgrades for BP may be on the way. BP shares eased 2 to 202 1/2 p on 6.2m shares. Shell, in spite of the recent good dividend, lost 5 1/2 to 476 1/2 p. Retailing group Kingfisher had a good session after reporting figures at the top end of market expectations. At the day's high the shares were up 11 at 485p, but came back with the market to close unchanged at 474p after volume of 3.6m. Dixons slipped 7 to 202p, with Kleinwort Benson reported to have advised investors to switch out of the stock and into Kingfisher. Profit-taking left Rank Organisation 13 down at 455p. Motor repair group Kwik-Fit continued to suffer from Monday's release of disappointing half-time figures. The shares shed 7 to 89p, with BZW said to have joined other brokers that have downgraded expectations for the company's full year. Inchcape retreated 11 to 409p on profit-taking. In the hotel sector, chunky sellers were again seen in Queens Moat Houses, which eased 2 to 34p in trade of 6.2m shares. Granada Group lost 15 to 220p, with County NatWest reported to be the day's main seller. Turnover came to 4.9m. Thorn EMI ended 13 off at 657p in sympathy with Granada. USM-quoted travel and tour operator Airbreak Leisure Group plummeted 13 1/2 to 10 1/2 p in reaction to Monday's announcement after the market close of interim losses, the passing of the dividend, a profits warning about the full year and the resignation of the chairman and finance director. Cadbury Schweppes was among a handful of stocks to buck the market trend. The shares firmed 2 to 432p as bid speculation once again did the rounds. Food retailers were friendless throughout the session, retreating more than the general market in percentage terms. Tesco declined 7 to 208p in trade of 4.9m shares, while Argyll fell 13 to 314p and J. Sainsbury 10 to 426p. Delta's interim figures disappointed the market, sending the shares plunging 25 to 353p. AB Electronics, after the losses and dividend omission, dropped 10 to 47p. International conglomerate BTR saw busy trading of 6.8m shares as the stock shed 4 to 444p. It was also active in the traded options market, the equivalent of more than 3m shares being dealt. Concern about the outlook for British Aerospace returned to upset the shares, which weakened 15 to 198p. A profits downgrading sent Simon Engineering tumbling 33 to 138p, making it one of the day's worst performing stocks in percentage terms. Smith New Court cut its current year forecast by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 13.4m, citing a lack of recovery in the company's Access operation in the US. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (15).

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Airlines call for monopoly probe THE UK's smaller independent airlines have called on the government to undertake an urgent review of airline competition and refer the proposed take-over of Dan-Air by British Airways to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways and Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, yesterday pressed their case with the Office of Fair Trading for a referral to the MMC of BA's acquisition of Dan-Air. They also asked for the establishment of a consumer watchdog for the airline industry called 'Ofair', similar to those already set up for privatised utilities such as gas, water and electricity. The OFT is expected to decide in the next 48 hours whether to refer the BA acquisition to the MMC. BA warned it would consider pulling out of the deal if faced with long regulatory hurdles, but the OFT is coming under increasing pressure to refer the deal. Sir Michael and Mr Branson said the take-over raised significant issues for the future of UK airline competition which could not be waved aside for short term expediency. Sir Michael said that the UK's multi-airline industry policy 'has never been under greater threat'. Both chairmen warned that the transaction would result in considerable job losses in the UK aviation industry, especially at Gatwick, Dan-Air's London base. Sir Michael claimed the BA rescue would lead to about 3,000 job losses, including the 1,600 jobs expected to be shed at Dan-Air and at suppliers. He argued that more jobs would have been saved if the troubled airline had collapsed and other carriers had been able to apply for Dan-Air routes out of Gatwick. Mr Branson claimed that at least 1,500 jobs would have been saved at Dan-Air if his earlier rescue proposal had been accepted.</p>

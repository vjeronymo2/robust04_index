			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> LEGION OF LATIN STUDENTS TO ARRIVE  </P> <P> Not quite sure whether or not Mars and Apollo are related? Confused over the  meaning of veni, vidi, vici? Curious about how to throw the discus while  wearing a toga? Well, California Latin students will address those issues and  others this weekend at the annual state Junior Classical League convention in  Irvine.  </P> <P> The students, members of Latin clubs at their schools, will gather at  University High School in Irvine, the home of the nation's second largest Latin  club. Student organizers have spent the year preparing for the three-day event  and say that this week has been the busiest.  </P> <P> "It's chaos, total chaos," said convention co-chairman Aaron Shapiro, one of  the 236 members of University High's club. "There're about 1,300 students  coming, and right now it's really hectic."  </P> <P> Representatives of 49 schools from across the state are scheduled to attend the  convention, and students traveling long distances will be housed with the  families of Orange County students.  </P> <P> The convention includes everything from a quiz bowl on mythology to a written  language and grammar test to team chariot races.  </P> <P> Participants can enter any of the events, as well as help make a team banner or  scrapbook relating to this year's theme. The theme is based on a quote from  Virgil's epic poem "Aeneid" and translates: "Perhaps one day it will be  beneficial to remember these things."  </P> <P> Gloria Shu, a senior at University High and the state's Junior Classical League  president, said the annual event is a memorable one.  </P> <P> "It really brings the state together," Shu said. "You can see Latin and Roman  and Greek culture at work."  </P> <P> This is the 35th year for the convention and the second time in the last four  years that it has been held at University High. This year's keynote speaker  will be former Los Angeles Rams football player Rosey Greer. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

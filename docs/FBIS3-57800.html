			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Responding to yesterday's statement by Ferhat  Ataman, acting spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, on  the eastern Aegean islands, particularly Limnos, Foreign  Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said: With this new,  unfounded, and provocative statement, the acting spokesman for  the Turkish Foreign Ministry continues to cultivate a climate of  tension. He added: The Greek Government has repeatedly declared  that it is seeking an improvement in relations between the two  countries, but something like this presupposes respect for  international law and the avoidance of provocations by Turkey.  The invoking of international treaties by Turkey only allows us  to recall the numerous violations it has committed, which peaked  with the military invasion of Cyprus and the ongoing occupation  of 40 percent of the island by Turkish troops.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman also noted: We should also  recall the decline of the Greek minority in Istanbul, Imroz  [Cokceada], and Tenedos [Bozcaada]. Regarding the more specific  points in Mr. Ataman's statement, we note the following: The  demilitarization of Limnos, Dardanelles Straits [Canakkale  Bogazi], Imroz, and Tenedos was abolished by the Montreux Treaty  of 1936. Moreover, it is recalled that, at that time, Turkey  agreed--both verbally and in writing--to abolishing the  demilitarization of Limnos and Samothraki. Mr. Bikas added:  Greece's sovereignty in the eastern Aegean islands and the  Dodecanese is absolute and does not depend on any prerequisite  or conventional commitment.    Referring to the measures adopted for the defense of the  islands, the Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated that these  measures are in accordance with Article 50 of the UN Charter and  that this was done because of Turkish provocation, as well as  Turkey's invasion and occupation of Cyprus.</p>

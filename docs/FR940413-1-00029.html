			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, the FAA proposed to codify SFAR 27 (53 FR 18530, May 23, 1988). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposed to add part 34 to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The NPRM included proposed &sect;34.71, which stated that compliance with gaseous emission standards would be shown by comparing the pollutant levels with the applicable emission standards. Proposed &sect;34.71 also stated that an acceptable means of compliance would be incorporated by reference in proposed &sect;34.4. Proposed &sect;34.4 referenced the preproduction program described in Appendix 6 to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16, ``Environmental Protection, Volume II_Aircraft Engine Emissions, First Edition, June 1981, effective February 18, 1982,'' as an acceptable means of compliance with &sect;34.71.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August of 1990, the proposal was adopted as part 34, ``Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes,'' effective September 10, 1990 (55 FR 32856, August 10, 1990). Part 34 contains all of the applicable aircraft engine fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements of SFAR 27, and the test procedures specified under the regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. Section 34.4 was not adopted as proposed, but was ``reserved.'' The FAA had intended to, instead, specifically incorporate in &sect;34.71 the reference to Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16; however, the reference to an acceptable means of compliance was inadvertently omitted. In addition, the final rule did not state the effective date of Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 in several other sections where this cite was referenced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After part 34 was adopted, the FAA received several requests for clarification of the compliance standards stated in FAR &sect;34.71; the FAA also received inquires as to why Appendix 6 to Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 was omitted as an acceptable alternative to testing every engine. Members of the public stated that &sect;&sect;34.4 and 34.71 were different from those proposed in the NPRM. The FAA recognizes that the final rule, as adopted, caused the confusion. In responding to the inquires, the FAA has stated that the intent of the 1989 proposal was to accept Appendix 6 as an alternative means of compliance. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that &sect;&sect;34.71 should be amended to reflect the intent of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Synopsis of the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA proposes to revise &sect;34.71 of part 34 of the FAR to state that Appendix 6 to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16, ``Environmental Protection, Volume II_Aircraft Engine Emissions, First Edition, June 1981, effective February 18, 1982,'' is an acceptable means of compliance with that section. In addition, &sect;&sect;34.64, 34.82, and 34.89 of part 34 would be revised to state that the effective date of Volume II of Annex 16 is February 18, 1982.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulatory evaluation examines the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rule to amend FAR part 34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of the proposed rule is to insert omissions from the current text for part 34, which was published in August 1990. The omissions include the reference to Appendix 6 to ICAO Annex 16, Environmental Protection, Volume II and the effective date of ICAO rule. In short, the proposed revisions would correct these omissions by referencing the preproduction certification compliance program described in Appendix 6 to ICAO Annex 16, Environmental Protection, Volume II and including the effective date of February 18, 1982, for all references to Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 in part 34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential benefits of this proposed rule ensure that the full intent of final rule for part 34 would be realized, and will eliminate any confusion caused by the noted omissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential costs of the proposed rule would be zero. No significant adverse consequences have been incurred by either the public or the FAA as a result of the published error. After publication, however, the FAA's Office of Environment and Energy was made aware of the error through public inquiry. The proposed amendments would address these inquiries and prevent future misunderstandings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule represents a clarifying change and would not impose any costs on either U.S. or foreign operators. Therefore, a competitive trade advantage would not be incurred by either U.S. operators abroad or foreign operators in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is because the proposed rule is clarifying in nature and would not impose any costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

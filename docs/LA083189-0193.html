			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS MIGHT BE TEAM TO RUN PAST LA HABRA FOR A CHANGE  </P> <P> Traditionally, predicting the winner of the Freeway League has been easy.  </P> <P> The six-team league has been dominated by La Habra High School, which has won  five titles in the past six years. The streak was interrupted in 1987 when La  Habra's undefeated team forfeited two games for using an ineligible player.  </P> <P> Once again, there is an overwhelming favorite in 1989, but this time that team  should be Sunny Hills. Even Jack Nicholls, La Habra's coach, admits as much.  </P> <P> "The big reason we won the title last year was beating Sunny Hills in our  league opener," Nicholls said. "I feel strongly that if we want to repeat,  we're going to have to beat them again."  </P> <P> La Habra upset Sunny Hills, 14-0, last season, shutting out a team that  averaged 24 points in its other nine regular-season games.  </P> <P> "It was a big, big win," Nicholls said.  </P> <P> Shutting out Sunny Hills this time around would be quite an accomplishment. The  Lancers figure to have one of the best running games in Orange County with  three talented running backs.  </P> <P> Brian Pizula, who averaged 9.1 yards per carry as a junior, is among the top  backs in the county.  </P> <P> Ken Overby is a strong, slashing-style runner who will start at fullback. But  the most impressive back is speedster Mike Sullivan, who gained 1,200 yards on  the Lancers' sophomore team last year.  </P> <P> Sullivan, the school's junior class president, was ineligible to play for the  varsity last year after transferring from Servite.  </P> <P> "All three have power, speed and the God-given ability to run to daylight,"  Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said. "This is by far the best group of running  backs I've coached."  </P> <P> They will have the benefit of running behind three all-league offensive linemen  -- center Robert Sung, guard Darren Correll and tackle Pat Marshall.  </P> <P> "They have the most talent and the most experienced coaching staff," said Rick  Foley, Buena Park's coach. "That's a pretty tough combination to beat."  </P> <P> Devaney, who had been downplaying his team during the preseason, finally  admitted this could be his best team in 10 seasons at Sunny Hills.  </P> <P> "A team rarely goes through this league undefeated, but Sunny Hills could do it  this year," said John Turek, Troy's coach.  </P> <P> A look at the teams:  </P> <P> BUENA PARK -- Six victories in four seasons leaves little room for optimism,  but third-year Coach Rick Foley is confident his team will end the longest  league losing streak (27) in the county sometime in '89. "Our goal is to make  the playoffs, and for the first time in my six years here, we're not picked to  finish last," Foley said.  </P> <P> Last year, Foley had two full-time assistant coaches and seven walk-on coaches  on his staff. This year, he has seven full-time coaches.  </P> <P> The Coyotes have one of the biggest offensive lines in the county, anchored by  tackles Jason James (6-5, 295) and Jim Perricone (6-5, 255). They also have two  of the county's quickest players: all-league cornerback Malcolm King and wide  receiver Charles White.  </P> <P> Foley thinks the program turned around last year, when the sophomore team tied  Sunny Hills for the league title.  </P> <P> Quarterback Mark Medellin and tailback Chris Medina, who led the sophomores to  a 9-1 record last year, are among the top newcomers.  </P> <P> FULLERTON -- The Indians were the surprise of the Division VI playoffs last  year, advancing to the semifinals by upsetting La Mirada and Kennedy.  Quarterback Rene Arias returns for his third season after completing 34 of 75  passes for 589 yards and 6 touchdowns and rushing for 211 yards and three  touchdowns last season.  </P> <P> Arias was seldom 100% last year in Fullerton's triple option; he suffered a  hyper-extended elbow in the team's second game and never fully recovered. "In  our offense, Rene is going to get hit on almost every play," said Steve  Nishimoto, Fullerton's coach.  </P> <P> Fullback Marcus Roberson, the backup to Steve DePhillips the past two years,  finally gets his chance. "Our offense is quarterback-fullback oriented, so  Marcus figures to carry about 20 times a game," Nishimoto said.  </P> <P> Bobby Patel, who started at cornerback last year, will move to wide receiver.  He caught only three passes last year, but averaged 36 yards per catch. D.C.  Olsen, a 215-pound junior, is the biggest player on the team and will double at  linebacker and either guard or center.  </P> <P> Nishimoto lost his most versatile player when wide receiver-defensive back John  Bailey quit the team after spring football to concentrate on baseball. Bailey  was the county's 13th leading scorer as a junior, serving as the team's punter  and field goal kicker. He also caught seven touchdown passes.  </P> <P> LA HABRA -- The Highlanders, who have won more league titles in the past six  seasons than any other county school, opened with three straight losses last  season. But they rebounded to go 4-0-1 in league play, allowing an average of  six points per game.  </P> <P> "We expect to win ballgames with our defense," Nicholls said. "I go by that old  Marijon Ancich philosophy that defense wins ballgames. Most of our kids like  playing defense better than offense, anyway."  </P> <P> Still, the Highlanders' offense should be strong with five returners, plus a  quarterback (Mark Moreno) who started five games. Halfback Mark Brown, who  scored 11 touchdowns as a junior, is stronger and faster as a senior.  </P> <P> "I anticipate Mark carrying the ball or receiving it about 25 times a game,"  Nicholls said. "He's as good as anybody in the North County."  </P> <P> Fullback Jeff Besinaiz, the best hitter on the team, doubles at linebacker.  Three offensive linemen -- Chad Pitcher (center), Dan Lediff (guard) and Herman  Hernandez (tackle) -- also return.  </P> <P> SONORA -- Two Division I-linebacker prospects, Scott Tibbets and Scott Sanders,  head a 32-player squad under second-year Coach Larry Allen. "All we need is  about nine more players just like them," Allen said.  </P> <P> Sonora's only victory in 1988 was over Buena Park, 14-6. In the past four  years, the Raiders have a 13-28-1 record.  </P> <P> "We're fighting a losing attitude," Allen said. "We've had five coaches here  this decade, so there's little sense of continuity and no tradition. We've had  problems getting kids to come out."  </P> <P> Ryan Lewis, a wide receiver last year, has moved to quarterback. He improved  over the summer and beat out David Stack for the starting spot. Stack will  start in the defensive secondary.  </P> <P> Tibbets, an all-league selection, also plays fullback and was the team's  second-leading scorer as a junior.  </P> <P> "I think we can compete with the La Habras and Fullertons, but Sunny Hills is  another story," Allen said. "They're the cream of the crop in this league."  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS -- The only question mark is at quarterback, where unproven junior  Rick Orr outplayed La Mirada transfer Jamal McKenzie to earn the starting job.  Orr is an adequate passer at best and probably will throw less than 12 times  per game because he has several fine backs.  </P> <P> Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs visited Sunny Hills last spring to scout Correll, a  strong lineman whose quickness defies his 245 pounds. Correll also will play  linebacker. "Defensively, we're smaller than we've been in the past, but we're  much quicker," Devaney said.  </P> <P> How deep is Sunny Hills' backfield? David Wilde, a star running back on the  Lancers' sophomore team two years ago, has been moved to wide receiver to get  some playing time.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills will make a six-day trip to Edmonton to play LaZerte High on Sept.  22. The trip, three years in the making, will cost each player $400.  </P> <P> TROY -- The Warriors are the youngest team in the league with only 15 seniors  on their 39-player roster. Coach John Turek will be counting heavily on players  from a sophomore team that finished 5-4-1 and has only one player, Jeff Dorsz  (6-5, 250), with good size.  </P> <P> "I've never had a team with so many question marks," Turek said. "We could be  pretty good, or we could be pretty bad. We could score some points, but we're  also going to give up some points."  </P> <P> Troy has only two returning starters, captains Bill Preisler and Adam Petecki.  Preisler will double as a defensive end and offensive guard and Petecki doubles  at linebacker and center.  </P> <P> Another part-time starter, fullback Chad Brasington, joins tailback Ed  Gunderson and quarterback Greg Windle in the backfield. Windle is a  dropback-style left-hander who Turek said is "very accurate." Gunderson has the  potential to become the best back Turek has coached at Troy.  </P> <P> "We've got some good skilled-position players, but for the first time since  I've been here, we don't have the physical size up front on either line," Turek  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE  </P> <P> 1988 Overall, League Records in Parentheses  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:4.64IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> SCHOOL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COMMENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> La Habra (6-4-1, 4-0-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Highlanders go for sixth title  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> in seven years.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sunny Hills (9-3, 4-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Best trio of running backs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> in the county.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fullerton (7-5-1, 3-1-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rene Arias is league's  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> top quarterback.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Troy (6-4-1, 2-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Youngest team in the league with  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  only 15 seniors.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sonora (1-9, 1-4)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Qualified only once for the  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> playoffs in 1980's.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Buena Park (2-7-1, 0-5)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> County's longest league losing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> streak at 27.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Thursday: Garden Grove League  </P></p>

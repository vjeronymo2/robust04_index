			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME HEAVY WEIGHTS, FANCY FOOTWORK AT BALLROOM BOXING  </P> <P> It is nearly time for Boxing by the Beach at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long  Beach. Inside the Grand Ballroom, which holds a red-aproned boxing ring,  promoter Steve Brooks writes checks to people who have provided their services  for the evening.  </P> <P> "All the fighters made weight, so that's a minor miracle," he said. "One was a  pound over, but they put him on a bike for 40 minutes and he lost it."  </P> <P> The doors open, the crowd files in.  </P> <P> Leah Newman and Darcy Austin wait nervously in a hotel room. They will be two  of the ring girls, the first time for both. Newman is a cocktail waitress at a  popular sports bar, where she did well in a recent bikini contest. Austin works  at a nightclub, where she wrestles customers in hot shaving cream.  </P> <P> Beneath a ceiling of little white lights similar to those that decorate  Christmas trees, the fights begin. Salvador Montes knocks out Anthony  (Hummingbird) Corriel in the first round.  </P> <P> Newman and Austin, in skimpy bathing suits, parade around the ring. Cheers and  "yows" rise from the crowd.  </P> <P> Newman returns to her chair. Her hand shakes.  </P> <P> The smacks from red leather gloves echo during the next two bouts.  </P> <P> "Take him out!" booms Gene Layton, an ex-pro football player who is sitting --  by design, he said -- behind the ring girls.  </P> <P> But one person at ringside looks bored.  </P> <P> "I've seen more excitement at a Broadway musical," said Gordon James, president  of the Long Beach Civic Light Opera.  </P> <P> Time for the main event: Ray McElroy vs. Robert (Showdown) Carson of San Pedro.  Both have tassels on their shoes.  </P> <P> There is a flurry of punches in the eighth and final round. Sweat drops fly  into the first row.  </P> <P> "Comb-in-a-tion, comb-in-a-tion," instructs a fan, his hands cupped around his  mouth.  </P> <P> It is over. McElroy wins a unanimous decision. Sonny Ray pulls off McElroy's  gloves.  </P> <P> The fighters leave the ring.  </P> <P> "Champ didn't knock you out, baby," Carson's girlfriend shouts to him.  </P> <P> They both smile.  </P> <P> Already, the ring is being taken down.  </P></p>

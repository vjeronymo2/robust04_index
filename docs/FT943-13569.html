			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Essential that green belt remains strong Sir, Paul Cheeseright's article (Property, July 15) noted that a number of developer interests had expressed the wish that the environment secretary should relax the currently defined West Midlands green belt when issuing his forthcoming strategic planning guidance for the region. However, they should understand that the secretary of state is constrained in the matter by his more general advice on green belts contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note number 2 issued in 1988, currently under review, which states the need for 'exceptional circumstances' when proposing alterations to established green belt boundaries. Given that it is most unlikely that the secretary of state will delete this policy requirement from the emerging policy advice on green belts, any proposed relaxation of the West Midlands green belt must be supported by very convincing reasons. While it is undeniable that potential investment in housing and commercial development that is prohibited from its preferred location on the urban fringe by green belt policy will not necessarily take place in inner city areas where it is needed most, it remains that a strong green belt policy is required as part of an overall strategy for government policies on urban regeneration and sustainable development.

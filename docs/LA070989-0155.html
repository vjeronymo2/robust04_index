			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A San Francisco court has approved payments to 205 homosexual men and women as  part of the $3.5-million settlement reached in 1986 with Pacific Bell in an  anti-gay job discrimination case. Each plaintiff will receive anywhere from a  few thousand dollars to $80,000, depending on how the awards are meted out by a  court-appointed arbitrator, said Leonard Graff of National Gay Rights  Advocates, the law firm that filed the class-action suit in 1975. The case  represents the largest anti-gay job discrimination case in the nation, Graff  said.  </P></p>

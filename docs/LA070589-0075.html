			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Recession Fears Easing, Study Finds: Inflation will increase this year, mainly  because of higher costs for food, health care and energy, but fears of a  recession are subsiding as interest rates fall, according to a study by Pacific  Gas &amp; Electric Co. "The likelihood of a 'soft landing' -- a slower growth  economy with moderate inflation -- has improved in recent weeks," said Tapan  Munroe, chief economist for the utility. The gross national product growth for  the rest of 1989 is expected to be 2.6%, while 1990's GNP should be 1.2%, the  forecast said. Inflation will be higher this year, with a consumer price index  increase of 4.9%, compared to 4.1% in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Simferopol under the "Crimea" </F> rubric: "Parliamentarians Want To Deal With Privatization on  Their Own. They Have Attempted To Strip Yuriy Meshkov of Some  Presidential Powers"]    [Text] Contradictions between Crimea's president and  parliament are taking on the form of a direct standoff. Upon  his return from Switzerland last week, Yuriy Meshkov caught the  deputies in yet another attempt to curb his presidential powers:  the Supreme Soviet tried to pass the so-called "Law on  Enforcing the Crimean Constitution." The session did not  specify which Constitution was at issue -- the new or the old  one, which sparked a conflict with Kiev, but this seemed to be  of no importance. The deputies wanted to pass a provision  entitling them to rescind and to suspend presidential edicts, to  stop the activity of local authorities, and even to appoint  chiefs of local soviets, something that belongs to the Crimean  president's few prerogatives.    It is hard to say what stopped the lawmakers. Probably, with  Mr. Meshkov back in town, conscience awoke in some of his "bloc  friends" and the bill has not been passed so far. But...    Observers note that all legislative trip-ups stem from the  commonplace struggle for a place at the trough, which has  continued at the parliament without letup since its election.  The Crimea Supreme Soviet simply does not care about settling  the conflict with Kiev. Also on 23 June, the presidential edict  subordinating the Crimean State Property Fund to the Saburov  government and the edict "on the privatization of Crimean  state-owned enterprises" were rescinded. All this means just  one thing: the parliament is intent on fully swilling  everything out of the hypothetical "trough" and on dealing with  privatization on its own. If the deputies, who acknowledged at  the latest session their complete economic and legal ignorance,  manage to succeed, Crimea will simply have no government at all,  and the factions will start bickering over the distribution of  property.</p>

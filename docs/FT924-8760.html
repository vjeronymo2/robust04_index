			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Hungary again devalues forint Hungary yesterday devalued the forint by 1.9 per cent, bringing the accumulated depreciation this year to 5.5 per cent, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, ruled out further adjustments this year, despite calls for greater depreciation by export-oriented western multinational companies operating in Hungary. The Bank, however, explained that its policy of maintaining a strong exchange rate would maintain downward pressure on Hungarian inflation, expected to reach 22-23 per cent by year end.</p>

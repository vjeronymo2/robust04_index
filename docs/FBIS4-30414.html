			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 June, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] began studying concrete import restraint  measures to be implemented when foreign products flood into  Japanese markets. On the same day, the ministry held the first  meeting of the Export-Import Transaction Council (an advisory  panel to the international trade and industry minister). It  plans to work out conclusion in time for discussions on the  ratification of the World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty  scheduled for September.    The Finance Ministry has also begun the study of import  restraint measures at the Customs Tariff Council (an advisory  body to the finance minister). The two ministries will work in  closer cooperation through their councils to work out  "Japanese-style import restraint" measures.    The WTO treaty, which was signed in April following the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks, authorizes a country  to restrain imports as an emergency measure by such means as  raising tariffs when a low-priced product is imported in large  quantities. Although Japan has a system of imposing retaliatory  tariffs or volume restraint, it seldom implements these measures  because it takes a lot of time to do so in actuality.    The WTO treaty approves of retaliatory measures when the  treaty is violated. For example, if a textile product is  imported in violation of the treaty, taking retaliatory measures  against another product, like automobiles, is possible under the  treaty. However, Japan has not yet decided on concrete  retaliatory measures.    Thus, the two councils will discuss what kind of retaliatory  measures should be adopted.    They plan to review the Customs Tariff Law and the Foreign  Exchange Control Law, if necessary.</p>

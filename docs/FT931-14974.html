			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions hail concessions on employment legislation TRADES Union Congress officials and Labour MPs have hailed government concessions in the legislation on union reform as greater than the amendments made to all previous employment bills over the past 10 years. In particular, they are relieved at ministers' agreement to bring forward changes to the plans to make unions provide all their members with an annual statement of financial information. Instead, the statement will have to be printed in the union journal with the proviso that any member can have one on request. Labour believes that that might save unions nearly Pounds 15m each year in postal charges. The detailed discussion of the bill by a cross-party committee of MPs yielded a further concession yesterday when the government said it would look at introducing greater flexibility into when a pregnant worker could begin her maternity leave. At present the bill allows employers to define when maternity leave starts. Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said: 'The changes we have won have been small but they are greater than all concessions in previous employment bills put together.' Other changes, won with the assistance of Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, include dropping the requirement for unions to offer equal assistance to all the candidates in executive elections. Union officials said that would effectively mean banning incumbent candidates from standing. The government has also conceded an exemption from the requirement for independent scrutiny of industrial action ballots involving only small numbers of workers. In spite of lobbying from unions and from employers, however, the government has refused to make any substantial concession on its plans for changing the 'check off' arrangements through which union dues are deducted automatically from pay. The bill would mean an employee would have to indicate approval every three years. Labour and the unions still hope that the move, which may cut union membership by more than 20 per cent, can be blocked when the bill goes to the House of Lords.</p>

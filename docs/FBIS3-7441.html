The Central Committee [C.C.] of the Jordanian Communist  Party  in its March 24 solidarity message to the C.C., the Workers'  Party of Korea said the United States reversed the New York  agreement, fully revealing its aggressive design to render the  situation strained and perpetrate a provocation on the Korean  peninsula.    The Brazilian Communist Party issued a statement on March  24.    Noting that the United States was driving the situation of  the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by foiling the third  round of the DPRK-U.S. talks and seeking the resumption of the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea, the statement said this is a  premeditated provocation to isolate and stifle socialist Korea.    The Spanish Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification,  the Organizing Committee of "the Espano-Coreano Koryo Friendship  and Cooperation Association" and the Spanish Committee of the  Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and  Latin America released a joint statement on March 22.    Pointing out that a grave situation has been created again  on  the Korean peninsula by the U.S. perfidious act in reversing its  agreement with the DPRK, it condemned the bellicose and  irresponsible attitude of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, which is serving the imperialists and the United States.    The Russian Association for Friendship and Cultural  Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a  statement March 24 said the situation of the Korean peninsula  has been further aggravated because some quarters of the United  States and Japan have not given up the intention to stifle the  DPRK, and the United States, taking advantage of its predominant  position in the IAEA, has reversed the DPRK-U.S. agreement, put  all manner of pressure on North Korea and worked to impair its  authority in the international arena and finally suffocate the  socialist system of this country.    The Zimbabwean Association for Solidarity and Friendship  with  Korea, the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Yemen and  the Secretariat of the Democratic Youth League of Ghana, too,  issued statements urging the United States to stop threatening  the DPRK.</p>

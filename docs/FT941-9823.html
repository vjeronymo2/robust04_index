			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Centrally set pay rise for NHS creates productivity paradox Sir, The government's pay rise for the National Health Service creates a productivity paradox with which hospitals are not yet equipped to deal. As the government has indicated, hospitals must increase productivity to pay for the pay rise ('PM concedes up to 3 per cent rises in public sector', February 4). Productivity will only be increased if there is some reward for doing so. Hospitals can only be rewarded if the more productive trusts get more money for being more productive. The source of this money is of course fund-holding GPs and regional purchasers, functioning in the 'internal' market. But the government will find it cannot rely on a market while it hands down pay increases from the centre. After all, wage rises should follow productivity gains, not precede them. Mortgaging someone else's future productivity increases (notably the NHS trusts') to pay for the centre's profligacy is bad policy. As the reforms originally intended, better to let trusts decide for themselves what pay they can afford to give out.

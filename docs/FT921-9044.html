			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Days lost by strikes in 1991 lowest on record FEWER DAYS were lost through strikes last year than in any year since records began 100 years ago, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of Employment. Provisional estimates put the loss at 800,000 days - the first time the figure has fallen below 1m since 1940 - compared with annual averages of 12.9m days in the 1970s and 7.2m days for the 1980s. The government is likely to use the figures during the election campaign as evidence of the effectiveness of its reform of union law and to support its claim that Labour would be unable to control the unions. In 1991, 177,000 workers were involved in a total of 354 stoppages compared with 298,000 engaged in 630 disputes in 1990. The provisional figure for stoppages in December, the latest monthly figure available, was 25 - the lowest for that month since 1932, when there were 21 stoppages. INVESTMENT by manufacturing industries in capital goods fell by 15 per cent last year compared with 1990, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Spending on vehicles suffered the biggest decline, down by 39 per cent from the previous year. Spending on plant and machinery fell 15 per cent and investment on new buildings fell 9 per cent. In the last quarter of last year capital expenditure was down 0.6 per cent compared with the previous three-month period. the value of investment in the fourth quarter of last year was Pounds 2.54bn at seasonally adjusted 1985 prices, compared with Pounds 2.96bn in the fourth quarter of 1990. Total capital expenditure last year was Pounds 10.27bn, compared with Pounds 12.14bn in 1990.</p>

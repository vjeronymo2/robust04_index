			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva April 9 TASS -- U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali met on Saturday Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs at his request to discuss Russian troops withdrawal and  guarantees of national minorities' rights in Latvia.    After the 45-minute meeting Birkavs told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that his visit to Geneva was caused by a "new  situation" called forth by the April 5 instruction by the  Russian president stipulating, in particular, creation of  military bases on Latvian territory. In his words, this  situation "has brought about an extremely high political  tension" and requires an "utterly new assessment and additional  international support". The Latvian prime minister believes  this document should be officially withdrawn "at the highest  level".    Birkavs gave to understand that the instruction had  complicated the signing of an agreement with Russia on troops  withdrawal. However, Latvia is ready to sign such an agreement,  he said.    According to Birkavs, Another subject for discussion during  the meeting with Butrus-Ghali was the "so-called violations of  human rights" in Latvia. "I would like to say that in its turn,  upon troops withdrawal, a law on citizenship which will take  into account many recommendations of the Council of Europe and  the CSCE high commissioner for national minorities will be  adopted", Birkavs said.</p>

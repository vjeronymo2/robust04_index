			<p>BFN     [Text] CIS heads of state signed a final package of  documents at their meeting in Moscow today. Its basis is a bloc  of economic agreements: on Ukraine's joining the economic union  as an associate member; on creating an economic union  commission; and on forming a free trade zone. In addition, a  declaration was approved on the observance of sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and the inviolability of Commonwealth  borders.    In an interview with our correspondent, President of  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Askar Akayev expressed satisfaction with  today's meeting between heads of state. In his view, the  meeting fulfilled its main task.    [Begin Akayev recording] First, it is the creation of a  permanently functioning committee. Or rather, the heads of  government introduced such an amendment--an economic commission  that will be located in Moscow and will monitor the  implementation of adopted agreements on trade and economic  cooperation. CIS bodies are at last appearing that could  develop in the future into an effective mechanism for  implementing agreements. [end recording]    Despite the fact that Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's  proposal to set up a Eurasian union was not examined today,  Akayev said that he wholly supports this idea.    [Begin Akayev recording] I see it as the foreseeable future  of our CIS. If the mechanisms for cooperation laid down by the  CIS are implemented to a significant extent, we will arrive at a  Eurasian union. [end recording]    For his part, Boris Yeltsin made special note of the  agreement signed in Moscow today on extending the term for CIS  peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, and also the joint statements  on the situation in Abkhazia and Nagornyy Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh]. The next session of heads of state will  take place on 9 September.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIANS FIGHT PRISON EXPANSION;  </P> <P> CAPITAL'S CRIMINALS UNWELCOME IN THE SUBURBS  </P> <P> Eighty years ago, federal officials told the District of Columbia to build its  new prison 20 miles outside the capital, in the rolling hills near Lorton, Va.  </P> <P> Today that prison is an unwanted neighbor in the suburbs that have grown up  around it. The overcrowded and antiquated complex is a source of anxiety to  residents of the area.  </P> <P> District officials say their efforts to ease problems at the Lorton corrections  complex have been blocked at every turn, and there's little they can do.  </P> <P> "We've lost control," said Charlie Peelie, one of the guards charged with  keeping order among the 8,600 inmates at Lorton. "It's just that there are too  many people here."  </P> <P> "We live on a powder keg," said Helen Thacker, who lives nearby. She said she  hopes her household alarm system and the heavy locks on her back yard gates  will protect her the next time a prisoner escapes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> D.C. Mayor's Lament  </P> <P> "Everybody wants everybody locked up, but not in their neighborhood," Marion  Barry Jr., the district mayor, said. "We have to do something."  </P> <P> But what?  </P> <P> Barry has proposed building a new prison inside the district and also expanding  Lorton. Preservationists are trying to block the proposed facility in the  district and Virginia officials, led by a congressman, are opposing expansion  of the prison.  </P> <P> All the while, conditions inside the 200-acre prison complex grow ever worse.  </P> <P> The facility is 1,400 prisoners over capacity and expects at least 4,000 more  inmates to be added by the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Men stand in line for hours at mealtime. Showers and toilets are too few and  recreational facilities are so scarce that some men sit around for lack of  anything better to do. Two men sleep in cells built for one.  </P> <P> "The inmates are very uncomfortable and tempers are short," a chaplain, the  Rev. Manning Moore, said. "There are men who are cursing for attention and  can't get it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inauguration Day Riot  </P> <P> One such eruption of tempers drew the nation's attention just hours after  President Bush was sworn in on Jan. 20. An inmate was stabbed to death, and  fires set by prisoners running amok destroyed two buildings.  </P> <P> No one escaped then, but 12 men got out last year and three of them are still  at large. One was convicted of manslaughter; the others were serving time for  first-degree murder.  </P> <P> Residents of Fairfax County, some of whom live within a block or two of the  prison, say they have seen escapees walking around their neighborhoods at  night.  </P> <P> Lisa Walker frets when her 5-year-old son goes outside to play. She hopes the  family Doberman pinscher will stand off any intruder.  </P> <P> "I have guns," she added, "and if I need to protect myself or my son, I'll do  it."  </P> <P> District officials say that such fears are unfounded, however.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escapees Go Home  </P> <P> "People in Fairfax County are so scared, but we have never had an incident in  Fairfax." Pat Wheeler of the Corrections Department said. Lorton escapees, she  said, "almost always go back to Southeast (quadrant of the district). If you  watch the homes of their family and friends long enough, you'll usually find  them."  </P> <P> The people of Fairfax, one of the wealthiest counties in the nation, wonder  about the prison's future, and so does the Barry administration. Barry has  proposed a $350-million, 10-year modernization of Lorton, along with expansion  of the district's halfway house program and building a second prison near the  jail in Southeast Washington.  </P> <P> The projects would add 3,525 beds to the 7,200 now considered the maximum at  Lorton.  </P> <P> Much of the district's program focuses on Lorton, where only 200 acres of the  2,000-acre site are in use. "The most appropriate place" for a new prison,  Wheeler said, "would be to build it in Virginia."  </P> <P> Wrong, says Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.), whose constituency includes the Lorton  area.  </P> <P> "The situation at Lorton reached crisis proportions a decade ago, and it has  continued to deteriorate," Parris said after the uprising in January.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prison Funds Denied  </P> <P> Last October, he succeeded in having Congress turn down the district's request  for $45 million to build an 800-bed addition at Lorton. Although the city  operates the prison, it is federal property and the government would have to  pay for any improvements.  </P> <P> "It's the only penal institution in the nation that's located outside the  political boundaries it's supposed to serve," Parris said.  </P> <P> "I think the penal requirements of the District of Columbia are best served by  the construction of a new and modern facility within the district . . . but,  like a sewage plant or a dump or anything else, nobody wants it in their  neighborhoods."  </P> <P> At least not those who live near the district jailhouse. They stalled the plan  by seeking historic designation for the chosen site.  </P> <P> Late last year, however, the capital's Historic Preservation Board rejected the  community group's arguments, and officials now hope to begin construction this  spring.  </P></p>

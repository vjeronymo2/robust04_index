			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "tk, CTK": "Ministry of Defense Will Prepare </F> Concept of Orders for Arms Manufacturers"]    [Text] Prague--The Ministry of Defense is to draw up  within six months a basic concept concerning future long-term  state orders for the arms industry, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  told journalists after the conclusion of a consultative meeting  of ministers yesterday, which was devoted to the state's  relationship with the arms industry. In its proposal, the  Ministry of Defense will determine which long-term orders  directly affect the country's ability to defend itself. The  state will then focus mainly on this area, and the  arms-industry's chances of obtaining such orders will look more  promising, Vaclav Klaus declared. The second group of  arms-industry items will be defined less precisely, and the  state's long-term approach to it will be much looser.    The state will not organize the export of arms production,  the prime minister declared further. It will only carefully  monitor the fairness of economic competition and compliance with  legislative regulations concerning production and exports.    Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that, once the program  for the Czech Army's reequipment has been drawn up, talks will  be initiated with Czech firms that will be able to participate  in the Army's reequipment. The process of reequipment will last  up to 10 years, according to Baudys.    The Army's reequipment would bring long-term state orders  for  a number of companies. As early as the late 1980's, for  example, the Ceska Zbrojovka [Czech Arms Factory] company in  Uhersky Brod started to develop a set of new-generation small  arms called Lada. The technical development and testing of the  weapon have been wound up, and the company is waiting only for a  state order. As representatives of Ceska Zbrojovka told  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, after the acquisition of the order, the  technical preparation for the production of the Lada set will  require three more years and investments of approximately 500  million korunas [Kc]. A state order would be worthwhile for the  Uhersky Brod arms factory and would also expand its export  potential. The company does not need it in order to survive,  however. It exports about 66 percent of its present production  to 46 states all over the world. The biggest importers of its  products are customers in Austria, the FRG, and the United  States. The aggregate revenues of Ceska Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod  a.s. reached Kc516 million last year. This year it expects to  take in Kc900 million; the projected profit for this year is  Kc105 million.</p>

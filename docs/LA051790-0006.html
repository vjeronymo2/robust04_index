			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS MAKE CUTS TO BALANCE BUDGET  </P> <P> The Fillmore Unified Board of Education is proposing to eliminate its  behind-the-wheel driver training program and cut other programs to balance its  budget.  </P> <P> School district officials trimmed $330,000 from various programs to come up  with a $12.8-million proposed budget, Assistant Supt.  </P> <P> Walter Weis III said.  </P> <P> By confining its driver education program to classroom instruction, the  district will save about $4,500, Weis said. One of the primary ways the  district trimmed the budget was to slow down its asbestos-removal program, he  said.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the board changed the attendance boundaries for  kindergarten pupils attending San Cayetano and Sespe elementary schools to  balance enrollment.  </P> <P> The switch is expected to affect about 40 students and was not opposed by  parents attending the meeting.  </P> <P> Students who live between Central Avenue and A Street will be moved to San  Cayetano in the fall.  </P> <P> The district has six schools and about 3,900 students.

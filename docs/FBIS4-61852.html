The rates of salary increase amounted to 132, 124 and 132  per  cent correspondingly as compared to the fourth quarter of 1993,  sources at the Russian Ministry of Economy told BUSINESS-TASS  here today.    An average monthly salary in the gas industry was 666,000  rubles (361 U.S. dollars) in March 1994 against the general  background of 169,000 rubles (92 U.S. dollars), 416,000 rubles  (226 U.S. dollars) in the oil-extracting industry, 367,000  rubles (199 U.S. dollars) in the mining industry, 122,000 rubles  (66 U.S. dollars) in the machine-building, and some 100,000 (54  U.S. dollars) in the light industry.

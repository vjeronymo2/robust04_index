			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cummins underlines return to profitability CUMMINS Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday underscored its return to profitability by turning in third-quarter net income of Dollars 17.6m, or 90 cents a share, including a one-time gain of Dollars 3.6m. A year earlier, Cummins suffered a net loss of Dollars 11.8m, or 94 cents. Sales advanced 6 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 903.6m from Dollars 850.9m. Cummins' balance sheet has improved steadily this year, thanks to its cost-cutting efforts and to a revival in key markets. For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 48.6m, or Dollars 2.60, on sales of Dollars 2.73bn, compared with a net loss of Dollars 11.8m, or Dollars 1.20, on sales of Dollars 2.54bn in the same period of 1991. Mr Henry Schacht, chairman, said: 'The company's third-quarter results were achieved despite economic uncertainty and seasonal shutdowns by our major customers.' Earnings had benefit-ed from cost-cutting, he added.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> The Harp Inn, 130 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-8855. A bar without pretense  for people who'd rather get poked in the eye than take a drink in some place  like Irvine.  </P> <P> They have OK Irish music here on the weekends; occasionally an exuberant patron  takes the stage about closing time to work out on a Celtic folk song or two.  Plus which, they put out a happy hour spread of Ritz crackers and tuna fish.  </P></p>

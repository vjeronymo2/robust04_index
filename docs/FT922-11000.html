			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Recruits to accountancy fall to a 5-year low THE NUMBER of students entering the accountancy profession fell to its lowest level for five years last year, but the quality of those remaining has continued to rise, according to statistics released by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. There were 6,391 students entering the profession in the year to July, compared with 7,063 in the previous 12 months. Most still go to the largest accountancy firms. Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training at the institute, said he expected numbers to fall further. The proportion of entrants with first-class or upper-second-class degrees has risen from 45 per cent in 1985 to 55 per cent last year. Pass rates for the PE1 professional exams averaged 81 per cent, and 90 per cent for PE2, of which 57 per cent succeeded on their first attempt. The median starting salary for a graduate in chartered accountancy in London was Pounds 12,500 last year, and Pounds 9,500 elsewhere in the country. Only 11 per cent of the intake is non-graduate. A fifth of the total comprises graduates with relevant degrees, principally in accountancy. Other common degrees for those entering the profession are business, science, maths and engineering. The proportion of women in the student intake rose by 0.1 per cent to 35.9 per cent. The proportion of individuals of non-European ethnic origin was 14 per cent. The median age at entry was 23, with 16 per cent joining after the age of 25. There were 15,730 trainee accountants in March, of whom 61 per cent were in firms with more than 101 partners.</p>

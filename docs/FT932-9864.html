			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Car sales 'may be below 1980s levels until next century' CAR SALES in Britain will not bounce back to the 1980s boom levels until the next century, a report issued yesterday by the Henley Centre for Forecasting says. Although the number of drivers is expected to grow customers' attitudes to car purchases have changed significantly during the recession. The report says drivers are now accepting lower status or second-hand cars, and waiting 15 per cent longer before buying a new car. 'Customers are cannier now,' said Mr Jon Francis, of the Henley Institute, which carried out the study for the car retailing and leasing company Lex Service. He said that in addition to the impact of the recession, improvements in car manufacturing had allowed drivers to use their cars for longer. The report predicts that car sales will increase by 10 per cent this year and grow from 1.59m in 1992 to more than 2m by 1997 - about 250,000 below the 1989 level. Barring any significant tax changes, the company car market is expected to grow by 27 per cent in the next five years, with a 3 per cent fall in the number of sales representatives but growth in the proportion of skilled managers. At the same time the proportion of women company drivers is expected to grow by 9 per cent to 37 per cent by 2000, prompting shifts in marketing and servicing styles. The report predicts that Britain's drivers will own an extra 1.4m cars by 1994, as increasing numbers of people pass their driving tests and car-based jobs become more prevalent. But the report also notes, that with customers expected to buy more second-hand cars, prices in the used-car market could fluctuate rapidly  - although the late 1980s boom has created a glut of four-to-six-year-old cars, the recession has also sharply reduced the number of one-to-three-year-old cars available. The report adds that customers will increasingly prefer to use 'brand' name outlets to service their cars. It says customers have been increasingly spurning the type of 'high status' cars that were popular during the boom of the late 1980s.</p>

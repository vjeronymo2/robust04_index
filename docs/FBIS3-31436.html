Only two days later, a car accident occurred in  which Liviu Luca was seriously injured, while the "offender,"  SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] Lieutenant Colonel Ion  Buica, died. Although the interview, which was granted  confidentially in Mr. Luca's office, was published only on  Monday, 14 February 1994, by TINERETUL LIBER, we ask ourselves  to what extent his bold statements and the accident that was  caused by a SRI officer were just an ordinary coincidence.</p>

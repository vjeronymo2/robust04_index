			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pentland acquires Reusch Pentland yesterday made a small dent in its Pounds 185m cash pile with the acquisition for up to Pounds 20m of a German sports goods company. The group is paying DM30m (Pounds 12m) for Karl Reusch Handschufabrik, which markets, licenses and manufactures specialist sports clothing and equipment. A further DM20m will be paid in 2000 if Reusch meets profits targets between 1997 and 1999. Reusch is perhaps best known for its goalkeeping gloves. Pentland estimates that 75 per cent of the goalkeepers at the World Cup this month will be wearing Reusch gloves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The Korea high-speed  rail construction authority has agreed to pay 2,101.6 million  U.S. dollars to Gec Alsthom in return for the Anglo-French  consortium's supply of trainsets and technology in connection  with the multi- billion-dollar Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway  project.    The authority said Monday it will use the trainsets, related  equipment and overall control system of Gec Alsthom's "train a  grand vitesse" (high-speed train) on the 430.7-kilometer  Seoul-Pusan line.    Under the agreement, the French company is also supposed to  transfer TGV construction technology to South Korean companies  -- Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., Daewoo Heavy Industries  Co. and Hanjin Heavy Industries Co.    Pak Yu-kwang, president of the Korea high-speed rail  construction authority, said a contract will be drawn up soon  paying Gec Alsthom 6,009.5 million French francs for trains made  by the French company and 1,069.8 million dollars for those made  by South Korean firms.    The price was about 270 million dollars lower than Gec  Alsthom had suggested last July.    The financing will come from France's export and  export-related funds, carrying the condition of repayment in 10  years with an eight-year grace period.    The South Korean authority and France's Banque Indosuez are  discussing other details of redemption such as interest rates,  Pak said. The agreement enables the South Korean authority and  Gec Alsthom to embark on the Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway  construction project, which is expected to finish by 2002. The  authority sent a report on the agreement to the Transportation  Ministry Monday and is awaiting government approval. The  ministry will approve the agreement after consultations with the  government committee on high- speed rail construction and  President Kim Yong-sam before the authority draws up the final  contract with Gec Alsthom in May, Pak said.    To ensure the TGV's performance and transfer of all  technology, South Korean manufacturers and the authority will  jointly participate in the TGV construction from the design  stage, according to Pak. The TGV should be given the  international quality control standard "ISO-9000" series and Gec  Alsthom will help the South Korean firms secure the ISO  standards, according to the agreement.    The authority and Gec Alsthom will cooperate to wind up all  technology transfers by the year 2002 so that South Korean  businesses can make TGV trains on their own from then on. The  South Korean companies will secure the intellectual property  rights for the transferred technology, and they are supposed to  give 2 percent of the selling price for 12 and a half years from  the contract day if they make deals to transfer the TGV  technology to third countries.    The TGV will begin service between Seoul and Taejon from the  year 2000 and run between Seoul-Pusan line from 2002. Meanwhile,  the TGV's top speed on the Seoul-Pusan line will be 300  kilometers per hour, according to the authority.</p>

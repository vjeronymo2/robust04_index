			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Travel: Sedate, but so scenic - Skiing THERE are certain parts of the Engadine that look, smell and feel so utterly and permanently Swiss that you feel they must have been like that when the Romans were still wandering the valleys. Take Pontresina, where you suspect that nothing much has happened since the Bernina electric railway from St Moritz arrived in 1904. Sedate. That is the word. And with its narrow main street hemmed-in by historic buildings with turrets, spires and painted facades, Pontresina is also inordinately pretty. On one of those perfect, cloudless blue days in the mountains, with snow blanketing the countryside and muffling all sounds, you do not even need to spend money on a lift pass to enjoy a blissful day. Pontresina is famous for its superb cross-country skiing: there are 60 km of trails in the resort and 90 nearby. Indeed, the village is so pre-occupied with cross-country that Club Med makes a point in its brochure of stating: 'As we specialise particularly in cross-country in this village, there is a small supplement for skiers wishing to practise downhill skiing.' But Pontresina also has some of the best and most scenic downhill slopes in the region, which it shares with St Moritz. Piz Lagalb has some really testing runs, including a magnificent and very long semi-off-piste black run which can be a dream in fresh powder or a severe challenge after the formation of giant moguls. There are exquisite views from the Diovalezza glacier, as well as excellent long runs for intermediates; some notable off-piste terrain back to the bottom of the cable car; and a breathtaking but technically simple descent down the glacier to Morteratsch. Although only three miles from St Moritz, Pontresina - set snugly, and perhaps a touch smugly, in a picturesque and sheltered valley - is just far enough away to preserve an aloof distance from its illustrious neighbour. 'Many traditionalists return annually to the great comfort and considerable charm of Pontresina hotels, and appreciate being at a distance from the glitter and hubbub of St Moritz,' reports the Good Skiing Guide. The Volvo Ski Guide makes the same point but adds that there is plenty of nightlife, nevertheless. Indeed, Club Med prides itself on providing most of the activities you might require, in-house. Each of the club's 22 ski villages - mainly in France and Switzerland - has its own ski and boot hire shops as well as boutiques selling ski-wear, plus fully-qualified instructors. In Pontresina, Club Med operates the Schloss and Park hotels, which are in the heart of the cross-country area and linked by a bridge with the village. There are three restaurants and a disco and Club Med's gentil organisateurs provide and organise live entertainment every night. My first reactions to Club Med's attempts to entertain me some years ago, in Senegal, were uneasy, especially when asked to join in the nightly sing-song with hand signals. But the fault was mine. Either you resist and look miserably foolish or you join in cheerfully and still look foolish - but happy. You don't have to attend the entertainment at all, of course. Indeed, this year Club Med has a new policy of making sure no-one feels under pressure to do anything they do not want to. Arnold Wilson was a guest of Club Med (106-110 Brompton Road, London SW3; reservations, tel: 071-581-1161). Prices for a week, including flight and all meals, are from Pounds 540 to Pounds 745; for a fortnight, Pounds 940-Pounds 1,297.</p>

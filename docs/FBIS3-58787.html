Mr. Stich said in a newspaper interview that he  thought Mr. 'Arafat's visit to Bern was a good idea and was in  line with Switzerland's promised support for Palestinians in the  Israeli-occupied territories. He pointed out that Mr. 'Arafat  had now renounced violence, and it was important for Switzerland  to be briefed on developments in the Middle East peace process.  During his first official visit to Bern, Mr. 'Arafat will meet  Mr. Stich and the Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Chernomyrdin backs Yeltsin Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has denied any presidential aspirations of his own in the 1996 elections. 'Now is not the right time to change president,' he said. He also warned of new political tensions this winter, but ruled out further 'bloody upheavals'. Speaking on German television, he voiced concern about future unemployment and food supplies, but did not predict a repeat of last October's armed rebellion. 'We have extremists who think their purpose in life is to demonstrate and shout in the city squares,' Mr Chernomyrdin said, but conveyed his 'belief in the Russian people'. He acknowledged that a recent presidential anti-crime decree giving police greater powers against organised crime was unconstitutional, but said it was essential under current circumstances, 'even if it infringes the rules of our constitution'.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Mad Love (Showtime Wednesday at 10 a.m.): The great pioneer cameraman Karl  Freund turned director in this stylish 1935 version of "The Hands of Orlac."  Peter Lorre stars. (1:10)  </P> <P> The Shooting (TBS Wednesday at 7:45 p.m.): Monte Hellman's 1967 existentialist  Western, starring Jack Nicholson and written by Adrien Joyce (who later wrote  "Five Easy Pieces"), stars Millie Perkins as an imperious woman demanding  Warren Oates to escort her across a vast desert for a price; Nicholson is a  mysterious man in black leather on their trail. The film can be taken as an  allegory or a suspense drama -- or both. (1:45)  </P> <P> The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (TNT Thursday at 12:20 a.m.): MGM's all-star revue  was designed to show that its contract players not only could talk but in some  instances could also sing! A genuine collector's item. (2:40)  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (13): The latest trendy theories on test - A one-eyed guru with some hand-me-down psychology can be king / Management studies 'IN SEARCH OF MANAGEMENT: CULTURE, CHAOS AND CONTROL IN MANAGERIAL WORK' by Tony J. Watson, Routledge, Pounds 12.99, 242 pages Theories such as Tom Peters' 'thriving on chaos' are now so orthodox that one forgets how recently the revolution in management studies took place. Henri Fayol's mid-century classic urging would-be managers 'to organise, to command, to co-ordinate and control' was still widely taught in the late 1970s. What finally undermined Fayol's view was a series of case studies which substituted the opportunistic empowerer for the rational planner as a more true-to-life image of management. It is all to the good, then, that in this new book, Tony Watson, a management professor at Nottingham Business School, tests the latest trendy management theories on the factory floor once again - not in a high-powered company renowned for excellence, but in a 'typical' UK manufacturing company. Watson tries to make his corporate guinea-pig anonymous, but it is easy to identify that 'ZTC Ryland' is GPT (GEC Plessey Telecommunications), the telecoms equipment manufacturer previously owned 50-50 by 'SEC' (GEC) and 'Parry' (Plessey), and then, after the 1991 takeover of 'Parry', 60-40 by 'SEC' and the European electronics giant 'Siegfried' (Siemens). Watson spends his year among GPT's middle management shortly after the GEC-Siemens takeover. At that time, GPT was a weak international player with an over-reliance upon a single customer, BT, and a single product (Systems X digital exchanges), which was in decline. Plessey had initiated an expensive empowerment programme for management but this soon foundered amid fears about job security under SEC's notorious cost-cutting regime. Many of the views Watson canvasses support his opinion that the best managers think strategically about the long-term viability of the business; get closer to the customer; re-design GPT's over-engineered products; and re-think the deadline mentality which piles up redundant inventory. Only one, lone, middle-management voice recommends wide-scale redundancies, a key factor in GPT's subsequent improvement in productivity. For all this, though, Watson's book fails. In the half-blind world of management lore, the one-eyed guru with some hand-me-down psychology and a well-turned phrase is often king. If Watson had spent more time examining the new products and new markets which GPT needed to develop, and less time spouting Marx and Weber in the works canteen, we would have got a better idea of the longer-term viability of the business. In fact, the success of SEC's investment in GPT seems to have surprised even Lord Weinstock himself, who no longer talks about selling out of the business as he once did. Upgrade and replacement work to Systems X in the UK has held up well, new products have been developed, particularly in payphones and cards, while its traditional exchange products have found new markets in the emerging world. The benefits of market size, product transfer and global opportunities which GEC brought to GPT suggests Watson should have focused his attention far more upon the senior management culture within the combined GEC-GPT. He spares the new managing director, only a few months into his job in any case, barely a half-page interview. Part of the problem is that Watson's time with the company occurred during a period of maximum uncertainty about its future. As a postscript to the book, one wishes Watson could revisit GPT today and see how the improvements have come about. He might find that, while middle managers easily empower themselves among Californian start-ups, in a global telecommunications company a little rational planning from on high does not come amiss. Shorn of this perspective, one's impression is that Watson ends up talking to the wrong people, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.</p>

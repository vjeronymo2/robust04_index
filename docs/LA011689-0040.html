			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> As more Nicaraguan refugees pour into Miami from Texas, a pregnant woman housed  at the Bobby Maduro Stadium was said by hospital officials to be suffering from  chicken pox, prompting fear she may have unknowingly spread the disease among  others. Celia Gutierrez, a Nicaraguan refugee in her ninth month of pregnancy,  was allowed into the stadium -- which already holds 263 refugees -- because of  her advanced pregnancy, authorities said. The migration of Nicaraguans from  Texas was sparked when a federal judge ruled Jan. 12 that the Immigration and  Naturalization Service could not require the refugees to stay in Brownsville  while their applications for political asylum were being processed there. Since  the ruling, about 700 Nicaraguan refugees have arrived in Miami by bus.  </P></p>

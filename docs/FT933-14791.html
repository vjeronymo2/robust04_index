			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Pay rises well above inflation reported SOME EMPLOYERS are continuing to offer pay rises more than three times the 1.3 per cent rate of inflation according to the latest pay bulletin from Incomes Data Services. The most dramatic increase in recent weeks was at the Halifax Building Society where performance rises ranged between zero and 8.25 per cent for 18,000 staff. The society said a 'tiny minority' of staff would receive 8.25 per cent. An average performer at mid-point in the salary range would receive a 3 per cent rise, compared with 5.5 per cent last year. Other substantial rises include: 5.5 per cent for 430 workers at Pilkington Insulation's fibreglass works in St Helens, Merseyside, after a 12 month freeze; an increase of 5.5 per cent at electronics company National Semiconductor in Greenock, Strathclyde; and a 4 per cent rise after a pay freeze at Manchester bus company GM Buses. According to the Engineering Employers' Federation, however, engineering industry pay settlements are continuing to fall to an average of 2.09 per cent in the three months from April to June. Meanwhile the Yorkshire and Humberside regional council of the Trades Union Congress said yesterday that low pay settlements were slowing recovery and reducing living standards. Mr Paul Jagger, TUC regional secretary, told a meeting with members of the Confederation of British Industry in Leeds: 'A successful economy must be based on equal sharing of the benefits of growth. Any attempt at creating growth on the back of low wages is doomed to failure in the long run.' Yorkshire and Humberside region has reported a series of low pay settlements in the private sector this year, particularly among engineering employers in South Yorkshire, where most recent awards have been under 2 per cent, and one in five workforces have accepted pay freezes. In March about 20,000 people employed by Sheffield City Council voted for a 3.25 per cent pay cut to avert 1,400 redundancies and balance the city's budget. Mr Jagger said: 'The general view that low wages equal a successful economy is a policy we reject, as it simply produces not only low pay but also low-skilled jobs in the longer run.' The TUC is also worried that training is suffering. Mr Jagger called on the government to stimulate recovery with tax incentives, particularly to encourage training. British Nuclear Fuels is offering staff up to four years' pay to leave the company by June next year, according to the latest issue of the magazine Personnel Today. BNFL hopes to tempt large numbers of its 8,000 white-collar workers. Pay bulletin details from: Incomes Data Services, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

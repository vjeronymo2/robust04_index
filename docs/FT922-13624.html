			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME warns again on zinc supply AS CONSUMERS protested yesterday that the London Metal Exchange's zinc market was out of touch with reality, the LME board issued its second warning this year that it was closely monitoring the growing zinc supply tightness. It did so after the LME price for zinc for immediate delivery rose above the three-month price - or moved into backwardation, to use the traders' jargon. Zinc prices have risen from Dollars 987 a tonne in late October - the lowest since the special high grade zinc contract was launched - to a 14-month high of Dollars 1,285 last week, in spite of LME stocks in that time moving up from about 150,000 tonnes to a record 222,800 tonnes. In a note to traders yesterday the LME board said: 'The exchange has at its disposal a variety of courses of action which would be introduced should circumstances dictate the necessity of such actions.' After this warning the backwardation, which on Wednesday was Dollars 12 a tonne, eased to Dollars 8.50 at yesterday's close. Mr Martin Abbott, director of marketing, described LME's latest move as 'a warning shot across the bows of anyone who might be thinking of playing any games in the zinc market.' However, Mr Malcolm Widdows, managing director of Brock Metals, a British West Midlands company best known as a supplier of zinc alloys to the motor industry, suggested: 'The market is too open to manipulation. The LME doesn't like that word used, so let's say its too open to influence.' He said the fact that the zinc price in the past few months had gone up in spite of relatively weak demand and visibly high stocks was very frustrating for consumers and likely to drive some into using a different metal when that was possible. 'I'm very unhappy and my customers hate it,' he added. Mr Widdows suggested that 'some clever person might have worked out that it pays to hold the majority of the zinc warrants and lend them out to cover shorts at better returns than bank rate'. (Shorts are those who have sold metal they do not own in the expectation they can buy it later at a lower price). Mr Widdows pointed out that the LME encouraged metal consumers to use the market to smooth out peaks and troughs in prices. 'But how are consumers to know when these shenanigans are going to go on. If a consumer covers during one of these peaks and the price then drops like a stone, it puts that consumer at a disadvantage to competitors.' Brock also processes aluminium and Mr Widdows said that the zinc market's performance was a dire warning of what might happen should a secondary (scrap) aluminium contract be added to the LME's list. There were various market rumours yesterday about the cause of the supply tightness. One company mentioned, Barclays Metals, said that, far from squeezing the market, it had always provided liquidity to the market if it was required - provided it had the metal. If the LME board decides there is danger of a disorderly market, it is legally obliged to take action to put matters right. In extreme circumstances in the past it has put an upper limit on the premium that can be charged to borrow metal (buy spot and sell forward) for a day.</p>

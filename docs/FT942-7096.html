			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Failure in steel crisis undermines Van Miert Once he was acclaimed as the rising star of the European Commission. But less than a week after his surprise announcement that the Commission's 18-month-old rescue plan for the steel industry was 'dead', questions are mounting about the political judgment of Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian commissioner responsible for competition policy. Senior officials and fellow commissioners are confused by Mr Van Miert's decision to wash his hands of the steel crisis, and irritated that he remains unwilling to consider a new compromise. In Brussels yesterday, Mr Van Miert offered little hint that he is ready to resume his role as co-architect of the steel plan, along with Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner. Privately, he is said to be still fuming over his defeat at a meeting of the Commission last Wednesday. Insiders say there were few signs of trouble when Mr Van Miert started with an appeal to allow the Italian government to provide state aid for the restructuring of the privately-owned Bresciani steel mills in northern Italy. In his view, the Italian reductions were the last hope of approaching the rescue plan's target of a 19m tonne cut in capacity. However, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator and a former competition commmissioner, said that the deal would be difficult to reconcile with European law. A second significant intervention came from Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the German budget commissioner. Mr Schmidhuber, a lawyer who usually votes with Mr Van Miert on competition matters, asked questions over Italian government funding, which Mr Van Miert was unable to answer. The competition commissioner was outvoted 11-4. What followed was either a tantrum or a tactic aimed at pressuring industry to come up with fresh cuts in capacity. 'The plan is dead,' Mr Van Miert declared, 'it is obvious we are not going to get near the target. But don't blame us. We tried.' In retrospect, officials say Mr Van Miert made several errors. First, he underestimated the legal difficulties of the Italian case, while overestimating how far he could push his (often successful) pragmatic approach to competition policy. Second, he (and Mr Bangemann) failed to grasp the risks of a high-profile Commission intervention to tackle the steel industry crisis. Third, Mr Van Miert may have not been flexible enough about the 19m capacity target. Some officials believe that an improving steel market may have rendered the figure obsolete - particularly in the light of the private sector's continued reservations about the rescue plan. On the other hand, any move to abandon the 19m target would call into question the entire plan. What is to be done? One approach would be to proceed under Article 95 of the European Steel and Coal treaty which would allow state subsidies to be paid to companies. But this would require unanimous support from the Council of Ministers, a long process with a dubious outcome. Whether Mr Van Miert changes course once again will depend on his own state of mind. Colleagues say they are baffled by his recent outburst, though one explanation is that he fears Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, will succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the next European Commission  -an appointment which would cost him his job.</p>

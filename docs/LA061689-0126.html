			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERBER TO LAUNCH INFANT FORMULA IN AD CAMPAIGN AIMED AT PARENTS  </P> <P> Baby foods maker Gerber Products said Thursday that it has teamed up with the  pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers to introduce an infant formula that will be  advertised directly to parents -- a controversial strategy opposed by a  pediatricians' group.  </P> <P> Most infant formulas are advertised only to medical professionals under  guidelines approved by advocates of breast-feeding and the powerful American  Academy of Pediatrics, which on Thursday voiced its opposition to the Gerber  plan.  </P> <P> The groups say that advertising directly to mothers may discourage  breast-feeding, and last year, the academy and others opposed a similar  marketing method that Los Angeles-based Carnation Co. used to market a new  formula product.  </P> <P> Dr. Birt Harvey, the academy's president-elect, said a mother's decision to  breast- or bottle-feed "shouldn't be influenced by commercial advertising by  one product or another. You are dealing with babies, not with soap products or  automobiles." Medical professionals say that breast milk is the most healthful  food for infants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stand-Off With Doctors  </P> <P> "We didn't expect them to change their position," said Steven W. Poole,  spokesman for Gerber, whose representatives met with officials of the  pediatricians' group to review the product and the marketing strategy. "The  academy's position, we believe, doesn't give consumer-mothers enough credit  about being well informed about breast-feeding."  </P> <P> Television and print advertising for the Gerber formula, which is to be  available nationwide in October, will "emphasize that breast-feeding should be  the first choice for mothers," Poole said.  </P> <P> Gerber says direct advertising for its product is needed if it is to make  inroads into the highly competitive infant formula market. Gerber made its own  formula in the 1950s and 1960s, before abandoning the business to the  pharmaceutical companies, which now claim most of the $1.5 billion in annual  formula sales.  </P> <P> The Gerber product will be made by Bristol-Myers, which makes infant formulas  Enfamil and ProSobee. In the 1970s, Bristol-Myers was forced to stop  advertising its formulas in baby-care magazines, under pressure from the  pediatricians' organization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Milk-Based Recipe  </P> <P> The new Gerber product is actually a milk-based formula that Bristol-Myers  manufactured until 1983, when it switched to a whey-based mixture.  </P> <P> Bristol-Myers also will promote the Gerber formula through its sales personnel  who call on doctors, said Poole.  </P> <P> The partnership between the two firms surprised some industry analysts.  </P> <P> "From Gerber's standpoint, it's a lower-risk way to play it," John M. McMillin,  a food industry analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said. "But what happens  if it starts to cannibalize (Bristol-Myers') existing business?"  </P> <P> "We're looking to increase total market share through this venture," said David  Dubber of Bristol-Myers, which claims about 35% of the market. "Today, more  consumers are taking a more active role in forming a selection and the Gerber  infant formulas will react to that decision."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Their Method'  </P> <P> Dubber said that Bristol-Myers has no plan to begin advertising its own infant  formula products directly to consumers. "It's just their method of marketing  and distribution," Dubber said of Gerber's strategy.  </P> <P> Industry leader Abbott Laboratories, which makes Similac, said it will continue  to refrain from direct advertising.  </P> <P> Carnation Co., also under pressure from the Academy, dropped its name and that  of its Good Start and Good Nature products from its infant product advertising.  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Domestic site likely for Mercedes plant GERMANY is emerging ahead of Britain, France and the Czech Republic as the most likely location for a new plant to assemble Mercedes-Benz' planned small car. The decision hinges on negotiations with unions on labour changes to reduce costs at the plant. Mr Dieter Zetsche, product development director of Mercedes-Benz car division, said a decision would be made before the end of the year. The favourite site is at Rastatt in south-west Germany, where the company already carries out some final assembly of its E-Class executive and luxury cars. However, other sites in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are being investigated through the London office of management consultants Arthur D Little. Mr Zetsche said building the plant at an existing site was the favoured option as this would be cheaper, although the unions would have to agree to meet the necessary cost targets. 'If we were to locate it in Germany, it would most probably be in Rastatt, where we have a huge site.' A decision to go ahead with the car, which would be smaller than a Volkswagen Golf or a Ford Escort, is expected in the next two months. The plant would have a capacity for 200,000 cars a year. German unions are anxious to keep the small car plant in the country to help offset the loss of 37,400 jobs in Germany that Mercedes is eliminating the three years from 1992 to 1994. The company has recently announced that it is to build a Dollars 300m assembly plant in Alabama in the US to produce up to 60,000 four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles a year from 1997. It will also start production late next year of a multi-purpose vehicle in Spain.</p>

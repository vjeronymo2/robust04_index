Academician Gennadiy Voronin, Deputy Chairman of the Russian  Federation State Committee for the Defense Industry, on the  Approaching Demise of the Russian Navy"]    [Text] [Chernyak] Gennadiy Petrovich, what prompted you  to contact the paper?    [Voronin] The dire state of the Russian Navy on the  threshold of its 300th anniversary. Battleworthy ships are  leaving the Russian Federation Navy in droves -- the Soviet Navy  never experienced losses of this kind in its entire history,  either in peacetime or even in wartime. Aircraft carrier losses  are particularly serious. Of the five aircraft-carrying  cruisers which were recently built and which are not even  halfway through their scheduled lifetime, only two now remain.  Moreover, the fate of one of them is predetermined.    The warship building program between now and the year 2003  does not provide for the construction of any aircraft carriers.  Moreover, the scientific and industrial projects on aircraft  carrier construction are no longer functioning and they could  begin to be irrevocably destroyed in the very near future.  Unless urgent measures are adopted, it will take us decades to  reach the level we were at in the late eighties and early  nineties.    [Chernyak] But the West can still afford to build aircraft  carriers -- it has lots of money. It is too expensive for  Russia....    [Voronin] It has been the popular view in recent years:  Aircraft-carrying ships are allegedly not necessary, because  they are "expensive," "ineffective," and "aggressive." But, as  a rule, these "justifications" are not confirmed by the  calculations. Evidently, their authors believe that bald  pronouncements, with an apparent military-analytical flavor, are  enough for the general public. I will tell you that the first  aircraft-carrying cruiser, the Kiev, which we built in  1970-1975, cost the country less than 270 million rubles [R] at  1975 prices, and counting the aircraft complement -- R320  million. The heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov,  with its complement of ultramodern fighters, cost no more than  R850-990 million at 1990 prices. Compare that with the cost of  a Nimitz-class U.S. Navy aircraft carrier -- $3.038 billion. At  the same time, the inclusion of heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers  in naval groupings makes them 1.5-2 times more effective. In  other words, the effective strength of fleets has to be doubled  in order to achieve the same results without heavy  aircraft-carrying cruisers. If one is talking about the value  of the naval forces and various onshore facilities remaining  intact in the first two-three weeks of conventional combat  actions, it would far exceed the amount spent on the creation  and upkeep of aircraft carriers.    [Chernyak] But there is an "alternative" path -- deployment  of shore-based fighter aircraft in addition to those in the air  defense system....    [Voronin] It would only be partial cover: The range of  shore-based aircraft and the amount of time they can spend in  areas where our naval forces require cover is limited, since  mankind has yet to invent an aircraft that can continue flying  indefinitely and has not raised a generation of pilots capable  of being at the controls for days on end. Indeed, what is  needed is further supplies of aircraft and the creation, often  in remote areas, of basing systems and all types of support and  maintenance for newly formed aircraft units (at least 15 fighter  regiments per fleet). So expenditure on the implementatiom of  this alternative would not compare (we are talking about tens of  times as much) with expenditure on the creation of heavy  aircraft-carrying cruisers.    [Chernyak] What about the aggressive nature of aircraft  carriers -- after all, what we have is a defensive doctrine...    [Voronin] But the Soviet doctrine never envisaged waging  combat actions in theaters overseas. Therefore, the idea of  creating attack aircraft carriers was not developed here. Our  Navy's aircraft-carrying ships have always been built as the  main means of protecting their forces and facilities and this  construction has always been for defensive purposes.    [Chernyak] Whom do you intend to defend yourself against --  indeed, according to the military doctrine, Russia has no  enemies.    [Voronin] Let us look at the military doctrines and tasks  facing the Western countries' navies. The U.S. military  doctrine is based on such tenets as, for example, "U.S. world  hegemony is to be achieved" and "the main opponent is the CIS  and Third World countries." Hence the maritime strategy whereby  the U.S. Navy must be capable of posing a nuclear missile threat  along the perimeter of the CIS countries, destroying CIS and  Third World countries' armed forces groupings in their entire  operational depth, blockading the CIS Navy off its own coast,  and preventing it from deploying on ocean routes.    [Chernyak] But the United States now has a new maritime  strategy....    [Voronin] It does not identify a new opponent, but assumes  that the United States now has undoubted supremacy at sea, based  on an assessment of the state of the Russian Navy. The concept  of fighting the Navy of the former USSR on the ocean is replaced  by the concept of using the U.S. Navy in maritime areas  adjoining our coast and waging combat actions in conjunction  with the Army and Air Force in order to gain supremacy on dry  land.    So we, Russia, remain the chief opponent. You can judge for  yourselves whether we need aircraft carriers when our new  "partners" have that kind of doctrine. Not to mention the fact  that the U.S., British, and French Navies have aircraft carriers  with offensive weapons -- attack aircraft.    [Chernyak] What is the situation in the United States  regarding aircraft carriers?    [Voronin] They are continuing to build mighty ships such as  Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. They are  large-displacement (90,000-100,000 tonnes) ships, carrying some  90 aircraft. Their main purpose is to deal heavy blows to enemy  territory and armed forces, using their aircraft. Special  escort forces have been set up to support aircraft carriers'  combat activities, because they are used in carrier battle  groups or multipurpose carrier groups -- 8-10 cruisers anmd  destroyers per carrier. There are 15 of these groups in the  U.S. Navy. This number will diminish somewhat by 2000, but  there will then be eight nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and  construction is planned to continue. Moreover, the Americans  are not scrapping the aircraft carriers they withdraw from  combat service, but they are transferring them to the reserve,  keeping around 60 percent of the maintenance personnel (for  example, the aircraft carrier Lexington, withdrawn from combat  service in 1991, and the Midway, withdrawn in 1992, are being  held in reserve and have not been sent for scrap).    We know also that a blueprint has been drawn up for future  aircraft-carrying ships in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal,  where ships of limited displacement of betweeen 8,000 and 20,000  tonnes are planned (in Spain one has been built). Even a small  country like Thailand has ordered a Principe de Asturias-class  aircraft-carrying ship from Spain....    [Chernyak] What are you proposing?    [Voronin] We do not consider it possible today, indeed we  are incapable of building aircraft carriers like the Admiral  Kuznetsov -- it is very expensive and, in fact, the main base is  now in Ukraine. But in order to ensure that the Russian  Federation Navy does not lose the potential to provide air cover  for its forces at sea, it would be entirely acceptable to decide  to build small aircraft carriers of comparatively small  displacement (12,000-15,000 tonnes). We have the potential to  do this at the moment -- the specialists, designers, and  shipbuilding capacities are still available. We could even make  them for sale abroad -- more and more countries, including Third  World countries, are showing an interest in ships of this class.  All this would considerably facilitate the task of of equipping  our Navy with aircraft carriers, if only three or four per  fleet, primarily for the Northern and Pacific Fleets.    [Chernyak] Not a bad idea : It would be no worse than the  arms race in terms of ruining us....    [Voronin] It is not a matter of building 10 aircraft  carriers quickly. We favor a methodical, deliberate, and  consistent continuation (without stopping and starting) of the  construction of aircraft-carrying cruisers, but at Russian  shipyards. Personally, I think it is time to immediately launch  a state order for the planning of small aircraft-carrying ships:  It would enable us to retain the development collective and  start preparing for the construction of a series of aircraft  carriers in St. Petersburg and Severodvinsk, with an export  version in mind (countries with nonglobal economies would be  able to afford them). It must be borne in mind that only three  or four countries would be able to afford to develop  aircraft-carrying ships of this class. But if we waste time,  even according to the authors of "Jane's Fighting Ships  1993-1994," "there is a danger of the drift or even collapse of  the whole Russian shipbuilding industry."    I think it would be advisable also for the Russian  Federation  Defense Ministry to review the way it thinks about the Navy.</p>

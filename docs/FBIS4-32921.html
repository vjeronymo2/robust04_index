			<p>BFN     [Text] (DYN) -- The President of the Radical Party bloc of  deputies Raul Galvan yesterday [26 May] lashed out at U.S.  Ambassador James Cheek "for his statements and pressure to get  the pharmaceutical patents bill dealt with."    Galvan joins a queue of disgruntled legislators who in  recent  days have aired similar opinions.    The Cilfa [Argentine Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical  Laboratories] national pharmaceutical chamber also joined in the  fray over the transition period allowed under the GATT Treaty  and accused Cheek of "avoiding the extensive debate required"  for this controversial issue.    "It is obvious that Ambassador Cheek has decided to have a  say in domestic policy decisions, encouraged no doubt by the  government's complacent attitude to previous incursions of this  nature," Galvan said.    Meanwhile the Senator Jose Genoud who presides over the  Industry Commission in the Upper House, which is currently  debating the bill, also had something to say on Cheek's  attitude, commenting that "the U.S. is now scaremongering."    Deputy Alberto Natale (DP [expansion unknown]) even went as  far as tabling a motion to get Cheek declared persona non grata.    Cilfa Executive Director Pablo Challu also said that he was  "surprised that the press release issued by the U.S. embassy has  discovered a new classification system whereby Argentina is now  intermediately developed," a classification which would deny  Argentina the ten-year transition period stipulated in the GATT  Treaty.'    "This classification is nonexistent for GATT which  classifies  countries as underdeveloped, developing and developed, while the  ten-year transition period is applicable to the first two  categories, Argentina clearly belonging to the second one,"  Challu said.    He also criticized the statement in the press release which  said that Argentina was not entitled to the ten-year transition  period because it already had a patent system for manufacturing  processes.    Challu said it was not true as the ten-year proviso is  applicable to those countries that don't have a product  patenting system and therefore Argentina is fully covered by the  GATT Treaty.</p>

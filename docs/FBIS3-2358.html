When a natural disaster strikes, they can get a premium from  disaster insurance.    In the nine counties and cities around Hangzhou, the  provincial capital, a cooperative disaster-relieving insurance  now covers more than 70 percent of the farm households.    To work out a social security system in rural China is a new  issue which the country is exploring in the process of  developing a market economy.    Such insurance also helps put an end to the traditional  practice of farmers having more children in order to guarantee a  secure old age, one of the causes of China's huge population.</p>

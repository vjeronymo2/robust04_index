			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (3): Reconstruction is a priority - The banking system CLEARING the Polish banks of the bad loans andnon-performing debts inherited from the old communist system and building up a modern banking system is high on the list of Polish priorities. Somewhere between 20 and 40 per cent of the assets of the commercial banking system are believed to be non-performing and confidence will remain low until balance sheets are reconstructed and banks re-capitalised. The first signs of change came in 1988 when the decisionwas taken to hive off nine 'commercial' banks from the Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP), the central bank, and encourage them to compete for corporate and individual custom. That decision left the NBP, now headed by Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, to concentrate on strengthening its central banking role. Ms Waltz, an academic specialising in banking law, was chosen by President Lech Walesa, and eventually approved by parliament in March after an initial rejection, largely because he thought she was the right person to put an end to a series of banking scandals, such as last year's ART-B affair. This involved the raising of large loans on the basis of fraudulent credit guarantees. The affair, which revealed grave weaknesses in the bank supervisory system, led to the removal and subsequent arrest on charges of negligence of the then central bank chairman, Mr Grzegorz Wojtowicz. The NBP is now entrusted with the usual central bank functions. It licenses new banks, supervises the system and maintains monetary and credit control through its refinancing facility and through minimum reserve requirements and credit ceilings. The most difficult task is building up the commercial banking system around the core formed by the nine commercial banks which formerly acted as the provincial branches of the central bank. Two of them, Bank Slaski in Katowice and the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy in Poznan, are to be privatised this year. The World Bank is concentrating the bulk of the Dollars 200m set aside for developing Poland's financial institutions on improving the efficiency and skills of these core banks. An important role is also played by the state-owned specialist banks, especially Bank Handlowy which still handles the greatest share of Poland's trade financing, and the PKO SA which has in the past been the repository of Poles' private hard currency savings. This sector also contains the PKO BP bank which traditionally attracted the bulk of domestic savings but is burdened with the legacy of once heavily subsidised housing loans which now threaten to engulf it. The Food Economy Bank (BGZ), which traditionally channelled loans to farmers under the simple communist banking system, is also now listing under the burden of farm debt which continues to rise while real incomes remain at 1989 levels. The BGZ also once co-ordinated hundreds of small local co-operative banks but some of these are now striking out on their own. The youngest of the state-owned specialist banks - Bank Rozwoju Exportu (BRE), set up in 1986 to finance export-related projects - is due to be privatised this year. The inherited problems of the state sector demand a huge investment in training and re-equipment. Training is being provided under a 'twinning' arrangement initiated by the International Finance Corporation and financed by the World Bank loan. Banco San Paolo from Turin, for example, is twinned with Powszechny Bank Kredytowy (PBK) in Warsaw and banks from the UK, Ireland and most other EC countries are involved in similar links. Re-equipment and bank modernisation is rapidly becoming big business for western computer and equipment makers such as ICL and for telecommunications specialists. The risks involved in running a banking system without speedy telecommunications to help clearing and other transactions were dramatically underlined by the ART-B scandal where billions of zlotys were simultaneously deposited in different banks around the country, taking advantage of slow communications. To bring Poland up to international standards Telbank, a company set up by the NBP, the Polish Banking Union and several individual banks, will link 17 cities and handle interbank transactions. It will operate alongside NBP's own wire to expedite settlements in a new clearing system. The organisation of the new commercial banking system around the nine core banks inevitably links the banking system to the fate of the state-owned industries. The divisions are geographic which means that Katowice-based Bank Slaski, for example, has most of Poland's distressed steel and coal industry on its books while the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy is saddled with the cash-strapped arms factories concentrated in the south-east. In 1990, when Poland embarked on its shock anti-inflation programme with high real interest rates, it was those companies which had been investing in modern equipment who were suddenly caught and hit hardest with a soaring debt service bill and little prospect of covering it. It was a process the banks found themselves helpless to prevent. They did not have the expertise to advise the companies or the political clout to cut credit to ailing enterprises and risk accelerating unemployment. On the contrary, at times they found themselves under pressure from sections of Poland's new Solidarity government to keep their debtors afloat. Poland's pressing budget problems have also helped to obscure the situation. Banks which sought to make reserves against bad debts were discouraged from doing so by the tax authorities as this would have lowered taxable profits. Instead unpaid interest was capitalised and presented in balance sheets as 'income accruing in future periods'. As such it was treated by the taxman as a current profit and taxed accordingly. The pressing need for tax income also acted as a powerful incentive to keep loss-making enterprises alive because allowing them to go under would eliminate them as a source of taxable 'paper' profits. This year the situation is to change. The government, supported by the World Bank, is working on a scheme to restructure bank and inter-company debts and clear corporate balance sheets to allow the chronically indebted enterprises to be identified and closed. Enterprises will be obliged to formulate a business plan and commercial banks, the Treasury, unpaid suppliers and other interested parties will sit around a table and discuss it. If all agree that the enterprise has a future the discussion will move on to discuss the modalities and details of debt reduction, restructuring and, where appropriate, access to fresh loans. If, on the other hand, the round table concludes that the enterprise is a 'basket case' the decision should be taken to close it. Appeals against the decision, it is suggested, would be decided by a separate tribunal. Loans of up to Dollars 300m from the World Bank would help finance the scheme which looks good on paper but will require steady nerves on the part of the government to implement. The first blow of the executioner's axe has yet to fall on Poland's hopeless debtors. The credibility of bank reform awaits that event.</p>
